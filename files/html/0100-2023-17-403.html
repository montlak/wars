<p class="noindent-1">For a grievant to be eligible for an award of attorney fees under the BPA, an arbitrator must award the grievant backpay upon finding under applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement that the grievant was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which resulted in the grievant's loss of pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">E.g., NAGE</span>, 52 FLRA at 1528. It is not disputed that the Arbitrator found under applicable law and regulation that the grievant was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. The only question presented is whether compensatory time off constitutes pay, allowances, or differentials within the meaning of the BPA such that the Arbitrator's award of compensatory time constitutes an award of backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Pay, allowances, and differentials" are defined as "pay, leave, and other monetary employment benefits to which an employee is entitled by statute or regulation and which are payable by the employing agency to an employee during periods of Federal employment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803.

In all three cases (including the instant case) three different arbitrators found that the agency did not violate any law, regulation, or provision of the parties' agreement but then, inexplicably, took it upon themselves to award substantial sums of money (in the earlier cases--$5,000 and $24,000) based on nothing more than those arbitrators' own sense of "industrial justice." <span class="Italic">VAMC Poplar Bluff</span>, 68 FLRA at 856 (Dissenting Opinion of Member Pizzella). I agree with the observation made by then-Member Pizzella that awards based on "equitable largesse"--are little more than "what some might call a taxpayer shakedown." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 15 and Dept. of Army, Army Sustainment Command</span>, 63 FLRA 89, 90 (2009), involving entitlement to priority consideration for a position, confirmed that counsel fees are unavailable under either 5 USC 5596 or 5 USC 7701(g) unless there is an award of back pay:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The threshold requirements for entitlement to attorney fees under the Back Pay Act are: (1) a finding that the grievant was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, which resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials; and (2) a grant of such pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3239, </span>61 FLRA 808, 809 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency only to provide the grievant priority consideration; the Arbitrator did not award backpay. As the grievant was not awarded backpay, the Arbitrator properly denied attorney fees under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 4015</span>, 52 FLRA at 84 (finding that an award of priority consideration did not support an award of attorney fees under the Back Pay Act). In this regard, we reject as unsupported the Union's assertion that it is entitled to attorney fees because it prevailed in its grievance. In this case, there is no dispute that the resolution of the grievance--the Arbitrator's original award of priority consideration--resulted in no monetary benefit to the grievant. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>Further, to the extent the Union argues that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7701(g), it is well established that an arbitrator may not award attorney fees under &#x00A7; 7701, which is incorporated into the Back Pay Act, independent of the terms of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See United States Small Bus.

<p class="noindent">When it was not established that a performance improvement period, considered by the arbitrator to have been imposed without good cause, resulted in the loss of pay, a fee award under the Back Pay Act was set aside as contrary to law, <span class="Italic">EEOC, Baltimore Field Office and AFGE Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v59/59-124.html">59 FLRA 688</a>, 694-95 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the Agency's last contention, that the award of fees for the PIP portion of the decision is contrary to the Back Pay Act, we note that under the Back Pay Act, in order for an arbitrator to authorize back pay, the arbitrator must find that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or the reduction of an employee's pay, allowances or differentials. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 916</span>, 57 FLRA 715, 717 (2002). However, in the absence of satisfying the above findings, an employee is not entitled to reasonable attorney fees. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, under the second portion of the above standard, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or the reduction of an employee's pay, allowances or differentials, the Arbitrator has failed to show, and the record does not otherwise provide, how the placement of the grievant on a PIP directly resulted in the withdrawal or the reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances or differentials.

Therefore, as the Back Pay Act is not applicable here, and the United States has not otherwise waived its sovereign immunity to be liable for attorney fees under these circumstances, this portion of the Arbitrator's award for attorney fees and costs is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency's efforts to collect employee debt, when rebuffed through grievances and arbitration, did not constitute an award of back pay under the Back Pay Act. Lacking a violation of that Act, there was no basis for an arbitrator's award of counsel fees. <span class="Italic">DODEA and FEA</span>, 70 FLRA 718, 720 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) ("In none of the cases has the Union shown that any of the grievants had lost pay to which they were legally entitled. Indeed, it is entirely possible that the audits will show that grievants owe the Agency a refund of overpayments. Given the lack of clear record evidence of net losses of pay or overseas allowances--and the fact that the Union has the burden of showing such losses--we find that the Union has not established an entitlement to attorney fees in these cases.").</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Concerning the violation of &#x00A7; 2.3.3.1, the Union argues that the Agency's failure to review the grievant's status on the do-not-arm list directly resulted in the grievant losing pay for each day that he remained on that list in excess of 180 days. However, &#x00A7; 2.3.3.1 did not require the Agency <span class="Italic">to remove</span> the grievant from the do-not-arm list after 180 days; it merely required the Agency <span class="Italic">to review</span> the grievant's status on that list and, then, take some "appropriate action." And even if the Agency had complied with that section, it could have chosen to prolong the grievant's placement on the do-not-arm list beyond 180 days by "reaffirm[ing]" his status on that list. Therefore, any connection between the violation of &#x00A7; 2.3.3.1 and the grievant losing pay from remaining on the do-not-arm list past 180 days is speculative. Accordingly, the Union has not provided any basis for finding that, as a matter of law, the Arbitrator erred in concluding that the violation did not directly result in the grievant losing pay.[13]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, N.H.</span>, 49 FLRA 1522, 1533 (1994) (where the effect of a violation is "totally speculative," the Authority will deny backpay under the Act (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of HHS, SSA, Balt.

<p class="noindent-1">The Union also asserts that the Agency's violation of Article 54 directly resulted in the grievant losing pay. As noted above, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 54 by failing to promptly initiate discipline against the grievant. But even if the Agency had done so, the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency was then obligated to immediately remove the grievant from the do-not-arm list and reassign him to his normal position. Moreover, it is unclear what effect the grievant's other misconduct had on the length of his reassignment or placement on the do-not-arm list. Because backpay is available "only where it is clear" that a causal connection exists,[18] there is no basis to find that the Arbitrator erred by concluding that the violation of Article 54 did not directly result in the grievant losing pay.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As the Union failed to establish that either of the Agency's violations directly resulted in the grievant losing pay, we find that the Arbitrator did not err by denying the grievant an award of backpay.[19] And without an award of backpay, there is no basis under the Act for an award of attorney fees.[20] Consequently, we deny the Union's contrary-to-law exceptions.</p>

<p class="noindent">An agency's violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action for purposes of a retroactive temporary promotion and back pay under the Back Pay Act sufficient to support a counsel fee petition. The Back Pay Act includes a broad category of personnel actions, including the omission or failure to take an action or confer a benefit. <span class="Italic">DHHS, HCFA, Region IV and NTEU Chap. 210</span>, 21 FLRA 910, 913 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">VA Northport VA Hosp. and AFGE Local 1843</span>, 67 FLRA 325, 326 (2014) ("A violation of a collective-bargaining agreement is an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action," citing <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA 556, 558 (2012)); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, NUSW Newport and NAGE FUSE Local R1-144</span>, 56 FLRA 477, 479 (2000) (failure to pay overtime: violation of provision of negotiated agreement constitutes unjustified or unwarranted personnel action). But if there is no back pay, there is no basis for fees. <span class="Italic">W.

<p class="noindent">If a grievance results in a stay of a disciplinary action and the grievant prevails in arbitration, there is no reduction of back pay or benefits and, therefore, no loss of back pay permitting a counsel fee award. <span class="Italic">GSA and AFGE Council 236</span>, 20 FLRA 794, 795-96 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Nat'l Council Bureau of Indian Affairs Educators and Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs</span>, 32 FLRA 707, 710 (1988) (awarding no fees when there was no award of back pay); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 24 FLRA 134, 136 (1986) (fee award can only be granted in conjunction with back pay award). The award of travel and per diem expenses did not amount to an award of back pay that permitted a union to recover counsel fees under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Austin &#x0026; Houston Dist. and NTEU Chap. 52</span>, 23 FLRA 774, 782 (1986). An arbitrator could not award fees in conjunction with a finding that the agency improperly initiated a criminal charge against the grievant or altered the grievant's status in an "Internal Reliability Program." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army Missile Range, White Sands and NFFE Local 2049</span>, 38 FLRA 258, 261-62 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA decided there was a monetary benefit supporting a fee award in <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA 556, 558-59 (2012), relating to a claim for lost annual leave to attend a union convention--a component of the "pay, allowances, or differentials" covered by that statute, involving a personnel action (denial of official time) covered by that statute:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The BPA provides, in pertinent part, that when an appropriate authority finds that an employee has been "affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the [employee's] pay, allowances, or differentials," the employee "is entitled, on correction of the personnel action, to receive...reasonable attorney fees related to the personnel action." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii). Under this plain wording, an award of attorney fees must be "related to the personnel action," <span class="Italic">id.</span>--specifically, the unjustified and unwarranted personnel action that affected the employee. In this regard, the Authority has held that, in assessing requests for fees in a fee award, an arbitrator <span id="page_2428"></span>must focus on "the agency's personnel action that was at issue in the [original] award." <span class="Italic">AFGE, SSA Gen. Comm.</span>, 48 FLRA 1055, 1058 (1993) (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of HHS, SSA</span>, 48 FLRA 1040, 1049 (1993)). Thus, in order to resolve the Agency's exceptions, it is necessary to assess whether the award of attorney fees was "related to" an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that ULPs and violations of collective-bargaining agreements are unjustified and unwarranted personnel actions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Sec. &#x0026; Exch. Comm'n</span>, 62 FLRA 432, 438 (2008) (<span class="Italic">ULP</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. DoJ, U.S. Marshals Serv.</span>, 66 FLRA 531, 535 (2012) (collective-bargaining-agreement violation). In the merits award, the Arbitrator found that the Agency committed a ULP and violated the parties' legacy agreement. <span class="Italic">See CBP</span>, 64 FLRA at 918. Thus, the Agency committed unjustified and unwarranted personnel actions, and the Union is entitled to fees that are "related to" those actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not dispute that the unjustified and unwarranted personnel actions resulted in a loss of pay, allowances, or differentials in the form of lost annual leave to attend the Union convention. Rather, the Agency claims that the award of fees must be set aside or limited because it also related to remedies that are not backpay. But nothing in the plain wording of the BPA or relevant precedent supports such a narrow interpretation. In fact, the Authority has indicated to the contrary by holding that the BPA "provides that fees are paid when 'related to the personnel action,' and does not limit attorney fees to proceedings for pay, allowances, or differentials." <span class="Italic">U.S. DoD, DoD Dependents Sch.</span>, 54 FLRA 773, 789 (1998) (<span class="Italic">DoDDS</span>). Consistent with this principle, the courts and the Authority have found that fees may be incurred for time spent litigating issues other than the entitlement to backpay itself. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3882 v. FLRA</span>, 994 F.2d 20, 21-24 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (<span class="Italic">Local 3882</span>) (fees recoverable for time spent litigating <span class="Italic">entitlement </span>to fees); <span class="Italic">Ala. Ass'n of Civilian Technicians</span>, 56 FLRA 231, 233-34 (2000) (Chairman Wasserman dissenting) (same); <span class="Italic">DoDDS</span>, 54 FLRA at 789-90 (fees recoverable for collecting <span class="Italic">interest </span>on backpay); <span class="Italic">U.S. DoD Dependents Sch.</span>, 54 FLRA 514, 520 (1998) (same). In this regard, the Authority previously has indicated that fees may be warranted for time spent litigating entitlement to non-monetary remedies, as long as those non-monetary remedies are linked to an award of backpay correcting an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr., Indian Head Div., Indian Head, Md.</span>, 56 FLRA 848, 853-54 (2000) (remanding fee award because record was insufficient to determine whether award related to prior awards that corrected unjustified and unwarranted personnel actions by awarding backpay). Further, in <span class="Italic">Local 3882</span>, the court found that connecting the amount of fees that was due to the underlying personnel action--there, a ULP--was consistent with the legislative purposes of the BPA, which include: (1) making "reasonably financially whole" those employees who have been subjected to unjustified personnel actions that resulted in reductions of their pay; and (2) "facilitat[ing] suits to enforce federal labor policy." 994 F.2d at 23. This authority supports rejecting the Agency's proffered, narrow interpretation of the BPA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Arbitrator found that "[t]he Union's case depended upon the issue of successorship[,]" and "[i]n order for the Union to prevail on <span class="Italic">any </span>issue"--i.e., including its claim regarding official time for the Union convention--"its representatives had to prove its core claims regarding successorship." The Agency does not claim that these findings are based on nonfacts or deficient on any other basis. And these findings further support a conclusion that the fees that the Union incurred should not be parsed in the manner that the Agency suggests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Agency has provided no basis for finding that the Arbitrator erred by awarding attorney fees that were incurred in connection with litigating the unjustified and unwarranted personnel actions--i.e., the ULP and contract violations. Accordingly, we deny the Agency's exception alleging that the awarded fees are not "related to the personnel action" within the meaning of the BPA. As the award of leave restoration for attendance at the Union convention provides the requisite award of backpay, it is unnecessary to resolve the Agency's claim that the restoration of leave for training and lobbying was not an award of backpay. With regard to the Agency's claim that the Arbitrator failed to provide an articulated decision as to how the fees relate to an award of pay, allowances, or differentials, the Arbitrator articulated how the fees related to an award of pay, allowances, or differentials in the form of restored leave for time spent at the Union convention. Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award that did not clearly involve an award of back pay as a predicate to a grant of counsel fees was remanded to the arbitrator for clarification, <span class="Italic">DOD Educ. Activity and FEA</span>, 57 FLRA 23, 24-25 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The threshold requirement for entitlement to attorney fees under the Back Pay Act is a finding that the grievant was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, that resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr., Newport, R.I.</span>, 56 FLRA 477, 478 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy</span>). Once such a finding is made, the Back Pay Act further requires that an award of fees must be: (1) in conjunction with an award of backpay to the grievant on correction of the personnel action; (2) reasonable and related to the personnel action; and (3) in accordance with the standards established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g), which pertains to attorney fee awards by the Merit Systems Protection Board. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The standards established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g) are: (1) the employee must be the prevailing party; (2) the award of fees must be warranted in the interest of justice; (3) the amount of the fees must be reasonable; and (4) the fees must have been incurred by the employee. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator's award resolving a request for attorney fees must set forth specific findings supporting determinations on each pertinent statutory requirement. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Phila. Serv. Ctr., Phila., Pa.</span>, 53 FLRA 1697, 1699 (1998). When an arbitration award does not sufficiently explain the arbitrator's determination of a pertinent statutory requirement, we will examine the record to see if it permits the Authority to resolve the matter. <span class="Italic">See Alabama ACT</span>, 56 FLRA 231, 234 (2000) (then Chairman Wasserman dissenting in part as to other matters) (<span class="Italic">ACT</span>). If it does not, we will remand the award for further proceedings to assure that the resolution of the request for attorney fees is consistent with law. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that a violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Health and Human Serv.</span>, 54 FLRA 1210, 1220 (1998). Here, the Arbitrator expressly found that the Agency was in "clear violation of the...collective bargaining [agreement]." Therefore, the Agency's assertion that the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency committed an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action is without merit, and the first requirement of the Back Pay Act is satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is not clear from either of the Arbitrator's awards whether the unjustified and unwarranted personnel action found by the Arbitrator resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of any of employees' pay, allowances or differentials. In this regard, while the Arbitrator stated in the initial award that "the impact of the new regulations is ongoing for many bargaining unit members," the Arbitrator did not find that any of those bargaining unit members lost pay, allowances, or differentials. Moreover, although the Arbitrator found that the "delivering of the new regulations [was] defective," he did not find that this defect caused any employees to lose pay, allowances, or differentials. The Arbitrator simply held the new regulation "for naught," over the Union's request "that retroactive LQA with interest be granted."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator stated in the supplemental award that his initial award "reflected that...the [MOU was] the basis for receiving an award of backpay." However, in his initial award, the Arbitrator included no reference to backpay. Indeed, the Authority specifically held, in reviewing the initial award, that the award "did not direct the Agency to take any specific action...[but that] implementation consistent with its holding is not impossible." <span class="Italic">DoDDS</span>, 55 FLRA at 1112. Consequently, the Union's assertion that backpay is included in the initial award is unsupported. In the supplemental award, the Arbitrator further stated that "[w]ages can be in the form of an allowance which is what has occurred in this particular matter," and "the dependents who were involved as a result of [his initial] decision...receive[d] an order for funds for quarters and other benefits." However, neither the award in particular nor the record in general establishes that employees in fact were denied allowances. Finally, in response to the Agency's argument that backpay has not been awarded, the Union claims only that certain unit employees "should...be granted" allowances, not that any employees, or dependents, have been granted allowances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we conclude that the supplemental award is unclear as to whether any employees lost pay as a result of the unjustified and unwarranted personnel action found by the Arbitrator. We further conclude that the record does not provide a basis for the Authority to resolve the issue. Accordingly, we will remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to determine whether any employees lost pay, allowances, or differentials as a result of the unjustified and unwarranted personnel action found in the initial award.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award directing issuance of a performance award to a grievant was an award of back pay and was sufficient to support a fee award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 48 FLRA 1040, 1045-46 (1993); <span class="Italic">see VAMC and AFGE Local 789</span>, 72 FLRA 677 (2022) (counsel fee award was justified when the merits award, based on contract requirements governing mid-term progress review and rating process, resulted in an increase in the level of the rating and a resulting monetary performance award). But an award directing a higher rating, resulting in a cash performance award, did not support a fee award under the Back Pay Act when the award was not determined by the arbitrator to be required under statute, regulation, or the provisions of a collective-bargaining agreement, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapter 67 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS Ogden</span>, 68 FLRA 868, 869 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2429"></span>The Union argues that the fee award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator erred when she determined that the grievant's cash performance award does not constitute pay, allowances, or differentials under the Act. When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by an exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.[14] In applying a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> standard of review, the Authority assesses whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law.[15] In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings.[16]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The threshold requirement for entitlement to attorney fees under the Act is a finding that the grievant was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials.[17] Under the Authority's case law, performance awards do not constitute "pay, allowances, or differentials" unless they are required by statute, regulation, or the provisions of a collective-bargaining agreement.[18] But where "performance awards required by a collective-bargaining agreement...are improperly withheld from bargaining[-]unit employees[, they] constitute 'pay, allowances, or differentials,' within the meaning of the Act, and the agency's failure to pay them as required by the agreement constitutes the 'withdrawal or reduction' of those benefits."[19]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[19]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 55 FLRA at 1276 n.9 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union fails to demonstrate that the grievant's cash performance award constitutes "pay, allowances, or differentials" under the Act. The Union does not claim that the grievant's cash performance award is required by statute or regulation. Moreover, to the extent that the Union argues that the performance award is required by the parties' agreement, the Union does not identify or include with its exceptions any agreement provision addressing the subject. In addition, although the Arbitrator found in the second merits award that "[t]o get the...performance-based cash bonus,...[the grievant] would have been required to obtain a performance appraisal of 3.4 or greater," citing a contract provision, the Arbitrator did not find that the provision "entitled" the grievant to an award. And the provision that the Arbitrator cites is not set forth in any award, or elsewhere in the case's record, including the Union's exceptions. Further, although the Arbitrator found that cash performance awards are discretionary with the Agency, the Union does not challenge that finding as failing to draw its essence from the parties' agreement. In short, there is no basis in this case's record for determining that the grievant's cash performance award constitutes "pay allowances, or differentials" under the Act, and we deny the Union's contrary-to-law exception on this issue. Because the Union's remaining contrary-to-law and nonfact exceptions assume that the Union has satisfied the basic requirements for an entitlement to attorney fees under the Act, and because we find that the Union has not done so, we further find that it is not necessary to address the Union's remaining contrary-to-law and nonfact exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of interest paid in conjunction with a prior agency settlement of a back pay claim supported counsel fees, <span class="Italic">DODDS and FEA</span>, 54 FLRA 514, 518-20 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's position--that fees may only be awarded where interest is included in a particular "award" or decision that also grants pay, allowances or differentials--ignores the basic structure and plain wording of this aspect of the Back Pay Act. Interest is automatically paid "with" the reimbursement of pay, allowances or differentials. That is, interest is an inseparable element of any payment of withdrawn or reduced pay under the Back Pay Act. As the Arbitrator explained this principle, an award of backpay "is a condition precedent to the payment of interest" and "the payment of interest affirms a finding" that backpay is warranted. Attorney fees are paid because there has been a finding of entitlement under the Back Pay Act, and the award of interest confirms that such a finding has been made. This wording of the Back Pay Act, that back pay is computed "with interest," confirms the common sense observation that an award of interest is necessarily tied to an underlying award of back pay, on which the interest has been computed. 5 U.S.C. 5596(b)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency's position ignores an element of the Back Pay Act discussed above: an "award" of back pay may be made by any appropriate authority, including an agency official. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803. There is no requirement in our precedent or the Back Pay Act that an award of back pay be in the same proceeding as the proceeding that determines entitlement to attorney fees. Rather, as long as employees have, in fact, been determined to be entitled to an award of back pay under the Back Pay Act, that this award was made in advance of the proceeding at issue has no bearing on a party's entitlement to the other remedies provided for in the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our decision here is consistent with the holding of the United States Claims Court that it has jurisdiction to award attorney fees where the underlying back pay dispute was settled administratively.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. United States</span>, 28 Fed. Cl. 195, 200 (1993), the court found:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Interest is only due in those circumstances in which the employee had been...paid wages retroactively upon the necessary finding of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. While the obligation to pay attorney fees is not automatic,...the interest and attorney fee provisions of the [Back Pay Act] presume that there has been an award of back pay, which, in turn, presumes proper appointment to a position. It would be difficult to imagine what more Congress would have to say to waive sovereign immunity in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">That interest may be awarded under the Act in a proceeding that does not also award back pay is confirmed by Comptroller General decisions that have approved the payment of interest on administratively settled claims, as long as the other requirements of the Back Pay Act are met. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Matter of: Payment of Interest Under the Back Pay Act</span>, B-242277 (Sept. 12, 1991) (employee entitled to interest on amounts erroneously withheld from employee's pay); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Matter of: Interest on Late Payments of Mandatory Employee Incentive Awards</span>, 70 Comp. Gen. 711 (Sept. 25, 1991) (agency may agree in a collective bargaining agreement to pay interest on late payment of incentive pay).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, our decision is supported by the terms of the attorney fees provision of the Back Pay Act, which do not limit attorney fees to proceedings for pay, allowances or differentials. Rather, fees are paid when "related to the personnel action." 5 U.S.C. 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii). Consistent with this provision, attorney fees are routinely awarded for time spent litigating entitlement to attorney fees. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3882 v. FLRA</span>, 994 F.2d 20 (D.C. 1993) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3882</span>). In <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3882</span>, the court reasoned that such fees "are clearly 'related' to the underlying action, for such fees are often necessary to fulfill the purposes of the statutory scheme on which the action is based." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 22. The court noted that one such purpose of statutory attorney fee provisions is to "make a litigant whole when she is wronged under a statute." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Certainly, attorney time spent collecting interest is at least as "related to the personnel action" as time spent collecting the attorney's fee. Fees for collecting interest are, further, equally necessary to make the employee whole. Thus, these fees are authorized by the terms and policy of the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DODDS and FEA</span>, 54 FLRA 773, 781-83 &#x0026; n.3 (1998), noted that there is no requirement that an award of back pay be in the same proceeding that determines entitlement to attorney fees. An agency may not collaterally attack the prior arbitration award (granting back pay) through exceptions to a second award (granting fees). If the merits award states that the arbitrator will retain jurisdiction if the parties cannot agree to the payment of fees, there has been no order to pay fees and an exception to a fee award will be denied. <span class="Italic">DOD, DLA, Texarkana and NAGE Local R14-52</span>, 56 FLRA 62, 68 (2000) (implication that exceptions will lie when and if fee award is made); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Pope Air Force Base, and AFGE Local 1770</span> (<span class="Italic">Union</span>) 71 FLRA 338, 339 (2019) (Member DuBester concurring) (when the merits award was final, exceptions to a fee award could not be used to challenge the merits award); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr. and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 57 FLRA 417, 420-21 (2001) (fees were supported by award that did not direct specific payment but that would lead to recovery of back pay); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Indian Head Div. and AFGE Local 1923</span>, <span class="blue">56 FLRA 848</span>, 853 (2000) (award of fees had to be connected to award of compensation under Back Pay Act; assuming connection, award of fees could be based on award of back pay issued in previous award).</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator could not award fees under 5 USC 7701(g) independent of the terms of the Back Pay Act, even in cases involving prohibited personnel practices. If in a promotion grievance the remedy was a rerun of the promotion, and if there was no restoration of pay, allowances, or differentials, the fee award was not in conjunction with an award of back pay and would be set aside because it did not conform to the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Army Aviation Sys. Command and NFFE Local 405</span>, 22 FLRA 379, 380-81 (1986) (not specifying the alleged prohibited personnel practices).

<p class="noindent-1">Where the threshold requirement for an award of attorney fees is met, the Back Pay Act provides that fees are to be awarded "in accordance with standards established under section 7701(g) of [title 5.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii); <span class="Italic">see AFGE, Local 1547</span>, 58 FLRA 241, 242 (2002). The standards for an award of attorney fees under &#x00A7; 7701(g) include, among other things, that the employee must be the "prevailing party." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1); <span class="Italic">see NAGE, Local R4-6</span>, 55 FLRA 1298, 1300-01 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that it was "unquestionab[le]" that the grievant did not suffer a loss of pay or leave as a result of serving three-day suspension that was later rescinded. The Union's arguments that there was a loss in pay because the suspension was intended to be without pay, and that an actual loss of pay is not relevant where there is an underlying finding of entitlement to back pay, are not persuasive. In this regard, as set forth above, the grievant must have suffered an <span class="Italic">actual</span> loss of pay. <span class="Italic">Warner Robins AFB</span>, 56 FLRA at 543. Neither party disputes that the grievant did not in fact lose pay as a result of the suspension. Moreover, given the Arbitrator's factual finding--to which we defer--that the grievant did not suffer a loss of pay or leave, there is no basis for finding that the suspension resulted in a "withdrawal or reduction" of pay within the meaning of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 186</span>, 55 FLRA 59, 61 (1999). As the grievant did not suffer an actual loss of pay, the award of attorney fees is not consistent with the requirements of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">United States SBA</span>, 55 FLRA at 181; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 4015</span>, 52 FLRA at 84; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2419</span>, 50 FLRA at 130; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 216</span>, 42 FLRA at 320-21.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even if there is a finding of discrimination, there may be no statutory award of counsel fees without an award of back pay, the result when the grievant was not recommended for promotion but there was no entitlement to back pay because the vacancy was canceled for a legitimate reason. The civil rights laws did not provide an independent basis for fees in <span class="Italic">Nat'l Union of Labor Investigators and Dept. of Labor, Office of Labor Mgmt. Standards</span>, 46 FLRA 1311, 1313-15 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we reject the Union's argument that fees may be awarded in this case without regard to the requirements of the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2), which provides for awards of attorney fees in cases involving prohibited discrimination, expressly refers to the standards for awards of fees set forth in section 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Section 7701, by its terms, provides authorization for awards of fees only to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in connection with proceedings before it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Coast Guard</span>, 28 MSPR 539 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Brown</span>). In this regard, other "appropriate authorities," including arbitrators, are authorized to award attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803. However, appropriate authorities other than the MSPB are not authorized to do so directly under section 7701. Instead, section 7701 applies to these authorities only through application of the Back Pay Act, which provides that, in addition to other requirements, attorney fees must be awarded "in accordance with standards established under section 7701(g)...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii). As such, and as no authority to the contrary has been supplied by the Union or is apparent to us, we conclude that the Arbitrator was not authorized to award fees solely under section 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Missile Range, White Sands, New Mexico and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 2049</span>, 38 FLRA 258, 261 (1990) (<span class="Italic">White Sands</span>) (an arbitrator is not authorized to award attorney fees solely under the terms of section 7701(g), independent of the terms of the Back Pay Act); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.807(e) ("[w]hen a determination by an appropriate authority that an employee has been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the withdrawal, reduction, or denial of all of [sic] part of the pay, allowances, and differentials otherwise due the employee is based on a finding of discrimination...the payment of attorney fees shall be in accordance with the standards prescribed under section 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964[.]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A threshold requirement for an award of attorney fees under the Back Pay Act is a finding that the grievant was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Chicago Region and National Treasury Employees Union Chapter 242</span>, 45 FLRA 437 (1992). The Back Pay Act further provides, among other things, that an award of attorney fees must be in conjunction with an award of backpay to the grievant on correction of the personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency had discriminated against the grievant. However, the Arbitrator also concluded that, as the grievant would not have been promoted even if the Agency had not discriminated against him, the Agency's discriminatory action did not cause the grievant to suffer a reduction in pay, allowances or differentials. Absent such finding, attorney fees may not be awarded under the Back Pay Act. As discussed previously, the Back Pay Act applies in this case. Accordingly, the award is not deficient in denying the Union's request for attorney fees....</p>
<p class="noindent">Note that in cases that would not otherwise be appealable to the MSPB, i.e., cases other than adverse actions and performance-based actions, a finding of discrimination should support a counsel fee award for a prevailing employee under statutory authority in the various civil rights laws independent of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 42 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e-16(d), 2000e-5(k). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-415.html#sec9-413">Civil Rights Cases; Title VII</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">The award of fees is not necessarily an all or nothing proposition. "[N]either 5 USC 7701(g) nor the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> [<span class="Italic">v. USPS</span>, 2 MSPR 420 (1980)] criteria (discussed <span class="Italic">post</span>) preclude an arbitrator from granting part of a request for attorney fees based on a determination that only part of the fees are warranted under the applicable legal requirements." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo and FEMTC</span>, 49 FLRA 820, 823 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">The parties may settle their fee dispute. Should they resolve matters but the fee litigation continues, the arbitrator is to apply MSPB law to determine whether the settlement should foreclose any further claim for fees, <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 49 FLRA 858, 864-65 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When exceptions are filed to arbitration awards resolving requests for attorney fees under the Back Pay Act, the Authority's role is to ensure that the arbitrator has complied with applicable statutory standards....&#8197;When the exceptions concern the standards established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g), the Authority applies the decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the issue before the Arbitrator concerned whether the Union's attorney was entitled to additional fees beyond those specified in the settlement agreement of March 25, 1991. In cases similar to this, the MSPB, the Federal Circuit, and another court of appeals have recognized that parties to a dispute for which attorney fees may be awarded can agree as to the appropriate amount of such fees. In such cases, the party requesting fees can effectively waive its claims to attorney fees beyond the amount agreed upon. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Paderick v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 54 MSPR 456 (1992), citing <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560-61 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">Greco</span>) and <span class="Italic">Wakefield v. Matthews</span>, 852 F.2d 482 (9th Cir. 1988). In <span class="Italic">Greco</span>, the court found, based on the language in a settlement agreement covering attorney fees, that the agreement was applicable to all aspects of the underlying case, including compliance. With respect to the argument that the settlement agreement should not be interpreted to extend to future proceedings arising from the case, the court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">While it may be true that the parties could not have foreseen the protracted compliance proceeding which developed, it is clear that the parties' intent was to end their dispute. Final resolution of the case could only be achieved upon petitioner's restoration, as far as practicable, to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. In our view it would be unreasonable to read the agreement in a manner so narrow as to defeat the intent of the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 561.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator interpreted the parties' settlement agreement and concluded, based on the plain language of the agreement, that the parties intended for the Union's attorney to receive $25,000 to cover all attorney fees in connection with <span class="Italic">SSA</span>. The Arbitrator further concluded that the work for which additional attorney fees were claimed was work performed in connection with <span class="Italic">SSA</span>. Consequently, we find that the Arbitrator was enforcing the provisions of a settlement agreement on attorney fees in a manner that was consistent with the procedures used by MSPB and Federal courts in the above cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">Counsel fees are routinely awarded for time spent litigating entitlement to fees under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Alabama ACT and DOD, Alabama NG</span>, 56 FLRA 231, 233 (2000).</p>
