<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-80"><span class="space">b.</span> Duty of Judge to Inform an Appellant of Governing Law; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Pro Se</span></span> Appellant; Liberal Construction of Pleadings</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Many individuals litigate Board cases without counsel. Board law has its complexities. Throughout the <span class="Italic">Guide</span>--written in response to those complexities--emphasis is placed on the responsibility of AJs to inform the parties of controlling law and to ensure they understand the issues the Board will resolve--a process that often occurs during the prehearing conference. AJs are expected to provide some guidance, particularly to unrepresented appellants, during the hearing process, while maintaining a position of neutrality.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"The Board has consistently required administrative judges to inform apprise an appellant of the applicable burdens of going forward with the evidence and of proving a particular affirmative defense, as well as the kind of evidence the appellant is required to produce to meet his burden." <span class="Italic">Carlisle v. DOD</span>, 93 MSPR 280, 285 &#x00B6; 11 (2003) (involving a disability discrimination defense to a removal). The AJ has a special responsibility toward the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant. The AJ is not to stand by while the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant is pulverized by zealous agency counsel. Nor should the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant be permitted to commit litigation errors that could readily be avoided. The <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> states, at Chapter 2, section 7 that "[T]he AJ may allow greater latitude to the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant in questioning witnesses and in giving testimony. The AJ may allow some leading questions, and may need to instruct the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant regarding the correct method of questioning."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ's responsibility to prevent the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant from falling into evidentiary traps was discussed in a pointed decision of the Federal Circuit. One of the issues in the appeal involved the weight that should have been given to statements offered by the appellant. Some were sworn; others were not, <span class="Italic">Bryant v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3377):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her decision, the administrative judge gave more weight to certain sworn statements than to Bryant's unsworn statements....&#8197;This, however, reveals the AJ's lack of appreciation that Bryant was a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigant. The AJ had the power pursuant to 5 CFR 1201.63 (1987) to request that Bryant resubmit his statements under oath, and should have done so. In our view, AJs should adopt a posture of assisting <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigants whenever possible to ensure a just resolution of the merits, and to avoid having these litigants shut out by the operation of technical rules of which they are unaware. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DHHS</span>, (No. 87-3381, slip op. at 3, Fed. Cir. Dec. 7, 1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">O'Keefe v. USPS</span>, 318 F.3d 1310, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the court raised, but did not decide, whether the AJ should have informed the appellant that his statements would have been of greater evidentiary weight had they been sworn. On remand the Board decided that the AJ should have told the appellant that statements in his closing argument were not of much evidentiary value and that the appellant should provide sworn testimony of the matters that he spoke of during closing argument but did not earlier testify about, <span class="Italic">O'Keefe v. USPS</span>, 95 MSPR 248, 250-51 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, the Board has held that an administrative judge has a particular <span id="Page_1378"></span>obligation to inform a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant of what is required to establish a case where the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant has the burden of proof, including the burden of proof to establish Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Kaiser v. Department of the Army,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. 440, 446 (1997); <span class="Italic">Harless v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 110, 113 (1996). The Board has held further that, to ensure fairness in circumstances where an appellant has the burden of proof, an administrative judge should advise a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant, prior to the close of record, that he has not provided the evidence to prove his claim. <span class="Italic">Goodnight v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 184, 188 (1991). The Board has found that the obligation of an administrative judge to advise a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant of what is required to establish his case, and whether he has provided the evidence necessary to establish his claim, derives in part from the provision of the Board's regulations requiring administrative judges to use the authority necessary to ensure that the record is fully developed and to see that there is a fair and just adjudication of the appeal<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 187; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41 (b)(5).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, although the appellant was <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, the administrative judge had no particular obligation to inform him of what evidence was required to establish his case in rebuttal to the agency's case as the agency had the burden of proof to establish its charges by preponderant evidence. However, the record fails to show that the administrative judge met her broader obligation under &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(5) to ensure that the record was fully developed. Nothing in the record indicates that the administrative judge explained to the parties that developing the record at the hearing required that testimony come from a witness who was placed under oath by the administrative judge during the course of the proceeding and that either party's unsworn statements during the course of the hearing were not subject to the penalties of perjury. The appellant gave a lengthy closing argument in which he alleged facts that had not been included in the testimony of the hearing witnesses. The administrative judge, however, failed to inform the appellant that these assertions were not evidence and that, for these assertions to be given the same weight as sworn testimony during the administrative judge's deliberations, she would have to swear in the appellant as a witness<span class="Italic">. Id.; see Dunn v. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 426, 435 (1994) (statements made by a party in closing argument do not constitute evidence), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 91 F.3d 169 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). Under these particular circumstances, we find that the appellant should be offered an opportunity to testify under oath.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burgess v. MSPB</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (discussing obligation of AJ to inform appellant of what is required to establish jurisdictional issue: "The order was misleading, incomplete, and latently ambiguous. It failed to tell Burgess that a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness was required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue, and that the production of factual evidence would be necessary to show that the board had jurisdiction and should grant a hearing.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board affirmed the responsibility its AJs bear toward <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants in <span class="Italic">Goodnight v. OPM</span>, 49 MSPR 184, 187-89 (1991), a retirement appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court held in <span class="Italic">Burgess v. MSPB</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643, 644 (Fed. Cir. 1985), that before a presiding official can dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the presiding official's order with regard to the issue must be reasonably calculated to apprise an appellant of what is required to obtain a hearing. Similarly, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Denny v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 123 (1990), that where an appellant has the burden of establishing the Board's jurisdiction the acknowledgment order must be reasonably calculated to apprise an appellant of what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue. The Board also held in <span class="Italic">Bibby v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 30 MSPR 507 (1986), that an administrative judge cannot dismiss an appeal without giving the appellant notice as to how to respond. Although no question of jurisdiction is at issue in this appeal, the appellant is nonetheless in a similar position because the burden of proof rests on her. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Marbrey v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 45 MSPR 72, 75 (1990) (whether the appellant bears the burden of proof in an appeal is a factor in determining the appropriate procedure to be applied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the Board's regulations require administrative judges to use the authority necessary to insure that the record is fully developed and to see that there is a fair and just adjudication of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.41(b)(10) and (12). We note, however, that although the Board has held that a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant may not escape the consequences of inadequate representation, <span class="Italic">Murdock v. GPO</span>, 38 MSPR 297 (1988), a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant is not required to plead the issues with the precision of an attorney in a judicial proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Roche v. USPS</span>, 828 F.2d 1555, 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Thus, we find that in retirement appeals that will be decided without a hearing, administrative judges should exercise those authorities to this end and inform appellants at the status conference of their burden of proof and of the kind of evidence they need to provide the Board for the adjudication of their appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. U.S. Marine Corps</span>, 3 MSPB 411, 3 MSPR 328, 330 (1980) (where the initial decision is issued without a hearing, the administrative judge should, in the interest of justice, monitor the submissions closely and request additional evidence when appropriate).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the issue is whether the administrative judge reasonably informed the appellant of the kind of evidence necessary to prove her allegations. The administrative judge sent an acknowledgment order to the appellant, who was <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, which simply informed her that she had the burden to prove both jurisdiction and her entitlement to civil service annuity benefits. This order, however, did not inform the appellant of the type of information or evidence necessary for her to prove her case. The administrative judge then held a telephonic status conference at which he reminded the parties that since the appellant did not request a hearing, the appeal would be decided on the record and that the record would close in two weeks. The parties stated in this teleconference that they did not wish to make any additional submissions before the record closed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge knew at the time of the teleconference call that: the appellant had not submitted any evidence to support her claims; OPM had not addressed the appellant's allegations; and neither party intended to provide further submissions. Yet, the administrative judge did not discuss the issues, the burden of proof, or the kind of evidence that would be relevant for the appellant to submit to prove her allegations. Rather, he issued an initial decision finding that the appellant failed on the proof issue and informing her of what she should have submitted to win her case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that to ensure fairness, the administrative judge should have advised the appellant prior to the close of the record that she had not provided the evidence to prove her claim. The administrative judge also should have clearly informed the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant of the type of relevant evidence necessary to prove her claim. Thus, we hold that he erred by issuing an initial decision finding that the appellant failed to offer any proof of her contentions when he failed before the record closed to inform her of her burden of proof and the kinds of evidence she needed to submit to the Board for the adjudication of her appeal. It is therefore, necessary to remand this appeal for adjudication on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge shall inform the appellant's representative prior to the close of the record what type of evidence is necessary to prove the appellant's allegations regarding the pay differential. The administrative judge shall provide the parties the opportunity to submit evidence and argument regarding this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCURRING OPINION OF CHAIRMAN DANIEL R. LEVINSON.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although I concur with the majority's decision, I write to stress that the administrative judge's obligation to advise appellants of the kinds of evidence needed to prove a case is not unlimited.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Administrative judges are not surrogate lawyers for one side or the other, and we should not make them such. To ensure fairness, administrative judges should advise <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants of their obligation to prove the facts underlying their claim. Administrative judges should also suggest, in general terms, the kinds of evidence the appellant should muster. However, an administrative judge's failure to foresee specific kinds of evidence that might be relied upon should not be considered reversible error in all cases. The key is whether the administrative judge has brought home to the appellant what he must prove and given him general guidance on how to do so. Because this test was not met here, I join my colleagues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Harless v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 110, 113 (1996), an overpayment recovery case, added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Regardless of whether the appellant could have inferred from OPM's discovery request or other sources that he should support his claim of financial hardship with additional evidence, the Board and its administrative judges have an obligation to inform the parties what is required to establish their cases. This obligation is particularly significant where, as here, the appellant is appearing <span class="Italic">pro se</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hill v. OPM</span>, 91 MSPR 566, 570 &#x00B6; 11 (2002), a retirement case depending on analysis of medical evidence, required the AJ to explain to the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant, before the hearing, that the appellant's evidence was insufficient and to instruct the appellant "further about the type of specificity of the evidence needed to meet her burden of proof." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Speaker v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 13 MSPR 163, 166 (1982) (AJ could raise the adequacy of a competitive level when the appellant was <span class="Italic">pro se</span> and unlikely to artfully formulate the argument); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Coast Guard</span>, 11 MSPR 461, 462 (1982) ("The record reflects that the presiding official noted appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, and made every effort to explain the terminology used at the hearing. Appellant was thereby able to make an opening statement, cross-examine witnesses, introduce documents into evidence, offer rebuttal testimony, and make a closing argument. In addition, the presiding official questioned the appellant under oath in an effort to elicit testimony concerning the voluntariness of his resignation."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. GSA</span>, 2 MSPR 47, 49 (1980) ("[A]lthough the appellant's presentation may have lacked some legal niceties, it was given full consideration by the presiding official.").</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1379"></span>We note that, although the appellant does not complain on review of a lack of notice regarding his USERRA burden and methods of proof, the administrative judge failed to sufficiently inform the parties of their burdens of proof or the different methods of proving a USERRA claim. When an appellant raises a USERRA claim or affirmative defense, an administrative judge must inform him of the burden of proving his claim or defense, the burden of going forward with the evidence, and the type of evidence necessary. <span class="Italic">Noble v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 693, &#x00B6; 13 (2003); <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 381, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 14. Where an administrative judge fails to inform the parties of their burden and methods of proof, the Board has typically remanded the appeal so the administrative judge could afford such notice and an opportunity to submit evidence and argument under the proper standard. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Hillman v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 7 (2003); <span class="Italic">Bloomer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 324, &#x00B6; 6 (2001). A case should be remanded, however, only where the record indicates that the appellant's presentation of his case was harmed by the administrative judge's error or omission, or there is a serious question of whether the case was harmed. <span class="Italic">See Nichols v. Department of the Interior</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 386, 388-89 (1996) (an appeal need not be remanded to address a jurisdictional issue where an agency motion to dismiss provides the appellant with notice that was lacking in the acknowledgment order).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Sherman v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-09-0327-B-1 (NP 11/20/2013) ("However, in the initial decision the administrative judge fully and accurately apprised the appellant of the elements of proof with respect to his harmful error claim, and the appellant failed to provide any additional evidence or argument regarding this affirmative defense on review. Rather, the appellant essentially reiterated his arguments from below.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At times the Federal Circuit notes that the AJ is not the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's lawyer. The Federal Circuit prosaically said of one appellant: "If she operates in the MSPB's kitchen, she should learn not only to stand the heat, but also to read the cookbook." <span class="Italic">Ihrcke v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 88-3182). But the same court can be critical of the tendency of the Board and some AJs to permit cases to drag out without telling the appellant what is necessary to make out a case. Consider <span class="Italic">Cuajunco v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1991 NP No. 91-3212). As to determinations that the appellant did not demonstrate sufficient creditable service and that the appeal was not timely filed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For a petitioner such as Cuajunco to go through two proceedings before the OPM, followed by two at the MSPB, without getting any understandable and reasonable guidance as to what evidence or proof he is expected to submit at that or the next stage, wastes everyone's time, energy and expense. The mere propagation of such misunderstandings, so easily recognized and corrected, if not prevented, by the agency involved, could only serve to frustrate the intent of Congress in providing for the underlying benefit or process at issue. The system must be meant to help people identify and acquire that to which they are rightfully entitled, rather than to continually put roadblocks in their way, regardless of their actual entitlement.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the appellant has been represented on appeal by her father, but that he has stressed repeatedly that he is not a lawyer, is acting mostly as scribe for his daughter and because she is unable to represent herself, and that neither of them can afford to hire an attorney. Thus, the appellant has basically been acting <span class="Italic">pro se</span> in these proceedings. The Board affords such appellants considerably more leeway, by not requiring that they plead issues with the precision of an attorney, but instead reading their pleadings liberally<span class="Italic">.
