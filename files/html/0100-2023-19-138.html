<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-134"><span class="space">B.</span> SPECIAL PANEL</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">By statute, a dispute between the EEOC and MSPB may be resolved through a Special Panel. 5 CFR 1201.172 (2022) describes the organization and composition of a panel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;A Special Panel is composed of:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A Chairman, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, whose term is six (6) years;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;One member of the Board, designated by the Chairman of the Board each time a Panel is convened;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;One member of the Commission, designated by the Chairman of the Commission each time a Panel is convened.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Designation of Special Panel members</span>--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time of designation</span>. Within 5 days of certification of a case to a Special Panel, the Chairman of Board and the Chairman of the Commission each will designate one member from his or her agency to serve on the Special Panel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Manner of designation</span>. Letters designating the Panel members will be served on the Chairman of the Panel and on the parties to the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the law developed in <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 471, 476 (Spec. Pan. 1986), and in <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 31 MSPR 519, 525 (Spec. Pan. 1986) [discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-19-058.html#sec12-55"><span class="Italic">Prima Facie</span> Case; Accommodation Requirements</a>"], the MSPB may issue a decision disagreeing with EEOC and certify the case to the Special Panel only if it concludes that EEOC has misinterpreted or misapplied civil service law. It may not disagree with EEOC on the application of discrimination law. The Board is without authority to "force" review of EEOC decisions based on discrimination law. <span class="Italic">Nuanez v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 32 MSPR 144, 147 (1987). The Board added to its authority to review decisions of the EEOC in <span class="Italic">Goad v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 393, 395 (1989), holding, <span class="Italic">in dictum</span>, that the Board may induce Special Panel review if the EEOC decision depends on civil service law for its support; or is "so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Esparza v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 517, 519-520 (1987). If an EEOC determination is based on interpretation of a regulation that is a civil service regulation, the Special Panel will defer to MSPB's interpretation of the regulation if the Board's interpretation is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Shoemaker v. Dept. of Army</span>, 34 MSPR 597, 603 (Spec. Pan. 1987) (in a dispute concerning a performance-based removal and a disability discrimination defense, on the question of whether an Army regulation required the agency to hold the removal in abeyance pending the disposition of a disability retirement application, the Special Panel held: "The EEOC's reliance on its interpretation of an Army civil service regulation must give way to the expertise of the MSPB."). In <span class="Italic">King v. Lynch</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1994110521f3d10841918">21 F.3d 1084</a> (Fed. Cir. 1994), the Federal Circuit determined that the discrimination laws considered in the course of MSPB adjudications are not "civil service laws."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The procedures and composition of the rarely-convened Special Panel are set out at 5 USC 7702(d). According to the implementing Board regulations, at 5 CFR 1201.171-.174 (2022), Panel operation is to conform to the following regulatory and statutory guidelines. A Chairman is appointed by the President, with the consent of the Senate, and has a six-year term. One member of the Panel is designated from the Board by the Chairman of the MSPB each time a panel is convened. One member of the EEOC is similarly designated. Designations of the two agency panel members are made within five days from certification of a case to the Panel. The Panel is to issue its decision, according to the regulations, within 45 days from certification. The Board provides the panel with a copy of the record as well as with administrative support. Submissions from the parties are filed with the Panel through the MSPB Clerk, mail filings to be accomplished by "overnight Express Mail" (an unwelcome diversion of funds, no doubt, for the discharged and unemployed federal worker). Parties are expected to submit written arguments or briefs to the Panel within 15 days from the Board's certification. Responsive pleadings are not ordinarily permitted. The parties have the right to oral argument (a significant and welcome departure from Board practice). The Panel Chairman determines the time and place of argument. The Panel Chairman has the authority to decide procedural issues and to waive regulations in the interest of expedition of the case. The Board is responsible for ordering the employing agency to take any action appropriate to carry out the Panel decision. Board regulations governing enforcement of final Board orders apply.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The requirements for certification of a case to the Special Panel were summarized, <span class="Italic">Maiorana v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 665, 669 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 471, 476 (Spec. Pan. 1986), the Special Panel outlined the following four prerequisite steps necessary for the establishment of its jurisdiction. First, the Board must have decided an issue of discrimination law. Second, EEOC must have decided that the Board's interpretation of discrimination law was in error and reversed the Board's decision. Third, the Board must review EEOC's decision and reach the conclusion that EEOC's decision reversing the Board's decision is in error because it has misinterpreted civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directive. Finally, the Board may then certify the case to the Special Panel for a resolution of the matter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not appear to consider past Special Panel decisions as binding precedent, <span class="Italic">Davenport v. Dept. of Navy,</span> PH-0752-14-0104-I-2 (NP 2/19/2015), at n.4:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Previous Special Panel decisions are not controlling in our present deliberations. <span class="Italic">See Boots v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 513, 518 (Spec. Pan. 2005) (viewing <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 471 (Spec. Pan. 1986) only as "guiding precedent").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The first Special Panel decision, <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 471, 476-83 (Spec. Pan. 1986), established the substantive principles governing Special Panel review:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For a matter to have reached the Special Panel for resolution, the following steps must have occurred. First, the MSPB must have decided an issue of discrimination law in its initial decision. Second, the EEOC must have decided that the MSPB's decision was in error as to its interpretation of discrimination law, and reversed the MSPB decision. Third, the MSPB must have reviewed the EEOC decision, and reached the conclusion that the EEOC decision reversing the MSPB was in error because the EEOC had misinterpreted a provision of civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directive. Finally, upon reaching that conclusion, the MSPB must certify the matter to the Special Panel for a resolution of the matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Panel's jurisdiction over this matter is set out in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702, which establishes only one jurisdictional prerequisite, <span class="Italic">i.e</span>., that the MSPB certify the matter to the Panel pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(1). Two possible grounds exist for certification. The MSPB may find as a matter of law either that the EEOC decision constitutes an incorrect interpretation of a provision of civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directive, or that its decision concerning such provision is unsupported by the evidence in the record. In this case the MSPB's certification rests on the first ground.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next requirement, that the MSPB certify the matter to the Panel pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(1), means simply that certification must follow a finding by the MSPB that one or more of the above grounds for certification exists. The statute plainly provides for certification whenever "the Board takes <span class="Italic">any action</span> under subsection (c)(2)." (Emphasis added.) Once a subsection (c)(2) finding is made, certification is automatic, leaving the Panel with no choice but to accept jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the relevant legislative history supports the view that jurisdiction is automatically conferred by the fact of certification, leaving the Panel with the responsibility of resolving the issues in dispute. For example, the Senate described the Panel's role as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the Board concludes against adopting the proposed Commission order, it means there still exists an unresolved dispute on a question of law between the two agencies.... Where such a dispute persists after the repeated procedures available to both agencies to resolve their differences at an earlier stage, the Committee felt that the matter was of sufficient importance, and the legal issues well enough drawn, that the [Panel] should consider the matter and resolve the differences.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 59 (1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The jurisdictional requirement has been met in this case. In its "Opinion and Certification Order," the MSPB found the EEOC to have "misinterpreted applicable civil service law, regulation and policy directives" in reaching its decision. <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. United States Postal Service</span>, Docket No. SF07528110438, EEOC Petition No. 03840005, at 4, January 31, 1985, (hereinafter referred to as Certification Order). The matter was simultaneously certified to this panel.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;At oral argument, counsel for appellant suggested that the Special Panel decline jurisdiction if we find that EEOC's decision was not based on an incorrect interpretation of civil service law. This is something we are neither required nor empowered to do. The decision to certify a natter to the Panel rests with the MSPB, and is dependent on its findings, without regard to the validity of the MSPB's findings. 5 U.S.C. 17702 (c) (2). The Panel is granted no authority to decline or grant jurisdiction based on the propriety of the MSPB's certification. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2)(A). Furthermore, a declination of jurisdiction by the Panel could have) the result of leaving the MSPB and the EEOC decisions in conflict, and not resolving their differences for the benefit of the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A decision whether the EEOC correctly or incorrectly interpreted civil service law is properly a function of the Panel's duty to issue a final decision on the merits pursuant to &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2). We find, therefore, that the requirements of &#x00A7; 7702 are satisfied here, and that the Panel has jurisdiction to proceed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Panel's scope of review is described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2) as deciding the issues in dispute. The Special Panel in deciding these issues is required to give due deference to the respective expertise of the MSPB and EEOC. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2)(B). Conspicuously absent is any reference to a recognized standard of review, such as "arbitrary and capricious" or "unsupported by substantial evidence." Faced with the lack of statutory and regulatory guidance, the Panel must decide what is meant by the terms "issues in dispute" and "due deference" in the above context. Although neither of these concepts is clearly defined in the statute, reasonable conclusions as to their meaning can be drawn by reference to legislative history and analogous appellate schemes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">"Issues in dispute."</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we discussed in Section II of this Decision, a matter must be certified to the Panel by the MSPB whenever the MSPB finds as a matter of law that an EEOC decision referred back to it under the &#x00A7; 7702 system of "mixed case" resolution either (1) "constitutes an incorrect interpretation of any <span id="Page_3564"></span>civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directive"; or (2) with respect to "such provision is not supported by the evidence in the record as a whole." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(c). In this case, we are concerned only with the former category, which constituted the MSPB's rationale for certifying the matter now before us. In either case, however, the Panel's consideration of the issues in dispute is narrowly circumscribed by the language of the statute to one of whether the EEOC decision misapplies in some manner civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of &#x00A7; 7702(d) supports this construction, shedding light on Congress' rationale for creating the Special Panel. The House and Senate versions of the procedures for handling discrimination cases were quite different in the early developmental stages of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978). The House preferred that all cases involving discrimination be heard by the EEOC, unless the EEOC in its discretion transferred jurisdiction to the MSPB. In the latter instance, an appeal of the MSPB decision to the EEOC was guaranteed, and the EEOC's decision would be final. There would be no certification to another body for the purpose of resolving disputes between the MSPB and the EEOC as to the proper outcome of such "mixed cases."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Senate provided a different option, stating in its report of the bill that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the current instance, however, the EEOC would be overruling the MSPB on day-to-day matters that are central to its mission. Further, in assigning to the EEOC authority to define the boundaries between title VII violations and the principles of the Merit System, the plan gives to the EEOC a virtually unlimited mandate to determine jurisdiction on a wide variety of appeals. <span class="Italic">The MSPB would be left in an inferior position to defend merit system principles.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 750, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1978) (emphasis added). To ensure that the EEOC would not have the unreviewable power to dictate the meaning of civil service law, the Senate proposed in S.2640 the method of "mixed case" dispute resolution before the Special Panel that is now &#x00A7; 7702(d). The Senate Report, referring to the potential usurpation of the MSPB's role in defining civil service law, and citing the passage quoted above, explained that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The procedures adopted by the committee resolve these problems. The chief purpose of the committee amendment is to make sure that neither the Merit Systems Protection Board, nor the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, will be able to overrule the other. Instead, the powers of the Board and the Commission are carefully balanced one against the other. The committee felt that it was absolutely essential to the success of the overall civil service reform effort that there be this creative balance between the authority of the Board and the Commission because of the unique nature of the issues involved. In addition, the procedures are designed to protect against inconsistent decisions by the Board and Commission, to prevent forum shopping, and to make the procedures for consideration of the same matter by both agencies as streamlined as possible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 969, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 52-53. The Conference Report also indicates that the final bill maintains this principle of parity. S. Con. Rep. No. 1272, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 139.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress' intent to narrowly confine the MSPB to certification of issues involving incorrect interpretations of civil service law is manifest in a comparison of &#x00A7; 7702(c) and (d) to the process by which the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) obtains review of MSPB decisions. The Director of OPM may obtain judicial review of final MSPB actions which constitute incorrect interpretations of and would have a substantial impact on civil service law. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(d). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has strictly construed this provision, granting petitions for review only when it finds that civil service law has in fact been incorrectly interpreted and that the incorrect interpretation will have a substantial impact. <span class="Italic">See Devine v. Levin</span>, 739 F.2d 1567 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Devine v. Sutermeister</span>, 733 F.2d 892 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Significantly, the language of &#x00A7; 7703(d) has not been interpreted to permit review of MSPB decisions which simply affect the operation of the civil service but do not constitute incorrect interpretations of civil service law itself. In like manner, we conclude that &#x00A7; 7702(c)(2)(A) should be construed with deference to its plain meaning to require that the MSPB only certify matters to the Panel when the EEOC decision constitutes an incorrect interpretation of civil service law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The balance struck by &#x00A7; 7702 is really quite simple. The EEOC review is to ensure that the MSPB refrains from basing its decisions on incorrect interpretations of discrimination law. The MSPB certification to the Special Panel, on the other hand, ensures that the EEOC may not err by misinterpreting civil service law. The Panel will review the record, according due deference to the expertise of each agency to determine whether the substance of the EEOC's decision with which the MSPB disagrees was actually predicated on a misinterpretation of civil service law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">"Due deference."</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Panel is charged to "give due deference to the respective expertise of the Board and the Commission in making its decision." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2)(B). The meaning of this provision is somewhat more problematic, as the concept of due deference is not clearly explained in either the statute or the legislative history. We are not, however, completely without guidance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following excerpt from the Senate Report on the Civil Service Reform Act explains that we are to give greater weight to the EEOC than the MSPB regarding interpretations of discrimination law, and greater weight to the MSPB than the EEOC where an interpretation of civil service law is involved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">9.&#x2003;Upon appeal, the [Panel] should review the entire record. (Subsection (i)(5)). It must decide the proper interpretation of the applicable statute and related law. It must decide whether the Board's application of the law to the evidence in the case was in fact reasonable, or whether the Commission was correct in concluding that the Board's conclusion in such matters was unsupportable as a matter of law. In applying the law, the [Panel] should pay due deference to the respective expertise of each agency. For example, the Commission's interpretation of the meaning of policy directives issued by it under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, or other anti-discrimination statutes is entitled to appropriate weight, just as is the Board's interpretation of the civil service laws under title V of the U.S. Code. In deciding, however, how to resolve any conflicting goals or standards caused by applying both the personnel rules and principles, and the anti-discrimination rules and principles to the same cause, the [Panel] will have to reach a decision on its own, without prejudicing the matter by according greater presumptive weight to how one agency or the other would resolve the conflicts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 969, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 60. This passage fails to define what degree of deference is "due," or what weight is "appropriate." It simply states that matters of statutory interpretation are subjects of agency expertise deserving deference of some degree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One analogy that is useful in determining the meaning of "due deference" is that of the Supreme Court when faced with a conflict between federal courts of appeals, between a federal and state court, or between a federal appellate court and a federal administrative tribunal. <span class="Italic">See</span> Sup. Ct. R., Rule 17; <span class="Italic">Automobile Salesman's Union v. NLRB</span>, 711 F.2d 383 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The Supreme Court is free to reach its own decision in accordance with what it determines to be the correct statement of relevant law. However, it has chosen to defer in varying degrees to statutory interpretations, conclusions of law, and findings of fact reached in proceedings below. The Supreme Court defers to the highest court of a state for interpretations of that state's law when those interpretations are found to rest upon an adequate state ground. <span class="Italic">Hortonville Joint School Dist. No. 1 v. Hortonville Ed. Ass'n</span>., 426 U.S. 482 (1976) <span class="Italic">on remand</span>, 274 N.W. 2d 697 (Wis. 1979); <span class="Italic">Hemmenstein v. Superior Court of California</span>, 340 U.S. 622 (1951).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another helpful illustration of this type of deference is seen in the review by both the Supreme Court and federal appellate courts of the decisions of administrative tribunals such as the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The NLRB's interpretations of the National Labor Relations Act will usually be upheld even if the reviewing court might prefer a different interpretation. The NLRB's expertise in a matter is only ignored where its interpretation (a) has no reasonable basis in law; (b) is fundamentally inconsistent with the structure of the National Labor Relations Act; or (c) moves into a new area of regulation which Congress has not committed to it. <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Company v. NLRB</span>, 441 U.S. 488 (1979); <span class="Italic">Automobile Salesman's Union, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although no instruction requires that the Special Panel follow this model, it does provide a useful analytical framework for deciding the extent to which the Panel is bound by the statutory interpretations posited by the MSPB and the EEOC. The third test set out above in <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co</span>. would be particularly appropriate where either agency is arguably guilty of usurping the other's statutory territory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Panel's standards of review of disputes between the EEOC and the MSPB in cases referred to it pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(c)(2)(A) are as follows:[10]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The Panel will overrule the MSPB and defer to the EEOC where (a) the EEOC decision does not constitute an incorrect interpretation of a provision of civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directives, and (b) the EEOC's decision that MSPB's interpretation of discrimination law was incorrect has a reasonable basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The Panel will defer to the MSPB leaving the MSPB's decision undisturbed (a) where the EEOC decision as found by the MSPB incorrectly interpreted a provision of civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directive and (b) the EEOC's conclusion in its decision that MSPB's interpretation of discrimination law was incorrect lacks a reasonable basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3565"></span>(3)&#x2003;The Panel will reach a decision addressing the merits of the case only where: (a) the decision of the MSPB that the EEOC decision incorrectly applied a provision of civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directive is correct, <span class="Italic">and</span> (b) the decision of the EEOC that the MSPB, in its initial decision, incorrectly interpreted and applied discrimination law is correct, thus leaving the merits of the case to be correctly decided under civil service and discrimination law by the Special Panel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;It is emphasized that the standards of review enunciated above deal specifically with natters certified pursuant to &#x00A7; 7702(c)(2)(A). We refrain from deciding a standard for the review for cases certified under &#x00A7; 7702(c)(2)(B), as this provision is not before us.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Special Panel's scope of review is described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2).

<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth in <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> and its progeny, the Special Panel's obligation to defer to each agency's expertise will result in one of three possible outcomes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;The Panel will overrule the MSPB and defer to the EEOC where: (a) the EEOC decision does not constitute an incorrect interpretation of a provision of civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directives; and (b) the EEOC's decision that the MSPB's interpretation of discrimination law was incorrect has a reasonable basis.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent, citing only dissenting opinions from previous Special Panel decisions and raising for the first time an issue that was not argued by either party before the Special Panel, argues that the "analytical framework adopted by the majority in <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> does not comport with the plain language of the statute and fails to give proper effect to the Special Panel's statutory duty to decide the issue in dispute."

The dissent's argument ignores the fact that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2)(b) requires the Special Panel to give "due deference" to the EEOC's interpretation of discrimination law. The dissent's argument also disregards the failure of the Board's certification order to set forth a specific argument as to how the Commission's decision is incompatible with basic principles of civil service law. Thus, the Special Panel has no grounds to address the merits of the underlying decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite repeated protestations that the Board is not to create conflicts with EEOC for the purpose of obtaining Special Panel review, the Board has done so. Consider <span class="Italic">Wilburn v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 623, 623, 625-27 (1989). The appellant was removed for allegedly assaulting another employee after the other employee used a racially derogatory epithet toward the appellant. The appellant alleged that the agency's decision to remove him was discriminatory because the agency imposed only a 10-day suspension on the other employee involved in the altercation. The Board rejected the disparate treatment claim but mitigated the removal to a 60-day suspension. The appellant sought EEOC review, and the Commission found that the Board erred in concluding that the disparate nature of the penalties was not racial discrimination. The appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination and the agency's articulation of a legitimate reason for the disparity was a pretext to mask the agency's underlying motive. EEOC referred the appeal back to the Board. Upon referral, the Board sought to recast the case in a civil service rather than EEO mold:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the EEOC's decision that the two participants in the altercation should have been given the same penalty rests on its interpretation of several agency policy statements: A...memorandum entitled "Threats and Assaults"; a...memorandum entitled "Disciplinary Action for Fighting"; and [a] ...bulletin entitled "Assaults and Threats." Thus, it is clear that the EEOC's determination that the appellant was discriminated against because he was removed rather than suspended for 10 days does not turn on general principles of discrimination law, but on its own interpretation of the agency's internal policies.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We note the EEOC did refer to one of its own regulations in its decision. However, it treated the regulation as an afterthought, and its conclusion that the agency failed to follow the regulation in this case hinges on its prior determination that the agency violated its own policies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These are civil service matters. The policy statements warn employees that assaults and threats are considered serious, will not be tolerated, and will result in discipline. Thus, the policy statements relate to adverse actions taken against employees under the civil service law set forth in 5 USC Chapter 75. Cases involving appeals from such actions under Title 5 and interpreting agency policy statements on these matters comprise a significant portion of the Board's case law....&#8197;Thus, the Board, not the EEOC, is the expert in this area....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the internal agency policies in question involve a matter of "civil service law" within the meaning of 5 USC 7702(c)(2), the Board has a legitimate basis for disagreeing with the EEOC under the provisions of that statute....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From its reading of the agency's policies, the EEOC drew the dubious conclusion that the two employees were similarly situated under agency policy with regard to the seriousness of their offenses. It also faulted the agency for failing to show why the acts of provocation should have been treated differently from a physical assault under agency policy, and found that the agency ignored its own policy not only with respect to penalties for the two offenses but also with respect to the use of mitigation in such a situation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In this case, even if the other employee provoked the appellant, his misconduct was less serious than the appellant's physical assault on him.[2] Therefore, the administrative judge correctly considered that the other participant was not similarly situated to the appellant in finding that the appellant's discrimination allegation was without merit....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;There is no proof that the other employee intended to provoke or offend the appellant. We express no opinion as to whether the penalties should be equal when intent to provoke or offend is shown.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wilburn</span> was certified to the Special Panel, but the Panel dismissed the case for lack of prosecution: during the six years of litigation that ensued after the adverse action against the appellant, he failed to keep everyone informed of his address. An extraordinary result, considering that once the battle was undertaken between EEOC and MSPB, Wilburn had no further prosecutorial responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Wilburn v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 609, 615 (Spec. Pan. 1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lynch v. Bennett</span>, 665 F. Supp. 62 (D.D.C. 1987), clarified the jurisdiction of the Board, EEOC, and the Special Panel in mixed case adjudications. Mr. Lynch, an attorney who had been employed by the Department of Education, sought reinstatement to his job, complaining that charges concerning poor performance were meritless and alleging that he had been discriminated against on the basis of his disability, epilepsy, after the agency failed to offer him reasonable accommodation. According to the court's analysis, Lynch appealed his removal to MSPB, whose AJ sustained the removal in 1982. Although there was an implicit finding by the Board that appellant's work was satisfactory, the dismissal was affirmed on the basis that appellant was AWOL for two hours on one occasion and exhibited a pattern of failure to submit work <span id="Page_3566"></span>on time. The AJ rejected allegations of disability discrimination and procedural error. Lynch took his case to EEOC immediately after the initial decision of the MSPB AJ became final. In 1984, that agency ruled that the MSPB AJ erred in applying the definition of a qualified disabled employee. EEOC referred the case back to MSPB to determine if Lynch was a qualified disabled employee under the correct definition of the term and, if so, whether the employer had reasonably accommodated his disability. In 1986, MSPB responded by reversing its AJ's decision that Lynch's work had been satisfactory. MSPB also ruled that Lynch was not a qualified disabled employee because he could not perform the essential functions of his job with reasonable accommodation. MSPB sustained the removal. Believing that its latest decision conflicted with the EEOC ruling, MSPB sent the case on to the Special Panel. The Panel sustained the second MSPB ruling. Mr. Lynch pursued the case in court, suing the employer, the EEOC, the MSPB, and the Panel, and alleging that the MSPB and Panel acted outside their jurisdiction by their latest rulings on the case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the authorities of the various administrative tribunals, the district court determined in <span class="Italic">Lynch</span>, 665 F. Supp. at 65-66:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the MSPB undertook to apply the correct definition of a qualified handicapped employee, it overstepped the bounds of its statutory mandate, plaintiff argues, by reopening [the MSPB decision of August 2, 1982, (<span class="Italic">MSPB I</span>)] after three years in order to reverse the official's finding that the agency had failed to prove that plaintiff's work was unsatisfactory. On reconsideration following an EEOC decision, the MSPB has three options, pursuant to 7702(c): it may adopt the EEOC decision; revise the decision if the EEOC incorrectly interpreted <span class="Italic">civil service</span> law, or revise the decision if the EEOC ruling on an issue of civil service law was not supported by substantial evidence. The "error of civil service law" cited by the MSPB was the EEOC's reliance on the decision in <span class="Italic">MSPB I</span> that the government had failed to prove that plaintiff's work was unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In enacting CSRA, Congress plainly intended that in certain cases the MSPB and EEOC would have overlapping jurisdiction, that the EEOC should have the final word on issues of employment discrimination, and the MSPB on issues of civil service law. Had the EEOC made factual findings incorrectly applying civil service law, it is beyond dispute that the MSPB would have been fully within its power to make a contrary finding. In this case, however, the only "error of civil service law" allegedly committed by the EEOC was to rely on the MSPB's final decision on an issue of civil service law. The MSPB attempted to reverse <span class="Italic">its own</span> prior decision on an issue of civil service law, and, accordingly, acted outside the scope of its authority under 7702(c)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Agency regulations permit the MSPB to reopen a presiding official's decision "at any time," 5 CFR 1201.117, but such a decision must be made within a "reasonable" time. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dawson v. MSPB</span>, 712 F.2d 264 (7th Cir. 1983). The Court is aware of no case that supports the proposition that the MSPB may reopen a prior final decision years after it was issued, and <span class="Italic">after the completion of EEOC review</span>. CSRA permits an employee to obtain EEOC review of a final MSPB decision, but the decision Mr. Lynch attempted to have reviewed by the EEOC turned out three years later not to have been final. Accordingly, the Court concludes, as did the dissenting member of the Board, that the MSPB's decision to reopen <span class="Italic">MSPB I</span> was untimely and outside the scope of its authority under 7702(c)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the MSPB reconsiders a case following EEOC review, it is authorized to refer that case to the Special Panel only if it finds that the EEOC incorrectly interpreted <span class="Italic">civil service</span> law. 5 USC 7703(d)(1). The Special Panel itself found that there was no such conflict in this case, the true conflict existing only between the two MSPB decisions. Nonetheless, the Special Panel decided that it was required to render a decision, and it adopted the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">MSPB II</span>. In so doing, the Panel deferred to the conclusions of the Board, finding from the record only that the Board's conclusions were "reasonable." Because the Special Panel deferred to conclusions that the Board had no authority to make,...its opinion must also be vacated.[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The Court need not decide, therefore, whether the Panel has jurisdiction to render an opinion on the merits of a case certified to it after it finds that certification was improper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Court finds that the opinion of Special Panel No. 2 and <span class="Italic">MSPB II</span> must be vacated, proceedings must resume at the MSPB, at the point at which the EEOC referred the dispute back to the Board. Applying the Rehabilitation Act and its implementing regulations as defined by the EEOC to the final factual findings made by the presiding official in <span class="Italic">MSPB I</span>, the MSPB should determine whether Mr. Lynch was a qualified handicapped employee, and, if so, whether the agency met its burden to accommodate his handicap.</p>

EEOC determined that the agency was not bound by those regulations and decided that the agency should have conducted an individualized assessment of the appellant to ascertain whether he posed a direct threat that could not be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Boots</span> was decided by the Special Panel in 2005. The decision sided with the EEOC's interpretation of the law.

<p class="Block-Quote1">This Special Panel proceeding is mandated by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(1). That provision requires the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) to certify a matter to the Special Panel when it finds a decision by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) constitutes an "incorrect interpretation of any provision of any civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directive" under section 7702(c)(2)(A).[1] In this instance, the Board found that the EEOC based its decision on an incorrect interpretation of civil service law "governing the legal effect of the agency's adoption of [Department of Transportation] DOT regulations."[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The Board may also refer the matter to the Special Panel when it finds that the EEOC decision involving any such civil service provision "is not supported by the evidence in the record as a whole." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(c)(2)(B).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;"The Panel's jurisdiction over this matter...establishes only one jurisdictional prerequisite, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that the Board certify the matter to the Panel pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(1)." <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. at 476-77.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As required by statute,[4] the Special Panel is to decide the "issues in dispute" and deliver a final decision.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;This standard of requiring EEOC "dispositive reliance" on civil service law before the Special Panel reaches the "merits" of an issue in dispute was vigorously contested by Chairman Ellingwood in his dissenting opinion in <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>. Chairman Ellingwood maintained that in so holding the majority in <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> thereby insulated the EEOC from review by a "fiat" unsupported by the Special Panel enabling legislation. Also, that the majority imposed merely a standard of "reasonableness" on the EEOC while requiring the Board to be "correct." <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. at 488-91.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board and EEOC decisions differ in their holdings on how certain DOT regulations apply to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS or agency). Those DOT regulations prescribe medical qualifications for certain commercial drivers in the private sector, and under applicable EEOC regulations, have the effect of permitting private sector employers to disqualify individuals with specified documented medical conditions from employment without an individualized assessment as to whether the individual poses a "direct threat" in the workplace. However, by their terms, the DOT regulations do not apply to federal agencies or the USPS. This controversy ensued because the USPS believed that it could voluntarily adopt the DOT regulations by including them in position descriptions and qualification standards for its commercial vehicle drivers and thereby rely upon them as a defense to a claim of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC found it legally significant that the USPS voluntarily adopted the DOT regulations instead of being required by statute to apply them. Accordingly, the EEOC found that, if the USPS relies upon those regulations to overcome a claim of disability discrimination in the removal of one of its employees, it must satisfy a more exacting test than <span id="Page_3567"></span>if it had been subject to the DOT regulations[6] and that the USPS did not meet that test. Moreover, the EEOC maintains that its application of the appropriate law and regulations was correct, notwithstanding some contrary court decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Thus, the EEOC distinguished the Supreme Court's ruling in <span class="Italic">Albertson's, Inc. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concluded that the USPS was entitled to adopt the DOT standards and once it had done so, it was required to comply with them--thereby making the standards binding on the USPS in the same way they would apply to a non-government employer. The Board found that by adopting the DOT standards, the USPS had implicated civil service law and that the EEOC had misinterpreted that civil service law in arriving at its position that the USPS was not required to comply with the DOT standards.[7]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The task for this Panel is to make a decision on whose position should prevail while giving "due deference" to the respective expertise of the Board and the EEOC. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">II. BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This controversy began with the removal of the appellant, Mr. Boots, who was employed by the USPS as a Tractor-Trailer Operator, Level 7, at an agency facility in West Palm Beach, Florida. Mr. Boots began his employment with the agency in 1998. At that time, he disclosed that he had experienced a seizure episode in 1984 and that he was taking anti-seizure medication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Boots held a valid commercial driver's license at the time he was hired and throughout his employment with the USPS. He had an accident-free driving record as a commercial driver for at least ten years prior to his employment with the USPS as well as throughout his tenure with the USPS. Nonetheless, Mr. Boots was removed from his position in December 2002 after undergoing a periodic medical evaluation conducted by the agency's contract physician. The physician advised the agency that the appellant was not qualified to operate a commercial motor vehicle under DOT regulations because of his use of an anti-seizure medication.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Under the applicable DOT regulation, an "established medical history or clinical diagnosis of epilepsy or any other condition which is likely to cause loss of consciousness or any loss of ability to control a commercial motor vehicle" will disqualify a person from operating a commercial vehicle. 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 391.41(b)(8). Of particular relevance to this case is DOT's interpretive guidance, Medical Advisory Criteria for Evaluation under 49 CFR Part 391.41, that states, "the following drivers cannot be qualified:...a driver who is taking antiseizure medication."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Boots appealed his removal to the Board claiming disability discrimination. The Board's administrative judge upheld the agency removal, finding that Boots was not a "qualified individual with a disability" because he was not qualified to operate a commercial vehicle under applicable DOT regulations[9] and could not perform the essential functions of his position with or without reasonable accommodation. The Board denied his petition for review of the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Boots v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, MSPB Docket No. AT-0752-03-0286-I-1, slip op. at 6 (Initial Decision, April 29, 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Boots then petitioned the EEOC to review the Board's decision. The EEOC found that the agency had discriminated against the appellant on the basis of disability. Under these circumstances, the EEOC concluded the USPS could not rely on the "mere existence of the DOT regulations" because it had adopted them on a voluntary basis.[10] Rather, in the view of the EEOC, in that circumstance applicable discrimination law requires an individualized assessment of an employee's qualifications which the USPS had not done. In order to avail itself of the "direct threat" defense against disability discrimination, an agency must conduct an individualized assessment of the particular individual with a disability and the particular job at issue.[11] Factors relevant in determining whether an individual with a disability poses a direct threat include the nature of the risk, the severity of the potential harm, the probability that the potential harm will occur, and the imminence of the harm. Therefore, the USPS did not meet its burden of proof by showing the appellant posed a significant risk of substantial harm as required under EEOC regulations.[12] Accordingly, the EEOC disagreed with the Board's decision and referred the matter back to the Board for further consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;The essence of the EEOC's conclusion regarding the USPS' voluntary adoption of the DOT standards is that the USPS was therefore not able to avail itself of the "conflict with other Federal laws" defense. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.15(e). This defense, created by EEOC rulemaking, addresses a situation where a challenged action is required or necessitated by another federal law or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;The EEOC has held that, when a federal agency applies safety-based qualification standards that screen out an individual with a disability, it must show that the individual poses a "direct threat." <span class="Italic">See Surprenant v. Potter</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01996186, 2001 WL 885325 (July 26, 2001) (USPS voluntary application of DOT regulations), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, EEOC Request No. 05A11071, 2004 WL 321030 (Feb. 12, 2004). EEOC guidance provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">With regard to safety requirements that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities, an employer must demonstrate that the requirement, as applied to the individual, satisfies the "direct threat" standard in &#x00A7; 1630.2(r) in order to show that the requirement is job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. &#x00A7; 1630.15(b) and (c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;In this case, an individualized assessment could have been initiated by a USPS attempt to reconcile the conflicting medical views on Mr. Boots' particular condition taking into account each physician's knowledge of his condition and the facts on which the physician relied in reaching his medical conclusion. Further, the USPS could have reviewed Mr. Boot's driving history, his medical history, including whether there had been any changes in his condition, and any evidence of the effect of his medication on his actual ability to drive. In conducting such an assessment, evidence that a current employee has been qualified for the position in the past, has otherwise performed his duties in a satisfactory manner, and remains currently able to do so is highly relevant. <span class="Italic">Echazabal v. Chevron USA, Inc</span>., 336 F.3d 1023 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon reconsideration, the Board disagreed, finding that the agency was bound when it voluntarily chose to adopt the DOT regulations under the proper exercise of powers granted to it by statute. To that end, the Board noted that it is well-settled civil service law that an agency is bound by the rules and regulations it has adopted and concluded the EEOC had misinterpreted civil service law in considering the obligations that arise from an agency's voluntary adoption of regulations.[13]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Boots</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10&#8209;13. Moreover, the Board found that the Supreme Court decision <span class="Italic">Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg</span>, 527 U.S. 555 (1999), supported its position because the employer had prevailed in that case even though there was an element of "voluntariness" in the application of the DOT standard. Even though Albertson's was bound to follow DOT regulations, the Board noted that there were permissive provisions for an employer to honor waivers obtained by an employee and the employee had obtained such a waiver. Nonetheless, Albertson's did not re-hire the employee and the court found that it did not have to honor the waiver. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 17. It is unclear how the "voluntariness" issue in that case supports the Board's position. In fact, the holding seems to undercut its position. Rather than presenting an issue of voluntariness, the circumstances suggest "non-voluntariness" by the employer because Albertson's chose not to participate in the program. The Court held that even though an experimental voluntary waiver program was available, Albertson's was entitled to rely on the existence of the otherwise <span class="Italic">mandatory</span> DOT standards which did apply to it and therefore it could assert that defense to the employee's Americans with Disabilities Act claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">III. ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This Special Panel views <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> as guiding precedent.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The unambiguous position of the majority of the Board is that the EEOC's erroneous interpretation of civil service law justifying referral to this Panel is its finding that the USPS was not bound by the DOT regulations that it voluntarily adopted. Thus, the majority of the Board noted, "[W]e conclude that the EEOC's decision that the agency discriminated against the appellant on the basis of disability rests on the erroneous finding under civil service law that the agency was not bound by the DOT regulations and that we must, therefore, certify this case to the Special Panel pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(1)."[17] Apparently to underscore its reasoning, the Board went on to assert, "The agency has exercised this authority[18] to adopt the DOT regulations...that...drivers...in the private sector must follow as a matter of law."[19]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[17]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Boots</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6; 9. It is true that the EEOC distinguishes these circumstances from those involving application of DOT medical qualification standards in the private sector where those standards are mandatory. In those situations the EEOC's regulations indicate that the "conflict with other Federal laws" defense applies, rather than the "direct threat" defense, requiring an individualized assessment. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.15(b) and (e); 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. &#x00A7; 1630.15(b), (c) and (e).</p>

Despite the Board's history of deference to the EEOC's interpretation of discrimination law, the dissent would have this Special Panel reverse the EEOC's interpretation of discrimination law in this controversy for reasons beyond those offered by the majority of the Board in referring this matter to the Special Panel for consideration; namely, that the EEOC's interpretation of discrimination law is (in the dissent's view) so demonstrably incorrect that its decision should be reversed even if no civil service law was misinterpreted or even involved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for this argument to prevail, it must first be established that the application of the DOT regulations by the USPS implicates civil service law. But neither the DOT statute nor its implementing regulations are directly applicable to the Postal Service because Congress exempted government agencies from among those covered by the legislation.[20] Thus, by their very terms, the regulations at issue are not clearly "civil service" regulations because they do not apply to federal agencies or their employees.[21]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[20]&#x2003;49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 31132(1)(2)(B); 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 390.5.</p>

See, e.g.,</span> 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1001, 1003, 1005.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the issue of whether the USPS, or any agency, is bound by the regulations it adopts may be a matter of general administrative law, but it is not inherently a matter of civil service law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Caceres</span>, 440 U.S. 741, 753 (1979); <span class="Italic">Board of Curators of University of Missouri v. Horowitz</span>, 435 U.S. 78, 92 (1978); <span class="Italic">Vitarelli v. Seaton</span>, 359 U.S. 535, 547 (1959).[22]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[22]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Caceres</span>, 440 U.S. at 753 n.18, the Court noted, "Even as a matter of <span class="Italic">administrative law</span>, however, it seems clear that agencies are not required, at the risk of invalidation of their action, to follow all of their rules, even those properly classified as 'internal.'" (Emphasis added.) In <span class="Italic">Board of Curators</span>, 435 U.S. at 92, the Court observed that Supreme Court cases regarding agency compliance with rules on deportation and dismissal from employment "enunciate principles of federal <span class="Italic">administrative law.</span>" (Emphasis added.) In <span class="Italic">Vitarelli</span>, 359 U.S. at 547, Justice Frankfurter, concurring in part and dissenting in part, noted that agency compliance with procedural regulations is a "judicially evolved rule of <span class="Italic">administrative law</span>...." (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The USPS maintains that it has voluntarily adopted the DOT standard using its inherent statutory authority. Even assuming that under its organic statutes the USPS has the necessary authority and did adopt the DOT standard as its own, that premise alone does not raise an issue of civil service law for purposes of this review. Neither the standard nor its purported adoption by the USPS was challenged by the EEOC or "interpreted" in any way. The coverage of those regulations which would void the requirement of the "direct threat" analysis under 29 C.F.R. part 1630, app. &#x00A7; 1630.15(b), (c) is limited to the DOT statutory authority on which it is based and the USPS cannot extend that statutory reach to itself using its own regulatory authority.[23] <span class="Italic"> See generally Youngstown Sheet &#x0026; Tube Co. v. Sawyer</span>, 343 U.S. 579 (1952); <span class="Italic">Chrysler Corp. v. Brown</span>, 441 U.S. 281, 295 (1979). Otherwise, the USPS would be able to do something that Congress never gave the DOT itself the authority to do--apply its regulations prescriptively to a government entity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[24]&#x2003;Section 1630.15(e) of the Americans with Disabilities Act regulations provides a defense where a challenged action "is <span class="Italic">required or necessitated</span> by another Federal law or regulation, or [where] another Federal law or regulation <span class="Italic">prohibits</span> an action...required by this part." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.15(e) (emphasis added); 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. &#x00A7; 1630.15(e). The Board's opinion reasoned that once the Postal Service voluntarily chose to adopt the DOT standards, civil service law required the Postal Service to follow them. However, the USPS does not have a "conflict with other Federal laws" defense under the Rehabilitation Act in this case because compliance by USPS with the DOT regulations or Medical Advisory was neither "required" nor "necessitated" by the underlying statute or the DOT regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, notwithstanding the question of whether the application of the DOT standard implicates civil service law, rule, or regulation, we conclude that the EEOC's decision rests on discrimination law. The dispute here was over the interpretation of defenses available under the Rehabilitation Act. EEOC's decision did not involve any interpretation of a civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directive. It was based exclusively on regulations implementing Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), including 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r) (defining the term "direct threat"), section 1630.15(b) and (c) (the "business necessity" and "direct threat" defenses) and section 1630.15(e) (the "conflict with Federal laws" defense), and the Interpretive Guidance accompanying those regulations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. &#x00A7; 1630.15(b), (c) and (e). The ADA regulations and Interpretive Guidance were expressly adopted by the EEOC and issued following public notice and comment through the formal administrative rulemaking procedure pursuant to authority conferred exclusively upon the EEOC by Congress in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12116. In 1992, Congress amended section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act to incorporate all of the EEOC's ADA employment discrimination standards, thus making clear that part 1630 of the ADA regulations apply under the Rehabilitation Act as well.[24] Accordingly, the EEOC's decision is not based on an incorrect interpretation of civil service law because the EEOC solely interpreted discrimination law in its decision.[25]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[24]&#x2003;In contending what weight should not be afforded EEOC's Interpretative Guidance regarding the intersection of the business necessity and direct threat defenses, the dissent argues, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that because the EEOC amended its 2002 federal sector ADA regulations to incorporate its private sector ADA regulations, the guidance is not of sufficient longstanding duration in its application to federal employers to warrant deference. Dissent at 21. In so arguing, the dissent relies upon two EEOC federal sector decisions, <span class="Italic">Bauer v. Ashcroft</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A01605, 2003 WL 22288299 (Sept. 29, 2003), and <span class="Italic">Evans v. General Services Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01840864, 1986 WL 635816 (Feb. 18, 1986), positing that in neither case did the EEOC require the employer to conduct a direct threat analysis nor did the EEOC apply its ADA regulations at 29 C.F.R. part 1630. Dissent at 21 n.7, 22 n.8. <span class="Italic">Bauer</span> and <span class="Italic">Evans</span> are inapposite. In both cases the agency utilized an employment test to gauge if an applicant could in fact perform the essential functions of the position sought. Finding that the tests were job-related and consistent with business necessity, in both cases, the EEOC found that the complainant was not "qualified" under the Rehabilitation Act. In contrast to the instant case, neither case involved a safety-based qualification standard, and therefore the direct threat standard was not implicated. Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Bauer</span>, the EEOC's decision did apply the appropriate regulation under part 1630. <span class="Italic">Evans</span> pre-dated the EEOC's 1991 part 1630 ADA regulations. Further, when the EEOC amended its federal sector regulations in 2002 to formally cross-reference its private sector ADA regulations, the preamble to the regulations noted that the EEOC had already been applying its "direct threat" standard to federal employers citing three cases to that effect, all of which incidentally involved the United States Postal Service. 67 Fed. Reg. 35,732, 35,733 n.11 (May 21, 2002), citing <span class="Italic">Kahout v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01954900, 1997 WL 348668 (June 19, 1997); <span class="Italic">Hobbs v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01944181, 1996 WL 33170622 (Jan. 26, 1996); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. U.S. <span id="Page_3569"></span>Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05940034, 1994 WL 745390 (Sept. 16, 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[25]&#x2003;Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(c)(2)(A), the Board must find, in pertinent part, that the EEOC decision constitutes an "incorrect interpretation of any provision of any civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directive."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Panel in <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> noted that in drafting section 7702(c)(2)(A) Congressional intent was that the Board should certify matters to the Panel only when the EEOC decision constitutes an incorrect interpretation of civil service law and that the Board may not force review on the merits of EEOC decisions based on discrimination law with which it disagrees by categorizing those decisions as falling within the statute. <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. at 486.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the USPS seeks to metamorphose this controversy into a civil service matter by purporting to bind itself to the DOT safety regulations and thereby avail itself of the defenses that would accrue to those entities mandated to follow the DOT regulations.[26] No matter how vigorously this controversy is characterized as something else, it is, at bottom, an argument about how the EEOC has interpreted discrimination law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[26]&#x2003;As the Board acknowledged in its certification, the cases it relied upon, such as <span class="Italic">Vitarelli v. Seaton</span>, 359 U.S. 535, 539-40 (1959), and its progeny, for the premise that it was required to follow the standard it adopted, all deal with situations where an employee is seeking to enforce rights conferred by agency rules and regulations, but the agency is seeking to avoid its obligations under rules of its own making. In such situations, the Board and courts have ruled that an agency is required to follow the rules to which it has agreed. <span class="Italic">See also Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 663 (1985) ("If the agency violates those procedures with <span class="Italic">prejudice to the individual employee's rights</span>, any resulting agency disciplinary decision will be reversed by the Board....") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Giesler v. Department of Transportation</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 277, 280 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 686 F.2d 844 (10th Cir. 1982). Agencies will be held to comply with rules which convey rights or interests to the objecting party<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Montilla v. Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Service</span>, 926 F.2d 162, 166-67 (2nd Cir. 1991). In contrast, here the USPS seeks to use the rule it adopted as a <span class="Italic">defense</span> to a claim brought by an employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The discussion could end here since we find that there was no misinterpretation of civil service law--the basis of the certification which vested this Panel with jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the dissent now asks the Panel to revisit <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> and add an exception to its analytical framework where, notwithstanding a lack of reliance on civil service law, the EEOC's decision is "demonstrably contrary to law." Alternatively, it is contended that, even within the confines of <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, the Panel should hold that the Board can justifiably disagree with the EEOC's interpretation of discrimination law because its interpretation of discrimination law "is so unreasonable as to amount to a violation of civil service law."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the dissent and separate concurring opinion in the Board's certification decision argue that the EEOC's interpretation of discrimination law on the intersection of the "business necessity" and "direct threat" defenses insofar as it concerns the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act "has been resoundingly rejected in federal court."[27] Cited in support of this argument is a Fifth Circuit decision, <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Exxon Corp</span>., 203 F.3d 871 (2000). That decision disagrees with EEOC guidance suggesting that an individual assessment/direct threat test is implicated in every case where a safety-based qualification standard is at issue.[28] The dissent and concurring opinion also point to two other circuit court decisions and a "number of lower courts" that appear to endorse the <span class="Italic">Exxon</span> rationale that an employer's safety-related qualification standard that is applied across-the-board need not meet the ADA's direct threat standard of individualized assessment.[29]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[28]&#x2003;The Fifth Circuit decision held that the ADA (incorporated by reference into the Rehabilitation Act) at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12113(a) and (b) involves a medical qualification standard defense under subsection (a) and direct threat defense under subsection (b) that are separate and distinct. In the view of the court, Congress intended the direct threat analysis to cover problems such as contagious illnesses, mental illnesses, and disabilities applying to <span class="Italic">individual</span> workplace problems apart from the general qualification standards required for the position. <span class="Italic">Exxon</span>, 203 F.3d at 874.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[29]&#x2003;98 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23&#8209;25; Dissent at 12-13; citing <span class="Italic">Morton v. United Parcel Service, Inc</span>., 272 F.3d 1249 (9th Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Tate v. Farmland Industries, Inc</span>., 268 F.3d 989, 995-96 (10th Cir. 2001); and lower courts in <span class="Italic">Bates v. United Parcel Service, Inc., Siederbaum v. City of New York</span> and<span class="Italic"> Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Murray, Inc.</span> (citations omitted). On the issue of voluntariness, the majority Board opinion distinguishes the <span class="Italic">Morton</span> case where the court found the United Parcel Service was not entitled to rely on its adoption of the DOT regulations as a discrimination defense where it had voluntarily applied those regulations to drivers of smaller commercial vehicles that were covered by DOT regulations. In the view of the Board opinion, this case is inapposite because the regulations were voluntarily extended by United Parcel Service beyond their scope. <span class="Italic">Boots</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6; 10 n.3. But, that is exactly what the USPS is attempting to do here--extend the DOT regulations beyond the scope of governmental entities as prescribed by Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This Panel is not prepared to expand <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> based on the arguments offered in this controversy for reasons we have already discussed.[30] And, well within the confines of that precedent, we can accommodate the dissent's insistence that the Panel must determine whether or not the EEOC's interpretation of discrimination law in this controversy "is so unreasonable as to amount to a violation of civil service law."[31]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[30] The dissent's suggestion that we expand the rationale of <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> is not only unprecedented, but also an unwise expansion of Special Panel jurisdiction. Congress authorized the Board to interpret and enforce various civil service laws, and the EEOC to interpret and enforce the EEO laws, including Title I of the ADA and section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. The Special Panel mechanism, by contrast, was created by Congress to resolve the outcome in specific cases where the two agencies disagree and to ensure that neither the Board nor the EEOC intrudes on the province of the other agency as the interpreter of the laws each has been charged to enforce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[31]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. at 486.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> is instructive here in determining whether there is <span class="Italic">any reasonable basis</span> for the EEOC's decision. Here, as there, we find that although there is room for disagreement on the merits, a reasonable basis for the decision does exist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The courts may, someday, reach the type of consensus that requires the EEOC to reconsider its position on whether "direct threat" is the sole defense to the application of safety-based qualification standards that screen out individuals with disabilities.[32] While there is currently some conflict in the circuits about the EEOC's position, there is nothing so definitive that would permit this Panel to conclude that the EEOC is wrong in its interpretation of discrimination law.[33] As required by its enabling legislation, the Panel is obliged to give "due deference" to the EEOC[34] in its sphere of expertise and this Panel is constrained by that responsibility. Taking all of the foregoing into account, the Panel defers to the EEOC's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[32]&#x2003;The dissent contends that the EEOC's Interpretive Guidance to the part 1630 regulations (contained in the Appendix that was subject to public notice and comment) is not entitled to "<span class="Italic">Chevron</span>-style deference" (<span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984)), likening the Appendix to a policy statement, agency manual or enforcement guideline. Dissent at 22-23. However, the level of judicial deference given to an agency's interpretation of its own regulation is "substantial deference." <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas Jefferson University v. Shalala</span>, 512 U.S. 504, 512 (1994) ("We must give substantial deference to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations. Our task is not to decide which among several competing interpretations best serve the regulatory purpose. Rather, the agency's interpretation must be given 'controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.'") (citations omitted). There is no contention here that the EEOC has applied its regulations and guidance in an inconsistent or irrational manner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[33]&#x2003;Although the dissent cites some court decisions at odds with EEOC's interpretation of discrimination law, at least one circuit court decision arguably supports EEOC's position. <span class="Italic">Branham v. Snow</span>, 392 F.3d 896 (7th Cir. 2004) (applying "direct threat" defense to employer's exclusion of an individual with insulin-dependent diabetes from a job as a criminal investigator for safety reasons). Moreover, in a different context, the Supreme Court unanimously endorsed EEOC's "direct threat" regulation in <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Echazabal</span>, 536 U.S. 73 (2002) (according deference to portion of EEOC's regulation providing a defense where an individual with a disability poses a threat to self as well as to others and endorsing EEOC's list of factors for assessing whether a direct threat exists).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[34]&#x2003;The dissent argues that, in charging the Panel to apply "due deference" to the respective expertise of the Board and the EEOC, Congress could not have intended that the Board or the Special Panel defer to the EEOC's interpretation of discrimination law when that interpretation is unreasonable, particularly when the government cannot even seek judicial review of an EEOC or Special Panel decision. Dissent at 7. While it is true that the government cannot seek judicial review in these cases that does not mean that a purportedly erroneous EEOC interpretation of law will never be <span id="Page_3570"></span>redressed. There may be a point at which the EEOC's interpretation could be found to lack a "reasonable basis" but we simply disagree with the dissent that this stage has been reached already. As <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> and the dissent's own citation to <span class="Italic">Fulman v. United States,</span> 434 U.S. 528 (1978), instruct, whether the EEOC's interpretation is the <span class="Italic">most reasonable</span> or the <span class="Italic">only reasonable</span> interpretation is irrelevant, since we need only find that the EEOC's interpretation is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. at 486; <span class="Italic">Fulman</span>, 434 U.S. at 536.</p>
