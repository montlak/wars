<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-27"><span class="space">8.</span> Law Enforcement Officer Retirement Credit Appeal</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Federal law enforcement personnel may, depending on their duties and the agency's intent in establishing their positions, have the right to early law enforcement officer (LEO) retirement benefits. [This subject is explored in Chapter 14, "<a href="0100-2023-21-133.html#sec14-132">Law Enforcement Retirement</a>."] To obtain LEO retirement credit for a position not designated for that status by the agency head, the employee must request the agency to make a determination of whether the employee's position is covered by the early retirement statutes. That determination can then be appealed to the Board in advance of the employee's expected retirement date. 5 CFR 842.807(b) (2022) (FERS); 5 CFR 831.901 (2022) (CSRS). To secure the right of appeal, the employee must act within the time limits set by 5 CFR 842.804(c) (2022) (FERS) and 5 CFR 831.906 (2022) (CSRS). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blade v. OPM</span>, 97 MSPR 92, 94-95 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-9 (2004) (considering the process available for a challenge by the appellant to an adverse LEO determination affecting his claimed annuity entitlements). The regulations are not identical; they should be examined separately, depending on the applicable retirement coverage.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mahoney v. VA</span>, 81 MSPR 65, 68-69 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (1999), explained the process under FERS:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an employee is in a position that is not subject to the higher withholding rate applicable to LEOs, he must generally seek, formally and in writing, a determination from the employing agency that his position is properly covered by the higher withholding rate. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 842.804(c). If the employee does not seek such a determination within six months after entering the position, or after any significant change in the position, the agency head's determination that the service was not so covered at the time of the service is presumed to be correct. The employee may rebut this presumption by presenting preponderant evidence that he was unaware of his status or was prevented by cause beyond his control from requesting that the official status be changed at the time the service was performed. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 842.804(c); <span class="Italic">Streeter v. Department of Defense,</span> 80 MSPR 481 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Department of Defense,</span> 80 MSPR 1, 21 (1998), the Board clarified that, when an appellant claims that he was unaware of his LEO status, the test is not whether the appellant should have been aware of the existence of LEO coverage or whether the agency notified or attempted to notify the appellant of his retirement status. Rather, the only question under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 842.804(c) is whether the appellant has proven by preponderant evidence that he was actually unaware of that status. <span class="Italic">See Streeter,</span> 80 MSPR at 485 &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The timing of LEO retirement credit appeals was explored in <span class="Italic">Slater v. GSA</span>, 95 MSPR 378, 382-83 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over a claim for FERS LEO retirement credit under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1), which provides that "an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United States under the provisions of this chapter administered by the Office [of Personnel Management] may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board." Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c), an employee must file a formal, written request for LEO coverage within 6 months after entering the position in question, or within 6 months of any significant change in the position. The regulation further provides that failure to make a timely request will result in a presumption that the agency head's determination of non-coverage was correct unless the employee can show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was unaware of his status or that he was prevented from making a timely request by cause beyond his control. The 6-month time limit of section 842.804(c) is not jurisdictional; rather, it is a procedural, "regulatory time limit." <span class="Italic">Trivett v. Department of the Navy</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 61 &#x00B6; 5 (1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Department of Defense</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 1, 10 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 230 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table)). Therefore, we find that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1), the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 6-month time limit of section 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.804(c) is waived if it is not enforced at the employing agency level<span class="Italic">. Lott v. General Services Administration</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 324 &#x00B6; 5 (1999); <span class="Italic">Trivett</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 61 &#x00B6; 5. Here, contrary to the agency's assertion, the record shows that the agency waived its enforcement of the 6-month regulatory time limit. Specifically, "within 6 months...after any significant change in the position" is the relevant provision of section 842.804(c) in this case since the appellant contends that the requirement of periodic medical examinations constituted a significant change in the duties of his FPS Police Officer position. It is undisputed that, while the agency issued the appellant documents dated July 17, 2001, directing him to undergo periodic medical examinations, the agency had implemented the requirement much earlier, on June 7, 2000. Not until July 23, 2001, did the appellant request LEO retirement credit based on the medical examination requirement. Rather than rely on this long delay when denying the appellant's request for LEO retirement credit, however, the agency concluded on August 24, 2001, that the medical examination requirement did not constitute a significant change in the duties of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency maintains that its denial was also on timeliness grounds because its August 24, 2001 letter informed the appellant that he had failed to state the changes in his duties since the Board's 1999 final decision affirming the agency's denial of his prior request for LEO retirement credit. We cannot agree that the agency's reference in its August 24, 2001 letter to the Board's 1999 final decision in the appellant's prior appeal amounts to a rejection of the appellant's LEO request on timeliness grounds. It is clear from the agency's August 24, 2001 letter that the agency denied the appellant's request for LEO retirement credit on the merits and did not apply the 6-month regulatory time limit to find that his request was untimely. Therefore, "[b]y issuing a decision on the appellant's substantive eligibility for LEO coverage, the agency waived the time limit of section 842.804(c), and whether the appellant met either of the exceptions of that section is irrelevant." <span class="Italic">Trivett</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 61 &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">see Lott</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 324 &#x00B6; 5. Hence, we need not further address, as did the agency and the administrative judge, whether the agency's requirement of periodic medical examinations significantly changed the duties of the appellant's position, so as to trigger the start of the 6-month time limit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants, who hold Police Officer or Supervisory Police Officer positions at the agency's Military Traffic Command, Military Ocean Terminal, Bayonne, New Jersey, formally requested LEO status and retirement coverage. After the agency denied their requests, they filed a timely Board appeal and requested a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ issued an initial decision, without affording the appellants a hearing, finding that they had not made a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board had jurisdiction over the appeals because their requests were filed with the agency more than six months after each appellant assumed his or her position and they had not shown that they were either unaware of their LEO status or prevented by circumstances beyond their control from requesting a change in retirement status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In their timely petition for review, the appellants argue that the Board should afford them a hearing and a decision on the merits of their appeals. Specifically, they claim that they did not file requests within six months after entering their positions because they were unaware of their LEO status until July 1995. They contend that they subsequently showed due diligence in requesting that the agency review their status and "now have an unfettered right to a hearing before MSPB to challenge the final agency decision denying them LEO status." In the alternative, they contend that the agency official who made the LEO determinations did not have authority under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 842.802 to make such a judgment, and that the Board should remand the appeals to the agency for new decisions by an appropriate agency official....</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction in these appeals arises from 5 USC &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1) which allows that an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interest of an individual under the provisions of 5 USC chapter 84 administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may be appealed to the Board. The statute, at section 8461(g), gives OPM the authority to prescribe regulations to carry out the provisions of chapter 84.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Remand is not necessary in order for the administrative judge to address whether</span> <span class="Italic">the agency's denials of the appellants' requests for LEO coverage were final</span> <span class="Italic">decisions made by a designated representative of the head of the agency as</span> <span class="Italic">defined under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 842.802.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The controlling regulations at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 842.803 and &#x00A7; 842.804 state that it is the "agency head" that is to make the determination as to LEO coverage. The term "agency head" is defined in detail at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 842.802 and includes designated representatives of the agency head so long as those representatives are at certain levels of the agency's organization and meet other requirements of the regulations. The appellants challenge whether the agency official who denied their requests for LEO coverage (John C. Moseley, Chief, Field Advisory Services Division) meets the definition of "agency head" at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 842.802. Apparently, their theory is that, if the official who denied their LEO coverage claim does not meet the regulatory definition of "agency head," then their appeals would not be untimely because the agency has not yet made final decisions which would be appealable to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulation regarding Board jurisdiction over agencies' determinations concerning LEO retirement coverage under FERS provides that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he final decision of an agency denying an individual's request for approval of a position as a rigorous, secondary, or air traffic controller position made under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 842.804(c) may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR &#x00A7; 842.807(a). This regulation specifically states that it is the decision of the "agency," not necessarily the decision of the "agency head," that is appealable to the Board. Although somewhat confusing on its face when read in context with &#x00A7; 842.803, OPM's supplemental information published when these regulations were modified makes it clear that "any affirmative determination [as to LEO coverage] must be made by the agency head in accordance with &#x00A7; 842.803. However, a denial of an individual request for position approval may be made by the agency head's designated representative...." 57 Fed. Reg. 32685, 32688 (July 23, 1992). Since it is the "final decision of the agency" <span class="Italic">denying</span> coverage that is the action on appeal here, and since the denial of a request for LEO coverage does not have to be made by the "agency head," then the 5 CFR &#x00A7; 842.802 definition of "agency head" is immaterial to the appeal at hand.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Department of the Navy,</span> 70 MSPR 152, 156 (1996), is hereby overruled to the extent that it is inconsistent with this holding.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">If, within six months after entering the position or after any significant change in the position, an individual has not sought a determination from the agency requesting LEO retirement status, the agency's determination that the position is not covered is presumed to be correct. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 842.804(c). It is undisputed that none of these appellants requested a determination of LEO status within the six-month period; however, the appellants argued below that they were unaware of the existence of LEO coverage until July 1995, and then diligently initiated their request for an agency determination in September 1995. Thus, they asserted, their lack of awareness constituted good cause for their untimely request. The AJ found that the agency had no obligation to inform the appellants of their right to challenge their LEO retirement status, and, since they were not previously subject to the higher withholding rate, they knew or should have known that they were not receiving LEO coverage before July 1995, and were therefore not "unaware." He therefore concluded that the Board could not review the merits of the appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Department of Defense</span>, MSPB Docket No. PH-0842-94-0200-B-1, slip op. at 24 (Sept. 8, 1998), we clarified that, when an appellant claims that he or she was unaware of his or her LEO status, the test is not whether the appellant should have been aware of the existence of LEO coverage or whether the agency notified or attempted to notify the appellant of his or her retirement status. Rather, the only question under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 842.804(c) is whether the appellant has proven by preponderant evidence that he or she was actually unaware of that status. <span class="Italic">id.</span> Here, the appellants have alleged that they were unaware of their LEO status until July, 1995. In addition, they also state, and the record reflects, that shortly thereafter they initiated a series of requests for determinations of their status. We find that these assertions, if proven, would establish that the appellants were unaware of their LEO status during the six-month period referenced in the regulation and that they acted diligently upon discovering their right to seek an agency decision on the matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the AJ must determine whether the appellants have rebutted the presumption of correctness of the agency's determinations denying LEO retirement coverage to these appellants. If the AJ determines that the appellants have proven by preponderant evidence that they were unaware of their LEO status within the six-month period or prevented by cause beyond their control from timely requesting a change in their status, he should further adjudicate the merits of their appeals.</p>
