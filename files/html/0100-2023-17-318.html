<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-316"><span id="page_2297"></span><span class="space">j.</span> Suspension</h5>
<p class="noindent">Many suspension grievances are adjudicated under a contract's "just cause" clause. An arbitrator may determine whether all or part of a disciplinary action is not for just and sufficient cause and set aside or reduce an imposed penalty. The "just cause" determination may, in turn, relate to other formulations, e.g., FLRA pronouncements concerning burdens of proof as discipline arising out of protected union activity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and Nat'l Border Patrol Council, AFGE</span>, 43 FLRA 939, 949 (1992). Some arbitrators will apply an "efficiency of the service" review standard--the same standard applied by MSPB in major adverse actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, Southwestern Power Admin. and IBEW Local 1002</span>, 56 FLRA 624, 625 (2000) (requirements that discipline be for efficiency of the service are functionally identical to requirements that discipline be for just cause). The arbitrator need not, in deciding a disciplinary suspension grievance, go beyond determining whether the suspension meets the "efficiency of the service" standard of 5 USC 7503(a). The arbitrator need not accept and then decide based on an agency's own formulation of the statutory standard as it is applied to the challenged suspension. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Ft. Wayne and AFGE Local 1384</span>, 39 FLRA 717, 721 (1991) (upholding award setting aside suspension based on employee's protected right to refuse to attend meeting with supervisor without union representative present); <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Prison Sys., El Reno FCI and AFGE Local 171</span>, 35 FLRA 329, 335 (1990) (rejecting argument that an arbitrator had to decide a case involving the escape of an inmate under a theory of strict culpability) (citing <span class="Italic">INS and AFGE</span>, 8 FLRA 248 (1982)).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award meets the Back Pay Act "but for" test if a suspension is submitted to arbitration and the suspension is found not to be for just cause. By operation of the award the suspension is rendered an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action within the meaning of the Back Pay Act. When coupled with a direction by the arbitrator that the agency reimburse the grievant for all losses caused by the unwarranted suspension, the award meets the requirements of the Back Pay Act that, but for the unwarranted suspension, the grievant would not have suffered a withdrawal or reduction of his pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1760 and SSA, Northeastern Program Serv. Ctr.</span>, 22 FLRA 195, 199 (1986). The award need not incant magic words. The finding by an arbitrator that a suspension was unsupported is a finding that the suspension was an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action within the meaning of the Act. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1915 and Dorn VA Hosp., Columbia</span>, 32 FLRA 1223, 1226 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">The back pay analysis for a suspension remedy is relatively straightforward, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU Chap. 164</span>, 65 FLRA 160, 163-64 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of backpay is authorized under the Back Pay Act only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action resulted in the withdrawal or the reduction of an employee's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Warner Robins Air Force Base, Ga.</span>, 56 FLRA 541, 543 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Warner Robins</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., </span>54 FLRA 1210, 1218-19 (1998) (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award of backpay for the grievant's five-day suspension is not contrary to the Back Pay Act.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Def., Dep't of Def. Dependents Schools, </span>54 FLRA 773, 785 (1998)). The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 28, Section 1 of the parties' agreement. The Agency has not demonstrated that this finding is deficient. Accordingly, we find that the award satisfies the first requirement of the Back Pay Act.</p>

<p class="noindent">Although nothing requires an arbitrator to apply the harmful error doctrine to a short suspension, nothing precludes its application. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1781 and USDA, Forest Serv.</span>, 42 FLRA 703, 709 (1991) (relying on <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Honolulu and AFGE Local 2886, Immigration and Naturalization Council</span>, 41 FLRA 207 (1991)); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1592 and Dept. of Air Force, Hill AFB</span>, 45 FLRA 424, 427 (1992) (award sustaining assessment of levy against employee for property damage; arbitrators are not precluded from applying harmful error rule in cases that do not mandate its application). If the arbitrator is not required to apply statutory <span id="page_2298"></span>standards to a short-term suspension challenge, the alleged misapplication by the arbitrator of the statutory standard (involving protected activity under &#x00A7; 7102) does not provide a basis for setting the award aside. <span class="Italic">VA Maryland Healthcare Sys. and AFGE Local 331</span>, 65 FLRA 619, 622 (2011). <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;IS and AFGE Local 1616</span>, 66 FLRA 693, 694 (2012), rejected the argument that the arbitrator could not impose a contractual "just cause" burden of proof on a suspension that the agency maintained was in part a performance-based action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an arbitrator resolves a claim under a collective-bargaining agreement rather than a legal claim, "unless a specific burden of proof is required, an arbitrator may establish and apply whatever burden the arbitrator considers appropriate[.]" <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, VA Md.

In addition, where an arbitrator is not required to apply a particular legal standard, alleged misapplications of that standard do not provide a basis for finding the arbitrator's award deficient. <span class="Italic">E.g., Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 65 FLRA 286, 288 (2010) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator framed the issue as whether the Agency had "just cause" or "appropriate cause" to discipline the grievant as required by Article 29, Section B of the parties' agreement. He did not set forth as an issue, or resolve, whether the suspension violated Chapter 75. Because the issue before the Arbitrator was a purely contractual claim, the Arbitrator was not required to apply a particular legal standard, and the Arbitrator's alleged misapplication of Chapter 75 does not provide a basis for setting aside the award as contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 65 FLRA at 288.

VA Md</span>., 65 FLRA at 621-22 (denying contrary-to-law exceptions challenging legal standard used by arbitrator, where arbitrator resolved grievance under parties' agreement on finding of no just cause for discipline).</p>
<p class="noindent">Just as an arbitrator need not follow law developed on procedural or harmful error by the MSPB or its reviewing court, the Federal Circuit, during adjudication of challenges to short suspensions or lesser disciplinary actions, the arbitrator need not follow substantive MSPB law on the merits of short suspensions, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770 and Dept. of Army, Ft.

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Metz</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 780 F.2d 1001 (Fed.

Therefore, because the grievant in this case was given a 10-day suspension, the Arbitrator was not bound to follow the same substantive standards as the MSPB. Consequently, the Union has not demonstrated that the award is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Metz</span>. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Immigration and</span> <span class="Italic">Naturalization Service</span>, 36 FLRA at 932 (Authority rejected the agency's assertions that an award was deficient because the arbitrator's findings regarding the issue of disparate treatment conflicted with precedent of the Federal Circuit and the MSPB).</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator's review of procedural issues involved in suspensions need not comport with decisions of the MSPB and the Federal Circuit on appeals litigated before the Board. When an arbitrator found aspects of the processing of a grievance over a one-day suspension untimely, the union filed exceptions that claimed the agency was barred from raising the issue of timeliness before the arbitrator because the agency had not raised the issue during the grievance procedure. FLRA sustained the award finding the grievance untimely, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Monroe and NAGE Local R4-11</span>, 35 FLRA 1187, 1191-92 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In [<span class="Italic">Gunn v. VAMC, Birmingham</span>, 892 F.2d 1036 (Fed.

The court in <span class="Italic">Gunn</span> noted that, because its review was governed [by the statutory standard] set forth in <span class="Italic">John Wiley &#x0026; Sons v.

<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing exceptions to arbitrators' awards under section 7122(a) of the Statute, the Authority does not apply the standard set forth in 5 U.S.C. 7703(c) but, as relevant here, is guided by decisions of "Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations[.]"...&#8197;Consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">John Wiley &#x0026; Sons v. Livingston</span> and other decisions of Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations, we will deny exceptions that merely disagree with an arbitrator's determinations regarding the procedural arbitrability of a grievance.

<p class="noindent">Although arbitrators may not be bound in disciplinary cases to the case law and statutes governing adverse actions, FLRA expects arbitrators to enforce constitutional safeguards. If an award concerning disciplinary action is challenged for lack of constitutional due process, the law defining the protected property interest should be provided to FLRA. If due process arguments are made, for example, on the basis of provisions of agency regulations and a collective bargaining agreement, FLRA may dismiss the exception if "[w]ithout any reference to either the regulation or the agreement, there is no basis on which to find any constitutionally protected property interest or to determine what process was due to the grievant." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 47 FLRA 621, 624 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">Constitutional issues that are indirectly involved in a grievance over discipline are not necessarily required to be correctly resolved, or resolved at all, if the arbitrator's determination is based on a contract article rather than the constitutional issue, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP, Border Patrol and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2554</span>, 65 FLRA 752, 755 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency alleges that the award is contrary to <span class="Italic">Garrity </span>and the "obey now, grieve later" rule. When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Def., Dep'ts of the Army &#x0026; the Air Force, Ala. Nat'l Guard, Northport, Ala.</span>, 55 FLRA 37, 40 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency alleges flaws in the Arbitrator's legal analyses concerning <span class="Italic">Garrity </span>rights and the "obey now, grieve later" rule, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, the issue framed by the Arbitrator involved whether "disciplinary action in this case [was] taken for just cause and only for reasons that will promote the efficiency of the service[.]" Where an arbitrator resolves a claim under a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) rather than a legal claim, "unless a specific burden of proof is required, an arbitrator may establish and apply whatever burden the arbitrator considers appropriate[.]" <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, VA Md.

In addition, where an arbitrator is not required to apply a particular legal standard, alleged misapplications of that standard do not provide a basis for finding the arbitrator's award deficient. <span class="Italic">E.g., SSA</span>, 65 FLRA 286, 288 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the "Agency ha[d] the burden...to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence," that the grievant's suspension complied with the parties' agreement. For the reasons set forth <span class="Italic">supra </span>Part II.B., the Arbitrator found that the "Agency [did] not...establish just cause for the [g]rievant's suspension[,] or that the suspension was only for reasons as will promote the efficiency of the Agency." Because the issue before the Arbitrator was a contractual claim, the Arbitrator was not required to apply a particular legal standard, and the Arbitrator's alleged misapplication of <span class="Italic">Garrity </span>rights doctrine or the "obey now, grieve later" rule does not provide a basis for setting aside the award as contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 65 FLRA at 288.

VA Md.</span>, 65 FLRA at 621-22 (denying contrary-to-law exceptions challenging legal standard used by arbitrator, where arbitrator resolved grievance under parties' agreement on finding of no just cause for discipline).</p>
<p class="noindent">A suspension grievance may be resolved by an arbitrator even if the grievant is no longer in the unit when arbitration is invoked. <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NAAE,</span> 63 FLRA 495, 499 (2009), added as to the arbitrator's jurisdiction over a grievance of an employee who was in the unit at the time the suspension grievance arose but who resigned before arbitration was invoked:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, CBP claims that the Arbitrator's arbitrability determination is contrary to law because he relied on <span class="Italic">Hess</span> [<span class="Italic">Hess v. IRS,</span> 892 F.2d 1019 (Fed. Cir. 1989)]. In <span class="Italic">Hess,</span> the court held that an employee's status "at the time adverse action [i]s taken" is determinative. 892 F.2d at 1020. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Hess</span> and based on his interpretation of the CBA, the Arbitrator concluded that, as the grievant was a unit employee at the <span id="page_2299"></span>time CBP issued its suspension decision, the grievant was entitled to grieve the decision under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. The Arbitrator's conclusion is consistent with <span class="Italic">Hess</span> and there is no basis on which to conclude that the Arbitrator was precluded from applying <span class="Italic">Hess</span>. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Fort Worth, Tex.,</span> 58 FLRA 397, 398 (2003) (where Authority, citing <span class="Italic">Hess</span>, found that award was not contrary to law because the grievant filed the grievance at the time he was in the bargaining unit); <span class="Italic">IRS, Brookhaven Serv.

Also, the Agency's claim that the Arbitrator improperly ignored the arbitrator's decision in <span class="Italic">Nellis</span> provides no basis for finding the award deficient under the Statute because arbitration awards are not precedential. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Local 2030,</span> 56 FLRA 667, 672 (2000).</p>
