<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-60"><span class="space">e.</span> Lack of Evidence of Precise Medical Causation Not Determinative</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite the Board's pronouncement in <span class="Italic">Chavez v. OPM</span>, 6 MSPR 404, 6 MSPB 343 (1981), that "once and for all" it was setting the standards for evaluation of medical evidence--and certainly <span class="Italic">Chavez</span> noted the importance of subjective evidence of disability--the Board and reviewing courts have continued their dialogue and analysis of what constitutes a sufficient foundation of medical evidence to support approval of a disability retirement application. [Refer in Chapter 4 to "<a href="0100-2023-11-053.html#sec4-54">Evidence in Disability Annuity Appeal; <span class="Italic">Chavez</span>; Post-Separation Evidence</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An annuity claim is not defeated because physicians cannot determine the cause of a medical condition, <span class="Italic">Winsted v. OPM</span>, 10 MSPR 325, 327 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case the record shows that, although the physicians could find nothing organically wrong with the appellant and the tests he underwent showed normal results, each of the doctors who examined the appellant and gave an opinion with respect to whether he was disabled concluded that he was unable to perform the duties of his position. This is supported by the appellant's own uncontradicted statements that his condition was getting progressively worse, that in addition to muscle weakness, he now suffered from considerable pain and at times was unable to walk at all. In addition the appellant's sister stated that the appellant's condition was deteriorating, that he was becoming weaker and was having difficulty with his balance. She said that her sister was similarly disabled because of muscle weakness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the appellant's supervisor noted that at the time he filed his disability retirement application, the appellant could not walk for long periods of time without stopping to rest, had trouble breathing during the summer and winter and could not carry his route on hot days. He stated that the appellant had been absent because of illness 72 days in the two year period preceding his filing of the disability application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submitted with his petition a statement from Dr. Burkhardt, the appellant's physician since 1969, who noted that the appellant had developed definite abnormal gait and generalized tremor. He stated, "Whatever the cause, he cannot function as a letter carrier in his current state." The appellant submitted a report from a neurologist who diagnosed his condition as reactive depression and stated that he was unable to return to work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The D.C. Circuit decided in <span class="Italic">Turner v. OPM</span>, 707 F.2d 1499, 1500-01, 1504-06 (D.C. Cir. 1983), that, following <span class="Italic">Chavez,</span> OPM and the Board could not deny a disability claim based only on lack of a precise medical explanation of the cause of the appellant's disability:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner Dr. James H. Turner seeks review of a final order of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board) denying his application for voluntary disability retirement. At issue is the Board's determination that petitioner's unusual medical condition--an acute aversion to enclosed places caused by chronic diarrhea--is not a "disease" within the meaning of the statutory disability retirement scheme, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6) (1976) (disability must be caused by "disease or injury"). Because the legal basis of the Board's determination is unclear, we remand to the MSPB for a more comprehensible rationale for its action in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I.&#x2003;BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;The Factual Basis of Petitioner's Claim</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before his separation from federal service, Dr. Turner was a chemical engineer with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Specifically, petitioner's job at EPA entailed the development and administration of nationwide programs to control and prevent air pollution from emitted particulate matter. As part of his duties, petitioner was required to travel frequently, often with minimal advance notice, throughout the nation and occasionally abroad.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1977, petitioner began to experience the unpleasant effects of chronic diarrhea and intestinal cramping associated with the diarrhea. Because of this malady, it became important for petitioner to have ready access to a restroom and, as fate would have it, petitioner's diarrhea was exacerbated by the extreme anxiety he felt when he did not have such access. In particular, he developed an adverse psychosomatic reaction to travel on commercial aircraft, where access to restrooms cannot be guaranteed at all times. This aspect of petitioner's condition severely affected his ability to perform the travel required by his job. Petitioner requested reassignment to a position that did not require air travel, but his request was denied because no such position could be found. Although petitioner's supervisor was sympathetic to petitioner's plight, he nonetheless became increasingly dissatisfied with petitioner's impaired work performance. In 1980, with his supervisor's support, petitioner applied for voluntary disability retirement pursuant to 5 U.S.C.&#x00A7; 8347 (1976).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accompanying Dr. Turner's application for disability retirement were statements by two doctors and petitioner's supervisor. In one of the medical statements, Dr. Robert Harper diagnosed petitioner's condition as, "[p]sychophysiological gastrointestinal reaction characterized by intermittent diarrhea. Phobic neurosis, fear of flying in commercial aviation or of being in any situation in which he does not have immediate access to a bathroom," Statement of Dr. Robert N. Harper. In a second medical statement, Dr. Willard Pierson stated that "Mr. Turner's diarrhea is aggravated by flying commercially, and he tends to have very urgent diarrhea before and during these flights." Statement by Dr. Willard C. Pierson. The statement by petitioner's supervisor indicated the work-related effects of petitioner's medical condition: "Dr. Turner cannot handle the extensive duties required in developing and administering extramural contract, grant, cooperative, and interagency R &#x0026; D programs because he is unable, due to his disability, to perform the required travel within the U.S. and overseas either totally or on the necessary timely basis." Superior Officer's Statement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;The Procedural History of Petitioner's Claim</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Approximately three months after submitting his application for disability retirement to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), petitioner received a letter from OPM stating that his application had been disapproved because "[a] careful review...of all evidence submitted in your case fails to establish that you have a disability severe enough to prevent useful, efficient, and safe performance of the essential duties of the position from which you are seeking retirement." Letter from Retirement Claims Division, OPM, to James H. Turner (June 4, 1980). Petitioner requested that OPM reconsider its decision but, upon reconsideration, OPM sustained its initial decision stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[Your]&#x2003;[m]edical evidence includes the following: The reports diagnose psychophysiological gastrointestinal reaction. The examinations reveal no objective pathological findings of sufficient severity to warrant total disability award. This condition seems to be under appropriate treatment and hopefully [crossed out] is <span id="Page_4169"></span>manageable. It is also noted that your problems are situational in nature rather than an inherent disease.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By the time petitioner received OPM's reconsideration decision, he had been forced to resign from his position at EPA because of his inability to perform his job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner appealed OPM'S final decision to the MSPB, but, in April 1981, the Board's presiding official affirmed OPM's final decision. Although the presiding official disagreed with OPM's finding that petitioner's condition was "manageable," he otherwise agreed with OPM's conclusion that petitioner did not have the type of medical condition that qualified for disability retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Moreover, the evidence of record does not reveal whether the diarrhea is amebic or bacillary. While the appellant may have had episodes of diarrhea due to an amebic or bacillary infection, the evidence of record indicates that at present, his diarrhea is caused by stress, and that stress comes about when he is faced with the prospect of traveling by commercial airplane. In other words, the appellant's initial problems with diarrhea, led to a fear of flying, which in turn now, when faced with flying, causes aggravation of the condition. In short, the appellant's diarrhea now is due to fear of flying.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's finding that the appellant's problems are situational rather than an inherent disease are supported by the facts of this case and there is no precedent for awarding disability retirement based on an individual's phobias.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner requested the full Board to review the presiding official's decision, but, in March 1982, the Board denied this request. Although the Board felt that the presiding official had misstated the applicable burden of proof, it nevertheless agreed with the "ultimate conclusion set forth in the initial decision." Accordingly, the Board allowed the presiding official's decision to become the final decision of the MSPB. Petitioner seeks judicial review of this final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;DISABILITY</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We come then to the merits of petitioner's argument--that and OPM and MSPB unjustifiably belittled the disabling characteristics of petitioner's unusual medical condition and therefore erred in concluding that he was not disabled within the meaning of the Civil Service Retirement Act (the Act). At the time of petitioner's application for disability retirement (February 1980), the Act contained the following definitions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"disabled" and "disability" mean totally disabled or total disability, respectively, for useful and efficient service in the grade or class of position last occupied by the employee or member because of disease or injury not due to vicious habits, intemperance, or willful misconduct on his part within 5 years of becoming so disabled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6) (repealed 1981). Petitioner argues that he meets these definitional requirements given that the sole evidence in the administrative record are the statements by two doctors indicating a "disease or injury" and the statement by his supervisor indicating that, due to this medical condition, petitioner could not perform the necessary functions of his job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Government responds that petitioner does not have the type of "disease" for which disability retirement can be awarded. This conclusion is drawn from the administrative determinations of OPM and MSPB that "[t]he [medical] examinations reveal no objective pathological findings of sufficient severity to warrant total disability award," "appellant's diarrhea is now due to fear of flying...and there is no precedent for awarding disability retirement based on an individual's phobias," and "OPM's finding that the appellant's problems are situational rather than an inherent disease are [sic] supported by the facts...." Although we recognize that these administrative determinations reflect mixed findings of fact and conclusions of law, it appears that the ultimate conclusions of both agencies share a common flaw: they impose on claimants seeking disability retirement legal burdens beyond those imposed by the definitional requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, OPM's emphasis on the lack of "objective pathological findings," and MSPB's concern with the unknown etiology of petitioner's medical condition, ("the evidence of record does not reveal whether the diarrhea is amebic or bacillary"), are difficult to square with the MSPB's recently announced de-emphasis of the importance of objective medical evidence. In<span class="Italic"> Chavez v. OPM,</span> No. DA 831L09003 (May 28, 1981), a decision on which the Board in this case otherwise placed considerable weight, the Board held that there was nothing "in sections 8331(6), 8347, or 7701 [which] requires us to conclude that a disability retirement claim on appeal before us must be established solely by objective medical evidence."<span class="Italic">Chavez,</span> slip op. at 23-24. The <span class="Italic">Chavez</span> decision, moreover, is consistent with OPM's general recognition that an employee may be disabled within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6) when the employee's illness is exclusively "mental or emotional,"<span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1203 (1982), and is also consistent with the plethora of court decisions striking down the indispensability of objective medical evidence under the even more rigorous disability insurance benefits provision of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 423(d) (1976)m <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Ragsdale v. Secretary, Dep't of Health, Education, &#x0026; Welfare,</span> 623 F.2d 528, 530 (8th Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Marcus v. Califano,</span> 615 F.2d 23, 27-28 (2d Cir. 1979); <span class="Italic">Page v. Celebrezze,</span> 311 F.2d 757, 762-63 (5th Cir. 1963).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the agencies' denigration of petitioner's "phobia" as being insufficiently severe to justify disability retirement effectively reads into the definition of disability an element of "seriousness" that is nowhere found in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6). Rather than measure the disabling nature of a disease by any abstract notion of "seriousness," the language of section 8331(6) defines "disability" solely in terms of rendering an employee incapable of "useful and efficient service" in the employee's specific position (providing the disease was not due to the employee's vicious habits, intemperance, or willful misconduct within five years of becoming disabled). <span class="Italic">See Cerrano v. Fleishman,</span> 339 F.2d 929, 931 (2d Cir. 1964), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 382 U.S. 855, 86 S. Ct. 106, 15 L. Ed.2d 93 (1965) (emphasizing the position-specific nature of disability); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(a) (1983) (employing same definition of "disability"); Federal Personnel Manual, 1981 Supplement 831-1, S10-1b (same); OPM Pamphlet 18, <span class="Italic">Your Retirement System</span> &#x00A7;F-19, at 17 (June 1979) (total disability means "inability of the employee, because of disease of injury, to satisfactorily and efficiently perform the duties of the position occupied or the duties of a similar position. It need not be shown that the applicant is disabled for all kinds of work."). Accordingly, if petitioner's chronic diarrhea in fact made it impossible for him to carry out the necessary functions of his position, he would seem to fit analytically within the statutory definition. The attempt by OPM and MSPB to disparage petitioner's medical condition as a mere "phobia" not only ignores the physical manifestation of petitioner's disease but also overlooks the fact that phobic reactions are clinically defined as mental illnesses, <span class="Italic">see American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</span> 225-34 (3d ed. 1980); equally compelling, OPM has never before suggested that phobias, as a class, are excluded from the statute's coverage of disabling mental diseases, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Your Retirement System, supra,</span> &#x00A7;F-12, at 17 ("May disability annuity be based on any disease of injury? No. It may not be based on a disability of short duration, or on disability due to vicious habits, intemperance, or willful misconduct on the employee's part within the 5-year period before becoming disabled.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agencies' conclusion that petitioner's condition is "situational," and therefore not an "inherent disease," seems to constitute no more than a shorthand reiteration of their earlier views that petitioner's condition is merely phobic, unsupported by objective pathological findings, or otherwise not serious enough to be disabling. To the extent OPM also meant to include within this conclusion its findings that Dr. Turner's condition was manageable, we note that the Board's presiding official specifically rejected this finding as unsupported by the medical evidence. The larger defect in the agencies' analyses, however, is that they overlook the fact that the statutory definition of disability is itself "situational," varying with the effects of a disease or injury on different employees' specific positions. In <span class="Italic">Chavez v. OPM,</span> for example, the Board held that a forestry technician's extreme allergic reaction to dust and smoke might constitute a disabling disease to an employee whose job entailed forest firefighting. <span class="Italic">Chavez,</span> slip op. at 30, while implying that such a disease might not be disabling to an employee whose job entailed a larger portion of inside office work, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 3. In <span class="Italic">Parodi v. MSPB,</span> 690 F.2d 731 (9th Cir. 1982), the Ninth Circuit confronted the inverse situation. The claimant in <span class="Italic">Parodi</span> was a federal office worker whose asthmatic bronchitis made it impossible for her to work inside an office where cigarette smoking occurred. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 737. Although the claimant could perform her work in a smoke-free environment, the court held that she fit within the definitional prerequisites of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6) because:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">She is as disabled for her job at her assigned worksite as she would be had she actually suffered permanent and severe chronic bronchitis or another physically debilitating disease. She cannot perform her job, not due to a choice or bad habits, but due to a disease which limits the environment in which she can work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">690 F.2d at 738. The MSPB's approach in <span class="Italic">Chavez</span> and the Ninth Circuit's approach in <span class="Italic">Parodi</span> comport with the statutory definition of disability and undermine the agency's "situational" rationale in the present case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We remand the case to the Board. Although the Government's disapproval of petitioner's application for disability retirement is without defensible rationale, we are debarred from moving to the merits of petitioner's case. The extremely narrow limits of <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span>-level judicial review vouchsafes factual determinations concerning disability retirement to OPM and, upon appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, to the MSPB. Our province extends no further than to correct misapplications of governing legislation that go to the heart of the administrative determination. We have no doubt <span id="Page_4170"></span>that such statutory misconstructions have occurred here. But it is for the Board on remand to engage in a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> redetermination of petitioner's qualification for disability retirement under the proper statutory definition of "disabled" and "disability." We caution the Board that, upon reassessment, it may not deny petitioner's claim merely because he suffers in part from a medically diagnosed "phobia" that may make commercial air travel impossible. Nor may the Board deny petitioner's claim solely because he cannot prove the etiology and extent of his medical condition by objective medical evidence. Rather, as the Board itself noted in <span class="Italic">Chavez,</span> slip op. at 28-29, objective clinical evidence is but one of the elements of proof to be considered, along with diagnoses and expert medical opinions, subjective evidence of disability, and all evidence relating to the effect of petitioner's condition upon his ability to perform in the grade or class of position he last occupied.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Turner v. OPM</span>, 16 MSPR 246 (1983) (granting the disability annuity).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Ninth Circuit reversed the Board on a disability determination and assessment of evidence in <span class="Italic">Parodi v. MSPB</span>, 690 F.2d 731, 733, 737-40 (9th Cir. 1983), involving extreme sensitivity to workplace tobacco smoke:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Parodi worked for the Defense Logistics Agency for nearly twelve years. In July 1977, the agency transferred her to a new workplace, located in a room occupied by sixty to seventy people, many of whom smoked.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Immediately after the transfer, Parodi began missing work due to pulmonary complications which included continual phlegm production, chest pains, congestion, and difficulty breathing and speaking. A pulmonary specialist, Dr. Donald Ho, diagnosed her as suffering from "asthmatic bronchitis with hyper-irritable airways," and concluded her condition stemmed from her reaction to cigarette smoke. Dr. Ho recommended she take leave from work. She did so and her symptoms subsided. Dr. Ho then recommended she not return to work in a smoke-filled environment. Parodi continued her absence from work and, shortly thereafter, on June 26, 1979, she filed for disability retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two doctors examined Parodi on behalf of the OPM. Dr. Charles Bass did not perform any objective tests but reported that Parodi did not suffer any short or long term adverse physical effects. Dr. Bass acknowledged that his opinion could change if he saw Parodi's chest x-rays and that Parodi's problem could require "personnel and environmental control." Dr. Robert Fallat, in examining Parodi, exposed her to cigarette smoke and within four minutes she suffered acute pulmonary problems including airway irritation, an increase in airway resistance, and a reduction in peak-flow rates. Dr. Fallat concluded that Parodi was hypersensitive to cigarette smoke, and recommended she "not return to employment in the same office where she previously experienced significant symptomatology." Dr. Fallat also stated that requiring Parodi to work in her previous job would endanger her health.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPM reviewed the medical evidence and, on September 27, 1979, concluded that Parodi was not totally disabled "within the meaning and intent of the Civil Service Retirement Regulations." Parodi appealed to the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its decision, the MSPB acknowledged the doctors' recommendation that Parodi not return to work in a smoke-filled environment and that her superior officer believed that she could not do her job due to pulmonary problems. The MSPB also recognized that Parodi "might reasonably be concerned with the probable risk to her future health from working in an environment where exposure to cigarette smoke presents a hazard to all employees, and particularly to herself because of her peculiar physical sensitivity." Despite these findings, the MSPB concluded that Parodi was not totally disabled and affirmed the OPM decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISABILITY</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties do not dispute the essential facts of this case: Parodi worked in an environment containing cigarette smoke; due to her hypersensitivity to cigarette smoke, she could not work at her assigned worksite; further employment at her worksite would subject her to risk of permanent lung impairment; but she could work in an environment containing less cigarette smoke. Given these facts, the issue here is whether the OPM and MSPB erred in finding that Parodi was not "totally disabled."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the governing legislation a person is totally disabled if unable to perform "useful and efficient service in the grade or class of position last occupied by the employee or Member because of disease or injury not due to vicious habits, intemperance, or willful misconduct on his part within five years before becoming so disabled." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6). Under this statute, the party seeking to prove disability meets its initial burden of proof by showing that the employee is unable, due to disease or injury, to perform useful and efficient service in the specific position occupied at the time proceedings for voluntary or involuntary retirement are instituted by either the employee or the government. <span class="Italic">See Cerrano v. Fleishman,</span> 339 F.2d 929, 931 (2nd Cir. 1964), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 382 U.S. 855, 86 S. Ct. 106, 15 L. Ed.2d 93 (1965).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellees do not dispute that Parodi, because of her disease, is unable to perform the specific position she last occupied. Rather, appellees contend that Parodi is not disabled because she does not suffer any permanent or serious impairment, and because she would be able to work in an area with less cigarette smoke.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both contentions suffer the same flaw--they impose on claimants seeking disability benefits certain requirements beyond those imposed by section 8331(6). As to appellees' first contention, section 8331(6) does not require that a person have a serious or permanent physical problem to qualify for disability benefits. The law only requires the person be unable to perform useful and efficient service, because of a disease or injury, in the job last occupied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellees' second contention--that Parodi is physically able to perform her job--is also irrelevant. Section 8331(6) does not require an applicant to prove an inability to perform useful service under all circumstances. While Parodi could perform her previously assigned job in an area with less smoke, as stated above, all she must show under section 8331(6) is an inability, due to an injury or disease, to perform the job she occupied at the time she applied for disability benefits. <span class="Italic">Cerrano,</span> 339 F.2d at 931. She has done so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While Parodi's condition presents a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case for disability benefits, we recognize that her claim is unusual. Most disability claims involve a physical or mental limitation that prevents a claimant from performing his or her job. Parodi has an environmental limitation. Unlike a person with a physical limitation, a person with an environmental limitation can physically perform the assigned work in a proper environment. Here, Parodi could perform the work assigned to her if she were placed in a smoke-free environment. Parodi cannot, however, perform her job due to its location in a smoke-filled office. She is as disabled for her job at her assigned worksite as she would be had she actually suffered permanent and severe chronic bronchitis or another physically disabling disease. She cannot perform her job, not due to choice or bad habits, but due to a disease which limits the environment in which she can work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8331(6) does not exclude environmental limitations from forming the basis of an employee's disability. Appellees have not cited any authority or justification for precluding victims of environmental limitations from receiving disability benefits.[13] As noted above, to qualify for disability benefits applicants must demonstrate an inability, due to a disease or injury, to perform useful and efficient service at the last job occupied. The nature of the disease or injury, unless it involves vicious habits, intemperance, or willful misconduct, is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;Analogous areas of law provide that persons suffering from environmental limitations (generally referred to as non-exertional limitations) may be considered disabled. Social Security, for example, provides disability benefits where environmental restrictions result in an "inability to tolerate some physical feature(s) of work settings that occur in certain industries or types of work." 20 C.F.R. Subpart P. App.2, Rule 2000.00(e). <span class="Italic">See also Gagnon v. Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare,</span> 666 F.2d 662 (1st Cir. 1981), Workers' Compensation cases have also recognized environmental limitations as disabling. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 2 A. Larson, <span class="Italic">The Law of Workmen's Compensation,</span> &#x00A7; 57.61, (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, Parodi's lack of a serious or permanent medical incapacity and her ability to perform her job in another location are immaterial to the primary question concerning disability--whether she could perform the job she last occupied. She could not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The finding that she could not perform the job she last occupied, however, does not conclusively, decide this case. Under the facts presented here, Parodi would not be disabled if the government offered her suitable employment--employment at the same grade or position in a location appropriate for Parodi's physical condition--because if such employment were offered, Parodi would be able to perform useful and efficient service. We must decide who carries the burden of proving whether suitable employment is available to Parodi.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only case discussing this issue is <span class="Italic">Cerrano v. Fleishman,</span> 339 F.2d at 929. There, the Bureau of Customs involuntarily retired Cerrano. The administrative board found Cerrano disabled for "useful and efficient service" in his position. He claimed he was not disabled for service in other positions in the same grade or class. The Second Circuit held that the Civil Service Commission, before involuntarily retiring someone, need not "search the entire galaxy of Civil Service jobs, either in the same grade or the same class, to determine whether or not there was some such position between Alaska and Florida or Hawaii and Maine, which the appellant, in spite of his disability, could fill." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 931. The court also suggested that an <span class="Italic">employee</span> applying for voluntary disability benefits would not have to prove "he was unable to perform any of the jobs which for administrative convenience are put in the same grade or class and in which at the time, there might be an opening." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that an employee should not have to prove the availability of an appropriate job. The government is in a better position than the claimant to provide evidence of the availability of suitable employment, particularly <span id="Page_4171"></span>the availability of employment in a safe environment. Therefore, we hold that once an applicant for voluntary disability retirement benefits demonstrates an inability to perform useful and efficient service in the last job occupied, the burden shifts to the government to show that an appropriate substitute position is available.[14] If the government satisfies this burden and offers the claimant a suitable position, the claimant is no longer disabled within the meaning of section 8331(6). If, however, the government cannot find a suitable position or refuses to offer one, the claimant is then entitled to disability benefits. In the instant case, Parodi is willing and able to work if a position in the same grade or class located in a safe environment is available. Therefore, unless Parodi's environmental limitation is accommodated within 60 days by an offer of suitable employment in a safe environment,[15] Parodi is eligible for disability benefits. For good cause shown to the district court, this period could be extended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;This test is similar to that employed in determining Social Security disability. When applying for Social Security disability, a claimant carries the initial burden of establishing that he is unable to perform his previous work. Once the claimant has made such a showing, the burden shifts to the Secretary of HEW to establish that there is other substantial gainful employment which the claimant can perform. <span class="Italic">Hall v. Secretary of HEW,</span> 602 F.2d 1372, 1375 (9th Cir. 1979). The test we adopt is also similar to the test employed in connection with the Longshoremen's Compensation Act. <span class="Italic">See Bumble Bee Seafoods v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs,</span> 629 F.2d 1327 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[15]&#x2003;In this case, the government could simply remove the environmental barriers or offer Parodi a job in an area containing less smoke.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record is not clear whether suitable employment in a safe environment is available. If it is, and if the government does not offer Parodi such employment, she is eligible for disability retirement benefits in an amount to be determined through regular proceedings.</p>
