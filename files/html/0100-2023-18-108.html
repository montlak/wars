<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Harding v. U.S. Naval Academy</span>, 567 Fed. Appx. 920, 925-26 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP), rejected the argument that a well-founded inference of a threat to safety drawn by the deciding official from the nature of the misconduct was an improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> consideration when the inference was not disclosed to the employee during reply process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Ms. Harding argues that she was improperly denied notice that the deciding official would rely on the danger that Ms. Harding's conduct presented to persons living in the part of the NSA facility where she had been driving, which was a residential area. The act of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, however, is inherently dangerous. The deciding official was merely pointing out that Ms. Harding's conduct presented a danger to persons in the NSA, a conclusion that flowed naturally from the fact of impaired driving in a residential area. She was not deprived of due process by not being advised in advance that the deciding official might draw that inference from the nature of the charged conduct.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Ms. Harding relies on this court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 634 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2011), and <span class="Italic">Stone v. FDIC</span>, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999), to support her claim that she was denied due process by not being notified of the penalty-related factors listed above. Those cases are inapposite, as they both involved <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts with the deciding official in which information was conveyed to the decisionmaker without the employee's knowledge. In <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication conveyed information about several past instances of misconduct by the employee, which the deciding official took into account in deciding that removal was warranted. 634 F.3d at 1278. The past misconduct in <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, unlike the factors raised by Ms. Harding, was clearly an aggravating factor as to which the employee had no notice. In <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication included the recommendation of another agency official that the employee be removed. 179 F.3d at 1372. The court remanded in <span class="Italic">Stone</span> to determine whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication introduced new and material information to the deciding official. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377. There is no issue of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication with the deciding official in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3284"></span><span class="Italic">Pauli v. DHS,</span> DC-0752-13-6815-I-1 (NP 3/10/2016), discerned no due process error when a deciding official considered the potential impact of a material expediter charged with negligently operating delivery vehicle:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the "hypothetical situation" that the appellant alleged constituted uncharged conduct underlying his removal, the deciding official testified that, in arriving at his decision, he considered that if the appellant had been transporting aircraft parts at the time of the incident, those parts could have been damaged, resulting in risk to life. The appellant argues that he was not, in fact, transporting any aircraft parts at the time, there was no damage to any aircraft part, and he had no notice that the deciding official would be considering this hypothetical situation in arriving at his decision. The administrative judge did not address this argument in her initial decision, and it does not appear that the appellant specifically raised it below. <span class="Italic">See Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980) (finding that the Board generally will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Giving the appellant the benefit of the doubt, we address this argument here, but nevertheless find that it was appropriate for the deciding official to consider what could have happened as a result of the appellant's misconduct. The deciding official was entitled to make logical inferences of the potential dangers of the charged misconduct, and the agency did not deprive the appellant of his due process rights by not advising him in advance that the deciding official might draw such inferences. <span class="Italic">See Harding v. U.S. Naval Academy</span>, 567 F. App'x 920, 925-26 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (finding that an agency did not violate an employee's due process rights when it did not notify her that it would consider as aggravating factors the consequences that naturally might have flowed from her actions). Furthermore, we do not construe this "hypothetical situation" as amounting to uncharged and counterfactual misconduct, but merely an explanation of why the Materials Expediter position entails a degree of trust and why the deciding official believed that the appellant could no longer be trusted.[9] <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 304-05 (1981) (explaining that, in determining the appropriate penalty, the agency should consider relevant factors such as the effect of the offense upon supervisors' confidence in the employee's ability to perform assigned duties).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The appellant argues that this situation is similar to that in <span class="Italic">Westmoreland v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 12 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 19 F. App'x 868 (Fed. Cir. 2001), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds as recognized by Pickett v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 439, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11 (2011) (finding that the Board in <span class="Italic">Westmoreland</span> improperly applied a harmless error test, rather than considering the error as a due process violation), in which the Board found that it was procedural error for an agency to consider prior incidents of misconduct of which the appellant had no notice to enhance the penalty. As explained here, we do not believe an agency must provide an appellant with notice that its penalty determination will include a consideration of the potential harm that might logically result from the appellant's misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCook v. DHUD,</span> SF-0752-14-0389-I-1 (NP 8/3/2015), placed the burden on the appellant to discern the possibility that a deciding official might infer notoriety from language of the proposal, based on guilty pleas to felony stalking, criminal threats, and computer access fraud, concerning the appellant's "important position" as an underwriter:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that because the notoriety of the offense was not overtly discussed in the notice of proposed removal this constituted an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication. The administrative judge found, though, that this <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information did not violate the appellant's right to due process because the notoriety of the offense was discussed in the decision to indefinitely suspend the appellant that was attached to the notice of proposed removal. The appellant argues that the differences between the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor analysis in the indefinite suspension and the removal are "too great" for the indefinite suspension to have provided him with notice of the aggravating factors the deciding official considered in the removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the proposal letter provided the appellant with adequate notice of the facts the deciding official considered concerning the notoriety of the offense. Specifically, the notice of proposed removal noted "considerable concerns" regarding the appellant's ability to perform in his "important position" in which he would be in contact with at least one of the victims he pled guilty to stalking and would have access to a computer program containing very sensitive personal data. The proposing official further noted that the appellant had been issued Criminal Protective Orders to remain 100 yards from four agency employees.<span class="Italic"></span> Although the notice letter did not expressly discuss these facts in terms of the notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the agency's reputation, the appellant was not deprived of due process by not being advised that the deciding official might draw such an inference from the nature of the information in the notice of proposed removal. <span class="Italic">See Harding</span>, 567 F. App'x at 925-26 (finding no due process violation because the deciding official was merely drawing a conclusion that flowed naturally from the nature of the charged conduct); <span class="Italic">see also Grimes v. Department of Justice</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 36, &#x00B6; 13 (2014) (determining that due process does not require that an employee be informed in advance of the particular weight a deciding official will give to arguments made in response to the reasons specified in the proposal letter).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But deciding officials' concerns about potential publicity led to a couple decisions involving due process objections when the publicity was not cited in the proposed adverse action. <span class="Italic">Payton v. VA</span>, AT-0752-14-0055-I-1 (NP 1/29/2015), involving charges of endangering the safety of a patient, leaving the work area, and lack of candor, distinguished <span class="Italic">Harding</span> and overturned a removal for lack of due process when the deciding official considered the appellant's intent as to a charge that did not require a showing of intent, and when the deciding official relied on purported effects of the employee's conduct, including "negative notoriety," not fairly implied for the charges:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reviewed the initial decision, along with the record evidence developed below, and we find that the deciding official committed a <span class="Italic">Ward/Stone</span> due process violation by considering several aggravating factors which were not included in the agency's advance notice of the action. In its notice of proposed removal, the agency explained that the appellant's misconduct jeopardized the safety of a particular residential patient and that the appellant had previously been disciplined in April 2013 and November 2012. The agency included no additional discussion of any other proposed aggravating factors in its notice of proposed removal. The deciding official's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors worksheet, however, reflects that the deciding official took into account several additional aggravating factors in rendering his decision, including the severity of the appellant's misconduct, the intentional nature of her actions, management's loss of trust in the appellant, and the potential negative notoriety that the agency could have faced as a result of the appellant's misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although some of the aggravating factors cited by the deciding official "flowed naturally from the fact" that the appellant was charged with endangering the safety of a patient and lack of candor (such as the severity of the appellant's misconduct) and were thus properly considered, we find that the intentional nature of the appellant's conduct and the potential for negative attention toward the agency were not within the natural ambit of these charges. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Harding v. U.S. Naval Academy</span>, 567 F. App'x 920, 925-26 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (<span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors worksheet referencing that the appellant "intentionally did not inform leadership when asked" about an unlocked gate and that "during a fact-finding the employee again intentionally gave untrue information"). Under these circumstances, the agency was required to notify the appellant that it would rely upon these additional aggravating factors in reaching a decision on her proposed removal. <span class="Italic">See Langham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6; 7 (2002) (suggesting that the agency erred by not informing the appellant that it would consider the intentional nature of his conduct).[4] The agency, however, did not include these factors in the notice of proposed removal, and the appellant had no opportunity to respond to these aggravating factors before the deciding official rendered a decision. We accordingly find that the deciding official's reliance on these factors violated the appellant's due process rights under Ward/Stone. <span class="Italic">See Solis v. Department of Justice</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 458, &#x00B6; 9 (2012) (finding a due process violation based on the deciding official's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors worksheet and hearing testimony); HT at 155-56 (deciding official's testimony that he reviewed each of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors listed on the worksheet).[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Langham</span>, the Board found that it could remedy the deciding official's error by performing its own analysis of the reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Langham</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6; 7. This practice, however, was overturned by the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Ward</span>. <span class="Italic">See Gray v. Department of Defense</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 7 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;There was testimony and evidence furnished below that the appellant was presented with "the evidence file" prior to her responding to the notice of proposed removal. Based on the information in the record before us, it does not appear that the agency provided the appellant with a copy of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor worksheet as part of the evidence file. However, if the agency had done so and had allowed the appellant, in her reply to the deciding official, and opportunity to address the factors identified in the worksheet (whether or not she availed herself of that opportunity), then there would have been no <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication and, therefore, no <span class="Italic">Ward/Stone</span> violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In further support of our conclusion, we note that neither of the sustained charges against the appellant--endangering the safety of a patient and lack of candor--required proof of intent; although lack of candor is a broad and flexible concept, it does not require a showing of intent. <span class="Italic">See Rhee v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 10 (2012) (citing <span class="Italic">Ludlum v. Department of Justice</span>, 287 F.3d 1208, 1283-84 (Fed. Cir. 2002)). <span id="Page_3285"></span>Moreover, although the intentional nature of an employee's conduct is always a relevant aggravating factor that may be considered as part of the deciding official's penalty analysis even if it is not part of the charge against the employee, a deciding official must inform the employee in advance of his intent to rely upon such an aggravating factor in reaching a decision on the proposed adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Fernandez v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 63, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 14 (2003) (intent is always relevant to the reasonableness of an agency's penalty determination); <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 547, 556 (1996) (an agency may consider the employee's intent even if it is not required as part of the charge of misconduct). Because neither of the sustained charges against the appellant required proof of intent, we find that the deciding official erred in considering the intentional nature of the appellant's misconduct without advanced notice. <span class="Italic">See Jenkins</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 12 (the agency erred by considering charges in the agency's table of penalties which were not included in the notice of proposed removal); <span class="Italic">Howard v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 106, &#x00B6; 6 (2012) (finding a due process violation based on the deciding official's consideration of performance deficiencies which were not included in the removal proposal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Projected notoriety of the offense or its impact on the agency's reputation, first addressed in the adverse action decision, also served to reverse an agency action for lack of constitutional due process in the reply process in <span class="Italic">Lundy v. DHS</span>, DA-0752-13-4522-I-1 (NP 2/19/2015), involving charges of unauthorized removal and possession of government property and misuse of a government computer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency intends to rely on aggravating factors as the basis for the imposition of a penalty, such factors should be included in the advance notice of adverse action so that the employee will have a fair opportunity to respond to those factors before the agency's deciding official. <span class="Italic">Lopes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 5 (2011). When a deciding official relies on information, which the appellant is not on notice may be considered, the information is referred to as an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication. <span class="Italic">See Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (discussing when <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> concerns arise in connection with an adverse action); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Black's Law Dictionary 316 (9th ed. 2009) (defining an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication as one "between counsel and the court when opposing counsel is not present," and noting that "such communications are ordinarily prohibited"). Our reviewing court has explained that, if an employee has not been given notice of aggravating factors contributing to an enhanced penalty, the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication with the deciding official may constitute a constitutional due process violation because it potentially deprives the employee of notice of all the evidence being used against him and the opportunity to respond to it. <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1280 (2011). However, "[o]nly <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official" constitute due process violations. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. The "ultimate inquiry" is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is "so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will consider the following factors, among others, to determine whether an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact is constitutionally impermissible: (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces "cumulative" information or new information; (2) whether the employee knew of the information and had a chance to respond to it; and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 685, &#x00B6; 8 (2013). A due process violation is not subject to the harmless error test; instead, the employee is automatically entitled to a new, constitutionally-correct removal proceeding. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279. The Board has determined that this analysis applies not only to <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications introducing information that was previously unknown to the deciding official, but also to information personally known and considered by the deciding official, if that information was not included in the notice of proposed removal to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 686, &#x00B6; 9 (2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official stated in his decision letter that he considered the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors indicated on the worksheet attached to his letter. On the attached worksheet, the deciding official indicated the three aggravating factors considered by the proposing official, and added an additional four factors as aggravating. Those factors were: the employee's job level and type of employment, the notoriety of the offense or its impact on the agency's reputation, the potential for the employee's rehabilitation, and the adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in the future. Regarding the appellant's job level, the deciding official explained that the appellant was to set an example for new hires at the agency's biggest distribution center. For the notoriety factor, the deciding official explained that if the misconduct were to become public, it would damage the agency's reputation and potentially result in a loss of trust and confidence in the agency. However, the record does not indicate that the appellant's conduct garnered any public attention. For the rehabilitation factor, the deciding official determined that there were repeated incidents of the same offenses, suggesting that the appellant could not be rehabilitated. Similarly for the alternative sanctions factor, the deciding official also considered the repeated incidents, along with the seriousness of the conduct, and the potential impact on the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor analysis introduced new information because the deciding official considered additional factors to be aggravating. The notice of proposed removal contained none of the information detailed by the deciding official regarding the four additional aggravating factors. The proposing official's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors worksheet reflects each of the four factors as being either neutral or not applicable. The proposing official also noted that the appellant had the potential to be rehabilitated, contrary to the conclusion of the deciding official. There is no evidence in the record to suggest that the deciding official shared any of the information regarding the additional aggravating factors with the appellant prior to his issuance of the decision letter. Therefore, we find that the deciding official's consideration of four additional <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors was new information not included in the agency's proposal notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To find a violation of the appellant's due process rights, not only must the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication considered by the deciding official be new, but the communication also must be material. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279. An <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is material when it influences the deciding official's penalty determination. <span class="Italic">Seeler v. Department of the Interior</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 9 (2012). The deciding official stated in his decision letter that he took into consideration all of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and referenced his worksheet. Further, his testimony reflected consideration of the new factors as part of the penalty determination. Although the deciding official did not explicitly state that he was influenced by the additional aggravating factors, we find that his specific identification of them in the decision letter shows that the determination was material to his decision in this case. <span class="Italic">See Silberman v. Department of Labor</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 12 (2011) (specific identification of supervisory memoranda of unprofessional conduct as factors in the agency's suspension decision showed that they were material to the case).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the second <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor, there is no evidence in the record that the appellant knew of the deciding official's consideration of additional <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. The appellant did not present an oral reply and presented only a written reply to the deciding official. We find no evidence that the appellant had the opportunity to respond to the additional aggravating factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, our reviewing court clarified that the third <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor of undue pressure is only one of several enumerated factors and is not the ultimate inquiry in the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> analysis. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2. The court added that, although <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications of this type may "make it more likely that an appellant was deprived of due process," the lack of undue pressure may be less relevant to finding a constitutional violation where the deciding official "admits that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication influenced his penalty determination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, we find that the additional aggravating factors in the decision letter's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors worksheet, along with the manner in which the information was used in the penalty determination, establishes that the appellant's right to due process was violated by the deciding official's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication, and that the third factor is thus less relevant. Therefore, we conclude that the agency may not remove the appellant unless and until he is afforded a new constitutionally-correct removal procedure. <span class="Italic">See Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 13. Accordingly, we VACATE the initial decision and do not sustain the removal action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Potential notoriety of an offense, mentioned in a proposing official's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> worksheet that was not provided to the appellant, but that was considered by the deciding official (who somehow obtained the analysis) resulted in a due process denial and reversal of an adverse action in <span class="Italic">Knowlin v. VA</span>, DC-0752-17-0703-I-1 (NP 2/15/2023) (Member Leavitt dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the consideration of the potential notoriety of the offense was an improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication. Regardless of whether the deciding official relied on the proposing official's analysis of the notoriety factor or he considered it separately on his own prior to issuing the decision, the agency was required to inform the appellant that it was considering the notoriety factor as an aggravating one before it imposed the removal. <span class="Italic">See Jenkins v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 10 (2012) (stating that when determining whether a due process violation has occurred, there is no basis for distinguishing between <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information provided to the deciding official and information personally known by the deciding official if the information was considered in reaching the decision and not previously disclosed to the appellant); <span class="Italic">Lopes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 10 (2011) (observing that when a deciding official considers either <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information provided to him or information personally already known to him, the employee is no longer on notice of portions of the evidence relied upon by the agency in imposing the penalty).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3286"></span>Regarding the first factor, the agency argues that the notoriety of the offense is not new information because it "flowed naturally from the [c]harge" and did not provide any additional information that was not already apparent from the proposal and evidence file. We disagree. The deciding official's consideration that the appellant's misconduct "could" have a negative impact and lead to additional scrutiny on the agency was purely speculative. Nearly any misconduct by an employee has the <span class="Italic">potential</span> for notoriety. In the absence of actual notoriety in the media or in the community, there was no reason to think that this counterfactual scenario should have been of special concern to the agency in this case. As such, the appellant could not have known that the agency would rely on the notoriety of the offense as an aggravating factor or that the deciding official would construe the factor in such a way. <span class="Italic">See Jenkins</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 12 (finding the deciding official's reliance on the recommended penalties from the agency's table of penalties for a charge other than those set forth in the proposal notice constituted new information because the appellant was not aware that the proposed penalty would be considered that way). Therefore, the deciding official's reliance on the notoriety factor cannot fairly be deemed cumulative or immaterial to the final decision. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the second <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor, it is undisputed that the appellant did not have an opportunity to respond to the agency's reliance on the notoriety factor. In fact, it is unclear from the record when she even became aware of which factors the agency was relying upon for an aggravated penalty. Although the proposing official informed the appellant that the agency was concerned about an internal complaint lodged by one of the affected service members, this is not the same thing as the agency's fear of possible future media attention. Regarding the third <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor, it is also undisputed that the deciding official considered the notoriety factor. He testified that the notoriety of the appellant's misconduct was an important factor in his decision and that the proposing official's analysis of that factor "did not go far enough."[3] However, there is no evidence in the record that the information resulted in undue pressure on him to remove the appellant. Nonetheless, our reviewing court has emphasized that whether the additional information was of the type likely to result in undue pressure is only one factor and is not the ultimate inquiry. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2. Specifically, the court recognized that "the lack of such undue pressure may be less relevant to determining when the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications deprived the employee of due process where...the [d]eciding [o]fficial admits that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications influenced his penalty determination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Therefore, while no clear evidence of undue pressure exists, the deciding official's testimony is clear evidence of the materiality of the notoriety of the offense in his decision to remove the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Even if the dissent is correct that the deciding official considered the notoriety of the offense independently of the proposing official's analysis, the due process problem would remain. A deciding official is not permitted to consider aggravating factors that the employee was not warned about in advance, regardless of whether any <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication was involved. <span class="Italic">See Richardson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2023 MSPB 1, &#x00B6; 32.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the deciding official's consideration of the notoriety factor was so substantial and likely to cause prejudice that the agency's failure to notify the appellant in advance violated her right to due process. <span class="Italic">See Gray v. Department of Defense</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-13 (2011) (finding a due process violation when the deciding official considered the appellant's likely loss of eligibility for a sensitive position as an aggravating factor without notifying the appellant). Accordingly, we reverse the initial decision in this regard and do not sustain the appellant's removal. The agency may not remove the appellant unless and until she is afforded due process. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12. In light of our findings here, we find it unnecessary to reach the appellant's additional due process claim that one of the agency's specifications was vague.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Decisions can occasionally seemingly read a lot into broad phrases in a proposal to justify a deciding official's reliance on a far more specific aggravating factor, as in <span class="Italic">Hulett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-11-0690-B-1 (NP 9/26/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant argues on review that he was not on notice of the deciding official's consideration in her penalty determination of certain matters she deemed as aggravating factors, specifically, the notoriety of the offense and the appellant's being willfully defiant and insubordinate. As the administrative judge found, however, both of these matters were referenced in the notice of proposed removal, wherein the proposing official noted that the appellant initially refused to report for drug testing on the date identified and that, for a Lead Firefighter, the use of illegal drugs violates the special trust of the general public who rely on Firefighters to protect life and property....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reference to the initial decision, <span class="Italic">Hulett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-11-0690-B-1 (Initial Decision 12/20/2013), does not show that notoriety was specifically stated by the deciding official to be an aggravating factor in the decision or in hearing testimony.
