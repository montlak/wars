<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-327"><span class="space">5.</span> Crediting Plans: Specific Selection Criteria; KSAs</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU Chapters 153 and Customs Serv., Region II</span>, 11 FLRA 209, 211-13 (1983), reviewed the negotiability of crediting plans used to establish relative merit of eligible candidates for promotion to unit positions. Although its result was reversed in court, FLRA found the matter negotiable. FLRA explained that promotion candidates are reviewed to determine basic eligibility and relative qualifications. As to basic eligibility, minimum qualification requirements for a position are set by OPM and supplemented by selective factors added by the agency, to include the knowledge, skill, and ability essential to successful performance in the job. If a candidate fails to meet those minimum qualification requirements, he is not eligible for further consideration. Eligible candidates are then rated and ranked so that selection can be made from those who are best qualified. Qualifications of eligible candidates are evaluated based on predetermined criteria by agencies in accordance with OPM guidelines. One method of rating is through the use of a crediting plan, a set of criteria reflecting the specific knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics that management determines are required for successful performance in the job to be filled. For each criterion at each crediting level, the plan provides definitions or examples of relevant factors such as experience, training, and education. Raters compare the background of the candidates with the crediting level definitions to measure the extent each candidate possesses the requisite characteristics set by the plan criteria. FLRA initially announced that union proposals defining crediting factors and criteria to be negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The proposed crediting plans would only apply to candidates who are determined by management to be at least minimally qualified for the positions involved. Furthermore, such plans would be used only to rate and rank such qualified candidates and would not be used to eliminate any candidate from further consideration for selection. Finally, in this connection, the proposals would not require the Agency to select a specific candidate or to limit the Agency to a specific source of candidates. In this regard, the Union expressly intends its proposals to leave the Agency free to select or not to select any qualified candidate for the position from any appropriate source. Consequently, Proposals 1 and 2 constitute procedures which would not prevent the Agency from acting at all to establish the minimum qualification requirements for a position or from selecting any qualified candidate from any appropriate source.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, Union Proposals 1 and 2 are not inconsistent with management's rights to determine the personnel by which Agency operations shall be conducted or to hire employees. These proposals do not restrict in any manner management determinations as to such personnel and the knowledge, skills, and abilities which such personnel must possess in order to do the work. Rather, the proposals would only establish criteria for more precisely evaluating the experience and education of qualified candidates and, moreover, as noted previously, would not prevent management from selecting any qualified candidate for appointment from any appropriate source. If follows, perforce, that the proposals would not prevent management from exercising its discretion to hire employees in the Agency. Finally, the Agency argues that the provisions of subchapter S6, FPM Supplement 335-1, preclude it from disclosing or negotiating the content of its crediting plans. The purpose of those provisions, as stated therein, is "to maintain the security and control of examination materials which, if exposed to unauthorized persons, might provide unfair advantage to some candidates or otherwise compromise the utility of the selection procedure." Hence, the content of crediting plans can be released...if the release would not create any unfair advantage to some candidate or compromise the utility of the selection process....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA rejected a compelling need objection to local negotiations over ranking factors for promotion. The agency argued that proposals precluded nationally uniform ranking or rating standards. The agency cited no regulation or rule containing national standards. <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, Region X, Seattle</span>, 5 FLRA 688, 689 (1981). But FLRA's approach toward negotiability of crediting plans was reversed in <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Region II v. FLRA</span>, 739 F.2d 829, 830-33 (2d Cir. 1984):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which was created to take over the personnel management duties of the Commission, was authorized to delegate its personnel functions to individual agencies, which, however, were prohibited from taking personnel actions that were contrary to law or OPM regulations....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104...provides for delegation of authority without relieving the OPM director of his responsibility "to prescribe regulations and to ensure compliance with the civil service laws, rules, and regulations."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies which are contemplating the promotion of employees must scrutinize the applicants to determine both their basic eligibility and their relative qualifications for the new position.&#x2003;Basic eligibility is determined by reference to minimum qualification requirements established by OPM and supplemented by such additional selective factors as the agency involved has deemed appropriate. Once it has been determined which candidates are basically qualified, the candidates' qualifications are evaluated to determine who is the best qualified for the position. This is done by means of a crediting plan.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A crediting plan consists of a set of evaluation criteria which reflect the specific knowledges, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) deemed necessary for the successful performance of a particular job. The crediting plan establishes different levels for the several criteria, each level corresponding to a different degree of actual or expected competency in terms of the particular criterion being measured. Each level is defined by reference to written descriptions of certain specific experiences, training, achievements, or test scores, and is assigned a rating value. Based on the cumulative score of the ratings for all evaluation criteria, the candidates can be ranked as to their comparative qualifications for a position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the Customs Service and OPM believe that skilled professional help is needed for the formulation and validation of adequate crediting plans....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM regulations also dictate the use of "subject matter experts" to analyze the duties and responsibilities of the job to be filled and personnel specialists to identify the KSAOs necessary to perform the job....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite the concerted emphasis on professionalism and specialization evidenced in the foregoing review, the Union insists, and the FLRA agrees, that the Service is required by law to negotiate with the Union the contents of its crediting plans for the positions of Import Specialist GS 5/7 and Customs Inspector GS 9/11. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deciding whether this Court should accede to the FLRA on this issue, one of the things we must determine is whether the FLRA erred in applying the "acting at all" standard to the facts of this case....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "acting at all" standard originated in section 7218(b) of the Senate Bill, which provided that negotiations on procedures governing the exercise of authority reserved to management should not unreasonably delay the exercise by management of its authority, and any negotiations on procedures governing matters otherwise reserved to agency discretion may not have the effect of actually negating the authority reserved to the agency....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, the "acting at all" standard deals with the process of negotiation, not, as here, with its end product. Any other interpretation of the standard would require the parties to predict the outcome of negotiations before they begin.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA also clearly erred in holding that crediting plans proposed by the Union would "not restrict in any manner management determinations as to [the personnel by which Agency operations shall be conducted]" and that "such plans would be used only to rate and rank...qualified candidates and would not be used to eliminate any candidate from further consideration for selection."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...If section 7106(a)(2)(C) is interpreted in [the] correct manner, it must be read to provide that management shall have the authority to make selections for appointment from "among properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion," and, disjunctively, that management shall have the authority to make selections from "any other appropriate source." Each subsection must be considered separately....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...If a measurement device does not measure accurately the degree to which a candidate possesses a required KSAO, management is deprived of its right to choose personnel possessing the knowledge, skills, and abilities which management deems necessary for the position....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the measurement tools included in crediting plans are integrally connected to the skills, knowledges, and abilities which are being sought in a candidate for a position. Therefore, the crediting plans are a part of management's substantive decision as to what KSAOs the successful performance of a position requires. Imposing an obligation to bargain concerning the content of the plans interferes with management's reserved right to determine the personnel who will conduct agency operations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Hard on the heels of the Second Circuit case came <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 762 F.2d 1119, 1122-23 (D.C. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">vacating</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 11 FLRA 247 (1983) (similar to 11 FLRA 209 (1983)), reaching the same result as the Second Circuit. The D.C. Circuit, not following the Second Circuit analysis, determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1) excludes the duty to bargain with regard to proposals that are "inconsistent with...any Government-wide rule or regulation." Treasury urges that the proposal in dispute here conflicts with several government-wide regulations including...5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Each employment practice of the Federal Government generally, and of individual agencies, shall be based on a job analysis to identify:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;The basic duties and responsibilities;</p>
<p class="noindent-3"><span id="page_871"></span>(2)&#x2003;The knowledges [sic], skills, and abilities required to perform the duties and responsibilities; and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(3)&#x2003;The factors that are important in evaluating candidates. The job analysis may cover a single position or group of positions, or an occupation or group of occupations, having common characteristics.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal before us clearly involves an "employment practice"...since that term is defined in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101 to include "measurement instruments." The FLRA does not assert that the proposal in question is actually based on job analyses of all or related groups of the some 11,000 diverse positions to which it applies. Rather, it argues that job analyses <span class="Italic">could</span> be carried out in conformity with the proposal, and that there is no reason to believe that any job analysis would find the proposal unrelated to job requirements. But the mere permissibility of an <span class="Italic">ex post facto</span> job analysis, and the mere absence of a showing that such an analysis, if conducted, would invalidate the previously adopted measurement devices, falls far short of fulfilling the requirement that those devices "be <span class="Italic">based</span> on a job analysis to identify...[t]he factors that are important in evaluating candidates." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(a). [emphasis added]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Authority's opinion did not address the requirement that the proposed employment practice be based on job analysis, it did consider the related requirement that all actions under a promotion plan be "based solely on job-related criteria." Federal Personnel Manual ch. 335, subch. 1-4. On the basis of that provision, it held the proposal non-negotiable insofar as it would require credit for <span class="Italic">non-job-related</span> education and experience.... This limitation does not suffice to save the remainder. Exclusion of non-job-related education and experience is not the same as a job analysis before the measurement scheme is adopted, and cannot reasonably be said to assure the same results. The latter is apparent from the fact that, even as so limited, the proposal establishes the number of points to be awarded for each level of the various factors <span class="Italic">without any reference to the demands of specific occupations</span>....</p>
<p class="noindent">Another crediting plan was considered, with the result that two provisions of the plan proposed, requiring credit or points for experience and education not directly related to a job, were nonnegotiable. They conflicted with the requirements of the former FPM Chapter 335 that crediting plans evaluate on the basis of job-related skills, education, experience, and other factors. A proposal was not negotiable that arbitrarily assigned points for crediting plan purposes on the basis of seniority without any job analysis linking seniority to success in the particular positions sought. The FLRA relied on <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 762 F.2d 1119, 1121-23 (D.C. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">vacating</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 11 FLRA 247 (1983). <span class="Italic">Montana Air Chap., ACT and Dept. of Air Force, Mont. Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 19 FLRA 946, 946 (1985). These rulings have been followed; a proposal to establish a crediting plan is nonnegotiable if, contrary to OPM regulations, it is not based on a job analysis demonstrating a connection between performance in a current position and job-related training and success in the positions sought. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R7-23 and Dept. of Air Force, Hq. 375th Air Base Group, Scott AFB</span>, 21 FLRA 978, 980-81 (1986). Negotiations over KSAs under the guise of impact bargaining were rejected as "sort of a camel's nose--thin to get into the tent of bargainability, but subject to growth at the Union's election once inside." <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 848 F.2d 1273 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (relying on <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1745 v. FLRA</span>, 828 F.2d 834, 840-43 (D.C. Cir. 1987)). Proposals concerning the formation of a crediting plan were nonnegotiable even though they permitted the agency to determine the relevant knowledge, skills, abilities and other factors concerning a position. They stated how much weight those factors would be given in the evaluation process, including weights for supervisory evaluations and candidates' interview responses. The proposals concerned the substantive aspects of the crediting plan and not simply the procedures involved in the plan. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 29 and Kansas City Dist., Corps of Eng'rs</span>, 23 FLRA 569, 571-72 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 61 FLRA 554, 556-57 (2006), summarized the law concerning negotiability of provisions that amount to or impact crediting plans:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted previously, employment practices of the Federal government must be based on a job analysis to identify: (1) the "basic duties and responsibilities" of a position or group of positions; (2) the "knowledges, skills, and abilities required to perform the duties and responsibilities" of the position or group of positions; and (3) "[t]he factors that are important in evaluating candidates" for the position or group of positions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(a). There must be a "rational relationship between performance in the position to be filled...and the employment practices used[,]" proof of which includes a showing that "the employment practice was professionally developed." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b). The term "employment practices" includes "the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101. This term was meant to be given a "broad and inclusive meaning[.]" <span class="Italic">Dowd v. United States</span>, 713 F.2d 720, 723 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300 applies to crediting plans for candidates applying for positions. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 55 FLRA 1174, 1182-83 (1999) (requiring agency to add points to candidates' scores based on seniority contrary to regulation) (Member Wasserman dissenting in part on other grounds). In reaching this conclusion, the Authority relied on the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">Dep't of Treasury v. FLRA</span>, 762 F.2d 1119 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">Treasury</span>). In <span class="Italic">Treasury</span>, the court addressed a proposal that specified the factors that a merit promotions board could consider--experience, supervisory evaluations of performance, education, awards, and miscellaneous factors--and the number of points that could be assigned to each. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1120. The court found that, because the proposal assigned specific points for these factors without reference to the demands of specific occupations, the requirement for a job analysis was not satisfied. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1122. In <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 55 FLRA at 1182-83, the Authority applied this precedent and held that a provision that provided employees with credit based on seniority did not satisfy the regulatory requirement for a job analysis because the provision made no reference to the requirements of specific occupations and was not tailored to a position or group of positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provisions 1, 2 and 3 all involve crediting plans for applicants for promotions. Provision 1 provides that candidates will be ranked by assigning specific numbers of points to certain types of awards. Provision 1 applies without regard to the demands of specific occupations and is not designed to apply to a particular position or group of positions. This supports a conclusion that Provision 1 fails to satisfy the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300. <span class="Italic">See Treasury</span>, 762 F.2d at 1122; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 55 FLRA at 1182-83.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 2 provides, as an alternative to Provision 1, that candidates will be assigned certain numbers of points based on their ratings on critical job elements for positions in the same series as the position being filled. Provision 2 also provides that the total of these points will be added to points for performance-related awards and that the sum of these amounts will establish the best qualified list in rank order. Although the assignment of points for critical job elements applies only to positions in the same job series as the position being filled, the assignment of points for performance-related awards is not so limited. Instead, this aspect of Provision 2 applies without regard to the demands of specific occupations and is not designed to apply to a particular position or group of positions. This supports a conclusion that Provision 2 also fails to satisfy the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300. <span class="Italic">See Treasury</span>, 762 F.2d at 1122; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 55 FLRA at 1182-83.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 3 sets forth a formula for rating and ranking candidates for a category of positions (specifically, positions rated GS-8 and below) different from those covered by Provisions 1 and 2. In particular, Provision 3 assigns specific numbers of points for quality step increases, PMS Performance Awards, suggestion awards, special act awards, and accepted system changes. As with Provision 1 and the aspect of Provision 2 involving points for performance-related awards, Provision 3 applies without regard to the demands of specific occupations and is not designed to apply to a particular position or group of positions. This supports a conclusion that Provision 3 also fails to satisfy the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300. <span class="Italic">See Treasury</span>, 762 F.2d at 1122; <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 55 FLRA at 1182-83.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not dispute that the measurement devices set forth in the three provisions are not based on job analyses, as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300. Instead, the Union claims that it is premature for the Agency to declare the provisions nonnegotiable and should be required to wait until after the IRS conducts any necessary job analyses. However, the court in <span class="Italic">Treasury</span> rejected a similar claim, holding that "the mere permissibility of an <span class="Italic">ex post facto</span> job analysis, and the mere absence of a showing that such an analysis, if conducted, would invalidate the previously adopted measurement devices, falls far short of fulfilling the requirement that those devices 'be <span class="Italic">based</span> on a job analysis to identify...[t]he factors that are important in evaluating candidates.'" 762 F.2d at 1122 (quoting 5 C.F.R. 300.103(a)) (emphasis in decision). Thus, the fact that the IRS could later conduct job analyses for individual positions or groups of positions does not render Provisions 1, 2 and 3 not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also claims that, under Article 2, Section 1 of the parties' agreement, the provisions should be construed and administered in a manner that is consistent with law and government-wide regulation, if possible. This is consistent with the Authority's practice. In this regard, where proposals have stated that they should be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with law and regulation, the Authority has relied on that fact in determining their negotiability. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Council of Veterans Admin. Locals</span>, 31 FLRA 360, 450 (1988) (<span class="Italic">NFFE</span>), <span class="Italic">remanded without decision</span>, 88-1314 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 27, 1988), <span class="Italic">petition dismissed on other grounds on remand</span>, 33 FLRA 349 (1988); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 3477</span>, 14 FLRA 427, 427-28 (1984) (<span class="Italic">Local 3477</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 32</span>, 3 FLRA 784, 785 (1980) (<span class="Italic">Local 32</span>). The Authority also assesses whether the wording and/or explained meaning of the proposal is otherwise consistent with law and regulation. <span class="Italic">See NFFE</span>, 31 FLRA at 450 (Authority found "no apparent inconsistency" between proposal and cited regulations); <span class="Italic">Local 3477</span>, 14 FLRA at 427-28 (finding union's statement of intent was that "sole procedures" of proposal were not meant to replace, but to supplement <span id="page_872"></span>provisions of the Agency's procedures and the requirements of law and regulation); <span class="Italic">Local 32</span>, 3 FLRA at 787 (finding proposals were not "incompatible or irreconcilable" with the cited regulations).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union provides no explanation as to how Provisions 1, 2 and 3 can be construed and administered in a manner that is consistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300. Rather, as discussed above, the provisions establish clear, absolute measurement devices that fail to meet the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300. As the plain wording of the provisions does not permit an interpretation that is consistent with law, and the Union has not provided one, the<span class="Italic"> </span>Union's claim that the provisions should be interpreted in a manner consistent with law and regulation under Article 2, Section 1 does not provide a basis for finding the provisions consistent with law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Union's claim that the parties at the local level agreed that this provision meets the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300, there is no basis for concluding that such agreement governs the Authority's assessment of the provision's consistency with law. Additionally, the Union's assertion that Provisions 1 and 3 are roll-over provisions from a previous agreement does not demonstrate that the provisions are negotiable. In this regard, the mere fact that parties have agreed to a provision in the past does not provide any basis for finding the provision not contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Air Traffic Controllers Ass'n, Rochester Local</span>, 56 FLRA 288, 291-92 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 29 FLRA 734--finding negotiable a provision regarding crediting seniority--is misplaced. In this regard, the issue presented in that decision was whether the provision was a procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute, not whether the provision was contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 791-93.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal that the agency disclose crediting plans to the union was nonnegotiable because then-controlling government-wide regulations, FPM Supp. 335-1, subch. S6, and FPM Letter 335-15, authorized release of crediting plans only if the their disclosure would not create any unfair advantage to some candidates or compromise the utility of the selection process. Because the proposal gave management no ability to make discretionary judgments as to release of the plans, the proposal was inconsistent with the regulation and nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 23 FLRA 681, 682-84 (1986). FLRA determined to be nonnegotiable a proposal that crediting plans be listed in job opportunity announcements. Proposals authorizing blanket disclosure of crediting plans were outside the duty to bargain. Release of benchmarks of crediting plans would result in an unfair advantage to bargaining unit employees when candidates are drawn from OPM registers or other sources. Nonunit candidates would not have access to the benchmarks. Further, the release of the information would provide an unfair advantage to local candidates competing for unique positions<span class="Italic">. DLA, Defense Gen. Supply Ctr. and AFGE Local 2047</span>, 37 FLRA 895, 906-08 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">Limited disclosure of components of a crediting plan was nonnegotiable, <span class="Italic">NTEU and USDA, Food Nutrition &#x0026; Consumer Serv.</span>, 68 FLRA 334, 336-37 (2015) (Proposal 2):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Wording</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Prior to the use of a crediting plan or similar rating guide the Employer will provide NTEU with specific notice of the plan/guide. However, once the plan/guide has been used and the Union so notified, the Employer is not required to notify the Union again unless there is a change in the plan. At the Employer's discretion, it may limit disclosure of the plan/guide to a face-to-face briefing, rather than describe it in any written notice. The Employer may withhold any test questions or answers if needed to protect the integrity of the test; however, it will reveal the number of points or other impact the test results could have on the overall assessment. Otherwise, the Union will be informed of the criteria to be assessed and the potential points or impact of each in the total assessment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Meaning</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties agree that, under this proposal, the Agency would have to notify the Union before using a "crediting plan or similar rating guide" to evaluate applicants for a merit promotion. A "crediting plan or rating guide" is the combination of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) required to successfully perform in a position; the job criteria for a position; and the weights to be used to evaluate whether a candidate possesses the KSAs. The meaning of a "crediting plan or rating guide" is taken from Authority precedent. Further, as part of its notification to the Union, the Agency would have to provide the Union with any criteria that it plans to use to assess applicants. The Agency could notify the Union in writing or orally in a face-to-face meeting. Moreover, the Agency would be required to give notice only when it uses a new crediting plan or rating guide, or changes an existing crediting plan or rating guide.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the proposal would require the Agency to inform the Union of the existence of tests that would be used and to explain how the tests would affect the application process. However, the Agency could withhold test questions and answers to protect the integrity of the test. The test questions and answers would have to be consistent with the Delegated Examining Operations Handbook, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) manual that establishes the types of tests and answers that may be used in the process covered by this proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusion: The proposal contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.201(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues, as relevant here, that the Union's proposal is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.201(c), which, according to the Agency, "expressly forbids the release of crediting plans." Section 300.201(c) states, "Each employee entrusted with test material has a positive duty to protect the confidentiality of that material and to assure release only as required to conduct an examination authorized by [OPM]." Also relevant is subsection (a), which states that OPM "does not release the following: (1) [t]esting and examination materials used solely to determine individual qualifications, and (2) test material, including test plans, item analysis data, criterion instruments, and other material the disclosure of which would compromise the objectivity of the testing process."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the proposal would permit the Agency to "withhold any test questions or answers if needed to protect the integrity of the test," &#x00A7; 300.201(c)'s prohibition on the release of "test materials" applies to more than just test questions and answers. Moreover, although it argues that "n[o]...law creates an absolute bar against the release of crediting plans," the Union does not specifically address the Agency's claim that &#x00A7; 300.201(c) bars the disclosure of crediting plans in its response.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the apparent conflict between the proposal and &#x00A7; 300.201(c), and in the absence of any argument to the contrary from the Union, we find that the proposal is contrary to government-wide regulation, and therefore outside the duty to bargain. Accordingly, we find it unnecessary to address the Agency's arguments that the proposal is "covered by" provisions of the parties' agreement or that the proposal interferes with its rights to hire and to select employees, under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2). Nor do we need to address the Union's argument that the proposal is a procedure or an appropriate arrangement, under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) or (3), respectively, because a provision that is contrary to law or government-wide regulation remains so regardless of whether it is a procedure or an appropriate arrangement.[38]</p>

In particular, the right to select encompasses management's right to determine the criteria by which it will assess the extent to which candidates possess the requisite qualifications, skills, and abilities, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Association of</span> <span class="Italic">Civilian Technicians, New York State Council and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau, State</span> <span class="Italic">of New York, Division of Military and Naval Affairs,</span> 45 FLRA 17, 20 (1992) <span class="Italic">(Division of Military and Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs), </span>and the weight to be given to those factors in any such assessment, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., American Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Local 31 and U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Wade Park Unit,</span> <span class="Italic">Cleveland, Ohio, </span>49 FLRA 957, 963 (1994) <span class="Italic">(VAMC,</span> <span class="Italic">Cleveland).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that prescribe the criteria to be used in assessing the extent to which candidates possess the requisite qualifications, skills, and abilities, and the weights to be given such factors, affect management's right to select. <span class="Italic">See Division of Military and Naval Affairs,</span> 45 FLRA at 20; <span class="Italic">VAMC, Dayton, </span>28 FLRA at 456. Management's right to take actions pursuant to section 7106(a) of the Statute includes the right to decide not to take such actions, and, therefore, proposals obligating an agency to use particular criteria and weights in determining the extent to which candidates possess the requisite qualifications run afoul of section 7106(a)(2)(C)<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3354 and U.S. Department of Agriculture,</span> <span class="Italic">Farm Services Agency, Kansas City Management</span> <span class="Italic">Office, </span>54 FLRA 807, 812 (1998). <span class="Italic">See also National</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1482 and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense, Defense Mapping Agency,</span> <span class="Italic">Hydrographic/Topographic Center, Louisville Office,</span> <span class="Italic">Louisville, Kentucky, </span>45 FLRA 52, 73-74 (1992) (proposal prescribing two criteria as the sole criteria governing selection directly interfere with management's right to select because it precludes management from "establishing additional or different criteria for the positions.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Conversely, proposals that prevent management from establishing particular assessment criteria and weights also affect management's right to select. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., American Federation of Government Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO, Local 1940 and Department of Agriculture,</span> <span class="Italic">Plum Island Disease Center, </span>16 FLRA 816, 823-24 (1984) (proposal prohibiting the establishment of promotion criteria that could not be satisfied by skills and knowledge normally acquired at lower grade levels directly interferes with right to select). Where a proposal preserves management's ability to act pursuant to a right under section 7106 of the Statute, however, it does not affect the exercise of the right. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923 and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Health</span> <span class="Italic">Care Financing Administration, Baltimore, Maryland,</span> 44 FLRA 1405, 1477 (1992) <span class="Italic">(HCFA) </span>(proposal requiring management to waive experience requirement where it is deemed appropriate preserves agency's ability to determine which employees meet qualifications for positions and does not directly interfere with management's right to select).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, where a proposal prescribes a particular selection criterion, but also provides management an option that preserves its right to select, the proposal does not affect the exercise of that right. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO and</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force Base, Ohio, </span>2 FLRA 604, 613 (1980), <span class="Italic">affirmed</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense v. FLRA, </span>659 F.2d 1140, 1161-62 (D.C. Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied, </span>455 U.S. 945 (1982) <span class="Italic">(Wright-Patterson) </span>(Proposal III providing for use of seniority as criterion to select candidates for assignment to a position, but allowing management to use competitive procedures instead, does not directly interfere with rights to assign and to select).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsections 5-13.a. and b. prescribe the criteria to be used in assessing the extent to which area I candidates possess the qualifications, skills, and abilities to perform the work of a position, and the weights to be given those factors. Subsections 5-13.a. and b. are modified by Subsection 5-13.c. As modified, the Agency would be able to establish its own alternative crediting plan, apply it to the same candidates' qualifications, and forward the results therefrom to the selecting official as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, under Section 5-13, even though management must use the prescribed crediting plan, in doing so, and in contrast to Proposal III in <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, it does not lose the ability to develop its own crediting plan and provide the selecting official with information about the candidates that reflects its own priorities. Because management could develop its own crediting plan, consistent with the disposition of Proposal III in <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson, </span>Section 5-13 would not affect management's right to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C)<span class="Italic">.
