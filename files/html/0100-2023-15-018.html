<p class="Body-Text">To prove AWOL, an agency must show by preponderant evidence that an employee was absent and that the absences were not authorized or that a request for leave was properly denied. <span class="Italic">Little v.

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 74 MSPR 648, 652 (1997), summarized the cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To support a charge of AWOL, an agency must show that the appellant was absent and that either the absence was unauthorized or that a request for leave was properly denied. <span class="Italic">See Cooke v. US Postal Service</span>, 67 MSPR 401, 404, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 73 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). If an appellant has sufficient sick leave to cover the period in question, the agency must grant the leave request where the appellant has provided administratively acceptable evidence of incapacitation due to illness or injury, regardless of whether the employee has complied with applicable leave procedures. <span class="Italic">See Riley v. Department of the Army</span>, 53 MSPR 683, 689, 689 n.4 (1992). <span class="Italic">See also Wade v. Department of the Navy,</span> 829 F.2d 1106, 1109 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Where an employee has exhausted all leave, an agency may deny leave without pay and place the employee on AWOL, where there is no foreseeable end to the employee's absence, and the absence is a burden to the agency. Under these circumstances, the Board will examine the record as a whole to determine if the denial was reasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Joyner v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 154, 159 (1993).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[Respondent] contends that the agency did not meet its burden of proof because its evidence failed to show that he was not conducting agency business during his absences from the office. Whittlesey suggests that there are many possible legitimate reasons for absence from the office, such as library research, reviewing files in other OHA offices, and discussions off-premises with SSA claimants' attorneys. However, respondent has not contended that he requested or received approval to conduct business away from his official duty station. Such approval is implicitly required by the agency's rule requiring him to work an eight-hour day and to record his comings and goings on a register.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserted that, from November 1 to December 3, 1993, each appellant left work prior to the end of his duty day without charges to leave, with 16 specifications as to Kratz, and 18 as to Avant....&#8197;Instead, the appellants claimed that they were on compensatory time; that they were, in addition, keeping a "mental running total" of compensatory time they had earned within the last six months or so; and that this type of recordkeeping was condoned by their first-line supervisor, Miller.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no error in the administrative judge's sustaining of this charge, based on the notes of the month-long surveillance conducted by the two AFOSI agents and on the appellants' admissions that they left work prior to the end of their shifts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the appellants' claim that they were on unofficial undocumented compensatory time, we note that it is well settled that where absence during work hours is shown, the burden is on the appellant to show that it was authorized. <span class="Italic">See Office of Hearings and</span> <span class="Italic">Appeals, Social Security Administration v.

The administrative judge correctly found no record evidence that either appellant was on any official or approved flexible work schedule that would permit a "pattern of unsubstantiated and undocumented absenteeism." We also find that despite the apparent condonation by Miller, the appellants knew or should have known that their practice of leaving early was not permissible. Accordingly, we find no error in the administrative judge's ruling that Miller's failure of supervision did not extenuate the appellants' "wholesale leave abuse."</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If the agency establishes that an employee should have teleworked under agency continuity of operations regulations during the pandemic and did not, the resultant AWOL-based removal can be sustained, <span class="Italic">Carter v. DOD</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before her removal, Ms. Carter was an Acquisition and Financial Support Specialist with Defense's Office of Net Assessment (ONA). In March 2020 and in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic, Ms. Carter was authorized for "Weather and Safety Leave." Keith Walters, chief of staff for ONA, subsequently informed her that she could not remain on leave throughout the pandemic and arranged for her to telework--i.e., provided a laptop, network-access, a detailed outline of her duties and responsibilities, and necessary teleworking resources and training. Ms. Carter, however, did not respond to Mr. Walters nor otherwise attempt to telework.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 8, 2020, Mr. Walters notified her that she needed to complete required telework training no later than December 15, 2020, explained that she was required to begin teleworking on January 4, 2021, and stated that she was permitted to take some of her "197 hours of use/lose leave" but was not authorized to take administrative leave. Ms. Carter responded to Mr. Walters the same day, stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Please stop asking about telework. Talk with Col Regan (prior chief of staff), my supervisor and you, I am no longer interest in telework agreement. Do not schedule annual leave. I am already on weather and safety leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next day, Mr. Walters issued a written memorandum notifying her that, effective January 4, 2021, she would not be authorized for Weather and Safety Leave, and would be required to report for duty via telework on that date pursuant to Defense's continuity of operations plan. The memorandum again instructed her to complete the required telework training and informed her that failure to follow the procedures outlined in the notice would result in disciplinary action up to and including removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Carter did not complete the required training or begin telework in accordance with Mr. Walters's memorandum email instructions. Consequently, Mr. Walters informed her on January 12, 2021, that she was absent without leave (AWOL), retroactive as of January 4, 2021, the date upon which she was to begin teleworking. Since Ms. Carter did not report for duty until February 4, 2021, her records reflected her AWOL status from January 4 through February 3, 2021.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 7, 2021, Defense issued a "Notice of Proposed Removal" based on: (1) AWOL charges, with 21 supporting specifications corresponding to each day she did not report for telework duty, and (2) failure to follow instruction charges, with 23 supporting specifications corresponding to instructions to request approval for leave and to complete required telework training. Ms. Carter provided a written response on April 15, 2021, and Defense issued a final decision on May 21, 2021,5 ordering her removal effective June 4, 2021. Ms. Carter retired instead.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 21, 2021, Ms. Carter appealed her removal to the Board. On October 28, 2021, an administrative judge issued an initial decision on her appeal, which became the Board's final decision when she did not petition for Board review within 35 days. The Board found that Defense proved all of the charged misconduct by a preponderance of the evidence. The Board rejected Ms. Carter's argument that Defense had no authority to <span id="Page_2453"></span>compel her to telework, noting that Defense's written policies provided the necessary authorization. The Board also rejected Ms. Carter's assertion that she did not receive notice to telework until February 3, 2021, as "incredible." The Board found that it was "highly improbable" that Ms. Carter did not receive any of Mr. Walters many communications about the telework requirement via memorandum, phone calls, and email "as she had no problem communicating with him using these methods prior to December 8, 2020." Instead, the Board found it was "probable that [Ms. Carter] simply refused to engage in any further conversations or communications with [Mr. Walters] regarding telework."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board then concluded that Defense established the requisite nexus between Ms. Carter's actions and efficiency of service. The Board reasoned that her AWOL status, which "by its very nature, disrupts the efficiency of the service," and "failure to follow instructions affect[ed] the agency's ability to carry out its mission." Lastly, the Board reviewed Defense's consideration of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, and concluded that Defense did not abuse its discretion in removing her from federal service as the penalty for her conduct. The Board, therefore, affirmed Ms. Carter's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency must establish three things when it takes an adverse action against an employee: (1) that, by a preponderance of the evidence, the charged conduct occurred; (2) that there is a nexus between the conduct and efficiency of the service; and (3) that the penalty imposed was reasonable. <span class="Italic">Bryant v. Nat'l Sci. Found</span>., 105 F.3d 1414, 1416 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Carter contends that Defense lacked legal authority to remove her for being AWOL from telework duty or for failing to follow instructions to telework because, under the Telework Enhancement Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6501 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. (TEA), she was not eligible for and could not be compelled to telework. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The TEA requires government agencies to establish telework policies, determine telework eligibility, notify agency employees of their eligibility, provide teleworking training to eligible employees, and treat teleworkers no differently than non-teleworkers. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6502(a), 6503(a). Before eligible employees participate in telework, the agency must enter into a written telework agreement with the eligible employee that "outlines the specific work arrangement that is agreed to." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 6502(b). Such teleworking policies and agreements notwithstanding, the TEA also requires agencies to "incorporate telework into the continuity of operations plan of that agency," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 6504(d)(1), "supersed[ing] any telework policy" "during any period that an executive agency is operating under a continuity of operations plan," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 6504(d)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board correctly noted that, under established Defense policy, Defense employees typically cannot be ordered to telework unless their duties are designated mission-critical. Dep't of Defense, Instruction 1035.01, <span class="Italic">Telework Policy</span>, Enclosure 3 &#x00A7; 2(f) (Apr. 7, 2020) (<span class="Italic">Telework Policy</span>) ("Although use of telework is encouraged, employees cannot be ordered to telework, unless the employee's duties are designated as mission-critical and the employee is required to report to an alternative worksite or the employee's telework agreement addresses this requirement."); U.S. Off. of Pers. Mgmt., 2021 Guide to Telework and Remote Work in the Federal Government, at 14 (Nov. 2021) ("[T]he Act does not obligate an employee to participate in an agency telework program. Accordingly, employee participation in a telework program is voluntary.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Ms. Carter's duties were not designated mission-critical, the Board correctly found that, in light of the novel coronavirus pandemic, Defense had authority to require her to telework pursuant to its continuity of operation (COOP) policies. Defense's COOP policies "supersede the telework policy" and provide that employees not normally eligible for telework may nonetheless be required to telework during a pandemic:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Employees who are telework-ready (i.e., approved and equipped for routine or situational telework) who are not able to report to their assigned office location due to a government closure from a natural or manmade emergency event (e.g., snow emergency, flood, hurricane, earthquake, wild fire, act of terrorism, pandemic) will telework each regularly scheduled work day during the emergency situation. Contingent upon supervisory approval, telework-ready employees may telework when government offices are open with the option for unscheduled telework when weather conditions make commuting hazardous, or similar circumstances compromise employee safety. During any period that a WHS-serviced Component is operating under the COOP plan, that plan will supersede the telework policy and the provisions of the telework agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">* * *</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the event of a pandemic health crisis, employees with COOP responsibilities, Service members, and employees who do not have COOP responsibilities but are trained and equipped to telework may be asked to telework to prevent the spread of germs. These employees or Service members should telework on a regular basis to ensure their proficiency and telework's effectiveness in continuing operations. Employees or Service members in positions not typically eligible for telework should telework on a situational basis when feasible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dep't of Defense, Dir. of Admin. &#x0026; Mgmt., Admin. Instruction 117, <span class="Italic">Telework Program</span>, Enclosure 3 &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8(f), (g)(3) (Mar. 31, 2015) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Appx. 157-58, <span class="Italic">Telework Policy</span>, Enclosure 3 &#x00A7; 3(i)(1)-(2) ("During any period that a Component is operating under the COOP plan, that plan shall supersede the telework policy and the provisions of the telework agreement....In the event of a pandemic health crisis,...Employees or Service members in positions not typically eligible for telework should telework on a situational basis when feasible."). Ms. Carter admits that the novel coronavirus pandemic affected Defense's operations, and she does not challenge the validity of Defense's COOP policies regarding emergency telework. Moreover, Defense's COOP policies are consistent with &#x00A7; 6504(d)(1) and (2) of the TEA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board further observed that, consistent with agency policy, Defense initiated a continuity of operations plan in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic and provided Ms. Carter with the necessary equipment (i.e., laptop) and opportunities for training to work from her home (i.e., an approved location for Ms. Carter to perform work) so that she could telework on a situational basis. After many months passed in which Ms. Carter declined requests to consider teleworking, she was instructed to commence telework on January 4, 2021, and there is no dispute that she refused to and did not do so until February 4, 2021. In view of this evidence, the Board's finding that Defense demonstrated by preponderance of evidence that Ms. Carter was AWOL from January 4 through February 3, 2021, and failed to follow instructions to report for telework duty was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding nexus, our review is limited by statute to whether the Board's affirmance meets the statutory criteria. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c). We hold in this case that it does.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's AWOL status, "by its very nature, disrupts the efficiency of the service," and is therefore a proper basis for removal. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Veterans Admin</span>., 792 F.2d 1111, 1113 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (holding that "any sustained charge of AWOL is inherently connected to the efficiency of the service"); <span class="Italic">see also Bryant</span>, 105 F.3d at 1417 (noting that, since Davis, "both this court and the Board have routinely held that the nexus between the charged offense and the efficiency of the service is automatic when the charged offense is AWOL"). Additionally, there is a direct relationship between service efficiency and an agency's rules and regulations regarding attendance and authorized absences because an employee's failure to follow such instructions inherently affects the agency's ability to carry out its mission. Accordingly, the Board did not err in concluding that Defense established the requisite nexus between Ms. Carter's AWOL and failure to follow actions and the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, we are satisfied that the removal penalty selected by Defense, as affirmed by the Board, was supported by substantial evidence and was not an abuse of discretion or violation of law. The record in this case establishes that both Defense and the Board properly considered the relevant aggravating factors based on Ms. Carter's failure to report for telework duty and mitigating factors based on her prior, satisfactory performance record. Moreover, Defense specifically "considered the consistency of the penalty with that imposed upon other employees for the same offense and the adequacy of alternative sanctions to deter future misconduct," noting that "[o]ther employees have been removed for AWOL and Failure or Delay in Carrying Out Written Regulations, Orders, Rules, Procedures, or Instructions." In view of this evidence, we cannot say that the Ms. Carter's removal is so "outrageously disproportionate" to the offense as to constitute an abuse of discretion or violation of law. <span class="Italic">See Yeschick v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 801 F.2d 383, 384-85 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee claims that she is not fit for duty because of illness, the employee is obligated to prove the leave entitlement.

The agency need not request the information directly from the doctor. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goens v. Dept. of Army</span>, 40 MSPR 456, 461 (1989).
