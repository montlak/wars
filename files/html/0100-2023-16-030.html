<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-31"><span class="space">12.</span> Multi-Unit/Employer Bargaining</h4>
<p class="noindent">The public interest is served if an agency with two or more unions exclusively representing separate units of employees voluntarily enter into a multi-unit arrangement to negotiate over conditions of employment in the various units. Matters of common concern can be addressed in a setting allowing a more efficient use of resources while promoting agreement on conditions of employment of larger numbers of employees. Withdrawal from a multi-unit or multi-employer arrangement must be done prior to commencement of multi-unit negotiations over the conditions of employment at issue. Withdrawal may occur only if there is mutual consent by the affected parties or if unusual circumstances exist after negotiations have begun. The stability of voluntarily established labor-management relationships is preserved as each party at the level of exclusive recognition retains the right in appropriate circumstances to require negotiations at that level respecting conditions of employment affecting unit employees. <span class="Italic">INS and AFGE, Nat'l INS Council</span>, 16 FLRA 80, 85-86 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">When parties engage in bargaining involving consolidated units, care must be taken to respect the appropriate levels of recognition and delegations of bargaining authority. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 39 FLRA 1409, 1427-28 (1991) (ALJ Decision), declined to find a ULP for an agency refusal to bargain when the request for negotiations came from a local that was not delegated authority to request negotiations from its parent union. <span class="Italic">VA Consol. Mail Outpatient Pharmacy and AFGE Local 2437</span>, 60 FLRA 109, 110-11 (2004), reviewing an arbitration award, determined that higher-level levels with bargaining authority for the organization bind lower level components in the same organization.</p>
<p class="noindent">The bargaining obligation is between the exclusive representative and the agency for the unit of recognition. Bargaining arrangements that modify the central bargaining relationship are permissive. The agency cannot force a union to conclude more than one contract for the unit of recognition, despite possible organizational advantages to the agency to split the unit up. When an agency attempted to force the union to subdivide the unit of recognition by negotiating two contracts rather than one agreement for the unit, FLRA determined that the agency negotiated in bad faith and ordered a remedy, <span class="Italic">FDA and AFGE Council 242</span>, 53 FLRA 1269, 1273-80 (1998), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 54 FLRA 630 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the obligation to bargain concerning employee's "conditions of employment," the parties to a collective bargaining relationship may also negotiate over a wide range of "permissive" subjects. <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Headquarters and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 18 FLRA 768, 771 (1985) (<span class="Italic">FDIC</span>). As the name implies, parties may, but are not required to, bargain over permissive subjects. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. While parties are free to make proposals over permissive subjects, they may not insist to impasse on such proposals<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Permissive subjects of bargaining include subjects that are not conditions of employment, as well as proposals that a party negotiate to limit a right granted to it by the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Locals 225, 1504, and 3723 v. FLRA</span>, 712 F.2d 640, 646 n.27 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>). For example, in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> the Authority held that a proposal that would have required a union to waive its right to utilize statutory impasse proceedings was permissive. In contrast, the court in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> held that the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure is a mandatory subject of bargaining, because the grievance procedure is a condition of employment and the statute does not indicate that a union had a right to a broad scope grievance procedure. 712 F.2d at 646.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the courts and the Authority have also limited the parties' mandatory bargaining obligation, holding that a party is only required to negotiate with the certified exclusive representative and agency, respectively. For example, a representative with a collective bargaining relationship in a consolidated bargaining unit is not required to bargain locally with individual components that make up the consolidated unit unless such bargaining has been agreed to at the consolidated level. <span class="Italic">DHHS</span>, 6 FLRA at 204; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, National Border Patrol Council, 2366, AFL-CIO v. FLRA</span>, 114 F.3d 1214, 1218-19 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (<span class="Italic">Border Patrol);</span> The fact that the parties to a consolidated unit are not required to bargain locally does not, however, foreclose such bargaining if both parties desire to engage in it. <span class="Italic">DHHS</span>, 6 FLRA at 204 n.2. Parties to a national, consolidated bargaining unit may, and often do, authorize local components to bargain supplemental and other agreements over particular subjects or in particular circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, International Council of U.S. Marshals Service Locals and Department of Justice, U.S. <span id="Page_1255"></span>Marshals Service</span>, 11 FLRA 672, 679 (1983). Local negotiation is, therefore, a permissive subject of bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's precedent on this subject parallels the law in the private sector. In <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Wooster Division of</span> <span class="Italic">Borg-Warner Corp</span>, 356 U.S. 342 (1958) (<span class="Italic">Borg-Warner</span>), the Supreme Court held that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to demand that a collective bargaining agreement be consummated between it and a local union, rather than the certified international union. The Court explained that the employer's proposal that a party other than the certified exclusive representative sign the agreement did not relate to the working conditions of employees. As such, it was an unfair labor practice for the employer to insist on its proposal to the point of impasse in negotiations, disrupting the bargaining process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Respondent has proposed that it negotiate two separate collective bargaining agreements with the Union, reflecting its determination that the two agency regions which bargaining unit employees are assigned to are separate "employers"....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither the parties' arguments nor the Judge's analysis, however, specifically address whether a proposal for two collective bargaining agreements is a permissive or mandatory subject of bargaining. In failing to address this issue, the decision ignores the basic principle that a "party is free...not to bargain" about nonmandatory subjects. <span class="Italic">Borg-Warner</span>, 356 U.S. at 349; <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Pennsylvania</span> <span class="Italic">Telephone Guild</span>, 799 F.2d 84, 89 (3d Cir. 1986). If the Respondent's proposal for two contracts is a permissive subject of bargaining, then the Union has the right to simply refuse to discuss the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the court noted in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, permissive subjects of bargaining are generally linked to "unilateral rights specifically vested in one party." 712 F.2d at 646. These unilateral rights may be specifically spelled out in the Statute, as they are in section 7106(b)(1), where permissive bargaining over particular subjects is linked to management's right to act unilaterally over these subjects. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Unilateral rights may also be rooted in more general statutory and policy consideration, as in the rule in both the private and federal sectors that the tape recording of bargaining is a permissive subject and parties have a unilateral right to refuse to tape record bargaining sessions. <span class="Italic">See Sport Air</span> <span class="Italic">Traffic Controllers Organization and Air Force Flight Test</span> <span class="Italic">Center, Edwards Air Force Base, California</span>, 52 FLRA 339, 345-46 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Sport Air); NLRB v. Bartlett-Collins Co.</span>, 639 F.2d 652, 656-57 (10th Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> 452 U.S. 961 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this analysis, if a proposal for more than one collective bargaining agreement is a permissive subject, then the party receiving the proposal has a unilateral right to negotiate one contract. We hold that the Respondent's proposal to negotiate separate agreements within one bargaining unit is a permissive subject of bargaining, because the Statute provides exclusive representatives a right to negotiate with "an agency." In short, the case law and the Statute indicate that there are certain features of collective bargaining that any party may rely on. One such feature is that the basic bargaining relationship is between one union and one employer. This principle is grounded in the Statute, in which "collective bargaining" occurs between "an agency" and "the exclusive representative." 5 USC 7103(a)(12), 7114(a)(1), (b). This principle and statutory terminology support our prior holding in <span class="Italic">DHHS</span> that parties may not be required to bargain below the certified "level of recognition" and, more generally, support a conclusion that the representative and agency may not be forced to negotiate with the other party in a form other than as a single party.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The principle that the exclusive representative and agency are each a single party dictates that neither has a right to turn itself into two parties and demand separate negotiations.&#x2003;Rather, both the agency and the exclusive representative have a unilateral right to demand that they negotiate with each other as one entity. Variations on this right may be proposed, but they are permissive, not mandatory, variations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent asserts that its two regional offices constitute two "employers" who must be permitted to bargain separately and it urges that the Authority adopt a "concept of multi-employer." As noted above, the bargaining obligation under the statute applies to "an agency." 5 USC 7114. We are not persuaded that the Statute or other reasons support the right of an agency to create separate employers within one designated agency representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of course, executive agencies are routinely divided into separate "agencies" for purposes of collective bargaining. The bargaining relationship attaches to certified representatives of "appropriate bargaining units," and a particular agency, such as FDA, will routinely contain a number of certified bargaining units. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7112(a). However, Congress had clearly directed that appropriate unit determinations are made by the Authority, not unilaterally by an agency, and must be based on a determination that there is a community of interest among the employees, as well as a finding that collective bargaining by a particular group will serve the efficiency of operation and effective dealings of the Respondent<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an agency believes that elements of its organizational structure make collective bargaining between a recognized union and the designated agency representative inappropriate, its recourse is not to refuse to bargain in its certified form. Rather, it may file a petition seeking to clarify the recognized bargaining unit. 5 USC 7112(d). The Respondent has taken that step, and its argument that collective bargaining is inappropriate between the Charging Party and these two offices was rejected by the Authority in <span class="Italic">Health and Human Services</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's argument here is, in effect, an attack on the validity of the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Health and</span> <span class="Italic">Human Services</span> that bargaining in this unit is appropriate. It has not, however, asserted that case was incorrectly decided or provided any reason that we should overturn this precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the principle that the parties are required to bargain only with the organization having representative status dictates that the union and the agency are each one party, with the right to bargain with the other party. The Respondent may not unilaterally dictate that it is, in fact, two employers who will only negotiate two contracts. A party may propose two parallel sets of negotiations and two parallel contracts, but it may not insist on this format and create an impasse in bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With these principles in mind, it is necessary to examine the record to determine whether the evidence indicates that the Respondent has violated its duty to bargain in good faith by insisting on bargaining two contracts and creating an impasse in negotiations. We find that it has.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has recognized that the concept of "impasse" may have somewhat different meanings in different contexts. <span class="Italic">Sport Air</span>, 52 FLRA at 349. In <span class="Italic">Sport Air</span>, we adopted the Judge's holding that an impasse on a permissive subject of bargaining "describes a situation where a party insists on its position on such a subject as a precondition to bargaining<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 349, <span class="Italic">citing, Latrobe Steel Co. v. NLRB</span>, 630 F.2d 171, 179 (3d. Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">see also 375th Combat</span> <span class="Italic">Support Group, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois</span>, 46 FLRA 640, 666 (1992) (proposals that are designed to impede negotiation violate the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record demonstrates that the Respondent insisted on its permissive proposal that there be two separate agreements in a manner that operated as a precondition to bargaining.&#x2003;The Charging Party attempted to initiate bargaining with the Respondent in 1991, 1993, and 1994. The bargaining requests for 1991 and 1994, which are in the record, are similar and each contained over 30 issues that the Charging Party wished to negotiate. In both 1991 and 1993, Respondent answered the Charging Party's request with separate letters from the two Regions at issue, indicating that separate bargaining would take place. In 1994, the Respondent simply provided the Charging Party with a copy of one of its 1993 letters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The course of dealing between these parties indicates that Respondent conditioned negotiation of the substantive issues suggested by the Charging Party on the conduct of separate negotiations for the two offices and that, in fact, this issue prevented substantive negotiations. As the Charging Party did not have an obligation to compromise on this permissive issue, Respondent's position operated as a precondition to bargaining, and created an impasse under the standard set out in <span class="Italic">Sport Air</span>. The Respondent's actions thus violated its duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To remedy this violation of the Statute, we order the Agency to bargain one collective bargaining agreement with the Union. In addition, the General Counsel proposes that the Authority order that an agreement reached between the parties be retroactively applied and that the Agency be ordered to begin bargaining within 30 days.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has imposed retroactive bargaining orders (RBOs) where an agency has refused to bargain over a specific proposal that had previously been found within the duty to bargain and where an agency refused to incorporate an interest arbitration award into a contract. <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance</span> <span class="Italic">Corporation</span>, 40 FLRA 775, 784 (1991) (<span class="Italic">FDIC); see also Pueblo</span> <span class="Italic">Depot Activity, Pueblo, Colorado</span>, 50 FLRA 310, 312 (1995) (RBO ordered where bargaining more appropriate than compliance proceeding to determine past overtime lost). The Authority has not ruled out an RBO in other types of cases. In this or similar cases, if the agency knew or should have known that its actions constituted an unfair labor practice, an RBO may be appropriate. The Authority's precedent regarding insistence on bargaining over permissive areas to impasse was clear, but its application to the Agency's proposal regarding multiple contracts in this case was not so obvious as to serve as the basis for finding that the Agency knew or should have known that its actions were unlawful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In connection with the evaluation of the propriety of an RBO, the Authority has held that this remedy did not "promote an effective relationship between the parties" in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, where an entire contract was to be negotiated and there was a "new bargaining relationship<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. The <span id="Page_1256"></span>Authority recently adopted a Judge's decision that applied this precedent and refused an RBO in a contract reopener situation, as in this case, <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona</span>, 53 FLRA 445 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no particular indication that an RBO would "promote an effective relationship" in this case. The Union has sought to reopen some 30 articles of the contract and has not made specific proposals on each article. Without any further information, it appears just as likely that a requirement that any agreement be retroactive would hamper agreement as that it would facilitate it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the request that bargaining begin within 30 days, the General Counsel has not demonstrated that this remedy is reasonably necessary to redress the respondent's unlawful conduct and that it would effectuate the policies of the Statute, including the deterrence of future violations<span class="Italic">. F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming</span>, 52 FLRA 149, 160 (1996). The Authority expects that the Agency will fully comply with the order to bargain. Any failure in this regard may be addressed to the Regional Office as a compliance matter.</p>
<p class="noindent">The decision denying reconsideration, <span class="Italic">FDA and AFGE Council 242</span>, 54 FLRA 630, 638-40 (1998), added as to the FDA argument that its situation was analogous to a "multi-employer" entitled to negotiate separate contracts:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's position is premised on a fundamental misconception about the nature of multi-employer bargaining in the private sector and under <span class="Italic">INS</span>. In the private sector, multi-employer bargaining units are established as voluntary associations of independent employers or unions that join together for purposes of collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">See</span> Hardin, <span class="Italic">Developing Labor Law</span> 511 (3d Ed. 1992). The Respondent's bargaining unit at issue here, however, is not a voluntarily created association of employers or unions. Rather, it was created in 1979 as a consolidation of several districts represented by the same Union within Respondent's "New York Field Office." <span class="Italic">DHHS</span>, 48 FLRA at 1010. This consolidation did not create a multi-employer bargaining unit; it created a single bargaining unit comprised of all employees of a single field office. Respondent's decision to reorganize its field structure in 1987 does not change the initial character of this bargaining unit and transform it into a "multi-employer" unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondent's bargaining unit and bargaining history also differ in critical respects from the situation presented in <span class="Italic">INS</span>, where the Authority adopted multi-employer principles analogous to those used in the private sector. In <span class="Italic">INS</span>, the agency and two AFGE Councils representing separate bargaining units within INS had a history of negotiating a single contract for both bargaining units. Renegotiation of this contract halted because a "question concerning representation (QCR)" arose involving one of the Councils. The Authority held that INS was not obligated to continue bargaining with the second Council, in which there was no pending QCR. The Authority held that parties to a "multi-unit or multi-employer" bargaining arrangement may unilaterally withdraw from the arrangement prior to the commencement of bargaining, but may only withdraw during bargaining with the consent of all parties. As bargaining had commenced and INS had not consented to dissolve the multi-unit arrangement and bargain separately with the second Council, that second Council could not unilaterally end the bargaining arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent analogizes its situation to <span class="Italic">INS</span>, asserting that it is seeking to withdraw from "multi-employer" bargaining prior to the commencement of negotiations. The flaw in the Respondent's position is that the Respondent's prior bargaining arrangement did not involve a critical feature of multi-employer bargaining under <span class="Italic">INS</span>: "multi-unit negotiations." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 16 FLRA at 85. The employees in this case are all included in a single, consolidated bargaining unit, not a voluntary association of separate bargaining units.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the underlying rationale of the <span class="Italic">INS</span> decision demonstrates that, although employers and unions may choose to enter into combinations of units or employers for bargaining, they retain the right to withdraw from such arrangements and bargain separately. <span class="Italic">INS</span> preserved multi-unit arrangements, "while ensuring that each of the parties at the level of exclusive recognition retains the right in appropriate circumstances to require negotiations at [the unit] level with respect to conditions of employment affecting the bargaining unit employees." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, rather than support the position of the Respondent, <span class="Italic">INS</span> confirms the basic holding of this case--that parties have a right to "require negotiations" at the level of exclusive recognition. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, there has been and remains only one bargaining unit in the Respondent's two regions and the Union may "require" negotiations "at that level."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather than disengage from a multi-employer bargaining arrangement, the Respondent here is attempting to, in effect, unilaterally split one unit into separate units. Unilateral action of this sort is not permitted. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Boise Cascade Corporation v. NLRB</span>, 860 F.2d 471, 475 (D.C. Cir. 1988) ("[o]nce an appropriate bargaining unit has been established, the statutory interest in stability and certainty in bargaining obligations requires adherence to that unit" and the unit may not be unilaterally modified).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's argument that its refusal to bargain one contract is supported by principles of multi-employer bargaining.</p>
