<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-35"><span class="space">b.</span> Ruling on Discovery</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Only in exceptional instances will administrative orders involving discovery of documents warrant judicial intervention before the final agency decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Chatterton</span>, 515 F.2d 916, 921 (3d Cir. 1975) (civil service case predating the Reform Act, but the result would remain the same after enactment of <span id="Page_5196"></span>that legislation). In judicial review of a Board decision on the merits, Board discovery orders will not be upset without a showing of abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro v. FAA</span>, 807 F.2d 169, 173 (Fed. Cir. 1986), discussing discovery in a compliance dispute, determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to discovery, the board accords broad discretion to its presiding officials. 5 C.F.R. Sec. 1201.41 (1982). Absent a showing of abuse of such discretion, the board will not substitute its judgment for that of the presiding official with respect to discovery. 29 M.S.P.R. at 414. No abuse of discretion was found by the board in this case. The board found that the requested documents would shed no light on the accuracy or fairness of the agency's selected method of calculating overtime as approved by the Comptroller General. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court's standard of review of MSPB decisions is established by statute. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7703(c) (1982). A board decision must be sustained unless found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, or unsupported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Department of the Navy,</span> 727 F.2d 1535 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In procedural matters such as discovery or an attempt to reopen a record, as here, the discretion accorded to the board and its officials must be shown to have been abused. That is not established here nor has bad faith by the agency been shown. We do not decide what this court would have done on the discovery issue had it been trying the case. We do not second-guess the trial tribunal on procedures except where the abuse of discretion is clear and harmful or where exceptional circumstances are present which fall within the terms of section 7703(c). <span class="Italic">See Bowman Transportation v. Arkansas-Best Freight System,</span> 419 U.S. 281, 95 S. Ct. 438, 42 L. Ed.2d 447 (1974); <span class="Italic">City of Wausau v. United States,</span> 703 F.2d 1042, 1044 (7th Cir. 1983). Government officials are presumed to carry out their duties in good faith. Petitioners have not provided any credible evidence to overcome that presumption. Unsubstantiated suspicions and allegations are not enough. The proof must be almost "irrefragable." <span class="Italic">Sanders v. United States Postal Service,</span> 801 F.2d 1328, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 772 F.2d 887, 889 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Department of the Navy,</span> 727 F.2d 1535, 1537 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Poschl v. United States,</span> 206 Ct. Cl. 672, 692 (1975).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a dispute over discovery, the court explained that "[t]he AJ was in a much better position than we are to determine the relevance of the requested discovery and proposed testimony and to judge the potential for repetition and undue delay." <span class="Italic">Irish v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 92-3368); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. SSA</span>, 529 F.3d 189 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (examining challenges to an AJ's discovery rulings under a standard of abuse of discretion). One case applied the harmful error doctrine to discovery denials. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">The requirement to show harm can be a real problem for an employee, who may be at a loss to show how the result would have been different had he obtained evidence that he never received, and who cannot evaluate the impact of its absence on the outcome of the appeal.

<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Becker v. OPM</span>, 853 F.3d 1311, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2017), proof of harm was required to show an AJ's erroneous treatment of discovery:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">According to Ms. Becker, the Board improperly refused her discovery into instances in which OPM may have waived the nine-month requirement under &#x00A7; 8441(1)--instances she hoped would supply a predicate for a claim of arbitrary enforcement. But Ms. Becker had no basis to request this discovery as she had no reasonable belief that any such instances occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> Oral Argument at 10:28-12:11, <a href="http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=2016-1365.mp3">http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=2016-1365.mp3</a> (only "heard" that OPM had waived nine-month requirement in the past, but had "no inside information" and it "[was not] something that [she] could verify"). Moreover, even if OPM had provided survivor benefits in other instances where the statute barred it from doing so, OPM was still required to follow the statutory requirements when reviewing Ms. Becker's application. <span class="Italic">See Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 424-26 (1990) (explaining that equitable doctrine of estoppel cannot be used to access funds that Congress has not authorized). We see no abuse of discretion in denying this discovery request.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reviewing court may conduct a more searching examination of the discovery dispute. The Federal Circuit provided a more incisive discussion of the relation between the discovery sought and the issues presented in <span class="Italic">Anthony v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2624):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official... denied Ms. Anthony's motion to compel the agency to produce "all placement actions.... " In the estimation of the presiding official, Ms. Anthony had not adequately shown that the information she sought was reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence pursuant to 5 CFR 1201.72(a). The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure serve as a general guide for discovery practice in proceedings before the Board... and by their instruction we observe that the presiding official has broad discretion in the control of discovery.... &#8197;We hold the presiding official acted within his discretion in denying the discovery request when the relevance of the personnel records of other employees was not adequately shown. It should be noted that the charges against Ms. Anthony were that she made critical mistakes in administering medication, whereas the discovery appears to be directed in some way to her transfer, during her probationary period, from the surgical ward to the obstetrical ward.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court took a less charitable view of the Board's supervision of discovery in <span class="Italic">Batey v. DMA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 92-3570). Appellant contested a RIF through an appeal challenging the authority of an agency official to conduct the RIF. Appellant's counsel requested the AJ to compel the agency to produce documentation establishing the authority to conduct the RIF. Rather than ordering the agency to produce the documents, the AJ deferred the issue of authority to the hearing. The AJ apparently required no documents but instead looked to OPM guidance and certain testimony of agency officials concerning the authority to institute the RIF. The AJ affirmed the RIF. When the employee filed a PFR, the agency responded by supplying its RIF regulations to the Board. The court found the Board's treatment of the evidentiary problem wanting and remanded the case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">... Certain propositions in American jurisprudence are self-evident, among them the proposition that the right to a hearing means the right to a fair hearing. This case was tried before an AJ who expressly reserved the issue of Major Quinn's authority for decision at trial. DMA before and during the trial had in its possession documentary evidence undeniably germane to a fair and correct decision on the authority question. DMA refused to disclose that documentary evidence to Batey and the AJ. Batey is thus entitled to proper discovery and a fair hearing on the issue of Major Quinn's authority to instigate the RIF.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Baird v. Dept. of Army</span>, 517 F.3d 1345, 1350-51 (Fed. Cir. 2008), remanded an appeal to the Board when the court concluded that the AJ erred by refusing to require the agency to comply with discovery requests for emails that may have contained communications showing that the adverse action decisional process was subject to inappropriate control at a level higher than the deciding official:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record demonstrates that virtually the whole discussion within the Agency concerning the punishment for Baird, and who ordered it, took place in email messages. The record before us also demonstrates clearly that the Agency did not comply with the discovery requests made on it to deliver all pertinent email messages. The need for full discovery of all <span id="Page_5197"></span>relevant email related to Baird's case is beyond question. Sauer's close relationship in rank serving under DeRuvo further emphasizes the need for full disclosure from his files, as well as from the files of all the other Agency personnel involved in Baird's case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Against Baird's argument that the Board erred in denying discovery of Sauer's archived emails, the Agency's brief to this court comes up lame. Rather than deal head-on with the Agency's undeniable noncompliance with Baird's early email discovery request, the Agency merely states that the administrative judge was within his sound discretion in refusing to permit additional discovery during the pendency of the hearing. The Agency fails to explain why it did not comply fully with Baird's discovery requests before the hearings began.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, Baird chose, as she was free to do, not to seek review of the administrative judge's decision by the full Board. The full Board therefore had no occasion in this case to consider the failure of the Agency to have complied with Baird's relevant discovery requests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has stated that "[d]iscovery is the process by which a party may obtain relevant information from another party to an appeal." <span class="Italic">McGrath v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 48, 51 (1999). Discovery in proceedings before the Board is provided pursuant to the Board's regulations. A party to whom a proper discovery request has been made must either comply or "stat[e] an objection to the particular request and the reasons for the objection." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(c)(1). The scope of discovery is broad: "[d]iscovery covers any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to the issues involved in the appeal...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1201.72(b). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(4), the administrative judge has broad discretion in ruling on discovery matters. The Board, however, has not hesitated to insist on proper compliance with legitimate discovery requests, and it often finds abuse of discretion by administrative judges who fail to enforce compliance with the Board's regulations concerning discovery requests. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 494 (2000); <span class="Italic">Gregory v. Fed. Commc'ns Comm'n</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 563 (1998); <span class="Italic">Beam v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 629 (1996); <span class="Italic">McCray v. Dep't of Def.</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 186 (M.S.P.B. 1995); <span class="Italic">Kiser v. Dep't of Educ.</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 372 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there can be no doubt that Sauer's email, and perhaps the email of others not yet disclosed to Baird, is relevant to Baird's theory of the case. Early in the proceedings, Baird made her discovery requests. Under the applicable regulations, the Agency was required either to satisfy the discovery requests or object to them. The Agency did not object to production, and the Agency did not timely respond to Baird's request for all relevant email documents. With respect to Sauer, the record shows that the Agency only raised the issue of emails with Sauer the day before his appearance at the hearing. The Agency's stated objection to production of Sauer's email--that the request came during the hearing--should have been rejected by the administrative judge. Baird's theory, as noted above, is that DeRuvo impermissibly interfered with the requirement that Blackman be the deciding official as to Baird's sanction. We express no view as to whether Baird's theory has any merit; we only hold that she is entitled to "obtain relevant information from another party to an appeal."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We thus conclude that the administrative judge abused his discretion in refusing to compel discovery of Sauer's email archives pertinent to this case. Given the Agency's lax attitude towards compliance with Baird's discovery requests, we cannot be sure that the Agency has in fact fully complied with the appropriate request for all email messages relating to Baird's case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth below, we hereby order the Board to enforce full compliance with Baird's discovery request insofar as it relates to email messages. To achieve this result, we vacate the Board's final decision (actually the administrative judge's initial decision) and remand the case for further proceedings....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A discovery dispute was reviewed in <span class="Italic">LaPorte v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1983 NP No. 83-1141). The appellant sought all records of past disciplinary actions involving assaults or other acts of physical violence on individuals. The request encompassed all actions taken in the Northeast Region of the Postal Service over a period of five years. The court concluded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Clearly, the request, which was not submitted until 16 days before the date set for the hearing, was unduly burdensome and unreasonable. Moreover, since each case has to be decided on its particular facts, and since petitioner's removal was attributable in part to past disciplinary actions against him, the records in other cases would have been of little, if any, relevance.</p>
