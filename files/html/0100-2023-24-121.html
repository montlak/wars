<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-117"><span class="space">b.</span> Scope of Review; Preclusive Effect of the Reform Act</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In general, there is no trial <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">novo</span> under the APA. Although a district court may have jurisdiction under the Act, it will only conduct an appellate review of the agency action. 5 USC 706 sets out the scope of the court's review. The court may compel an agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed. It may also set aside actions that are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; actions that are contrary to constitutional rights, privileges, or immunities; actions in excess of statutory jurisdiction or authority; actions taken without the procedures required by law; actions unsupported by substantial evidence; and actions unwarranted by the facts to the extent that they are subject to <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">novo</span> review by the court. <span class="Italic">De</span> <span class="Italic">novo</span> review is limited to inadequate agency fact-finding procedures and proceedings brought to enforce agency actions. APA review is restricted. <span id="Page_5336"></span>An action will not be deemed arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion "simply because one may happen to think it ill-considered, or to represent the less appealing alternative solution available." <span class="Italic">Hondros v. Civil Serv. Comm'n</span>, 720 F.2d 278, 295 (3d Cir. 1983) (determining that agency action implementing an employee selection process was arbitrary when it was replete with mistakes, irregularities, and unexplained procedures); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Polcover v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 477 F.2d 1223, 1228 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (describing and criticizing the duplicative role of district and appellate court cases brought under the APA to review personnel actions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">APA jurisdiction may be preempted by the remedial scheme of the Civil Service Reform Act. The APA is limited in its review of personnel actions by those courts following <span class="Italic">Carducci v. Regan</span>, 714 F.2d 171 (D.C. Cir. 1983), deciding that the CSRA divests district courts of APA review authority that they may have had prior to the effective date of the Reform Act. The reasoning of <span class="Italic">Carducci</span> is discussed relative to the <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> decision, <span class="Italic">post</span>. The courts apply the same reasoning in rejecting APA suits as they do in rejecting <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> suits: no implied cause of action will be created because of the comprehensive, if sometimes inadequate, review scheme created by the CSRA. <span class="Italic">Ryon v. O'Neill</span>, 894 F.2d 199, 203 (6th Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Krafsur v. Davenport</span>, 736 F.3d 1032, 1036-41 (6th Cir. 2013) (discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-24-130.html#sec17-126">Tucker Act</a>"; CSRA precluded APA and Tucker Act suit involving minor discipline against an ALJ, along with other claims); <span class="Italic">Mann v. Haigh</span>, 120 F.3d 34, 38 (4th Cir. 1997) (CSRA preempts preexisting APA remedy allowing review of personnel actions affecting NAFI employees); <span class="Italic">Billops v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 725 F.2d 1160, 1163 (8th Cir. 1984) (if MSPB lacks jurisdiction for some reason, e.g., timeliness or election of remedies, APA does not create independent basis of review). Although the APA may be unavailable for challenges to individual employment decisions, it remains available to review agency rulemaking proceedings affecting the tenure or selection of civil servants. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Horner</span>, 854 F.2d 490 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (reviewing efforts of OPM to exempt certain professional and administrative positions from competitive service). If the statute specifies a reviewing court, that court has exclusive jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Telecomms. Research and Action Ctr. v. FCC</span>, 750 F.2d 70 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Otherwise, review is at the district court level under the APA. 5 USC 702-703, 28 USC 1361.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The preclusive effect of the Reform Act as to claims made under the APA relative to personnel actions was described in <span class="Italic">Doe v. Goss</span>, 2007 WL 106523, 2007 U.S. DIST. LEXIS 2708 (D.D.C. No. 04-2122 Jan. 12, 2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff brings Count I of the Second Amended Complaint pursuant to the APA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 706(1) &#x0026; (2)(A)-(D). He alleges that Defendants violated the APA through their violation of "portions of CIA regulations providing for the integrity of intelligence collection and reporting." 2AC &#x00B6; 39. He seeks reinstatement at the GS-15 staff level "to which his promotion was wrongfully withheld," as well as restitution of pay at that salary level. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at &#x00B6; 41. He also asks the Court to order the CIA "to undertake rule-making to promulgate appropriate regulations to ensure protection of Plaintiff's rights in matters concerning...his employment at CIA." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at &#x00B6; 42.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff's APA claim seeks judicial review of the CIA's decision to deny him a promotion and to terminate him. Defendants contend that these claims are precluded by the CSRA. Significantly, Plaintiff's Opposition does not even address Defendants' preclusion argument. Accordingly, Plaintiff may be deemed to have conceded the Motion to Dismiss as to Count II. LCvR 7(b); <span class="Italic">see United States v. Real Property Identified As: Parcel 03179-005R,</span> 287 F. Supp.2d 45, 61 (D.D.C. 2003) ("If the opposing party files a responsive memorandum, but fails to address certain arguments made by the moving party, the court may treat those arguments as conceded.") (internal citation omitted). Because the decision to deem an argument as conceded for a party's failure to respond is discretionary, and because Defendants' argument challenges subject matter jurisdiction, the Court will consider, on the merits, whether the APA claim is precluded by the CSRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our Court of Appeals has concluded that the CSRA eliminates the right to judicial review under the APA for adverse actions that fall within the CSRA's scope. If the courts were to review such actions, "the exhaustive remedial scheme of the CSRA would be impermissibly frustrated." <span class="Italic">Carducci v. Regan,</span> 230 U.S. App. D.C. 80, 714 F.2d 171, 174 (D.C. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">see also Harrison v. Bowen,</span> 259 U.S. App. D.C. 304, 815 F.2d 1505, 1513 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (the CSRA "had the effect of depriving employees of a right of judicial review under the APA that they probably had prior to enactment of the CSRA.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA precludes APA actions challenging personnel decisions, including those concerning promotions and awards, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(ii) &#x0026; (ix), as well as those challenging adverse actions, including terminations, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(1). <span class="Italic">See Graham v. Dep't. of Justice,</span> No. 02-1231, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27419, (D.D.C. Nov. 20, 2002), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Graham v. Ashcroft,</span> 03-5025, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 16108 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 5, 2003). The CSRA also precludes claims that, in taking a particular adverse personnel action, an agency violated its own regulations. <span class="Italic">Graham v. Ashcroft,</span> 360 U.S. App. D.C. 124, 358 F.3d 931, 935-36 (D.C. Cir. 2004). These are precisely the types of actions Plaintiff challenges in his APA claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an attempt to circumvent the CSRA, Plaintiff argues in his Opposition that he has alleged a violation of constitutional rights actionable under &#x00A7; 706(2)(B). He points to his <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claim (Count V) in support of this argument. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that our Court of Appeals has held that federal employees may "seek equitable relief against their supervisors, and the agency itself, in vindication of their constitutional rights"; the CSRA does not preclude such claims. <span class="Italic">Spagnola v. Mathis,</span> 859 F.2d 223, 229-30 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) <span class="Italic">(rev'd in part on other grounds by Hubbard v. EPA,</span> 299 U.S. App. D.C. 143, 982 F.2d 531 (D.C. Cir. 1992). However, despite two amendments to his original Complaint, Plaintiff's final Second Amended Complaint still does not allege in his APA claim a violation of a constitutional right. He alleges only that "[t]he complained of acts and omissions by Defendants Goss [sic] have violated [classified] <span class="Italic">portions of CIA regulations</span> providing for the integrity of intelligence collection and reporting, in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 706(1) &#x0026; (2)(A)-(D)." 2AC &#x00B6; 39 (emphasis omitted). Alleged violation of agency regulations cannot be reviewed under <span class="Italic">Graham</span>, 358 F.3d at 935-36.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's APA claim (Count I) is granted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nyunt v. Chairman, Broadcasting Board of Governors</span>, 589 F.3d 445, 447-49 (D.C. Cir. 2009), declined, based on CSRA preclusion and the inapplicability of <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne,</span> to permit use of the APA by an employee who lost out on a promotion to a noncitizen, in alleged violation of statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike many U.S. Government agencies, the Broadcasting Board of Governors is authorized to hire non-U.S.-citizens. But there is a catch: The BBG may do so only when no "suitably qualified" U.S. citizen is available to fill the job in question. 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1474(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nyunt is a U.S. citizen who worked at the BBG, applied for a promotion, and lost out to a non-U.S.-citizen. He sued the BBG, claiming he was "suitably qualified" and that the BBG therefore contravened its statutory mandate when it promoted a non-U.S.-citizen over him. The problem is that Nyunt brought this claim in federal district court under the Administrative Procedure Act. This Court has repeatedly held that federal employees may not bring employment and personnel suits of this kind under the APA, but instead must pursue such claims through the elaborate administrative and judicial review system set up by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. We therefore affirm the District Court's dismissal of Nyunt's complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kyaw Zaw Nyunt, a U.S. citizen, worked for many years as an international radio broadcaster in the Burmese service of Voice of America. The Voice of America is run by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, a U.S. Government agency. In March 2003, Nyunt applied for a promotion to a more senior international broadcaster position. The BBG selected a non-U.S.-citizen over Nyunt and other applicants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In deciding to hire a non-U.S.-citizen, the BBG relied on its internal hiring policy and the relevant portion of its authorizing statute, 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1474(1). Section 1474(1) provides that the BBG--unlike most federal agencies--may hire non-U.S.-citizens. The statute grants that authority, however, only "when suitably qualified United States citizens are not available."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The BBG has interpreted the phrase "suitably qualified" to mean "equally or better qualified." Guidelines for Selection, Promotion, and Employment of Non-U.S. Citizens in the Presence of Qualified U.S. Citizen Competitors In Nyunt's view, the BBG's interpretation rewrites and effectively eviscerates Congress's mandate. Nyunt contends, in short, the BBG cannot hire or promote a non-U.S.-citizen over a U.S. citizen who is qualified for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the BBG promoted a non-U.S.-citizen over him, Nyunt sued under several anti-discrimination statutes. He also raised claims under the Administrative Procedure Act regarding the BBG's alleged misinterpretation and violation of 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1474(1). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A), (C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The District Court dismissed Nyunt's complaint. A prior panel of this Court summarily affirmed the District Court's dismissal of all but the present APA claims. We now conclude that our precedents squarely foreclose Nyunt's APA claims, and we therefore affirm the District Court's dismissal of those as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, the BBG contends that Nyunt lacks standing. We disagree. Nyunt alleges that he is a U.S. citizen who applied for and was unlawfully denied a promotion. That alleged injury is fairly traceable to the BBG's hiring policy and decision. And it likely would be redressed by a favorable disposition, which would help establish Nyunt's right to the job in question or to front pay and benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> Compl. &#x00B6;&#x00B6; C, G (requested relief includes an order "for front pay and benefits, if the BBG does not or will not employ plaintiff," and "[s]uch other legal and equitable relief as may be just and proper").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn, therefore, to analysis of Nyunt's Administrative Procedure Act claim. Nyunt's choice to bring his claim under the APA is problematic because a long line of cases requires that federal employees pursue <span id="Page_5337"></span>employment and personnel challenges of this kind through the procedures set up by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, rather than under the APA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Supreme Court stated in<span class="Italic"> United States v. Fausto,</span> the CSRA is comprehensive: It regulates virtually every aspect of federal employment and "prescribes in great detail the protections and remedies" applicable to adverse personnel actions, "including the availability of administrative and judicial review." 484 U.S. 439, 443, 108 S. Ct. 668, 98 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1988). The CSRA is also exclusive: It constitutes <span class="Italic">the</span> remedial regime for federal employment and personnel complaints. <span class="Italic">See Grosdidier v. Chairman, Broad.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Many other courts of appeals have ruled the same way. <span class="Italic">See Tiltti v. Weise,</span> 155 F.3d 596, 600 (2d Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Pinar v. Dole,</span> 747 F.2d 899, 912-13 (4th Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Broadway v.

United States,</span> 168 F.3d 24 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying those principles in <span class="Italic">Grosdidier,</span> we held that the CSRA precluded an APA claim that, like Nyunt's, targeted the BBG's implementation of &#x00A7; 1474(1). We stated that, "except where Congress specifies otherwise, the Civil Service Reform Act is the proper statutory vehicle for covered federal employees to challenge personnel actions by their employers." 560 F.3d at 495-96. "Federal employees may not circumvent the [CSRA] 's requirements and limitations by resorting to the catchall APA to challenge agency employment actions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 497. That principle applies to a "systemwide challenge" to an agency policy interpreting a statute just as it does to the implementation of such a policy in a particular case. <span class="Italic">Fornaro,</span> 416 F.3d at 67-69. And it applies even if the CSRA scheme ultimately would provide no relief: As we have repeatedly said, "what you get under the CSRA is what you get." <span class="Italic">Filebark,</span> 555 F.3d at 1010 (internal quotation marks omitted). In sum, the settled precedents of this Court bar Nyunt's APA claim; any claim targeting the BBG's interpretation or application of &#x00A7; 1474(1) must proceed through the CSRA process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nyunt argues that he cannot obtain relief for this kind of &#x00A7; 1474-related violation in the CSRA process. He contends that this Court therefore retains the power to consider the BBG's allegedly illegal hiring policy under the precedent of <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne,</span> 358 U.S. 184, 79 S. Ct. 180, 3 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1958). That decision permits, in certain limited circumstances, judicial review of agency action for alleged statutory violations even when a statute precludes review. The <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span> exception applies, however, only where (i) the statutory preclusion of review is implied rather than express, <span class="Italic">see Bd. of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc.,</span> 502 U.S. 32, 44, 112 S. Ct. 459, 116 L. Ed. 2d 358 (1991); <span class="Italic">see also McBryde v.

Cir. 2001); (ii) there is no alternative procedure for review of the statutory claim; and (iii) the agency plainly acts "in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the" statute that is "clear and mandatory," <span class="Italic">Leedom,</span> 358 U.S. at 188; <span class="Italic">see also Nat'l Air Traffic Controllers Ass'n AFL-CIO v. Fed. Serv. Impasses Panel,</span> 437 F.3d 1256, 1263-64, 369 U.S. App. D.C. 404 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that Nyunt's claim can meet the first and second requirements, it cannot meet the third, which requires that the agency error be "so extreme that one may view it as jurisdictional or nearly so." <span class="Italic">Griffith v. FLRA,</span> 842 F.2d 487, 493, 268 U.S. App. D.C. 491 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Given that very stringent standard, a <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span> claim is essentially a Hail Mary pass--and in court as in football, the attempt rarely succeeds. So it is here: Even if the BBG has misinterpreted or otherwise evaded its statutory obligation to hire "suitably qualified" U.S. citizens, its action is not the kind of "extreme" error that would justify reliance on the <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span> exception.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Grosdidier v. Chairman, Broadcasting Bd. of Governors</span>, 560 F.3d 495, 496-98 (D.C. Cir. 2009), cited in <span class="Italic">Nyunt</span>, found APA relief precluded by the CSRA as to a challenge to nonpromotion of agency international broadcasters who asserted that noncitizens were improperly hired to fill the positions they sought:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Broadcasting Board of Governors is a federal agency responsible for the U.S. Government's international broadcasting. It manages a network of individual broadcasting services, including the Voice of America, which is known as the VOA. The VOA transmits news, educational, and cultural programming around the world in more than 40 different languages to an estimated global audience of more than 100 million people.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiffs Camille Grosdidier, Jorge Bustamante, and Carlos Martinez have worked for the VOA as international broadcasters. They are American citizens. In recent years, they have all applied for open positions within the VOA. In each case, however, the VOA instead chose to hire noncitizens for the posts. In doing so, the VOA relied upon 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1474(1), which authorizes the Federal Government to "employ, without regard to the civil service and classification laws, aliens within the United States and abroad for service in the United States relating to the...preparation and production of foreign language programs when suitably qualified United States citizens are not available when job vacancies occur."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiffs sued the Board under the Administrative Procedure Act. They argued that they were "suitably qualified" under &#x00A7; 1474 and that the Board thus acted arbitrarily and capriciously in hiring non-citizens in their places. They brought their lawsuit on behalf of themselves and a purported class of similarly situated citizens who were passed over in favor of non-citizen applicants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The District Court dismissed plaintiffs' case. It held that the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.), not the APA, was the statute under which plaintiffs must challenge these personnel actions. On appeal, our review of this legal question is <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiffs argue that the Civil Service Reform Act is not the exclusive avenue for covered federal employees to bring suits challenging personnel actions and that they may pursue their claim under the Administrative Procedure Act. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1978, Congress passed and President Carter signed the CSRA. The Act brought about "the most systematic governmental review and revision of the federal civil service system since the enactment of the Pendleton Act in 1883." William V. Luneburg, <span class="Italic">The Federal Personnel Complaint, Appeal, and Grievance Systems: A Structural Overview and Proposed Revisions</span>, 78 KY. L.J. 1, 4 (1989). The CSRA replaced "the haphazard arrangements for administrative and judicial review of personnel action." <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto,</span> 484 U.S. 439, 444 (1988). To reform the "outdated patchwork of statutes and rules built up over almost a century," Congress created "an integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review, designed to balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 444, 445 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA protects covered federal employees against a broad range of personnel practices, and it supplies a variety of causes of action and remedies to employees when their rights under the statute are violated. As our Court has emphasized, the CSRA is comprehensive and exclusive. Federal employees may not circumvent the Act's requirements and limitations by resorting to the catchall APA to challenge agency employment actions. <span class="Italic">Filebark v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 555 F.3d 1009, 1010 (D.C. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Fornaro v. James,</span> 416 F.3d 63, 66-67 (D.C. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Graham v. Ashcroft,</span> 358 F.3d 931, 933-36 (D.C. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Carducci v. Regan,</span> 714 F.2d 171, 172 (D.C. Cir. 1983). We have emphasized, moreover, that the CSRA is the exclusive avenue for suit even if the plaintiff cannot prevail in a claim under the CSRA. As we have explained, Congress designed the CSRA's remedial scheme with care, "intentionally providing and intentionally not providing particular forums and procedures for particular kinds of claims." <span class="Italic">Filebark,</span> 555 F.3d at 1010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Allowing employees to end-run the CSRA would undermine Congress's efforts to foster a "unitary and consistent Executive Branch position on matters involving personnel action." <span class="Italic">Fausto,</span> 484 U.S. at 449; <span class="Italic">see also Graham,</span> 358 F.3d at 934. Therefore, we have told federal employees, "what you get under the CSRA is what you get." <span class="Italic">Fornaro,</span> 416 F.3d at 67.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Of course, Congress is always free to make explicit exceptions to the exclusivity of the CSRA. For example, the CSRA's express terms make clear that the Act does not extinguish any right or remedy available to federal employees under federal anti-discrimination laws. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(d); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the face of our extensive body of CSRA precedents casting doubt on their submission, plaintiffs cite the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Worthington v. United States,</span> 168 F.3d 24 (Fed. Cir. 1999). There, the Federal Circuit allowed an employee to bring claims pursuant to the Tucker Act concerning a personnel action (in that case, the government's alleged failure to provide an employee with back pay after inappropriately placing him on a compressed work schedule). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 26, 27. <span class="Italic">Worthington</span> does not apply here because this case involves the APA, not the Tucker Act. And in any event, we have some doubts about <span class="Italic">Worthington,</span> which appears to be in significant tension with this Court's precedents in <span class="Italic">Filebark, Fornaro, Graham,</span> and <span class="Italic">Carducci.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiffs also point to the text of 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1474(1) in particular the provision allowing the VOA to employ noncitizens "without regard to the <span id="Page_5338"></span>civil service and classification laws." But &#x00A7; 1474 has nothing to do with the question before us. Section 1474 contemplates the hiring of non-citizens notwithstanding the usual prohibitions on such hiring, and without regard to any limitations the civil service laws might place on that hiring. The statute does nothing to affect the exclusivity of the CSRA for suits targeting personnel decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In affirming the District Court's dismissal of this case, we need not decide whether the violation of &#x00A7; 1474 alleged by plaintiffs is, in fact, prohibited under the CSRA. Regardless of the answer to the question, plaintiffs cannot bring this suit under the APA. We affirm the District Court's judgment dismissing this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Filebark v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 555 F.3d 1009, 1010-15 (D.C. Cir. 2009), determined that the CSRA precluded APA review by a group of air traffic controllers who had contract grievance procedures, or who had a possible claim against a union through FLRA procedures for a violation of any duty of fair representation breach resulting from treatment of a contract grievance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have long held that federal employees may not use the Administrative Procedure Act to challenge agency employment actions. <span class="Italic">See Fornaro v. James</span>, 416 F.3d 63, 66-67 (D.C. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Graham v. Ashcroft</span>, 358 F.3d 931, 933-35 (D.C. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Carducci v. Regan</span>, 714 F.2d 171, 172 (D.C. Cir. 1983). This is so because Congress, through the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.), and related employment statutes, has carefully constructed a system for review and resolution of federal employment disputes, intentionally providing--and intentionally not providing--particular forums and procedures for particular kinds of claims. As such, we have held that this comprehensive employment scheme preempts judicial review under the more general APA even when that scheme provides no judicial relief--that is, "what you get under the CSRA is what you get." <span class="Italic">Fornaro</span>, 416 F.3d at 67. In this case four air traffic controllers nonetheless argue that they may use the APA to litigate their pay dispute with the Federal Aviation Administration because the CSRA provides them no protection. Straightforwardly applying our precedent, we affirm the district court's dismissal of their suit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Significantly for our purposes, the FAA is largely exempted from the CSRA by 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(1), which directs the FAA to develop "a personnel management system for the Administration that addresses the unique demands on the agency's workforce," "notwithstanding the provisions of title 5 [i.e., the CSRA] and other Federal personnel laws." <span class="Italic">See also</span> &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2) ("The provisions of title 5 shall not apply to the new personnel management system...."). Congress required that "[s]uch a new system shall, at a minimum, provide for greater flexibility in the hiring, <span id="Page_5339"></span>training, compensation, and location of personnel." &#x00A7; 40122(g)(1). In response the FAA created a personnel management system with dispute resolution provisions that largely track those of the CSRA, providing greater review for major adverse actions and no review for minor actions like this pay-scale dispute. The general exemption from the CSRA has certain exceptions, however, as CSRA provisions such as "chapter 71, relating to labor-management relations," continue to apply. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Among the provisions in that chapter that still apply is section 7121(a)(1), which requires that collective bargaining agreements contain negotiated procedures for the settlement of grievances, and which the controllers cite as the statutory basis for Count I of their amended complaint. This section previously provided that such negotiated grievance procedures would be "the exclusive procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) (1994). In 1994, however, Congress amended section 7121(a)(1) to make negotiated grievance procedures "the exclusive <span class="Italic">administrative</span> procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage." &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) (emphasis added). Having held that the earlier version of this section precluded all judicial review for employees with negotiated grievance procedures, <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, 909 F.2d 1452, 1454 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), the Federal Circuit recently reversed course, holding that the 1994 amendment signaled Congress's intent no longer to preclude all review of covered grievances. <span class="Italic">Mudge v. United States</span>, 308 F.3d 1220, 1227 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Seeking reversal of the district court's ruling that they have no cause of action, the controllers make three arguments: (1) that the district court erred in dismissing the bargaining unit members because section 7121(a)(1), as amended, no longer precludes judicial review of negotiated grievance procedures; (2) that by revisiting dismissal of the APA claims, the district court violated the law of the case; and (3) that because their employer is largely exempt from the CSRA, the controllers can maintain an APA cause of action notwithstanding our CSRA preclusion precedents. We consider each argument in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The controllers' first argument--applicable only to the bargaining unit members--lacks in relevance whatever it might have in merit. It may be true that in amending section 7121(a)(1) Congress intended no longer to preclude all judicial review for employees with negotiated grievance procedures; it may also be true that <span class="Italic">Mudge</span> correctly allowed the employees in that case to proceed; it may even be true that the district court's first opinion in this case erroneously used section 7121(a)(1) as justification for dismissing all bargaining-unit employee claims. But even if section 7121(a)(1) no longer has this preclusive effect, it is emphatically untrue that "&#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) <span class="Italic">establishes</span> [a] federal employee's right to seek judicial remedy for [a] grievance subject to negotiated procedures in [a] collective bargaining agreement," as the controllers maintain in their complaint, Am. Compl. &#x00B6; 37 (emphasis added). To the contrary, as the Supreme Court explained in <span class="Italic">Whitman v. Department of Transportation</span>, 547 U.S. 512, 513 (2006), section "7121(a)(1) does not confer jurisdiction," nor does it create a cause of action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because section 7121(a)(1), by itself, provides no right to sue, the bargaining unit employees must point to an independent source of law in order to maintain this action. In <span class="Italic">Mudge</span> a money claim within the Tucker Act jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims provided the cause of action, <span class="Italic">see</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Mudge v. United States</span>, 50 Fed. Cl. 500, 502 (Fed. Cl. 2001); in <span class="Italic">Carter</span>, the case that <span class="Italic">Mudge</span> held overruled by the 1994 amendment, the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b), provided the cause of action, <span class="Italic">see</span> 909 F.2d at 1453. Neither is available here. In fact, the only basis for a cause of action the bargaining unit controllers even mention in their complaint is the APA--the same source identified by the non-bargaining unit controllers. Thus, the 7 case for all four controllers begins and ends with the question identified as central by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Whitman</span> and answered in the district court's second opinion--namely "whether &#x00A7; 7121 (<span class="Italic">or the CSRA as a whole</span>) removes the jurisdiction given to the federal courts or otherwise precludes employees from pursuing" a claim under the APA, <span class="Italic">Whitman</span>, 547 U.S. at 514 (emphasis added, citation omitted). If we answer that question in the affirmative then neither the bargaining unit members nor the supervisors have a claim, whether or not the district court, in its first opinion, properly relied on section 7121(a)(1) to dismiss all bargaining unit employee claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reviewing <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the dismissal of the APA claims, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Munsell v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 509 F.3d 572, 578 (D.C. Cir. 2007), we find no error in the district court's decision. Twenty-five years ago, in <span class="Italic">Carducci v. Regan</span>, we held that "the exhaustive remedial scheme of the CSRA would be impermissibly frustrated by permitting, for lesser personnel actions not involving constitutional claims, an access to the courts more immediate and direct than the statute provides with regard to major adverse actions." 714 F.2d at 174. Holding that "failure to include some types of [claims] within the remedial scheme of so comprehensive a piece of legislation reflects a congressional intent that no judicial relief be available," we found an APA remedy beyond that provided in the CSRA precluded by the comprehensiveness of the CSRA itself. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 174-75. The Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion five years later in <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, holding that the exclusion of particular employees (rather than particular claims) from the CSRA was not an invitation to those employees to sue under other statutes but a "manifestation of a considered congressional judgment that they should not have statutory entitlement to review." 484 U.S. 439, 448-49 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We clarified the breadth of these precedents in two recent cases. In <span class="Italic">Graham v. Ashcroft</span>, we held that the lack of any entitlement to judicial review in the CSRA precluded litigation of an employment matter under the APA even where the complaint did not concern "'a <span class="Italic">type</span> of personnel action covered by the CSRA.'" 358 F.3d 931, 934 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (quoting <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 448 (emphasis added, brackets omitted)). Thus, we found preclusion not because 9 the CSRA identified some other kind of plaintiff or some other kind of procedure for bringing the claim, but because it provided no way of bringing it. As to such claims we said, "the CSRA provides no relief and precludes other avenues of relief." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 935. One year later in <span class="Italic">Fornaro w</span>e made the point even more directly, holding that "what you get under the CSRA is what you get." 416 F.3d at 67. Not one of our precedents has cited section 7121(a)(1) in so holding, and the controllers nowhere argue that the 1994 amendment affects these cases or their now-familiar analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, the controllers correctly point out that Congress largely exempted the FAA from the CSRA, and that we have never before had occasion to apply our preclusion cases to employees of an exempt agency. But the upshot of our precedents for this case is absolutely clear. Far from saving an APA claim, Congress's exemption of these controllers' agency from the CSRA signals the same thing as Congress's omission of the type of personnel action at issue in <span class="Italic">Graham</span> or the type of employees at issue in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>--namely that Congress intended to provide these employees with no judicial review. This is because we treat the CSRA and Congress's related employment statutes as covering the field of federal employee claims, and so our cases expressly teach that those left out of this scheme are left out on purpose. Indeed this case is easier than most, for we need make no inferences about the pregnant meaning of legislative silence. In exempting the FAA from the CSRA, Congress made its intent perfectly clear: to "provide for greater flexibility in the hiring, training, compensation, and location of personnel." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(1). Because giving FAA employees a unique right of access to the courts would frustrate rather than further that intent, proper application of our precedents bars this suit. <span class="Italic">See also McAuliffe v. Rice</span>, 966 F.2d 979, 980-81 (5th Cir. 1992) (reaching same conclusion as to different entity exempted from CSRA because allowing APA review would "thwart[&#8197;] the goal of maintaining flexibility").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The controllers argue that "[w]hatever the scope of the 'flexibility' which Congress granted to the FAA, it is inconceivable that Congress authorized the FAA to devise a compensation plan for its Controllers and then violate that plan with impunity and without review." The controllers never develop this apparent due process argument, nor could they, for even its factual premise is flawed. The controllers do have a remedy: if the FAA fails to live up to its agreements, the union can pursue the matter (union grievance regarding Albuquerque Center salary level), and if the union fails to live up to its duty of representation, the controllers can pursue the union, <span class="Italic">see Steadman v. Governor, U.S. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home</span>, 918 F.2d 963, 966 (D.C. Cir. 1990) ("A failure to seek arbitration (which an employee may not compel on his own) may constitute such a breach of the union's duty [of fair representation] . But, in that event, only the FLRA--not a district court--may remedy the breach by ordering arbitration."). These procedures surely lack the directness and immediacy of an APA suit, and the controllers have apparently found them frustrating (accusing NACTA of "machinations" designed to defeat Filebark's claims). But the choice of procedures lies with Congress, and as we have repeatedly held, Congress had no intention of providing claimants like these--unmentioned in the CSRA--with a level of access to the courts unavailable to almost any other federal employees, including those that the CSRA identifies as most worthy of procedural protection. <span class="Italic">See Graham</span>, 358 F.3d at 935 (citing <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> and <span class="Italic">Carducci</span> for the proposition that giving direct APA review to claimants not entitled to review procedures under the CSRA would upset careful congressional layering of remedial procedures). Thus, we find this APA claim precluded by the structure of Congress's employment statutes and "the CSRA as a whole," <span class="Italic">Whitman</span>, 547 U.S. at 514.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the controllers identify only the APA as the statutory basis for their claims, and because such claims are precluded by the CSRA as a whole regardless of who brings them, we affirm. <span class="Italic">So ordered.</span></p>
