<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-213"><span class="space">2.</span> Judge Must Ensure Jurisdictional Issues Are Identified; <span class="Italic"><span class="Bold">Burgess</span></span> Notice</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In an involuntary resignation case, <span class="Italic">Burgess v. MSPB</span>, 758 F.2d 641 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the Federal Circuit remanded because the AJ did not clearly identify for the appellant the issues of jurisdictional significance and her burden of proof in response to a jurisdictional show cause order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nowhere does it order or even caution the employee that to establish jurisdiction it would be necessary to produce or allege facts or evidence on an appealable issue. We believe a contrary impression was conveyed since the order indicated nothing of the kind and said that a decision would be made on the basis of the petition and the responses of the parties. The order was misleading, incomplete, and latently ambiguous. It failed to tell Burgess that a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness was required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue, and that the production of factual evidence would be necessary to show that the board had jurisdiction and should grant a hearing. The government knows how to make this plain to employees if that is what it intends....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After <span class="Italic">Burgess,</span> the Board has required its AJs to let appellants know what they need to allege or prove to establish jurisdiction. The Board requires what it occasionally refers to as a "<span class="Italic">Burgess</span> notice."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"Although the appellant has the burden of proof on jurisdiction, the administrative judge must fully inform her of the requirements for establishing it." <span class="Italic">DeGraaff v. VA</span>, 73 MSPR 224, 229 (1997) (but declining to remand because the result of the case would remain the same irrespective of the jurisdictional determination on an IRA claim). "An AJ may dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction only if the appellant has been placed on specific notice of what must be shown or alleged to establish jurisdiction, and the appellant fails to make the requisite showing or allegations." <span class="Italic">Kapica v. USPS</span>, 95 MSPR 556, 560 &#x00B6; 8 (2004);<span class="Italic"> see</span> <span class="Italic">Peterson v. VA</span>, PH-752S-14-0445-I-1 (NP 8/11/2014) ("When the Board's jurisdiction is in doubt, an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">Alvarez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 9 (2009) (citing <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). The administrative judge's error was not cured by the agency's sole pleading. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 186, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 12 (2009) (finding an agency's pleadings sufficient to meet the notice requirement)."); <span class="Italic">Rumph v. USPS</span>, 101 MSPR 243, 246 &#x00B6; 7, 2006 MSPB 40 (2006) (citing <span class="Italic">Kapica</span>). If there is a jurisdictional dispute, the AJ must tell the appellant when during the appellate process that she must prove jurisdiction, if the AJ has not otherwise determined that the appellant satisfied her burden of proof on the jurisdictional issue. It is not sufficient for the AJ to deny the agency's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and not inform the appellant of her continuing burden as to proof of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rutherford v. USPS</span>, 112 MSPR 570, 576-77 &#x00B6; 16, 2009 MSPB 214 (2009). Yet the Board is not required to tell the petitioner what specific allegations must be asserted or supported by evidence to make a case for jurisdiction. The Board provides adequate notice by informing the appellant of what generally must be done to establish jurisdiction--that the appellant must raise a nonfrivolous allegation that would establish an appealable jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">Bean v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 33 Fed. Appx. 517, 519-20 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Padilla v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, DE-1221-16-0081-W-1 (NP 9/15/2022), summarized <span class="italic">Burgess</span> notice requirements in a <span class="italic">pro se</span> appellant's appeal:</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Whatever the level of pleading required, if there is a jurisdictional element in an appeal, e.g., whether a probationer has properly alleged discrimination within the Board's appeals authority, the AJ should not determine the jurisdictional issue without first providing the appellant an opportunity to amplify upon or offer proof in support of his allegation that his discharge resulted from, for example, "partisan politics." <span class="Italic">Sweeting v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit related what is expected of Board's AJs when it evaluated a postal employee's claim that he was entitled to a hearing under a statute granting appeal rights to certain postal managers and supervisors, <span class="Italic">Waldau v.

In <span class="Italic">Manning</span>, however, this court noted that a "case[&#8197;] may arise where the MSPB should hold an evidentiary hearing on jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1428. Such a case exists when a petitioner raises nonfrivolous allegations of controverted jurisdictional facts on which the MSPB's jurisdiction is clearly established if these facts are proven. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Burgess v.

Department of the Army</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 271, 274 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the Board recognized that Waldau had met his threshold burden of raising a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction and therefore remanded to the AJ for a hearing and a new decision on the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Waldau</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 194-195 (1992) (order remanding for jurisdictional hearing). In limiting the scope of the jurisdictional hearing on remand to whether Waldau was a management employee, and therefore ignoring Waldau's confidential status argument, the AJ reasoned in part that the Board's remand order "[did]not appear to expand upon the [management employee] issue decided in the initial decision." The Board, however, clearly remanded for a "<span class="Italic">new</span> initial decision" on the issue of jurisdiction, explicitly stating that the AJ was to reach the merits of the case if she found "that the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's case." The Board also explicitly withheld a decision on the confidential employee issue in light of its remand order. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 195 n.2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless of the reading given to the Board's remand order, the government contends that a petitioner, in his initial pleading, must allege <span class="Italic">each and every nonfrivolous ground</span> on which he would attempt to base Board jurisdiction in a jurisdictional hearing, were he to qualify for such, or be forever barred from altering, amending, or otherwise adding to the asserted grounds in any subsequent proceedings on the issue. The touchstone as to whether the government is correct on this issue lies in a principle established in our precedent. In <span class="Italic">Burgess</span>, an employee of the Federal Trade Commission appealed her removal to the Board. In light of the agency's argument that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the case because Burgess had voluntarily resigned her initial position as a secretary, and because the position into which she was reinstated before finally being removed was temporary, the AJ issued a show cause order stating simply that Burgess had to "show cause why her appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction." 758 F.2d at 642. In response, Burgess stated that she would produce evidence at a hearing demonstrating that her resignation was involuntary. The AJ characterized Burgess' response as a "mere conclusion" and dismissed her appeal for want of jurisdiction. The full Board denied Burgess' petition for review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This court on appeal held that the AJ's notice to Burgess was legally insufficient in that it failed to apprise Burgess precisely and without confusion of what she was required to show to obtain a hearing on the jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 643-44.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the facts of that case, this court held that the notice to Burgess should have specified that she could overcome the initial jurisdictional hurdle by producing nonfrivolous allegations in support of her asserted grounds for jurisdiction. Legally sufficient notice, we held, requires clear notice to the appellant of what she must allege. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the absence of such specific direction in the notice, "a contrary impression was conveyed," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 643, namely that Burgess was not required to respond particularly to the jurisdictional challenge. In forcefully concluding that the order issued to Burgess was "misleading, incomplete, and latently ambiguous" because of its lack of required specificity, the court noted that "[t]he government knows how to make [the employee's burden] plain...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 643-44. <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> thus requires that the government must unambiguously and clearly give notice of that which it requires of a litigant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Application of the principle established in <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> to the circumstances of this case entitles Waldau to an adjudication of his claim that he qualifies as "engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity." The government construes the AJ's Order in this case as having required Waldau to produce nonfrivolous allegations as to his status as both a management and a confidential personnel employee. The Order on its face, however, consistent with 39 U.S.C. Sec. 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii), only informed Waldau that he could establish Board jurisdiction <span class="Italic">either</span> as a management employee or as a confidential personnel employee. The Order did not state that if Waldau asserted one ground in his response, he would be barred from raising the other ground at a subsequent jurisdictional hearing, or in the legal jargon of such orders, that "any subsequent hearing on jurisdiction will be restricted solely to the grounds for jurisdiction asserted in your response to this Order." Such, however, is precisely the meaning the government attributes to the AJ's Order. We cannot read the government's meaning into this Order, without contemporaneously concluding that the Order is incomplete and ambiguous, if not misleading, and therefore that it runs afoul of the <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> principle.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Order is not saved from imprecision simply because it recites alternative statutory bases to establish Board jurisdiction. Nothing in the statute speaks to what is required to obtain a jurisdictional hearing before the Board. Recitation of alternatively drafted statutory language, without indication that all statutory grounds must be pleaded to qualify for a hearing on all such grounds, is hardly informative to the unaware. In short, Waldau simply was <span class="Italic">not</span> informed by the AJ's Order that if he initially came forward with nonfrivolous allegations as to only one of the grounds for jurisdiction, he would be forever denied the opportunity to present evidence on the second ground at a subsequent jurisdictional hearing for which he would then have properly qualified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we express no view on the nature of the process due Waldau. Although the Board and our precedent speak of "evidentiary" hearings on <span id="Page_1196"></span>jurisdictional issues, the AJ of course is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing if the proffered facts are not in dispute. In such circumstances, the hearing would be limited to the legal consequences of the agreed facts. Regardless of whether the hearing's nature is evidentiary or legal or both, however, the hearing should in any event be plenary on the question of the Board's jurisdiction. Accordingly, the case is remanded to the Board for further proceedings on this issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To comply with rulings of the Federal Circuit interrelating jurisdictional and hearing requirements, the AJ confronted with a jurisdictional issue must inform the appellant what is required to reach a hearing. It is insufficient merely to direct the appellant to respond to the agency's motion to dismiss. The order directing the response must at least explain to the appellant that she must raise a nonfrivolous allegation concerning the jurisdictional issue, e.g., involuntary resignation, and that she must produce factual evidence to show that the Board has jurisdiction and should grant her a hearing. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 236, 238 (1987). The AJ must closely examine appeals documents to determine where lie jurisdictional issues. The AJ's obligation to inform the appellant concerning the elements of Board jurisdiction extends to claims of violations of restoration rights. <span class="Italic">Norwood v. USPS</span>, 100 MSPR 494, 496-97 &#x00B6; 5 (2005).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The advice from the AJ to the appellant on a jurisdictional issue should be tailored to the circumstances of the appeal. In <span class="Italic">Bibby v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 30 MSPR 507 (1986), the appeal involved a removal for AWOL, but the appellant noted on her appeal that she earlier filed an EEO complaint. The AJ's decision to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction was reversed. Reciting <span class="Italic">Burgess v. MSPB</span>, 758 F.2d 641 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (before an AJ may dismiss an appeal for lack of jurisdiction, his order must be reasonably calculated to tell the appellant what is required to obtain a hearing), <span class="Italic">Bibby</span> determined that the AJ should have told the appellant the exact question needing a reply: whether her earlier EEO complaint involved the same issue as the issue involved in the removal appeal. General instructions contained in the acknowledgment order pertaining to responses to motions were insufficient to apprise the appellant of what was necessary to demonstrate jurisdiction over her EEO allegation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morales v. DOD</span>, 54 MSPR 226, 230 (1992) (agency's motion to dismiss did not advise the appellant that he was required to allege facts that would establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination; the initial decision did not explain the requirement for a nonfrivolous allegation and the Board could not, for that reason, fault the appellant's continued lack of specificity concerning the discrimination allegation in his PFR); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Kince v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 64, 67 (1992) (AJ should not have dismissed the appeal of an action claimed by the agency to have been earlier settled until the appellant was informed that to set aside the settlement, he had to show that the agreement was tainted with invalidity through fraud or mutual mistake).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As an example of the degree of specificity expected in the advice from an AJ to an appellant concerning how the appellant should respond to a jurisdictional issue, consider <span class="Italic">Holden v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 420, 423 (1998), suggesting that the AJ should supply direction specifically tailored to Board decisions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, the administrative judge provided the appellant with a loose definition of a "constructive suspension" and stated that such actions are appealable. He did not, however, inform the appellant what he must allege to establish jurisdiction over a constructive suspension. If an employee who is absent due to a medical condition requests work within his medical restrictions, and if the agency is bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light-duty work to such an employee, the employee's continued absence constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board if the agency fails to offer the employee any available light-duty work. <span class="Italic">Thibodeaux v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 76 MSPR 178, 181 (1997); <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 MSPR 680, 693 (1996).</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cottle v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 409, 413-14 &#x00B6; 11 (2000), emphasizes the necessity for clear notice to the appellant of a jurisdictional issue through an agency motion or through an AJ's notice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency's arguments on review are not explicitly framed as an attack on the Board's jurisdiction, the Board must satisfy itself that it has authority to adjudicate the matter before it, and may raise the question of its own jurisdiction <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> at any time. <span class="Italic">Waldrop v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 MSPR 12, 15 (1996). At the same time, the appellant was never informed by the administrative judge that she bore the burden of proving that her removal was substantially related to a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See Burgess v. Merit</span> <span class="Italic">Systems Protection Board,</span> 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish Board jurisdiction). The agency did argue below that the Board lacked jurisdiction, making reference to some of the authority discussed above. <span class="Italic">cf. Nichols v. Department of the Interior</span>, 69 MSPR 386, 388-89 (1996) (the Board may dismiss an appeal for want of jurisdiction without issuing a show-cause order if an agency motion to dismiss put the appellant on notice of what was required to establish jurisdiction). Still, the agency's motion did not clearly explain what the appellant's jurisdictional burden is.... The initial decision, as noted above, did not analyze the jurisdictional issue consistent with governing precedent, so the initial decision was not sufficient to alert the appellant that she ought to file a cross petition for review arguing that she did not have a fair opportunity to develop the record on jurisdiction below....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is insufficient for the AJ to inform the appellant that the agency's motion to dismiss will close the record on a certain date, <span class="Italic">Mahony v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 432, 434 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge's order closing the record was not sufficient to apprise the appellant that there was a threshold jurisdictional issue concerning the timeliness of his petition for appeal. Further, the order failed to apprise the appellant that he could show good cause for the untimely filing of his petition for appeal, and that the Board could waive the twenty-day time limitation for good cause shown. Finally, it did not give appellant adequate notice how to respond. Therefore, we find that appellant was not sufficiently apprised that he must show good cause for the untimely filing of his petition for review, and request a waiver of the Board's regulatory time limitation for filing a petition for appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant must provide a response if the AJ issues an order directing a response on a jurisdictional issue. If the appellant fails to respond, the appellant must provide more than a "bare, unsworn assertion of nonreceipt" of the AJ's order if he is to avoid the dismissal that follows the failure to respond. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perez v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 248, 249 (1992) (also considering the appellant's failure to recognize the need to inquire about the jurisdictional order referenced in filings he received from the agency). If the appellant requests more time for producing jurisdictional information, the AJ should rule on the request. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Beadle v. Dept. of Army</span>, 40 MSPR 193, 196 (1989) (failure to rule was harmless error). If the AJ notifies the appellant of the jurisdictional issue and of the way to respond to it, but the appellant claims he never received the notice, the Board will consider the circumstances to see if the appellant was truly aware of the jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perez v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 248, 249 (1992) (Board discounted the appellant's claim that he did not receive the acknowledgment order because his "bare, unsworn assertion of nonreceipt does not establish the truth of the assertion"; the appellant should have known of the jurisdictional issue by reading the agency's responses to that issue referencing the AJ's acknowledgment order). [For discussion of due process requirements when the AJ closes the record (including reply rights to new evidence introduced by the opposing party), refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-095.html#sec3-95">Posthearing Activities</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-10-096.html#sec3-96">Closing Record</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If, unlike <span class="Italic">Mahony</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, an agency's submissions are sufficient to place the appellant on notice of the jurisdictional issue, the AJ's failure to notify the appellant of the issue does not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights, <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 382, 386 (1998)<span class="Italic">,</span> <span class="Italic">Naraghi v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> DC-315H-10-0508-I-1 (NP 1/12/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do note that the administrative judge's jurisdictional notice appears to have provided the appellant with inadequate guidance regarding how he could have established that he was an "employee" with Board appeal rights based upon prior federal service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>.,<span class="Italic"> Hurston</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 34, &#x00B6; 9. This was error. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue). But this error was harmless for two reasons. First, the requisite notice was provided in the agency's response and the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 186, &#x00B6; 9 (2009) (the necessary jurisdictional notice may be provided by the agency pleadings or the initial decision). Second, there is no evidence that the appellant had other federal service, and his response on the Optional Form 306 suggests that he did not.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, to constitute fair notice to the appellant of what he must establish by way of jurisdiction, assuming the AJ did not issue a show cause order, the agency's motion must provide a cogent and complete statement of the various grounds the appellant could plead to sustain Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Salazar v.

<p class="Body-Text">Should the AJ fail to advise an appellant of what is needed to show Board jurisdiction, the error is harmless if the employee makes, and the AJ considers, all relevant jurisdictional arguments. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Richardson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the administrative judge did not provide the appellant with notice of the IRA jurisdictional requirements. Further, she did not set forth the IRA jurisdictional standard in the initial decision by stating that the appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that her disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or failure to take personnel actions against her. The agency's submissions, however, which cited the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001), cured the lack of notice. <span class="Italic">See Boughton v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 5 (2003) (stating that an administrative judge's failure to properly inform the appellant of the Board's jurisdictional requirements may not be prejudicial where the appellant is put on notice, by the agency's motion to dismiss, of what he has to allege in order to establish jurisdiction). Further, the record shows that the appellant, who was represented by counsel, understood the jurisdictional standard. Therefore, the administrative judge's error did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may dispose of the jurisdictional issue at the PFR level based on the appellant's submissions if the initial decision correctly identifies the jurisdictional issue and burdens of proof, even if the AJ failed to treat those matters prior to the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Naraghi</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Ballesteros v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge did not provide the appellant in the acknowledgment order with proper notice regarding how to establish jurisdiction as a probationary employee in the excepted service, we find that the administrative judge provided proper notice of the appellant's jurisdictional burden in the initial decision itself, which afforded the appellant the opportunity to meet her jurisdictional burden for the first time on review. <span class="Italic">See Caracciolo v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 663, &#x00B6; 11 (2007). The appellant has failed to do so.</p>

Here, we find that the initial decision, which relied on the correct statutory provision, placed the appellant on notice of her jurisdictional burden and that she was afforded an opportunity to meet her jurisdictional burden in the petition for review."); <span class="Italic">Marshall v. VA,</span> DC-3443-11-0954-I-1 (NP 7/3/2012) ("To the extent the appellant is arguing that the administrative judge failed to provide him with his burden of proving jurisdiction over a constructive demotion appeal, the administrative judge provided the appellant with the elements of a constructive demotion claim in the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fleming v.

In the initial decision, the administrative judge also informed the appellant that his affirmative defenses, standing alone, are not within the Board's jurisdiction.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If jurisdictional requirements are established for the first time in an initial decision, it is then too late for the appellant to supply evidence to the AJ on the jurisdictional issue. If the appellant can figure out what to do in that situation--supply jurisdictional evidence to the Board on PFR--the Board will evaluate the submission. If the appellant was not informed by the AJ (or through an agency motion) of what he needs to provide to show jurisdiction over his appeal, the Board may consider information provided by the appellant for the first time with a PFR to ascertain whether the appellant makes out a colorable claim within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Koury v. DOD</span>, 84 MSPR 219, 226-27 &#x00B6; 12 (1999) (IRA case); <span class="Italic">Sweeney v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 73 MSPR 329, 334 (1997) ("While the newly-submitted documents would not normally be considered because they were filed for the first time with the petition for review...because the administrative judge provided no specific guidance on what the appellant needed to provide to show jurisdiction...we find it appropriate to consider the documents submitted with the appellant's petition for review."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Williams v. VA</span>, 74 MSPR 472, 475 (1997) (Board considered information during a PFR concerning the timeliness of a fee petition when neither the AJ's response to the petition nor the agency's motion to dismiss the petition identified to the appellant a postal delivery problem leading to the timeliness issue). Without notice of the jurisdictional issue to the appellant, however, "the Board can make factual findings on the threshold issue of jurisdiction when those findings are based on undisputed documentary evidence." <span class="Italic">Mendenhall v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 430, 439 (1997) (citing <span class="Italic">Spillers v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 22, 28 (1994)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board elaborated on use of a PFR to address a jurisdictional issue first squarely identified and addressed through an initial decision, <span class="Italic">Scott v. DOJ</span>, 105 MSPR 482, 486-87 &#x00B6; 6, 2007 MSPB 113 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, an AJ's failure to provide an appellant with proper <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> notice can be cured if the agency's pleadings contain the notice that was lacking in the acknowledgment order, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Nichols v. Department of the Interior</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 386, 388-89 (1996), or if the ID itself puts the appellant on notice of what she must do to establish jurisdiction, thus affording her the opportunity to meet her jurisdictional burden in the PFR, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Fleming v. Department of Labor</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 341, &#x00B6; 9 (2004); <span class="Italic">see also Milam v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 485, &#x00B6; 10 (2005). Here, the ID set forth Board law regarding nonselections as well as reductions in grade or pay. Accordingly, the appellant had notice of the Board's jurisdictional requirements in her specific case and could address those issues on PFR.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the necessary jurisdictional showing is made, the AJ generally grants a hearing; otherwise the appeal is dismissed with notice of Board appeal (PFR) and judicial review rights. Should the AJ misstate the jurisdictional issue, the case may be remanded so that proper direction may be given to the appellant to guide him in the presentation of his evidence and argument. <span class="Italic">Carr v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 681, 684 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 51 MSPR 557, 559 (1991) (directing the AJ to advise the appellant what allegations would be necessary to invoke jurisdiction on the basis of the agency's failure to restore him following recovery from a compensable injury).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ's duty to insure fair notice of issues likely extends to the agency as well as to the appellant. In <span class="Italic">Knight v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 424, 428 &#x00B6; 9 (1998), not involving a jurisdictional dispute, an appeal was remanded when the AJ only partially informed the agency of how it should prove, in a restoration claim, disqualifying conduct as defined under OPM and agency regulations. Having taken on the responsibility of advising the agency of its burden of proof, the explanation from the AJ should have been accurate. Under <span class="Italic">Donahue v. USPS</span>, 100 MSPR 387, 396 n.6 (2005), an appeal will not be remanded for further factual development, despite the AJ's failure to provide information concerning jurisdictional requisites to the appellant prior to dismissal of his appeal, if the undisputed facts preclude a finding of jurisdiction. The Board does expect agencies to provide evidence bearing upon jurisdiction, particularly when that evidence is in the possession of the agency. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-09-217.html#sec2-214">Agency Representative's Responsibilities</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Knowledge of how to assert jurisdictional facts will not be presumed because the appellant files a PFR. If the AJ does not specifically inform the appellant of how to make a jurisdictional claim in an order prior to the initial decision, the appellant will not be expected to spell out the jurisdictional claim in a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morales v. DOD</span>, 54 MSPR 226, 230 (1992). But if the appellant fully addresses a jurisdictional claim in his PFR (or before the AJ), the Board decides the jurisdictional issue without a remand. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Banks v. USDA</span>, 59 MSPR 157, 159 n.2 (1993); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Pryor v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 202, 206 (1994) (record on a reemployment appeal was sufficiently well developed that the Board decided the jurisdictional issue without a remand to the AJ to inform the appellant what was required to establish jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Notice requirements have some inherent limitations. It may be impossible for the AJ to inform an appellant how to establish jurisdiction that does not exist, <span class="Italic">Kelly v. OPM</span>, 53 MSPR 511, 517 n.7 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant alleged in his petition for appeal that he was appealing the agency's withdrawal of his preference eligible status, as well as handicap discrimination. Because there is no law, rule, or regulation that confers on the Board jurisdiction over this subject matter, the administrative judge could not have provided the appellant with more specific information regarding his burden of proof with respect to the <span id="Page_1198"></span>Board's jurisdiction over his appeal....&#8197;Thus, we find that, under the circumstances, the administrative judge's notification to the appellant that the Board may not have jurisdiction over such an action and that he was required to submit additional evidence and argument on the matter was adequate under <span class="Italic">Burgess</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ fails to provide the proper notice, but clearly the Board has no jurisdiction, the appeal will be dismissed; the AJ's error is harmless. <span class="Italic">Labinski v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 125, 128 &#x00B6; 6 (2001); <span class="italic">Bryars v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-315I-18-0065-I-1 (NP 5/16/2022) (dismissing probationer's appeal; despite lack of notice of IRA rights from AJ, the omission was harmless when the record demonstrated to MSPB that the appellant had not filed a complaint with OSC, meaning there was no IRA jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Hudson v. OPM</span>, 114 MSPR 669, 672 &#x00B6; 11, 2010 MSPB 194 (2010) (insurance benefits claim that was clearly beyond the Board's jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 573, 578 (1995) ("Here, the administrative judge failed to afforded the appellant the required notice. The administrative judge's failure did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights, however, because, as discussed above, the record clearly shows that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal. <span class="Italic">Pennington</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. at 11; <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 160. Accordingly, we find that it is unnecessary to remand this appeal to the field office and dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Pennington</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. at 11; <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 160."); <span class="Italic">Fidler v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 440, 444 (1992) ("The appellant was represented by counsel, and she addressed these issues in her response to the agency's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, and again in her petition for review."); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. DOD</span>, 46 MSPR 154, 160 (1990) ("Because the appellant's claim is plainly not within the Board's jurisdiction, however, we find that the administrative judge's error did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights so as to require a remand of the appeal to the regional office for further adjudication.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Jurisdictional issues are complex. When the jurisdictional issue is presented for adjudication early in the appeal, the AJ should adjudicate the issue so as to ensure the appellant understands what the issue is and what type of proof, information, or allegations are needed to show that the Board has jurisdiction. It is insufficient for the AJ to tell the appellant that there is a jurisdictional issue but then leave it to the appellant to determine the nature of the issue and how to respond. [Jurisdictional issues are addressed throughout the <span class="Italic">Guide</span>, particularly in Chapters <a href="0100-2023-08-001.html#sec1-1">1</a>, <a href="0100-2023-13-001.html#sec6-1">6</a>, and <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">13</a>.]</p>
