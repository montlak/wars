<h4 class="h4" id="sec7-18"><span class="space">6.</span> Sexual Misconduct</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Doe v. NSA</span>, 6 MSPR 555, 6 MSPB 467 (1981), considered the removal of an individual charged with sexual misconduct involving his daughter. The appellant held a sensitive post with an intelligence agency governed by regulations requiring dismissal of employees whose trustworthiness could be questioned. Finding the appellant's contacts with his daughter constituted a breach of parental trust, the Board concluded that a presumption of nexus arose from the nature and gravity of the appellant's misconduct. Although the Board considered evidence that the appellant's high level of competence tended to outweigh the presumption of nexus allowed by <span class="Italic">Merritt</span>, the Board determined, after reviewing medical evidence in the record, that appellant's conduct raised substantial and continuing questions as to his mental and emotional stability. The misconduct of the appellant established a general lack of trustworthiness and stability that might impair both his ability to perform his classified duties and the ability of the agency to perform its sensitive mission. Board Member Wertheim dissented. He conceded that there probably were types of conduct so offensive that they should preclude retention in government employment irrespective of the effect of the conduct on the efficiency of the service. He stated, however, that the statutory standard permitted removal for only those causes that promote the efficiency of the service. 5 USC 7513(a). Wertheim reviewed the facts and literature pertaining to incest and sexual abuse of children. Considering the lack of any demonstrable effect of the appellant's conduct on his performance or on national security, he argued that the appellant's removal did not enhance service efficiency. A reviewing court considered that the Board had sufficient reason to affirm the dismissal as a result of confidential information within the employee's access, the impracticality of his remaining employed if denied clearance and access to classified information, and the "inevitable and inherent risks in work of the nature in which the employee was involved." <span class="Italic">Stalans v. NSA</span>, 678 F.2d 482 (4th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's rulings on off-duty sexual misconduct are consistent. Sexual assault on a child justified an adverse action against a custodial work inspector whose job required independence in interacting with building managers. The conviction, leading to a two-year deferred sentence, gave reason to question the appellant's integrity as to his job responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Williams v. GSA</span>, 22 MSPR 476, 478 (1984). A postmaster was removed as a result of both an off-duty arrest for lewd conduct and a charge that he lied to police. Although subordinates said they respected the appellant, a good prognosis for rehabilitation did not outweigh the legitimate agency apprehension about the appellant's ability to perform his duties. The nexus for removal was established by the effect of the off-duty problems on the appellant's reputation for honesty and integrity. <span class="Italic">DeDonato v. USPS</span>, 25 MSPR 286, 291 (1984), <span class="Italic">on remand</span> from Federal Circuit, 30 MSPR 423 (1986) (Table) (mitigating removal to a demotion). <span class="Italic">Graham v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 364, 367 (1991), found sufficient nexus to support removal of a distribution clerk convicted of sexual abuse involving a minor. The conduct was sufficiently egregious to warrant a rebuttable presumption of nexus. The presumption was not rebutted by the appellant. Although some of appellant's coworkers testified on his behalf, others objected to his return. The postmaster stated he had lost trust and confidence in the appellant. A favorable prognosis from a psychologist did not outweigh the "agency's legitimate apprehension as to [appellant's] ability to perform his duties," and the effect of his proven misconduct on the efficiency of the service. There was some unfavorable publicity naming the appellant as a Postal Service employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is a minimum that an agency must do to establish nexus when it removes an employee based on charges relating to off-duty sexual conduct. The agency is expected to supply the Board with enough evidence, enough information, to demonstrate a connection between the charged conduct and the appellant's working conditions or relations with others at the workplace. <span class="Italic">Hicks v. Dept. of Navy</span>, AT-0752-13-7338-I-1 (NP 1/2/2015), affirmed an AJ's decision setting aside a removal based upon the paucity of evidence supporting nexus. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Slayton v. USDA</span>, SF-0752-17-0370-I-1 (NP 2/23/2023) (sustaining removal for inappropriate conduct at the appellant's apartment, located on property owned by the agency and leased from the agency; a co-worker testified that she lost interest in working for the agency and the appellant was reassigned to a new duty station based on the deciding official's loss of trust in his ability to perform his duties at the same remote location).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The courts may apply a more rigorous nexus analysis than the Board in sexual misconduct cases, but the results are unpredictable. In <span class="Italic">Major v. Hampton</span>, 413 F. Supp. 66, 71 (E.D. La. 1976), the plaintiff, an IRS agent responsible for examining tax returns, was dismissed on a charge that he engaged in behavior that "tends to discredit himself or the Service." More specifically, the allegation was that he rented and used an apartment in New Orleans, together with three other men, for the purpose of sexual relations with consenting women during off-duty hours. Although the Civil Service Commission sustained the dismissal, the reviewing court did not:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Major's acts were circumspect, indeed clandestine. His place of assignation was in the French Quarter of New Orleans--which boasts itself as "the city that care forgot." His landlord-neighbor was not disturbed. He used the apartment for trysts only when off-duty. The litigants were invited to adduce evidence with respect to the ultimate issues: whatever effect Mr. Major's conduct may have had upon his personal life, his marital relationship, or his piety, was it of a kind that rationally can be said to tend to discredit him or the IRS? Was there a government need, compelling or less stringent, to deal with this kind of employee conduct? They chose to introduce none. There is therefore no evidence that his actions were articulated to arouse, or did in fact arouse, odium for the employee or the IRS. The record demonstrates no rational basis for the conclusion reached by the Appeals Board. Its conclusion is a moral judgment, not a finding, supported by evidence, that the disapproved conduct incurred discredit.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Dismissal of a budget analyst was set aside after the employee was charged with immoral conduct resulting from alleged off-duty homosexual conduct. In <span class="Italic">Norton v. Macy</span>, 417 F.2d 1161, 1165-68 (D.C. Cir. 1969), the court explained that a charge of immoral conduct would not support adverse action without proof of connection to the appellant's work:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Preliminarily, we must reject appellee's contention that once the label "immoral" is plausibly attached to an employee's off-duty conduct, our inquiry into the presence of adequate rational cause for removal is at an end. A pronouncement of "immorality" tends to discourage careful analysis because it unavoidably connotes a violation of divine, Olympian, or otherwise universal standards of rectitude. However, the Civil Service Commission has neither the expertise nor the requisite anointment to make or enforce absolute moral judgments, and we do not understand that it purports to do so. Its jurisdiction is at least confined to the things which are Caesar's, and its avowed standard of "immorality" is no more than "the prevailing mores of our society."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">So construed, "immorality" covers a multitude of sins. Indeed, it may be doubted whether there are in the entire Civil Service many persons so saintly as never to have done any act which is disapproved by the "prevailing mores of our society." Analytical philosophers would distinguish between acts conventionally regarded as morally wrong and acts which are disapproved merely as indecent, repulsive, or unesthetic; but if the Commission makes such a distinction, it is of no benefit to employees, who may assertedly be dismissed for "indecent and disgraceful" conduct as well as for "immorality."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not prepared to say that the Commission could not reasonably find appellant's homosexual advance to be "immoral," "indecent," or "notoriously disgraceful" under dominant conventional norms. But the notion that it could be an appropriate function of the federal bureaucracy to enforce the majority's conventional codes of conduct in the private lives of its employees is at war with elementary concepts of liberty, privacy, and diversity. And whatever we may think of the Government's qualifications to act <span class="Italic">in loco parentis</span> in this way, the statute precludes it from discharging protected employees except for reason related to the <span id="Page_2297"></span>efficiency of the service. Accordingly, a finding that an employee has done something immoral or indecent could support a dismissal without further inquiry only if all immoral or indecent acts of an employee have some ascertainable deleterious effect on the efficiency of the service. The range of conduct which might be said to affront prevailing mores is so broad and varied that we can hardly arrive at any such conclusion without reference to specific conduct. Thus, we think the sufficiency of the charges against appellant must be evaluated in terms of the effects on the service of what in particular he has done or has been shown to be likely to do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case appellee has shown us no such specific connection. Indeed, on the record appellant is at most an extremely infrequent offender, who neither openly flaunts nor carelessly displays his unorthodox sexual conduct in public. Thus, even the potential for the embarrassment the agency fears is minimal. We think the unparticularized and unsubstantiated conclusion that such possible embarrassment threatens the quality of the agency's performance is an arbitrary ground for dismissal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lest there be any doubt, we emphasize that we do not hold that homosexual conduct may never be cause for dismissal of a protected federal employee. Nor do we even conclude that potential embarrassment from an employee's private conduct may in no circumstances affect the efficiency of the service. What we do say is that, if the statute is to have any force, an agency cannot support a dismissal as promoting the efficiency of the service merely by turning its head and crying "shame."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For a contrary view of the connection between service efficiency and dismissal for off-duty sexual activities predating an employee's appointment, refer to <span class="Italic">Dew v. Halaby</span>, 317 F.2d 582 (D.C. Cir. 1963).</p>

We hold that this constitutes substantial evidence supporting the hearing examiner's finding of a nexus between the off-duty conduct and office morale. Certainly Sherman's fellow employees would be justified in placing a new, more meaningful interpretation upon remarks which, although offensive, might previously have been tolerated or dismissed. The atmosphere of fear and mistrust engendered by the combination of the indecent liberties conviction and the harassing commentary and contacts is inherently disruptive of office morale to such extent that it constitutes an impairment of the efficiency of the service.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Removals such as the one at issue here constitute adverse actions covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(1).

<p class="Block-Quote1">As an FBI employee, the appellant was expected to behave in a manner that showed him to be honest and trustworthy, and to "so comport [himself] that [his] activities on and off duty [would] not discredit either [himself] or" the FBI. Manual of Administrative Operations and Procedures, Part I, &#x00A7; 1-1; Airtel of Jan. 3, 1994. According to his division's Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAIC), who served as his first-level and later second-level supervisor, he also was expected "to maintain high standards," and his actions were expected to be "beyond reproach." Furthermore, the appellant was not only an FBI employee, but also a law enforcement officer; and the Board has held that the FBI has the right to hold its special agents to a high standard of conduct. <span class="Italic">Ludlum v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the appellant's failure to live up to these standards caused the ASAIC and others in the agency to lose confidence in the appellant's honesty and integrity, to question his judgment, and to have "much less confidence in his abilities to perform...any job." It also shows that the two FBI employees the appellant taped became aware of the videotapes, that information and rumors regarding the taping spread throughout the division, that the information and rumors were upsetting to both of the employees, that it interfered with their ability to concentrate on their work, and that the ASAIC accordingly needed to spend time counseling them and making sure that they and other employees concentrated on their work rather than on the gossip and rumors related to the videotaping.</p>

DOJ</span>, 565 F.3d 1375, 1377-83 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (following remand and directing further remand, <span class="Italic">Doe v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Doe was initially employed by the FBI in January 1997. Prior to his removal, Doe worked as a Special Agent pilot near an FBI Field Office in Ohio. While Doe was off duty, he had consensual sex with a female member of the FBI's support staff ("Female #1"), whom he was dating. Doe and Female #1 videotaped their sexual encounters, at her suggestion. However, Doe also videotaped his separate consensual sexual encounters at his residence with another female FBI employee ("Female #2") as well as with one woman who was not an employee ("Female #3").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This aspect of Doe's private life came to be known by the FBI through the actions of Female #1. In October 2002, while Doe was out of town, Female #1 entered his house and found the tapes, each with a videotaped partner's name labeled on it. She contacted Doe and together, with the assistance of a professional counselor, they worked out the problems the tapes revealed about their relationship. Later, she shared her concerns with, and revealed the existence of the tapes to, counselors in the FBI Employee Assistance Program. From that point rumors spread about Doe and female co-workers at the FBI, which were upsetting to Female #1 and Female #2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2298"></span>In March 2003, in response to these rumors, the Office of Professional Responsibility ("OPR") of the FBI began to investigate. Doe admitted to videotaping the three women, on occasion, without their knowledge or consent. In March 2004, the OPR concluded that Doe's off-duty behavior, specifically videotaping sexual encounters with women without their consent, was unprofessional conduct and "contrary to the FBI's suitability requirements." In discussing whether Doe's conduct was sanctionable, the OPR decision memorandum stated that Doe's non-consensual taping activities "may have constituted a violation of criminal law." Based on these findings, Doe was removed from employment with the FBI on June 9, 2004. At the time of that decision, the deciding official Jody Weiss, then Deputy Assistant Director of OPR, and Doe's supervisor Gary Klein, Assistant Special Agent in Charge, both believed that Doe's conduct had violated the Ohio state voyeurism law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FBI's Disciplinary Review Board sustained Weiss' decision on June 7, 2005. Doe timely appealed the FBI's removal action to the MSPB. On October 26, 2005, an AJ conducted an evidentiary hearing regarding Doe's removal. In a March 2006 Initial Decision, the AJ reversed the removal, finding no legal nexus between Doe's off-duty personal conduct and "the efficiency of the agency's operation" nor with the performance of Doe's work duties. In his analysis, the AJ found insufficient evidence that Doe's conduct violated Ohio state law and, moreover, held that the FBI's policy regarding the intimate relationships of its employees did not support extending the review of the legality of Doe's conduct in jurisdictions other than the state of Ohio. The AJ found no evidence that Doe ever discussed his videotaping activity with anyone other than Female #1, prior to the April 2003 investigation, nor that Doe had ever shown the tapes to any other person, including Female #1. The AJ held that Doe was neither responsible for the rumors that circulated at the Field Office, nor for any disruption that resulted from those rumors. The FBI was ordered to retroactively restore Doe effective June 9, 2004, and transfer back pay, with interest. In accordance with the interim relief provided by the AJ's order, Doe was reinstated and reassigned to a different FBI location in Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FBI appealed the Initial Decision to the Board. In an August 14, 2006 decision, the Board held that the agency had established a nexus between Doe's conduct and the efficiency of the service. Relying on evidence that Doe's conduct had adversely affected his division's operations and caused his supervisors to lose trust and confidence in him, the Board reversed the Initial Decision and remanded the case for further adjudication. As to the perceived criminality of Doe's conduct, the Board "agree[d] with the administrative judge that it does not appear to have violated any laws of the state in which it occurred." The Board did not analyze what effect the perception that the behavior was criminal had on the decision to remove Doe.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, considering only the propriety of the removal penalty, the AJ mitigated the penalty to a 120-calendar-day (time served) suspension and a directed reassignment at the FBI's option. The AJ found that Doe's conduct was not actionable under section 1 of the FBI's policy, which addresses conduct or relationships involving violations of the law, because it was not criminal. The AJ found that any conduct by Doe that disrupted the FBI's operation, as a violation of section 2 of the FBI's policy, was mitigated by the workplace disruptions caused by others. The AJ further held that the FBI officials' loss of trust and confidence in Doe was "to some extent grounded in the unsubstantiated belief that the appellant's conducted [SIC] violated a local voyeurism statute." Comparing the penalty that Doe had received for his "morally wrongful off-duty conduct in his intimate relationships" against a history of similar cases, the AJ concluded that Doe's removal exceeded the tolerable limits of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FBI then appealed again to the Board, arguing that the AJ erred in finding Doe's removal to be a penalty beyond tolerable bounds of reasonableness. The Board held that intervening acts by others did not absolve Doe of culpability for "clearly dishonest" actions and that his seven-year length of service with no disciplinary record and a history of positive performance reviews did not warrant mitigation. Concluding that the FBI had not failed to weigh any relevant mitigation factors and that Doe's removal was a reasonable penalty, the Board sustained the FBI's removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To sustain the charge of misconduct, the agency must have established by preponderant evidence the existence of a nexus between the employee's misconduct and the work of the agency, i.e., the agency's performance of its functions. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 229 F.3d 1356, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (citing <span class="Italic">Mings v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 813 F.2d 384, 389-90 (Fed. Cir. 1987)). The agency has the burden of proof to establish that the employee's discipline will "promote the efficiency of the service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the penalty, the Board's decision must carefully scrutinize the circumstances that led to Doe's removal, and specifically state its justification for upholding that decision in order for it to be deemed reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1258 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("The Board must...itself precisely articulate the basis for upholding the agency's action. The active process inherent in the precise articulation of any justification as a matter of course requires 'careful' scrutiny of the circumstances: thus, the need for, and legitimacy of, the Board's exercise of its balancing authority with aplomb."). If proper justification does not reveal itself upon careful scrutiny, the agency's penalty cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency's own regulations circumscribe the conduct the agency may investigate and consider as grounds for removal of an employee. Accordingly, the Board decisions have focused on whether or not the FBI's inquiry into Doe's personal affairs, and attendant disciplinary removal, was in accordance with the FBI's personal relationships policy. The FBI policy does not condone disciplinary consideration of an employee's morality in romantic or intimate relationships in the absence of (1) a violation of criminal law, (2) an adverse impact on the agency's ability to perform its responsibilities, or (3) a violation of an internal regulation. Moreover, the policy affirmatively indicates that OPR may investigate conduct of employees in the context of a personal relationship only if that conduct is criminal, stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">OPR does not investigate relationships based upon the morality of romantic or intimate relationships, or upon the marital status or gender of the parties, unless they would realistically be subject to prosecution and thus impact upon the accomplishment of the FBI's mission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Memorandum from Louis Freeh to All Employees (March 27, 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent proffers two arguments to quiet the dissonance apparent between its policy and its investigation into, and subsequent disciplinary decision based on, Doe's personal relationships. The first argument is that even if Doe's conduct was not criminal in the jurisdiction where it took place, it could be elsewhere. We agree with the AJ and the Board that questioning whether Doe's conduct would have been legal if it had occurred in a different jurisdiction, at least in the circumstances of this case, is immaterial to the review of his removal and need not be considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second argument is that there is a duty of agents to behave honestly at all times, and a potential breach of this duty warrants investigation, regardless of whether he employee's underlying conduct was criminal. [1] Although the FBI suitability standards referred to by respondent do not include explicit guidance on whether an agent must behave honestly in all aspects of an agent's life in order to remain employed, the FBI Employee Handbook states that high standards of conduct must be maintained "not only when they are engaged in their official duties but while off duty." <span class="Italic">See also Ludlum v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6; 29 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 278 F.3d 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the FBI has a right to hold its special agents to a high standard of conduct). It was this theory that the Board adopted in its December 4, 2007 decision when it sustained the FBI's removal action. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Dep't of Justice</span>, CH-0752-04-0620-B-1 (holding that "clearly dishonest" conduct is sufficient to trigger investigation and ultimately justify a decision to remove a special agent).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The FBI requires certain suitability standards which must be met for a person to be hired and employed as an agent. Among these are honesty and integrity, which is described as including,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...behavior that shows the person to be honest, trustworthy, self-disciplined, and respectful of laws and regulations; behaviors that display high standards of ethical conduct and actions that are taken without jeopardizing or compromising these standards, even when there are no ramifications for not doing so. Behaviors involve following agency policy and the letter and spirit of the law and avoiding even the appearance of impropriety. This is related to a person's professionalism, ability to maintain a positive image, ability to serve as a role model and represent the FBI positively to others. It can be contrasted with behavior that involves breaking the law and deviating from agency policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">See</span> Manual of Administrative Operations and Procedures ("MAOP"), Part I, Section 21-11.1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We think that the Board's decision cannot be sustained and that a remand is required for two separate reasons. First, the Board has failed to articulate a meaningful standard as to when private dishonesty rises to the level of misconduct that adversely affects the "efficiency of the service." Using only "clearly dishonest" as a standard inevitably risks arbitrary results, as the question of removal would turn on the Board's subjective moral compass. Grounding disciplinary decisions in the nebulous field of comparative morality is too easily used as a <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> justification. The articulation of a meaningful standard is necessary particularly in light of the apparent conflict between the FBI's policy on investigating personal relationships and its policies requiring their agents to act with "[i]ntegrity and [h]onesty." <span class="Italic">Compare</span> Memorandum from Louis Freeh to All Employees (March 27, 2001) <span class="Italic">with</span> MAOP, Part I, Section 21-11.1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2299"></span>This court recognizes the difficulty in drawing a line between the types of conduct that can justify investigation, discipline, and the penalty of removal and those that cannot. Indeed, at oral argument neither party was able to define a meaningful standard. This conundrum does not justify the Board's failure to articulate a meaningful standard. Elsewhere we have acknowledged that misconduct that is private in nature and that does not implicate job performance in any direct and obvious way is often insufficient to justify removal from a civil service position. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 229 F.3d 1356, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Bonet v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 661 F.2d 1071, 1078 (5th Cir. 1981) (it is insufficient for an agency to rely on internal regulations that proscribe in general certain employee conduct, e.g., "immoral" or "disgraceful," as proof of the required nexus between off-duty dishonesty/immorality and the efficiency of the service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without a predetermined standard--e.g., the legality of the conduct--to clarify when the agency may and may not investigate the personal relationships of its employees, it is conceivable that employees could be removed for any number of "clearly dishonest" misrepresentations, from those made to preserve the sanctity of a romantic relationship to cheating in a Friday night poker game. The danger here is twofold; federal employees are not on notice as to what off-duty behavior is subject to investigation and the government could use this overly broad standard to legitimize removals made for personal or political reasons. A clear articulation of a standard is therefore essential to the government's ability to reasonably and legitimately remove an agent for off-duty conduct relating to personal relationships. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Doe v. Hampton</span>, 566 F.2d 265, 272 n.20, 273 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (particularized requirements for removal serve to "minimize unjustified governmental intrusions into the private activities of federal employees" and have become a "leitmotif throughout federal personnel administration" to delimit employment concerns).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Courts have long recognized that, at a minimum, the government is bound to accord due process and set basic substantive limits on its prerogative to remove its employees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Norton v. Macy</span>, 417 F.2d 1161, 1164 (D.C. Cir. 1969) ("The Due Process Clause may also cut deeper into the government's discretion where a dismissal involves an intrusion upon that ill-defined area of privacy which is increasingly if indistinctly recognized as a foundation of several specific constitutional protections.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To allow the Board decision to stand would be to recognize a presumed or <span class="Italic">per se</span> nexus between the conduct and the efficiency of the service. We cannot endorse such an interpretation here, as we agree with the Board that the required nexus is not one that can be presumed based on Doe's conduct "speaking for itself." <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Allred v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 786 F.2d 1128, 1130 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (a presumption of the nexus arises when the misconduct is so egregious that it "speaks for itself," which "places an extraordinary burden on an employee, for it forces him to prove the negative proposition that his retention would not adversely affect the efficiency of the service") (quoting <span class="Italic">Crofoot v. U.S. Gov't Printing Office</span>, 761 F.2d 661, 664 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). The case is remanded so that the Board may articulate a meaningful standard as to when private misconduct that is not criminal rises to the level of misconduct that adversely affects the efficiency of the service, and apply that standard to the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Secondly, we think that the Board has failed to address the fact that the FBI's decisions to sustain the charge and to impose the penalty of removal were influenced at least in part by the assumed criminality of the behavior. It remains unclear to this court whether the deciding officials at the FBI interpreted its policy to <span class="Italic">require</span> a criminal finding, such that they could only investigate Doe if his surreptitious videotaping of his sexual liaisons was criminal. The record indicates that the deciding officials at OPR as well as Doe's own supervisors were under the impression that Doe's conduct violated state voyeurism laws, and was reasonably subject to criminal prosecution. On appeal, the AJ held that Doe's conduct likely did not violate the Ohio state voyeurism law, because Doe had not shown the videotapes to any other person and the females who had been taped waived their right to privacy with respect to Doe. <span class="Italic">See State v. Frost</span>, 634 N.E.2d 272, 272 (Ohio Ct. App. 1994) (holding no violation of Ohio state voyeurism statute when the privacy interest to be protected had been waived by the females who "probably expected to be observed").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Yet, while the Board agreed with the AJ's conclusion that Doe's conduct was not criminal, it failed to examine what role that impression played in the initial decision by the agency to remove Doe based on "clearly dishonest" conduct proscribed by the FBI policy. Because the Board sustained the agency's decision without regard to the violation of law issue, it did not consider whether the FBI would have disciplined Doe absent assumed criminality.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent suggests that it is irrelevant that in imposing discipline the FBI may have been improperly influenced by the assumed criminality of petitioner's conduct, relying on cases holding that the Board reviews the agency's decision <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. The dissent correctly points out that, in the Board context, agency fact finding is subject to <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review by the Board. Thus, in the cases relied on by the dissent, the Board (or arbitrator) was required to determine <span class="Italic">de novo</span> whether the agency acted in bad faith (<span class="Italic">Fucik v. United States</span>, 655 F.2d 1089 (Cl. Ct. 1981)); whether the employee had engaged in sexual harassment (<span class="Italic">Jackson v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 768 F.2d 1325 (Fed. Cir. 1985)); whether the employee was disabled (<span class="Italic">Licausi v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 350 F.3d 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). So too, the Board must determine whether the agency exceeded its authority in determining that the employee's action would adversely affect the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">None of those cases involved a situation where the agency had discretion to impose or not to impose discipline, and the agency had imposed discipline under a mistaken view of the applicable law. As we concluded in <span class="Italic">Fucik</span>, "we believe an agency does have a certain amount of discretion in choosing between two courses of action, one which would involve adverse action procedures and one which would not." 655 F.2d at 1097. Under such circumstances the Board's task is not to make the discretionary decision as to whether discipline is desirable but to determine the facts; assess whether the agency had the authority to impose discipline; and determine whether discipline would have been imposed absent the legal error. As the dissent concedes, in the penalty area the Board must conduct just such an inquiry before sustaining the agency's penalty where the Board sets aside some of the charges on which the penalty is based. Dissent at 2. There is no reason to apply a different approach to the basic question of discipline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case there is no factual dispute and, as described above, we leave it to the Board in the first instance to determine whether the FBI would have authority to discipline Doe for his actions. But even if the FBI could impose discipline, the Board must determine whether the agency would have imposed discipline absent the legal error, i.e., whether the FBI would impose discipline now that the FBI's legal error (the assumed criminality) has been corrected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record indicates that Doe's supervisor and the deciding official lost confidence in Doe's honesty and integrity, questioned his judgment and ability to perform his duties, and found Doe's misconduct serious because they believed it violated Ohio state law. Because it seems probable that Doe was disciplined at least in part because the deciding official mistakenly believed that his misconduct was in violation of the law, it is necessary to know what conclusion the decision makers would have reached, and what penalty they would have imposed, if the possibility that the conduct was criminal was removed from consideration. <span class="Italic">See Hayes,</span> 727 F.2d at 1539 ("it is not our duty to find nexus but rather to decide...whether the [MSPB] affirmance of the agency conclusion on the nexus issue meets the statutory criteria for our affirmance."); <span class="Italic">see also Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (where there are several charges leading to a penalty, and not all the charges are sustained, it is necessary to consider what penalty would have been appropriate in light of the dropped charges).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of a violation of criminal law, the FBI is permitted to discipline an employee for off-duty personal conduct only if the conduct impacts the agency's ability to perform its responsibilities or if the conduct constitutes a violation of an internal regulation. In addition to the remand described above (requiring the Board to articulate and apply a meaningful standard), the case is remanded to the Board to consider whether the agency (1) rendered its decision based on a determination that Doe's conduct satisfied either of those two prongs; and thereafter (2) would have imposed the penalty of removal as an appropriate disciplinary measure, independent of any determination that a violation of criminal law had occurred.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's remand decision did not reinvent the law of nexus. The Board determined that off-duty conduct of a non-criminal nature warrants adverse action, i.e., supports a nexus finding, if the conduct is contrary to the agency mission (and the Board found that Doe's conduct was not contrary to the FBI's mission) or that the conduct had a demonstrable impact on the workplace (and the Board found that Doe's conduct did adversely affect office morale and efficiency). The Board sent the case back to the AJ for evaluation of whether the agency would have removed Doe for the conduct in the absence of consideration by agency officials that the conduct might have violated state laws concerning voyeurism. <span class="Italic">Doe v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DOE_JOHN_CH_0752_04_0620_M_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_470141.pdf">113 MSPR 128</a>, 130-51 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1-36, 2010 MSPB 16 (2010) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Doe v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is before the Board on remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which vacated our final decision and remanded for further proceedings. For the following reasons, we FIND that the agency had the authority to investigate and discipline the appellant for the conduct at issue in this case, FIND that there is a nexus between some of the charged conduct and the efficiency of the service, and REMAND this appeal for further adjudication consistent with this Opinion and Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2300"></span>BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) removed the appellant from his GS-13 Special Agent position based on a charge of "Unprofessional Conduct Videotaping Sexual Encounters With Women Without Their Consent. The agency based the action on the appellant's signed, sworn statements indicating that, while he was employed by the agency, he videotaped his sexual encounters with three women, two of whom worked as support staff in the appellant's division, without their knowledge or consent. In effecting the removal, the agency's deciding official noted that the appellant's actions were contrary to the FBI's suitability requirements, and that "[i]t is your surreptitious violation of the privacy and trust of these women under the most intimate of circumstances that has caused the FBI to deem you unsuitable for continued employment in a position of such trust as that of Special Agent in an agency dedicated to the core values of integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness." In his response to the proposed action, the appellant referenced the FBI's Personal Relationships Policy, which he claimed provided that the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) "does not investigate allegations based upon the morality of romantic or personal relationships, or upon the marital status or gender of the parties, unless they would realistically be subject to prosecution and thus impact upon the accomplishment of the FBI's mission." Nevertheless, in his decision notice the deciding official wrote that "[I]n fact, your non-consensual recording may have constituted a violation of criminal law," and in any event "it is not your relationships with these women but your videotaping them without their knowledge upon which this disciplinary matter is based."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal to the Board, the appellant asserted that there was no connection between his admitted secret recording of the now-destroyed videotapes and his performance as an agent with the FBI, but raised no affirmative defenses such as allegations of discrimination, violation of law, or harmful procedural error. After a hearing, the Board's administrative judge (AJ) reversed the action, finding that the agency proved the factual allegations underlying its charge but did not show by preponderant evidence that discipline promoted the efficiency of the service. The AJ noted several arguments raised by the agency in a memorandum of law as to why its action promoted the efficiency of the service. The AJ found that "[c]oncerning the propriety of imposing discipline for the appellant's admitted off-duty conduct, the agency primarily argues that the appellant's conduct 'appears' to violate the law of the State of Ohio, where the conduct occurred, and that it would have violated the voyeurism laws of other states had the conduct occurred in those jurisdictions." The AJ also noted that the agency "further characterizes the appellant's conduct as 'egregious,' that it directly impacted two employees of the subject Midwestern Division Office, that it was 'blatantly inconsistent' with the FBI's mission," and that it affected the efficiency of the FBI because it violated the agency's suitability standards requiring its employees to conduct themselves with integrity and honesty. Nevertheless, the AJ found, after a review of the applicable Ohio statute, that the agency did not show that the appellant was realistically subject to prosecution based on the admitted facts in the case. The AJ further found that the agency did not identify any impact the appellant's conduct had on the performance of the appellant, any employee, or any aspect of the agency's operation, and did not demonstrate that the appellant "was directly responsible for the release in the agency's Division Office of interpersonal information bearing on...[his intimate or romantic] relationships." Finally, the AJ found that the agency did not distinguish the severity of the appellant's off-duty conduct in his intimate relationships from the conduct of other agents whose actions in their off-duty personal relationships, with their spouses or partners in adulterous affairs, or in paying for the services of prostitutes, had not been found by the agency to form a sufficient nexus with agency operations to warrant discipline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the agency petitioned for review of the initial decision, the Board granted the petition, reversed the initial decision, found that the agency proved by preponderant evidence a nexus between the appellant's conduct and the efficiency of the service, and remanded the appeal for further adjudication. <span class="Italic">Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 135, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 6 (2006). The Board noted that under its case law an agency may establish a nexus between off-duty misconduct and the efficiency of the service by showing that the employee's conduct (1) affected the employee's or his coworkers' job performance, (2) affected management's trust and confidence in the employee's job performance, or (3) interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 7. The Board found that although it appeared that the appellant had not violated a law in the state in which the conduct occurred, his conduct was "clearly dishonest" and the FBI required its employees to behave in an honest and trustworthy manner and to comport themselves on and off duty so as not to discredit themselves or the FBI. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9. The Board found that the appellant's failure to live up to those standards caused his supervisor and other employees to lose confidence in his honesty and integrity, question his judgment, and have much less confidence in his ability to perform any job. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10. The Board further found that the two FBI employees the appellant videotaped became aware of the tapes, information and rumors regarding the videotaping spread throughout the division, the information and rumors were upsetting to both of the employees and interfered with their ability to concentrate on their work, and the Assistant Special Agent in Charge needed to spend time counseling them and making sure that they and other employees concentrated on their work rather than on the gossip and rumors related to the videotaping. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board noted that although the appellant did not divulge the existence of the tapes to his coworkers, the agency did not charge him with such action; rather, the agency charged him with admittedly improper conduct that, when discovered and disclosed to others, predictably and understandably caused emotional distress to the FBI employees he had videotaped, adversely affected his division's operations, and caused his supervisors to lose trust and confidence in him. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 11. The Board also noted that although the FBI's Personal Relationships Policy provided that OPR "does not investigate allegations based upon the morality of romantic or intimate relationships, or upon the marital status or gender of the parties, unless they would realistically be subject to prosecution and thus impact upon the accomplishment of the FBI's mission," the agency did not base its charge on the morality of the appellant's relationships with the women he videotaped; instead, it based its charge on conduct in which the appellant engaged during those relationships. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12. The Board concluded that "even if the policy could be construed as limiting the agency's ability to establish nexus,...it does not preclude a finding of nexus in this case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the AJ mitigated the penalty of removal to a 120-day suspension and a directed reassignment, at the agency's option, of the appellant to another agency field office. The agency petitioned for review, and the appellant cross-petitioned for review of that initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 1 (2007), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded</span>, 565 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2009). In its final decision, the Board granted the agency's petition for review, denied the appellant's cross-petition for review, and sustained the removal action, finding that the penalty of removal was not so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the appellant's misconduct that it amounted to an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review of the Board's final decision, the court vacated both the Board's determination that the action promoted the efficiency of the service and the Board's ruling regarding the reasonableness of the penalty of removal, and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion. <span class="Italic">Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, 565 F.3d 1375, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The court first noted that the agency's own regulations circumscribed the conduct the agency could investigate and consider as grounds for removal of an employee, and that the Board's decisions had focused on whether the FBI's inquiry into the appellant's personal affairs, and the attendant disciplinary removal, were in accordance with the FBI's Personal Relationships Policy. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1379. The court held that the FBI's policy did not condone disciplinary consideration of an employee's morality in romantic or intimate relationships in the absence of (1) a violation of criminal law, (2) an adverse impact on the agency's ability to perform its responsibilities, or (3) a violation of an internal regulation, and that the policy indicated that OPR "may investigate conduct of employees in the context of a personal relationship only if that conduct is criminal...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court found that although the Board had held that the appellant's clearly dishonest off-duty conduct was sufficient to trigger the agency's investigation and justify the removal decision, the Board had failed to articulate a meaningful standard as to "when private dishonesty rises to the level of misconduct that adversely affects the 'efficiency of the service,'" that using only "clearly dishonest" as a standard risked arbitrary results, and that the articulation of a standard was necessary particularly in light of the "apparent conflict between the FBI's policy on investigating personal relationships and its policies requiring their agents to act with '[I]ntegrity and [h]onesty.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1380. The court noted that "[w]ithout a predetermined standard--.e.g., the legality of the conduct--to clarify when the agency may and may not investigate the personal relationships of its employees, it is conceivable that employees could be removed for any number of 'clearly dishonest' misrepresentations, from those made to preserve the sanctity of a romantic relationship to cheating in a Friday night poker game." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1381. The court held that "[T]o allow the Board decision to stand would be to recognize a presumed or <span class="Italic">per se</span> nexus between the conduct and the efficiency of the service," and that it could not endorse such an interpretation because the required nexus was not one that can be presumed based on the appellant's conduct "speaking for itself." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the court remanded the case so that the Board "may articulate a meaningful standard as to when private misconduct that is not criminal rises to the level of misconduct that adversely affects the efficiency of the service, and apply that standard to the facts of this case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court further held that the Board had failed to address the fact that the FBI's decision to sustain the charge and to impose the penalty of <span id="Page_2301"></span>removal was influenced "at least in part by the assumed criminality of the behavior." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court found that it remained unclear whether "the deciding officials at the FBI interpreted its policy to require a criminal finding, such that they could only investigate Doe if his surreptitious videotaping of his sexual liaisons was criminal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court found that the "deciding officials" at OPR as well as the appellant's own supervisors were "under the impression that Doe's conduct violated state voyeurism laws, and was reasonably subject to criminal prosecution," and that "while the Board agreed with the AJ's conclusion that Doe's conduct was not criminal, it failed to examine what role that impression played in the initial decision by the agency to remove Doe based on 'clearly dishonest' conduct proscribed by the FBI policy." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1381-82. Thus, the court held that "[b]ecause the Board sustained the agency's decision without regard to the violation of law issue, it did not consider whether the FBI would have disciplined Doe absent assumed criminality." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1382. Accordingly, the court indicated that the Board must determine whether the agency exceeded its authority in determining that the employee's action would adversely affect the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. More specifically, the court held that the Board must (1) determine whether the FBI had the authority to discipline the appellant for his actions, and (2) even if it could impose discipline, determine whether the agency would have imposed discipline "absent the legal error, i.e., whether the FBI would impose discipline now that the FBI's legal error (the assumed criminality) has been corrected." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, noting that the record indicated that the appellant's supervisor and the deciding official had lost confidence in the appellant's honesty and integrity, questioned his judgment and ability to perform his duties, and found his misconduct serious because they believed it violated Ohio state law, the court noted that "[b]ecause it seems probable that Doe was disciplined at least in part because the deciding official mistakenly believed that his misconduct was in violation of the law, it is necessary to know what conclusion the decision makers would have reached, and what penalty they would have imposed, if the possibility that the conduct was criminal was removed from consideration." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1382-83. The court held that in the absence of a violation of criminal law, the FBI was permitted to discipline an employee for off-duty personal conduct only if the conduct impacted the agency's ability to perform its responsibilities or if the conduct constituted a violation of an internal regulation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1383. Thus, the court remanded the case to the Board to consider "whether the agency (1) rendered its decision based on a determination that Doe's conduct satisfied either of those two prongs; and thereafter (2) would have imposed the penalty of removal as an appropriate disciplinary measure, independent of any determination that a violation of criminal law had occurred." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">ANALYSIS</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency had the authority to investigate and discipline the appellant for the conduct at issue in this case.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency is required to act in accordance with the procedures it adopts for itself, and the Board will enforce employee rights derived from such rules, regulations, policies, and collective bargaining agreements. <span class="Italic">Campbell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 273, 279 (1997); <span class="Italic">see Hudson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 398, &#x00B6; 6 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 15 Fed. Appx. 812 (Fed. Cir. 2001). For example, if an agency's policy prohibits it from disciplining an employee under certain circumstances, the Board will find that such a charge cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Sadowski v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 655, 658 (1989) (the agency improperly charged the appellant with both AWOL and abuse of sick leave because a management instruction prohibited the use of more than one offense to describe a single incident). Here, many of the issues raised in the court's decision remanding this case to the Board relate to the agency's "Personal Relationships Policy," which is set forth in a March 27, 2001 memorandum sent to all employees by former FBI Director Louis J. Freeh. In pertinent part, that policy provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">The private lives of FBI employees, and their relationships with others, are subject to inquiry by the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) only when the conduct may: (1) negatively impact upon the ability of the Bureau to perform its responsibilities; (2) violate the law; or (3) violate an internal regulation.</span> Current manual provisions prohibit certain conduct, such as sexual harassment, but do not provide overall guidance on how personal relationships may involve misconduct subject to discipline. The following policy statement is intended to inform employees of harmful institutional consequences which can result from personal relationships and require disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1. CONDUCT OR RELATIONSHIPS INVOLVING VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Off-duty conduct which violates federal, state, or local law or involves law enforcement contact is reportable to OPR because it has a direct connection with the FBI's law enforcement mission and its need to maintain an effective and respected workforce. Employees are subject to discipline for offenses involving prostitution, public indecency, sexual assault, statutory rape, domestic violence, bigamy, and other violations which are prosecuted under the criminal law of the jurisdiction where they are committed. <span class="Italic">OPR does not investigate allegations based upon the morality of romantic or intimate relationships, or upon the marital status or gender of the parties, unless they would realistically be subject to prosecution and thus impact upon accomplishment of the FBI's mission.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2. MISUSE OR COMPROMISE OF GOVERNMENT POSITION, PREMISES, PROPERTY, WORKING HOURS, OR OTHER INTERESTS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">While normal interaction between employees in the workplace may involve reasonable discussion of social contacts during nonduty hours, the guiding rule is that personal relationships are to be pursued on personal time with personal resources. Unauthorized passengers may not be transported in FBI vehicles. Personal acquaintances may not be permitted improper access to FBI space. Physical intimacies in a government workspace or vehicle, or while on duty, are inappropriate and unprofessional. <span class="Italic">Employees must not allow their personal relationships to disrupt the workplace, compromise the interests of the government, or make them subject to manipulation.</span> For example, romantic or intimate relationships between a Special Agent and a current informant, witness, or subject are prohibited because they may negatively impact upon the credibility of the persons involved and of the overall investigation and prosecution, or make the Agent vulnerable to improper pressure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the FBI policy provides that the private life of an FBI employee like the appellant is subject to inquiry by OPR when conduct "may" negatively impact upon the ability of the FBI to perform its responsibilities, violate the law, or violate an internal regulation.[1] Because the policy does not define the term "may," the ordinary, contemporary, common meaning of the word applies. <span class="Italic">See Augustine v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 429 F.3d 1334, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Pugach v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 46 F.3d 1081, 1083 (Fed. Cir. 1995). We find that the ordinary, contemporary, common meaning of the term "may," within the context of the FBI policy in this case, "indicate[s] possibility or probability," and refers to a "reasonable possibility." Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 717 (10th ed. 2002); <span class="Italic">see Christiania General Ins. Corp. of New York v. Great American Ins. Co.</span>, 979 F.2d 268, 276 (2d Cir. 1992) (a provision requiring notice when it "appears likely" that a claim will or "may" involve a policy does not require a probability much less a certainty that the policy at issue will be involved; all that is required is a "reasonable possibility" of such happening, based on an objective assessment of the information available). This interpretation makes sense because the FBI may not be certain that a law or regulation has been violated, or that its ability to perform its responsibilities has been negatively impacted, until an inquiry has been conducted. Moreover, this interpretation is consistent with the opinion of the deciding official in this case, Jody Weis, who testified that OPR could intervene in a matter if an employee's on- or off-duty conduct disrupted the office such that people were not working as a result. Hearing Transcript (HT) at 77, 134-35 (testimony of Weis that "if it's disrupting the office, if the function of the office, if the office's effectiveness and efficiency is disrupted because of [legal, off-duty, personal sexual] behavior, I believe our personal relationship policy would allow us to look into that if it was referred to us"), 136-39 (testimony of Weis that despite the policy statement that OPR does not investigate the morality of relationships, OPR could still investigate the matter if a personal relationship disrupted the workplace or compromised the interests of the government). The Personal Relationships Policy clearly states that employees must not allow their personal relationships to disrupt the workplace.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In contrast to this provision, which specifically addresses when conduct that takes place within the private lives of FBI employees is subject to inquiry, the policy statement that "OPR does not investigate allegations based upon the morality of romantic or intimate relationships, or upon the marital status or gender of the parties, unless they would realistically be subject to prosecution and thus impact upon accomplishment of the FBI's mission," addresses the morality of a relationship, which is not at issue in this case. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hall v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 682, 119 (2006) (the whole of a statute should be considered in determining its meaning, and statutory provisions should be read in harmony, leaving no provision inoperative, superfluous, redundant, or contradictory). The charge against the appellant was not based on the morality of his relationships, i.e., whether it was immoral to be dating the women in question, but on conduct in which the appellant engaged during those relationships.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, even assuming that there was no reasonable possibility that the appellant's conduct violated a law, we find that there was at least a reasonable possibility that the appellant's actions of videotaping his sexual encounters with three women without their consent, two of whom worked for the agency, negatively impacted the agency's ability <span id="Page_2302"></span>to perform its responsibilities and violated an internal regulation.[2] In this regard, the record indicates that the two FBI employees the appellant videotaped without their consent became aware of the tapes, that information and rumors regarding the videotaping spread throughout the division, that the information and rumors were upsetting to both of the employees, that it interfered with their ability to concentrate on their work, and that the Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAIC), Gary Klein, needed to spend time counseling them and making sure that they and other employees concentrated on their work rather than on the gossip and rumors related to the videotaping. Thus, because the appellant's conduct "may" have negatively impacted the ability of the FBI to perform its responsibilities and violated an internal regulation, the agency was not prohibited under the Personal Relationships Policy from investigating and disciplining the appellant for the unprofessional conduct set forth in the agency's charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Weis found that the appellant's conduct violated numerous policies and regulations, including the Manual of Administrative Operations and Procedures, which he described as stating in relevant part that "the Bureau expects its employees to so comport themselves that their activities on and off duty will not discredit either themselves or the Bureau," that "[e]mployees shall endeavor to avoid any actions creating the appearance that they are violating the law or the ethical standards promulgated pursuant to this order," and that employees may be dismissed for violating suitability standards relating to honesty, integrity, and judgment. Weis also referenced the FBI Employee Handbook, which he quoted as stating that the FBI "expects and requires that high standards of personal conduct on the part of its employees be maintained not only when they are engaged in their official duties but while off duty," that employees should avoid any activity or situation which could be misinterpreted or misunderstood to the detriment of the FBI, that conduct must not only be proper but always appear proper, and that employees who fail to uphold such values as reliability, trustworthiness, honesty, and integrity will be subject to administrative action up to and including dismissal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">This case must be remanded for further development of the record with respect to the issue of whether the agency would have disciplined the appellant, and would have decided on the penalty of removal if it decided to discipline him, absent the "legal error" of assuming that his conduct was criminal.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that the agency had the authority to discipline the appellant for "Unprofessional Conduct-Videotaping Sexual Encounters With Women Without Their Consent," we next address the issue of whether the agency would have imposed discipline "absent the legal error, i.e., whether the FBI would impose discipline now that the FBI's legal error (the assumed criminality) has been corrected." <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 565 F.3d at 1382.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its proposal notice, the agency addressed in detail its evidence supporting the charge and asserted that the appellant's conduct violated numerous policies and regulations. The agency also asserted, however, that the appellant's pursuit of professional counseling regarding his actions in the matter did not excuse or explain "your having videotaped women without their knowledge or consent, in apparent violation of state law...." As set forth above, Weis indicated in response to an argument raised by the appellant that "[I]n fact, your non-consensual recording may have constituted a violation of criminal law."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, testimony provided by the proposing and deciding officials at the hearing reflects that the agency may have disciplined the appellant "at least in part because the deciding official mistakenly believed that [the appellant's] misconduct was in violation of the law...." <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 565 F.3d at 1383 (emphasis added). The proposing official, Mary Rook, testified that she "ha[d] concerns" that the appellant committed a crime when he surreptitiously videotaped females having sex with him, and that "[w]e believe that he had violated an Ohio statute regarding voyeurism." She testified that based on what she knew and her reading of the statute, she "ha[d] concerns" that the appellant committed a crime. She testified that she understood that the appellant was not prosecuted because the videotapes had been destroyed. Rook testified that the appellant's conduct was unprofessional because "he appears to have violated state law..., [h]e violated the tenets of what it means to be a Special Agent of the FBI[,] [h]e lacked integrity, he lacked judgment, he lacked trustworthiness, all of which we consider in viewing whether a person is suitable for employment as [a] Special Agent with the FBI. She further testified that "[t]he fact that [the appellant] apparently violated the law even though it was just the state law, that's of no consequence. He violated a law and was sworn to uphold the law. So, what he did was inconsistent with what our mission is. Rook testified that after the appellant made his oral response to the proposal notice, Weis concluded that the appropriate discipline was termination because he had committed a crime. Whether or not it was charged, the actions were the same, that he had violated the trust of these women, he had invaded their privacy, he had failed to demonstrate the integrity and the trustworthiness and the judgment that we expect of all our agents."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When asked whether she decided that there was a violation of law without knowing what the prosecutor's assessment of the case was and whether the prosecutor had accurate information, Rook testified that "we reached our assessment without regard because in OPR whether the case is prosecuted or not really doesn't impact, because the prosecutor looks at other things than whether the law was technically violated and a jury appeal case and all those kinds of things we don't consider that. We look at the conduct. Was it a violation of the statutes. It appeared that it was. She testified that the agency relied upon the content of the Ohio statute, without regard to interpretation, that "[i]t appears on its face to be a violation," and that the appellant's conduct appeared to violate the law. Finally, Rook testified with respect to this issue that she proposed the appellant's removal because she felt that it appeared to her that the appellant's actions violated state law. She also testified, however, that the agency did not do any research to determine how the statute was applied by the state, and that she had no state case law to show that the statute has been applied by a state prosecutor "in the circumstances where the person was in the room consensually, in a consensual intimate relationship with the offender."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Weis testified that he had concerns that the appellant had committed a crime when he surreptitiously videotaped females having sex with him, specifically, an Ohio statute regarding voyeurism. He further testified that if the appellant had been in a state that did not have a voyeurism statute, he was not sure if that would have made a difference, and that "[t]here wouldn't have been a crime that would have maybe brought us to this, there wouldn't have been the appearance of criminal activity that would have brought [us] to it, however we still have the actions that took place, which I feel, although they are criminal in nature, he was never charged. Weis testified that he believed there was an invasion of privacy under the Ohio voyeurism statute, but that even if there was no violation of law, the agency could look into what an employee does in his bedroom if it "works itself into an FBI office and disrupts the office." He testified that he was not curious as to whether the Ohio statute applied to a situation where the surreptitious taping had taken place between consenting adults, and that "[w]e were looking simply if they were going to prosecute him, once they declined, we simply, we looked at the behavior involving those instances and compared it to our suitability standards. He testified that the agency also looked at the statute to determine if the appellant's behavior, although not charged, would have been criminal, or at least had the appearance of criminality, and concluded that "I felt that it did, and...at least two attorneys took a cut at that and felt that the behavior was criminal, although not charged."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of whether the agency would have disciplined the appellant at all, let alone imposed the penalty of removal, absent the assumed criminality of his conduct, was not addressed by the parties below or directly asked of the key witnesses in this case. Regarding the issue of whether the agency would have disciplined the appellant absent its "legal error," an AJ who observes the demeanor of the witnesses is in the best position to assess the credibility of those witnesses on this issue. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Posey v. Department of Defense</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 472, &#x00B6; 13 (2007). Accordingly, we remand this case for further adjudication consistent with this decision and with the court's opinion in Doe, including the submission of evidence on this issue and a hearing if requested by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Efficiency of the Service Standard</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court instructed the Board to "articulate a meaningful standard as to when private misconduct that is not criminal rises to the level of misconduct that adversely affects the efficiency of the service, and apply that standard to the facts of this case." <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 565 F.3d at 1381. The court indicated that using only "clearly dishonest" as a standard risked arbitrary results, "as the question of removal would turn on the Board's subjective moral compass." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1380.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), an agency may remove an employee "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. 752.403(a) (an agency may take an adverse action only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service). In <span class="Italic">Kruger v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 71, 74 (1987), the Board held that an agency may show a nexus between off-duty misconduct and the efficiency of the service by three means: (1) a rebuttable presumption in certain egregious circumstances; (2) preponderant evidence that the misconduct adversely affects the appellant's or coworkers' job performance or the agency's trust and confidence in the appellant's job performance; or (3) preponderant evidence that the misconduct interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission. A nexus under the third category may be proven by showing that an employee engaged in off-duty misconduct that is directly opposed to the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Id.; see Brown v. Department of the Navy</span>, 229 F.3d 1356, 1360-61 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The general principles underlying the standard set forth in Kruger have <span id="Page_2303"></span>been applied in situations involving non-criminal, dishonest, off-duty misconduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 211, 243 (1995) (finding a sufficient nexus between the off-duty misconduct of making false accusations against former coworkers and the efficiency of the service where the agency lost confidence in the appellant's ability to perform his duties as a criminal investigator), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 99 F.3d 1160 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table); <span class="Italic">Cornish v. Department of Commerce</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 382, 383-85 (1982) (finding a nexus between the appellant's failure to meet his debt obligations and his identification of the agency as his employer in connection with his off-duty misconduct, and the efficiency of the service), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 718 F.2d 1098 (6th Cir. 1983) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the court has held that this case does not involve egregious circumstances giving rise to a rebuttable presumption of nexus. <span class="Italic">See Doe</span>, 565 F.3d at 1381 ("we agree with the Board that the required nexus is not one that can be presumed based on Doe's conduct 'speaking for itself"). Moreover, we find that the appellant's conduct in this case is not directly opposed to the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Cf. Brown</span>, 229 F.3d at 1358-1361 (finding nexus where an area program manager for a Marine Corps Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Department engaged in an adulterous relationship with the wife of a Marine assigned to a unit supported by the manager while the Marine was deployed overseas); <span class="Italic">Allred v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 786 F.2d 1128, 1131-32 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (finding nexus based on an accountant's conviction for off-duty child molestation, given that the mission of the agency was to administer health and social services to disadvantaged persons like the victim of Mr. Allred's offense); <span class="Italic">Wild v. U.S. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 692 F.2d 1129, 1131-34 (7th Cir. 1982) (finding nexus based on a HUD appraiser's off-duty actions as manager of deteriorated rental properties). The agency has not alleged or shown, for example, that its mission included preventing the surreptitious, non-criminal videotaping of consensual sexual encounters. Thus, a finding of nexus may be established in this case if preponderant evidence shows that the misconduct affected the appellant's or his coworkers' job performance or management's trust and confidence in the appellant's job performance. <span class="Italic">See Kruger</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. at 74.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that in <span class="Italic">Norton v. Macy</span>, 417 F.2d 1161, 1164 (D.C. Cir. 1969), the court, observing that "[t]he Due Process Clause may...cut deeper into the government's discretion where a dismissal involves an intrusion upon that ill-defined area of privacy which is...a foundation of several specific constitutional protections," reversed the removal of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration budget analyst on alleged grounds of "immoral conduct" and of possessing personality traits that rendered him "unsuitable for government employment." The court found that the employee's homosexual advance toward a stranger while off duty had been proven as alleged, but concluded that the discharge was unlawful because the record established no "reasonable connection" between the evidence against him and the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1162. The Norton court reasoned that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the notion that it could be an appropriate function of the federal bureaucracy to enforce the majority's conventional codes of conduct in the private lives of its employees is at war with elementary concepts of liberty, privacy, and diversity. And whatever we may think of the Government's qualifications to act in <span class="Italic">loco parentis</span> in this way, the statute precludes it from discharging protected employees except for a reason related to the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1165. In finding that an agency must demonstrate some "rational basis" for its conclusion that a discharge will promote the efficiency of the service, the court held that the sufficiency of the charges "must be evaluated in terms of the effects on the service of what in particular he has done or has been shown likely to do." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1164, 1166. The only justification for removal mentioned by the agency in Norton was the possibility of embarrassment to the agency. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1167. Under these circumstances, the court found that the agency did not show any "reasonably foreseeable, specific connection between [the] employee's potentially embarrassing conduct and the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following <span class="Italic">Norton</span>, private sexual conduct involving only consenting adults was similarly found to be unrelated to service efficiency in <span class="Italic">Mindel v. U.S. Civil Service Commission</span>, 312 F. Supp. 485, 488 (N.D. Cal. 1970), in which a district court reversed the removal of a postal clerk for cohabiting with a woman to whom he was not married, finding that there was no "rational nexus" between such conduct and the duties of a postal clerk. In <span class="Italic">Major v. Hampton</span>, 413 F. Supp. 66, 67-68, 71 (E.D. La. 1976), a district court reversed the removal of an Internal Revenue Service return examiner for maintaining a separate apartment for discreet off-duty extramarital affairs, again finding a lack of nexus because the government did not introduce evidence that the employee's actions "were calculated to arouse, or did in fact arouse, odium for the employee or the IRS." The <span class="Italic">Major</span> court noted that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]he examiner and the Appeals Review Board appear to have assumed that a person's moral character is homogeneous: those who behave improperly in one regard are likely to transgress in others. But this is both a logical non-sequitur and a psychological error....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A person may have impeccable sexual standards--or indeed be celibate--and yet steal. On the other hand, thieves may be faithful to their wives and attend religious services regularly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">413 F. Supp. at 71 n.4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The above cases are distinguishable from the instant case because the off-duty conduct in those cases did not affect the job performance of other agency employees and did not otherwise disrupt the workforce. Moreover, the agency in this case did not base its action on the appellant's status or on conduct that is protected by some law, rule, regulation, or policy. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, Exec. Order No. 13,087, 3 C.F.R. 191 (1999), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e note (2008) (prohibiting discrimination in federal employment because of sexual orientation). Rather, it relied on off-duty conduct involving other agency employees that affected those employees' job performance and the efficiency of the workplace. As proven by the agency, the appellant videotaped his sexual encounters with two FBI employees, identified in the record as Female No. 1 and Female No. 2, without their consent. As set forth more fully below, we find that there is a nexus between the appellant's conduct as it related to Female No. 1 and Female No. 2 and the efficiency of the service. These employees became aware of the tapes, information and rumors regarding the videotaping spread throughout the division, the information and rumors were upsetting to both of the employees and interfered with their ability to concentrate on their work, and ASAIC Klein needed to spend time counseling them and making sure that they and other employees concentrated on their work, rather than on the gossip and rumors related to the videotaping.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency submitted signed, sworn statements from the two FBI employees who were videotaped by the appellant without their consent. In her written statement, Female No. 1 averred that she understood that the agency was conducting an administrative inquiry regarding an allegation that the appellant "engaged in unprofessional conduct by surreptitiously videotaping sexual encounters with various... Division female support employees, possibly without their consent," that she started dating the appellant in September 2001, and that they became engaged in February 2003. She indicated that in the fall of 2002, she was staying at the appellant's house while he was out of town, decided to watch an unlabeled videotape she found in the appellant's bedroom, and discovered that it was a videotape of her and the appellant having sex on an occasion on which she had not consented to the videotaping.[3] Female No. 1 found a box in the appellant's closet that contained videotapes with the names of other females written on them, including Female No. 2, who worked in the same agency office and previously dated the appellant, and Female No. 3, whose name Female No. 1 did not recognize. Female No. 1 wrote that "I was very upset about finding the videotapes of the other women and felt devastated because he not only had made tapes with other women, but had kept them." She indicated that "[t]here have been a lot of rumors at the office about the videotapes as a result of me telling some friends what I had found," and that "[t]hese rumors have now gotten out of control."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Female No. 1 had consented to being videotaped by the appellant during sexual encounters with him that occurred prior to and after the videotape that was made without her consent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Female No. 2 averred that she understood that the agency was conducting an administrative inquiry regarding an allegation that the appellant had engaged in unprofessional conduct by surreptitiously videotaping sexual encounters with various female support employees possibly without their consent. She wrote that in January 2003 she heard rumors that Female No. 1 had made a complaint about the appellant videotaping himself having sex with other women, and that she was one of the women on the tapes. Female No. 2 indicated that she had never discussed videotaping the sexual encounter with the appellant, and "[t]here is no way that he would have thought that I agreed to being videotaped having sex with him." She further averred that a special agent in the office recently asked her if she was okay, asked "Are you sure?" when she replied that she was okay, and "[t]he fact that he was asking me this and the tone of his voice made me believe that he knew about the videotapes and may have seen them." Female No. 2 indicated that the appellant may have shown the videotapes to other employees or put them on the Internet, she was "very upset about the rumors going around the office about me being videotaped with [the appellant] having sex," she approached the Acting Assistant Special Agent in Charge about her concerns, and she received a "disturbing" message on her voice mail at work from a special agent she dated after she had dated the appellant. In this voice mail message, the special agent referenced the videotapes and "made a comment about my children being proud of me. I have been very upset coming to work everyday because of these rumors in the office."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency submitted a signed, sworn statement from an agency employee indicating that he and Female No. 1 were friends, that in the <span id="Page_2304"></span>fall of 2002 Female No. 1 "came to work and she was shaken up about an incident that had occurred that weekend," and she confided in the coworker regarding her discovery of the videotapes. The coworker wrote that Female No. 1's "story went on for several days," that she "kept telling me more and more every day," and that "[i]t was obvious she was shaken up because it was all she wanted to talk about." Another coworker indicated that Female No. 1 talked to her and four other employees about the videotapes, and that "[t]here have been a lot of rumors around the office because [Female No. 1] told people and she didn't think they would say anything."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his assessment of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, Klein wrote that rumors about the appellant's situation were widespread throughout the division, and that "[t]his has been disruptive to the Division." He recommended that the appellant receive a disciplinary transfer and up to a 30-day suspension, but noted that OPR ultimately determines the penalty in disciplinary cases. He testified during a deposition that the appellant's conduct led to an OPR investigation, and that the presence of OPR investigators in the office "was certainly very disruptive, and they interviewed probably at least a half-a-dozen employees, and there were a number of or many other employees who expected to be interviewed." Klein testified that while OPR was in the office it was a subject of conversation as to what had happened and who had been talked to, and "just a lot of rumors and a lot of disruption" during regular business hours. He further testified that there was a lot of disruption in the workplace, it was the topic of conversation throughout the office, he had frequent visitors in his office and telephone calls from "quite a few of the parties involved who were upset about reputations, and about a delay, and the feeling that OPR and the administrative process was not proceeding quickly enough." Klein testified that there were relationship issues, "problems between employees...were getting pretty serious, and allegations of misconduct were being made against other employees," such as the telephone message left for Female No. 2 by a coworker informing her that she had disgraced her family and should be ashamed of herself. He testified that Female No. 2 approached him on many occasions concerning the appellant's conduct, her concern about her reputation, and her belief that "people in the office thought less of her, and that she had done something wrong, and that she was just very upset about this." Klein "constantly told her that she did not do anything wrong, and that she had nothing to be ashamed of," and counseled her and Female No. 1 not to talk about the matter in the office. Klein testified that he believed that Female No. 1 and Female No. 2 were talking to other employees about the matter and making statements that were upsetting to other parties, and that Female No. 1 told Klein that she was thinking about obtaining a lawyer and filing a lawsuit against a number of people because of various things that she felt had or had not taken place. He estimated that he and Female No. 2 spent 3 or 4 hours discussing the appellant's conduct, and that Female No. 2 continued to be a good employee, "but it obviously disrupted her life," and "[p]sychologically, she seemed to be very bothered much of the time, and obviously she did not devote her entire energies to her work." Klein testified that his productivity was affected because it took a lot of his time to deal with the problems caused by the appellant's conduct, counsel people, and "try to make sure that people concentrated on their work and not on these allegations."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding Female No. 1, Klein testified that she came to see him approximately six times, he spent approximately 3 or 4 hours with her, and that both Female No. 1 and Female No. 2 spoke with the Special Agent in Charge on a number of occasions about the appellant's conduct. The productivity of Female No. 1 was affected because she "obviously devoted a lot of her energies...to this matter," she spent a lot of time with Klein about it, "there were a lot of complaints about her from other employees that she was talking about this," and "it was just something for many months [that] was the principal focus of a lot of energies and attention in the office." Klein spent "a lot" of time talking to Female No. 1, trying to reassure her, and advising her on various aspects of the matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Klein testified that a female employee who had dated the appellant but had not had any sexual encounters with him met with Klein twice for approximately 20 minutes because her husband, who was also an employee in the office, was upset about the allegations relating to the female employee's prior relationship with the appellant. Klein testified that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">she told me that her husband was upset, and I offered and because she knew that she was going to be interviewed, or probably interviewed, I told her that we could make this very private, and if she was concerned about other employees in the office being aware that she was interviewed, and that that could be arranged.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I also offered to talk to her husband, and she told me no, that that would not be necessary. And she told me that her husband was very upset about the rumors that were going around the office about her alleged relationship with [the
 appellant].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This female employee's productivity was affected because it "took away from her activities in the normal course of business," and it "obviously affected her relationship with her husband," and although Klein did not know how much time was involved or how serious it was, the female employee was concerned enough to bring it to his attention. Klein testified that his productivity was affected in addressing this female employee's concerns because "it just meant that I spent more time involved in counseling sessions and administrative matters, rather than in investigative matters, or supervising other programs in the office." Further, he testified that the agency's media coordinator informed him that a major newspaper with a large circulation in Ohio had sought details from the media coordinator about the allegations made against the appellant. Klein testified that the appellant's relationship with the employees in the office was affected because his reputation was adversely affected. On cross-examination, Klein testified that Female No. 2, who was a professional support employee, ensured that telephone bills were paid and that equipment and supplies for agents were ordered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rook, who was the Chief of the Adjudication Unit in OPR and the proposing official in this case, testified that "[t]his matter caused a huge disruption in the...Division...[and] became the subject of a lot of rumors, a lot of gossip within the office and apparently was very disruptive in the workplace." She testified that she knew about this disruption based upon the witness statements she had read and input from Klein, and that the appellant's actions had an impact on the work performance of at least one employee, apparently Female No. 2, who mentioned this in her written statement. Rook testified that the disruption in the office manifested itself due to a lot of gossip that "grew to the point that...there were rumors of group sex and orgies and video taping," that Female No. 2 received a telephone call from another agent who told her that her children must be "real proud" of her, and that Female No. 2 "said that she dreaded going to work" and was very embarrassed and humiliated. She testified that according to Klein no one wanted to work with the appellant, which would have disrupted the office, and although she did not know whether there was any particular interference with an investigation or report processing or mission activity as a result, "based on my experience as an agent working with other agents I think it would impact operations."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Weis, Acting Assistant Director of OPR and the deciding official in this case, testified that the matter was referred to OPR because it was creating a disruption in the workplace. Weis testified that Female No. 2 was</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">very upset about this. She was very concerned who [the appellant] may have shown this to, and again, I don't know if he showed it to anybody or not, he said he didn't, I have no reason not to believe him on that, but here you have an individual who when she learns that she was taped without consent, she's terrified. You know, she's a single mother of three, she has no idea that she's been videotaped, she's concerned about it getting on the Internet, she's getting calls from people at work because this entered into the workplace, which she feels is very damaging to her. So you have somebody whose life has kind of been turned upside down, all because one individual wanted to make these tapes without this other, I'm going to use the term "victim['] s" consent, for his personal gratification. So I don't see where his actions show a lot of care and a lot of concern for these women's well being after the fact.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that unbeknownst to him, his conduct did "spill over into the office. In this regard, he testified that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Female No. 1 worked in the reception area and, you know, during the course of months people loved to come up to her and say hey, here's what I've been hearing, what's true, what's not. So there, you know, it's just crazy how things work there, but again, this rumor storm was getting so out of control that, again, people were just coming up to her and say, hey, by the way, I've been hearing this, this and this, you know, what's true, what's not. Sometimes she would acknowledge what was going on, sometimes she was just like, I'm not talking about it, or that's not true. So she was fending off a lot of different rumors and fending off a lot of different people, seeking information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency must prove by preponderant evidence the existence of a nexus between the employee's misconduct and the work of the agency, i.e., the agency's performance of its functions. <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 565 F.3d at 1379. A preponderance of the evidence is the degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering the record as a whole, would accept as sufficient to find that a contested fact is more likely to be true than untrue. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(q)]. Here, while the disruption in the wider workplace may have been due in part to the reactions of Female No. 1 and Female No. 2 to the appellant's unprofessional conduct, we find that such underlying conduct directly and predictably caused the emotional distress experienced by Female No. 1 and Female No. 2, which negatively affected their job performance.[4] Further, the appellant reasonably should have known that such conduct, if discovered, not only would affect the job performance of Female No. 1 and Female No. 2, but <span id="Page_2305"></span>would lead in turn to some disruption of the workplace. As explained above, the agency presented evidence indicating that Female No. 1 was very upset and devastated upon finding the videotapes, believed that rumors in the office had gotten out of control, was "shaken up" when she came to work, kept telling a coworker "more and more" about the matter every day for several days, to the point where it was "all she wanted to talk about," and was approached in the reception area where she worked over the "course of months" by coworkers seeking information, such that she had to "fend[ ] off a lot of different people...." Female No. 2 received a troubling voice-mail message from a coworker regarding the matter, was "very upset coming to work" every day, was "terrified" when she learned that she had been videotaped during a sexual encounter without her consent, and did not devote her entire energies to her work. Klein spent hours, if not days, addressing the concerns of Female No. 1 and Female No. 2; this time could have been spent by Klein on other work-related matters; a female employee and her husband, who was also an employee, were upset about the rumors generated by the appellant's conduct and spent time during work hours addressing those concerns; and the agency's media coordinator was drawn into the issue as a result of media inquiries. We find that the agency has shown that it is more likely true than untrue that the appellant's unprofessional conduct of videotaping his sexual encounters with two FBI employees adversely affected the job performance of those employees, as well as the job performance of other employees and the efficiency of the office as a whole.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although Klein testified that as far as he knew, Female No. 2 did not fall behind in ordering supplies or paying telephone bills during the time in question, we note that Female No. 2's performance would most likely be measured against other standards in addition to the timeliness of her work product. In any event, the agency has shown that it is more likely true than untrue that Female No. 2's job performance was negatively affected given the amount of time she spent trying to resolve the impact upon her work reputation and the fact that she indicated that she was "very upset" coming to work every day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although a close question, we find that the agency has not met its burden of proving by preponderant evidence a nexus between the appellant's conduct with respect to Female No. 3, who was not an FBI employee, and the efficiency of the service. The agency's investigators were never able to locate and interview Female No. 3. Although Female No. 1 indicated that she was generally upset about finding the videotapes of other women and felt devastated because the appellant had not only made those tapes but kept them, there is no indication that the appellant's videotaping of Female No. 3 in particular affected the job performance of Female No. 1 or other employees, or otherwise contributed to the rumors in the workplace. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., HT at 202 (testimony of the appellant that "the rumor was that I had been with, you know, six, a dozen women in the office"). The agency also has not shown that the appellant's conduct with respect to Female No. 3 adversely affected the appellant's job performance or the agency's trust and confidence in the appellant's job performance, given the absence of evidence showing that it was likely or reasonably foreseeable that the appellant's non-criminal videotaping of a sexual encounter with a non-employee without her consent would affect the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Norton</span>, 417 F.2d at 1166 (the sufficiency of the charges must be evaluated in terms of the effects on the service of what in particular he has done or has been shown to be likely to do); <span class="Italic">Major</span>, 413 F. Supp. at 71 n.4 (questioning the assumption that a person's moral character is homogeneous, and that those who behave improperly in one regard are likely to transgress in others); <span class="Italic">cf.

Mine Safety and Health Administration</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 554, 556 (1982) (finding a nexus between the appellant's loss of an eye and the performance of his duties as a mine inspector because an agency "need not wait for the appellant to cause injury to himself or others because of his vision limitation, as long as the likelihood of such an event is reasonably foreseeable"); <span class="Italic">Doe v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The court vacated the Board's determination that the penalty of removal was reasonable. <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 565 F.3d at 1383. Accordingly, if the AJ finds on remand that the agency would have removed the appellant in the absence of the "legal error," the AJ shall determine whether the penalty of removal is reasonable, taking into consideration our finding that the agency has not proven a nexus between the appellant's conduct as it related to Female No. 3 and the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Payne v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Fifth Circuit reviewed the Board's nexus formulation in <span class="Italic">Bonet v. USPS</span>, 661 F.2d 1071, 1077-79 (5th Cir. 1981) (<span class="Italic">Bonet I</span>). In an appeal involving a charge of indecency with a child, the court determined that the Board must make two determinations: (1) that the employee, in fact, committed the alleged misconduct; and (2) that the employee's discharge, based on this misconduct, promoted the efficiency of the service. The court concluded that the Board's presumption of the adverse effect of immoral acts with a child was inappropriate if there was no evidence of adverse effect and no evidence of significant adverse publicity other than a notice of an indictment that did not mention the Postal Service--publicity considered by the court not to constitute notorious public knowledge of the incident charged. The court resolved that general conclusions about a lack of public confidence in the employee, a branch manager, were insufficient to warrant a Board finding of a relation between the off-duty misconduct and service efficiency. Nor could the Postal Service regulations prohibiting the misconduct create the necessary nexus:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite our reflective revulsion for the type of off-duty misconduct in question,...the 1978 Act does not permit this court nor an employing agency to characterize off-duty conduct as so obnoxious as to show, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, a nexus between it and the efficiency of the service. The 1978 Act prohibits the discharge of a federal employee for conduct that does not adversely affect the performance of that employee or his co-employees. 5 USC 2302(b)(10)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These provisions clearly signal a legislative intent that the agency must demonstrate by sufficient evidence that the off-duty misconduct, upon which the disciplinary action is founded, adversely affects the performance of the duties of the employee or of the agency. We further conclude, in light of the statutory requirements, that the reviewing authority may not place upon the employee, as the Board did, the burden of showing that his continued employment will <span class="Italic">not</span> affect the efficiency of the service. The Board may not shift the burden of proof by presumption or application of the <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n situations involving off-duty activities, the reviewing court will require the agency to demonstrate that removal will promote the efficiency of the service. Identification of the cause for removal is not sufficient; the agency must also establish the relationship between the employee misconduct and the adverse effect on its abilities to perform successfully....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bonet</span> was again heard by the court after remand to the Board, <span class="Italic">Bonet v. USPS</span>, 11 MSPR 141, 145 (1982), for additional evidence on nexus. <span class="Italic">Bonet v. USPS</span>, 712 F.2d 213 (5th Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">Bonet II</span>). On remand, the Board sustained the discharge, concluding that the employee's conduct had an adverse effect on his superiors and subordinates. The reviewing court reasoned that its role was to determine whether that conclusion was based on substantial evidence and whether it was reasonable to base a discharge upon the evidence. If there was no impact, the court ruled discharge was not permissible, even though the impact might have been expected. If there was adverse impact, but not of a kind to be expected, discharge was also not permissible. Finally, if there was an expectable adverse effect, but the adverse employee reaction was a pretext for discharge on an impermissible basis, e.g., race or sex, discharge was not justified. The court decided that affidavits submitted by the employer of coworkers and superiors who stated that they lacked confidence and trust in the employee were enough to demonstrate the requisite adverse impact, even though the employee supplied his own and numerous other contrary affidavits. The court concluded that because the alleged sexual misconduct was with a minor, the adverse impact could be reasonably expected. A judge dissented, critical of the affidavits obtained from employees working with Bonet, but more critical of the idea of allowing fellow employees a "veto over the total reform or the total recovery of someone who has committed an offense in the past"; "[i]t is wholly unacceptable to me to conclude...that total reform or mental cure has no relationship to an objective standard connecting the Postal Service with an otherwise unconnected matter of improper personal conduct."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Between <span class="Italic">Bonets I and II</span>, the Board considered another case involving a diesel engine mechanic's improper treatment of his seven-year-old daughter. Invoking a professed lack of trust and confidence in the appellant by agency supervisors, the Board sustained the dismissal. <span class="Italic">Bonet I</span> was distinguished, <span class="Italic">Evans v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 11 MSPR 407, 409-10 n.2 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board is cognizant of the holding in <span class="Italic">Bonet v. United States Postal Service,</span> 661 F.2d 1071 (5th Cir., 1981), involving a Postal Service employee who was discharged for alleged grossly immoral off-duty conduct. The court stated that an employing agency cannot characterize off-duty conduct as so obnoxious as to show, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, a nexus between it and the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Bonet</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> at 1077. The court noted that the agency made no finding that the conduct adversely affected the employee's <span id="Page_2306"></span>performance of his duties; that the indictment for misconduct had been dismissed; and that there was no evidence showing public knowledge of the employee's conduct. The court then reversed and remanded the case for further findings consistent with the opinion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In appellant's case, the agency presented no specific evidence of the effect of appellant's conduct on the actual performance of his duties, but his superiors testified that they lacked trust and confidence in appellant. Such destruction of trust and confidence would affect the employer-employee relationship. Further, the charge against appellant was not dismissed, but appellant admitted to the conduct. Given these differences, we believe that this case can be distinguished from <span class="Italic">Bonet</span>. <span class="Italic">See also Cooper v. United States,</span> 639 F.2d 727, 226 Ct. Cl. 75 (1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The facts were again reviewed in <span class="Italic">D.E. v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 721 F.2d 1164 (9th Cir. 1983) (earlier opinion, reported at 707 F.2d 1049 (9th Cir. 1983), withdrawn from publication), <span class="Italic">as amended</span>, 722 F.2d 455 (9th Cir. 1983). The court accepted the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Bonet I</span>, refusing to relieve the agency of the statutory duty to establish nexus even for reprehensible conduct, 721 F.2d at 1168:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the <span class="Italic">Bonet</span> court and hold that a presumption of nexus may not be used because it allows an agency to remove an employee without offering evidence of actual adverse impact on the service. The Board argues that the rebuttable presumption is permissible because it does not shift the ultimate burden of proof. We disagree. The presumption arbitrarily shifts to the employee the burden of producing evidence that his employment does <span class="Italic">not</span> affect the efficiency of the service. Courts have expressly required the agency to show the opposite: that his continued employment <span class="Italic">does</span> affect the service such that termination will promote its efficiency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We can hypothesize that a conviction of off-duty embezzlement of an employee whose job involved handling funds could reasonably be regarded as having a substantial adverse effect on efficiency. There is no basis for such conclusion here where the offense is totally unrelated to the duties performed by E. We need not reach the issue of whether "certain egregious circumstances" may ever logically indicate an adverse effect on an employee's performance. In any event, the off-duty conduct must be shown to have some connection to the agency's overall performance. The burden should remain on the agency to prove that the off-duty misconduct adversely affects the employee's or the agency's performance....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concluding that the off-duty conduct had no effect on the employee's job, that it was not a source of notoriety, embarrassment, or discomfiture to the agency, and that nothing was in the record other than unsupported and conclusory statements by agency officials that they lacked trust and confidence in the employee's ability to function independently in unusual and demanding situations and to be able to respond to direction, the <span class="Italic">D.E.</span> court reversed the Board and remanded for a determination of whether attorney fees should granted under the Equal Access to Justice Act. The Board ordered the appellant reinstated in <span class="Italic">Evans v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 18 MSPR 499, 500 (1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Discussion of the law developed in regional circuits is instructive, but that law is no longer controlling. The Federal Circuit now reviews Board decisions. It is there that one must look for controlling standards relating to nexus. The Federal Circuit does not impose on agencies the requirements of <span class="Italic">Bonet I</span> and <span class="Italic">D.E.</span> The Federal Circuit essentially allows Board decisions on nexus to be sustained if there appears to be a logical connection rather than proof of a connection between conduct and improvement of service efficiency. Incest with a stepdaughter by a custodial work inspector whose work included inspection of the cleaning work of contractors who employed young females was sufficient to support removal; <span class="Italic">Bonet</span> was disclaimed as not controlling. <span class="Italic">Williams v. GSA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-720). Sufficient nexus supported removal of a mechanical planner found guilty of assaulting a 10-year-old female. The employee's job required uncontrolled access to buildings and grounds at the Navy Yard, including on-base residential housing, <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 727 F.2d 1535, 1537 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (affirming <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 15 MSPR 378, 381 (1983)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Agencies are vested by law with the discretionary authority and responsibility to determine what is necessary for their efficiency in discharging the missions assigned to them by Congress...and this must be determined on the merits of each individual case. No appellate court has the institutional competence or authority to find facts to determine what is for the efficiency of the service. Only the finder of the facts can do so.... A presumption of good faith attends agency action.... There are hundreds of these agencies, and together they make hundreds of personnel decisions, sometimes thousands, on a daily basis. "The federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the multitude of personnel decisions that are made daily by public agencies." <span class="Italic">Bishop v. Wood</span>, 426 U.S. 341, 349 (1976)</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Allred v. DHHS</span>, 23 MSPR 478, 479-80 (1984), followed. The appellant, a supervisory cost accountant, was charged with off-duty child molestation. The Board considered the conduct egregious, warranting a presumption of nexus, even though the agency presented no specific evidence of the effect of the appellant's conduct on his duties. If the appellant provided evidence of good work performance to rebut the nexus presumption, the agency could overcome the rebuttal evidence through testimony from supervisors that they lacked trust and confidence in an employee who was in a sensitive position involving allocation of funds. Under these circumstances, the loss of supervisory confidence in <span class="Italic">Alfred</span> had a "clear" adverse effect upon service efficiency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Allred</span> was reviewed in <span class="Italic">Allred v. DHHS</span>, 786 F.2d 1128, 1131-32 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The court observed that Allred was a GS-14 Supervisory Cost Accountant. He represented the agency before state and local governments, universities, hospitals, and other grantees. He reviewed cost allocation plans to ensure that they conformed to agency regulations. He entered a <span class="Italic">nolo contendere</span> plea to one felony count of child molestation. The court affirmed the Board decision sustaining the removal. It was acknowledged that an agency must prove that the offending conduct related to job responsibilities. But it was noted that a presumption of nexus could arise if the conduct contravenes an agency's mission. This presumption, the court said, "places an extraordinary burden on an employee, for it forces him to prove the negative proposition that his retention would not adversely affect the efficiency of the service" (citing <span class="Italic">Crofoot v. GPO</span>, 761 F.2d 661, 664 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). The court considered the single count of child molestation (a paid encounter with a minor) to be egregious:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the number of crimes nor the allowance of a discretionary <span class="Italic">nolo contendere</span> plea can be controlling. Allred admits to the commission of an abhorrent act and cannot now downplay the seriousness of his offense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board did not abuse its discretion when it found that Allred's misconduct was sufficiently egregious to raise a presumption of nexus. The presumption rests on the nature of the misconduct itself. Reliance on the presumption is unnecessary where the misconduct's adverse effect on the efficiency of the service is clearly shown by factors other than the nature <span class="Italic">per se</span> of the conduct. That the Board may have unnecessarily discussed the presumption where, as here, there is uncontroverted evidence that the offense is directly opposed to the agency's mission, does not require reversal of the Board's decision. The mission of HHS is to administer health and social services for the disadvantaged, elderly, disabled, indigent and children, and to oversee the administration of those services by others. Allred's supervisor testified that the victim of Allred's offense is among those the agency tries to help. Thus, Allred's conduct is antithetical to the very programs which he was to monitor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts have repeatedly held that where an employee's misconduct is contrary to the agency's mission, the agency need not present proof of a direct effect on the employee's job performance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Masino v. United States</span>, 589 F.2d 1048, 1056 (Ct. Cl. 1978) (customs officer dismissed for using marijuana off-duty, a substance he was assigned to exclude from the country); <span class="Italic">Giles v. United States</span>, 553 F.2d 647, 650 (Ct. Cl. 1977) (IRS agent dismissed for failing to file timely tax returns). This is so because the "misconduct was of a character likely to undermine public confidence in the agency, and thus impair the agency's efficiency, although it might not affect the employee's job performance." <span class="Italic">Wild v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 692 F.2d 1129, 1132 (7th Cir. 1982). In these circumstances, the agency should not have "to wait for an on-the-job violation before dismissing an offending employee." <span class="Italic">Borsari v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 699 F.2d 106, 110 (2d Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Allred contends on appeal that he has rebutted the presumption, citing the presiding official's recognition of his subordinates' statements that his performance between his arrest and indefinite suspension indicated to them that he would still be able to function, that there was no adverse publicity, and that an indirect supervisor had not lost confidence in him. The Board said that statements of coworkers did not rebut the presumption. The Board held that Allred's direct supervisors' loss of trust and confidence in one who represented the agency to other agencies, grantees, state governments, and private institutions, adversely affected the employer-employee relationship and thus the efficiency of the service.... We agree with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not here decide whether in another case a bare presumption might be rebutted by testimony of coworkers that they considered an employee's after-arrest performance satisfactory and other factors cited by Allred. Considered in terms of rebuttal, Allred's evidence is insufficient in this case when pitted against the direct relationship of his misconduct to the agency's mission and the showing that his supervisors had lost trust and confidence in him.... Moreover, employees can be expected to exhibit their best behavior in the face of a strong possibility that the agency will soon be acting to remove them.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Refer to the dissent of Judge Nies in <span class="Italic">Allred v. DHHS</span>, 786 F.2d 1128 (Fed. Cir. 1986), for discussion of why greater analysis should be undertaken in nexus determinations. Judge Nies would have required a demonstration that the misconduct related to particular job requirements rather than to the overall agency mission.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Off-duty child abuse warranted indefinite suspension of a letter carrier with public contact. There was some evidence that the public had knowledge of <span id="Page_2307"></span>appellant's misconduct. <span class="Italic">Graybill v. USPS</span>, 22 MSPR 554, 557 (1984). In court the Board's ruling prevailed, <span class="Italic">Graybill v. USPS</span>, 782 F.2d 1567, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In arguing that the MSPB erred in finding that the nexus had been established, Graybill alternatively suggests that off-duty misconduct cannot give rise to the presumption of a nexus and that only excessively violent off-duty conduct, such as murder, is sufficient to demonstrate a presumed nexus. Nevertheless, a number of decisions, including those in <span class="Italic">Hayes [v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 727 F.2d 1535 (Fed. Cir. 1984)] ; <span class="Italic">Stalans v. National Security Agency</span>, 678 F.2d 482 (4th Cir. 1982); and <span class="Italic">Gueory v. Hampton</span>, 510 F.2d 1222 (D.C. Cir. 1974), make clear that the courts have not read such a limitation into the law. Rather, the question which the courts have concerned themselves with is the question of whether a particular instance of conduct is so egregious that it is reasonable to conclude that it "would directly relate either to the employee's ability to perform approved tasks or to the agency's ability to fulfill its assigned mission." <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Bergland</span>, 586 F.2d 1007 (4th Cir. 1978), at 1011, <span class="Italic">quoting Doe v. Hampton</span>, 566 F.2d 265, 272 n.20 (1977)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that sufficient evidence existed for the agency to find that a connection existed between Graybill's job responsibilities and the charges to which he pled guilty.... The facts before both the agency and the MSPB clearly indicated that Graybill's fellow employees found it difficult to work with him following his conviction. More importantly, the facts before the agency and the Board revealed that Graybill's job responsibilities brought him into regular contact with members of the public, including children, and that Graybill's postal route brought him by local schools. We find no error in the Board's conclusion that a nexus could be presumed to exist between Graybill's misconduct and the efficiency of the service. In any event, the evidence was clearly sufficient to demonstrate the required nexus and we decline to conduct a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the proceedings in this case as Graybill might prefer.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A different result was reached in the appeal of another letter carrier. Nexus did not exist in the conviction of the appellant for the low-level felony offense of "having carnal knowledge of a 14-year-old female," an offense involving no violence or force. The agency offered no concrete evidence that employees with whom the appellant worked objected to his continued employment. The agency offered no evidence demonstrating the likelihood of close contact between the appellant and children in local schools or residences, <span class="Italic">Moten v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 282, 287-89 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was convicted of violating a provision of the state criminal code concerning carnal knowledge of a child between 13 and 15 years of age. In his written reply to the notice of proposed removal, the appellant acknowledged his criminal conduct. He stated that, although the girl was only 14 years old at the time, she lied to him and claimed to be 16 years old. He also stated that the girl was a neighbor, and that relations between them, which occurred at his home, were entirely by mutual consent, without any threats, force, intimidations, or inducement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not alleged, and we see no basis for finding, that the appellant's misconduct interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission. In addition, we see no basis for finding that the misconduct, which was a low-grade felony that did not involve violence or force, was sufficiently egregious that nexus may be presumed. <span class="Italic">Cf. Faint v. United States Postal Service</span>, 22 MSPR 495, 497 (1984) (assault with a deadly weapon gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of nexus), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 770 F.2d 179 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). As we have indicated above, however, the administrative judge found that the agency had proved that the appellant's misconduct adversely affected both his ability to perform his duties and the agency's trust and confidence in his job performance. He therefore found that there was a nexus between the appellant's removal and the efficiency of the service. We agree with the appellant that this finding is not supported by the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's conclusion that nexus had been shown is based partly on testimony that had been "offered to show that [the] appellant's fellow employees found it difficult to work with him," and partly on a showing that the "appellant's job responsibilities as a city carrier brought him into regular contact with members of the public, including children of elementary, junior high school, and high school age."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the first of these bases, we note that the deciding official testified at the hearing that employees had "c[o]me and asked [her] if [she] knew about [the appellant's] situation," and that "they were concerned...." She testified further that the employees had said that they "didn't approve of what had happened," and that they "would tell [her] ...what he did was terrible" and that they "wouldn't want to work around him." On cross-examination, however, when the deciding official was asked to name the employees who objected to working with the appellant, she was able to name only one, and that one employee was a "secretary" who had virtually no contact with the appellant. The agency presented no direct or specific evidence--in the form of testimony, affidavits, or other statements--that any of the employees with whom the appellant worked objected to his continued employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In connection with the second basis for the administrative judge's finding of nexus, the deciding official expressed her concern that the appellant, while delivering mail, would come into contact with children. Specifically, she testified that, when she was employed as a letter carrier, she ate lunch at schools, and that the appellant "could talk to the kids, and...kids love mailmen." She also testified that she did not feel comfortable with his delivering mail to private residences "[b]ecause there [were] children that (were) unsupervised...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does show that there were residences and schools on the appellant's routes. We find, however, that the agency has failed to show that the presence of those schools and residences is a sufficient basis for a finding of nexus. The appellant testified at the hearing that he never ate lunch at any school on his route, and that he knew of no other people who ever did so. He testified further that he had no time to socialize with, or even to talk to, people on his route; that the only incident in which a teenager or a child had talked to him on his route was one in which a "kid threw a baseball and broke the mirror on the side on the truck," and that he never delivered mail to children. None of this testimony was rebutted. We note further that the appellant appears to have performed his duties almost entirely in areas open to the public, and that, although the appellant testified that he sometimes knocked on doors and talked to residents, the agency offered no evidence that he entered those residences even when adults were present. We therefore find no proper basis for concluding that the nature of the appellant's work brought him into such contact with children that there was a nexus between his misconduct and the efficiency of the service.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;We also note that the agency did not rebut the appellant's assertion that the girl involved in the appellant's misconduct was a neighbor, rather than a resident in the area in which he worked. There is no evidence that the appellant met her as a result of his employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, and in the absence of any other indication that the appellant's misconduct was related to the duties of his position, we find that the agency has failed to prove the existence of the required nexus. We therefore REVERSE the part of the initial decision in which the administrative judge found nexus and sustained the appellant's removal. The appellant's removal is NOT SUSTAINED.</p>

Department of the Navy</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 378 (1983) (employee convicted of assault and battery of a 10-year old girl), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 727 F.2d 1535 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Although the appellant's behavior did not involve a physical assault on a child, we conclude that his criminal misconduct was sufficiently egregious to meet this criterion.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As the appellant points out, the commission of egregious off-duty misconduct creates a rebuttable presumption of nexus, not a conclusive one, and can be overcome by evidence showing an absence of adverse effect on service efficiency. <span class="Italic">See Allred</span>, 786 F.2d at 1131; <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 521, 524 (1984); <span class="Italic">Doe v. National Security Agency</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 555, 561 (1981), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Stalans v. National Security Agency</span>, 678 F.2d 482 (4th Cir. 1982). The appellant asserts that he rebutted any presumption of nexus, in that the deciding official admitted that the appellant's off-duty misconduct did not involve any publicity or notoriety that might damage the reputation of the agency and that his coworkers were not aware of the misconduct. The mere absence of publicity or notoriety and coworkers' ignorance is not sufficient under the facts of this case to rebut the bare presumption of nexus created by egregious conduct. <span class="Italic">See Allred</span>, 786 F.2d at 1131-32; <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. at 529-30; <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. at 562. As set forth above, the appellant's off-duty misconduct led his managers to question his reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. <span class="Italic">See Allred</span>, 786 F.2d at 1131-32 (evidence of good performance between an arrest for child molestation and an indefinite suspension, as well as absence of adverse publicity, were insufficient to rebut the presumption of nexus when "pitted against the direct relationship of his misconduct to the agency's mission and the showing that his supervisors had lost trust and confidence in him.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit sustained removal of a financial manager employed by the Bureau of Prisons. The appellant was removed after he pleaded guilty in state court to the charge of indecency with a fourteen-year-old girl who was a friend of his daughter. Citing <span class="Italic">Allred</span> and <span class="Italic">Hayes</span>, the court concluded that "a presumption of nexus may arise if the employee's conduct is so egregious <span id="Page_2308"></span>that 'it speaks for itself.'" <span class="Italic">Word v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3306). [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-165.html#sec8-164">Sexual Misconduct</a>," for on-duty sexual misconduct or sexual harassment.]</p>
