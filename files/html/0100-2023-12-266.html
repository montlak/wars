<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-265"><span class="space">6.</span> Postal Service Employees</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Non-Postal Service employees appeal an arbitration award involving an EEO issue to Board headquarters. For Postal Service employees, the review scheme differs. A Postal employee without ordinary Board appeal rights has no right to MSPB review of an arbitration award, whether or not there is an issue of discrimination. A preference eligible Postal employee may pursue both a Board appeal and a grievance through her collective bargaining contract. If the grievance results in an arbitration award, the Postal employee cannot secure direct Board review of the award. If discrimination is raised for the first time in the Board appeal by the Postal employee, the Board reviews that affirmative defense <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. [Refer in Chapter 1 to "<a href="0100-2023-08-241.html#sec1-237">Effect of Collective Bargaining Contract Grievance or Related Procedures; 5 USC 7121</a>"; "<a href="0100-2023-08-242.html#sec1-238">Postal Service Employees</a>."] The Postal manager or personnelist [whose statutory appeal rights are discussed in Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-154.html#sec1-153">Postal Service</a>"] has no grievance arbitration route; he must pursue an ordinary Board appeal with the usual affirmative defenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The analysis of Postal employees' appeal rights when grievance procedures are also invoked is indirect. 5 USC 7121(d) grants a right of Board review of arbitration decisions when EEO issues are raised with the Board. The statute requires the employee to make a binding election between the contract procedure and the Board appellate procedure, but if the contract process is chosen: "[s]election of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee to request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review the final decision pursuant to section 7702 of this title in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board." But 5 USC 7121, involving election of remedies, and its implementing regulation, 5 CFR 1201.3(c)(1) (2022), are made inapplicable to the Postal Service by the Postal Reorganization Act, 84 Stat. 719 (1970). Those Postal employees who are eligible to appeal to the Board and who are covered by negotiated grievance procedures are not forced to make a statutory election of remedies. Preference eligible employees in the Postal Service have the right to appeal an adverse action to the Board's regional offices, as well as the right to invoke the grievance provisions of a collective bargaining agreement specified in 39 USC 1206(b). <span class="Italic">Hall v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 233, 236 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Landingham v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 77, 81 &#x00B6; 6 (1999) (preference-eligible Postal Service employee may file both a grievance and a Board appeal from the same action, but does not have the right to Board review of an arbitrator's award); <span class="Italic">Blackiemore v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 424, 427-28 (1994) (if a Postal employee elects to file an EEO complaint with his agency, he may file an appeal with Board 20 [now 30] days after he receives agency resolution or a final decision on the discrimination issue, or, if the agency has not resolved the matter or issued a final decision within 120 days, the employee may appeal the matter to the Board at any time after the expiration of 120 calendar days); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 57, 59 (1993) (Board appeal must be initiated within 20 [now 30] days of the effective date of the adverse action; the employee may not await an arbitrator's decision to seek review, as might an employee of another agency who could not simultaneously file an MSPB appeal and pursue a grievance); <span class="Italic">Emerald v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 586, 589 (1991) (apparently recognizing that the Postal Service employee can initiate the appeal after the agency completes an EEO investigation into his complaint); <span class="Italic">Epstein v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 662, 664 (1988) (MSPB does not have jurisdiction to review appeals from USPS arbitration decisions under 5 USC 7121; rather, preference eligible postal employees may avail themselves of both a Board appeal and the negotiated grievance procedure).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Summarizing the processes for eligible Postal Service employees, <span class="Italic">Muse v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 342, 345 &#x00B6; 8 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An eligible Postal employee may simultaneously file both a grievance and a Board appeal, each subject to relevant timeliness requirements. <span class="Italic">See Marjie v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 MSPR 95, 98 (1996). Only within the context of a timely filed petition for appeal of an agency action may the Board review a Postal employee's arbitration decision on a grievance. <span class="Italic">See Fedon v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Moore v. USPS</span>, 91 MSPR 277, 279 n.1 (2002), also explained the availability of Board review for postal employees who would otherwise have appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), an individual affected by a personnel action that is both appealable to the Board and covered by a negotiated grievance procedure may contest the action before the Board or via a grievance, but not both. An individual who chooses initially to grieve may seek Board review of the final decision on the grievance if he or she claims that the personnel action was based on discrimination prohibited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1). Section 7121(d), however, does not apply to the U.S. Postal Service, and thus Postal Service employees have the right to grieve and to appeal actions directly to the Board. <span class="Italic">Marjie v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 95, 98 (1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In greater detail, the review scheme was explained in <span class="Italic">Fedon v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 657, 660 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a general rule, an individual affected by a personnel action that is both appealable to the Board and covered by a negotiated grievance procedure may contest the action before the Board or via a grievance, but not both; an individual who elects to grieve may seek Board review of the final decision on the grievance if he or she claims that the action was based on prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). That statutory provision does not apply, however, to a Postal Service employee who has the right to appeal an action directly to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Lucas v.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 95, 98 (1996). When the appeal of a Postal Service preference eligible employee is properly before the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), and the action appealed has been the subject of an arbitration decision, the Board may consider the arbitration decision if the Board otherwise has jurisdiction over the appeal and the timeliness requirements are met. <span class="Italic">See Lipsky v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 555, 557-58 (1993). The appellant herein, as a preference-eligible, has no right to obtain review <span id="Page_1862"></span>of the arbitration decision, as the administrative judge found, but she has a right to appeal her removal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(ii), 7512(1), 7513(d). The initial decision dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, and did not decide the question of the timeliness of the appeal. Since, as set forth above, the Board has jurisdiction over the removal action, the issue of timeliness of the appeal must be addressed.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Of what significance is an arbitrator's award to a Postal Service employee who can and does file a timely direct appeal to the Board from the same action that was considered in the arbitration?

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that it was inappropriate for him to review the arbitrator's decision under <span class="Italic">Leamon</span>, presumably because of the statement in that case that 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.157 precludes initial review of arbitration decisions by administrative judges. <span class="Italic">Leamon</span>, however, deals with the Board's authority to review an arbitrator's decision under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 192.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Preference-eligible employees of the Postal Service may: (1) appeal an agency action directly to the Board; (2) pursue grievance/arbitration procedures; or (3) pursue both within certain limitations. <span class="Italic">Stahl v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 83 F.3d 409, 411 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Although Mr. Robey initially appealed the removal action by the Postal Service to the Board, he later withdrew the appeal and instead pursued grievance/arbitration procedures through the union. Now, Mr. Robey appears to be seeking review of the determination by the arbitrator. As a Postal Service employee, however, Mr. Robey has no right of Board review of the arbitration decision. <span class="Italic">Fedon v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The Federal Circuit likewise lacks jurisdiction to review an arbitrator's decision pursuant to a Postal Service agreement with the union. <span class="Italic">Burke v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 888 F.2d 833, 834 (Fed. Cir. 1989). While 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121 authorizes the same review of arbitration decisions by the Federal Circuit as is available for decisions by the Board, &#x00A7; 7121 and its implementing regulations are not applicable to Postal Service employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jackson v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 57, 59 (1993), recapitulated the limitations on review of arbitrators' awards involving Postal employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that he had no authority to review the arbitration decision under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(d) because the appellant did not raise an allegation of discrimination. Section 1201.154(d) implements 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d) which requires aggrieved employees alleging unlawful discrimination to elect between appealing to the Board and pursuing negotiated grievance procedures; it further provides for Board review of arbitration decisions where such discrimination is alleged. The Board has held, however, that 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d) does not apply to Postal Service employees with Board appeal rights who may file both a grievance and a Board appeal at the same time. <span class="Italic">Lucas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 39 MSPR 459, 461 (1989); <span class="Italic">Hall v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 26 MSPR 233, 236 (1985). Correspondingly, the Board may only review Postal Service arbitration decisions within the context of a timely appeal of the agency action. <span class="Italic">Lucas</span>, 39 MSPR at 461. Thus, since the appellant's petition for appeal of his removal was untimely filed and he had failed to show good cause for this delay, we conclude that the administrative judge properly dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Waters v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 683, 684-85 (1988), spoke of deference to an arbitrator's award during a Postal Service employee's Board appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the administrative judge finds that this appeal was timely filed and that the Board has jurisdiction, the appellant is entitled to adjudication of the merits of his appeal. In addressing the merits, the arbitrator's decision is to be reviewed under the same standard applicable to preference eligible employees of other agencies. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. United States Postal Service</span>, 35 MSPR 581, 588 (1987). The Board will, in most cases, defer to Postal Service arbitration decisions and will only set them aside or modify them where the appellant shows that the arbitrator erred in interpreting civil service law, rules, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 592. In cases in which a question arises about the appropriateness of deferral, the Board will follow the guidance of relevant Federal court decisions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 592 n.12. All requests for review must include a statement of the grounds on which the review is requested, evidence of record or rulings bearing on the issues before the Board, arguments in support of the stated grounds with specific reference to the pertinent documents and citations of authority, and legible copies of the award and other pertinent documents. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 592 n.13.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That deference does not extend to collateral estoppel effect. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. <span id="Page_1863"></span>USPS</span>, 865 F.2d 235, 238 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (allowing for collateral estoppel effect of an arbitration award when the issue previously adjudicated is identical with the one later presented; the issue was actually litigated in the prior case; the previous determination of that issue was necessary to the end-decision then made; and the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action). The Board defers to the judgment of the arbitrator in most circumstances, but in appeals involving Postal Service preference eligible employees, the Board will not apply collateral estoppel to an arbitrator's findings on discrimination of the kind prohibited under 5 USC 2302(b)(1). <span class="Italic">Berkey v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 24, 28 (1989) (declining to apply collateral estoppel to an arbitration award when the issues before the Board were not the issues actually litigated before the arbitrator).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stahl v. MSPB</span>, 83 F.3d 409, 411-13 (Fed. Cir. 1996), also explained the review scheme for Postal employees' cases that may travel the route of arbitration rather than an appeal to a Board regional office:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Stahl, a Distribution Clerk with the Postal Service, was removed from service in March 1992 on the ground that she was medically unfit for duty. Ms. Stahl is a preference eligible veteran as defined by statute, and therefore is afforded certain appeal rights not available to other Postal employees. 5 USC &#x00A7; 2108; 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005. Upon her removal the Postal Service gave Ms. Stahl the written information that she could appeal to the MSPB and could participate in negotiated grievance procedures. She was told that if she chose to appeal to the Board she waived access beyond Step 3 of the negotiated grievance procedures, a step that did not include formal arbitration, and was subject to certain additional limitations not here relevant. Ms. Stahl was given a copy of the MSPB regulations, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> She then proceeded under the grievance procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Eventually an arbitrator's decision against Ms. Stahl was issued on March 17, 1995. On April 21, 1995 Ms. Stahl filed with the MSPB a petition for review of the arbitrator's decision. The Board points out that the arbitrator's decision is not appealable, for 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d), which provides for Board review of arbitration decisions when discrimination is alleged, does not apply to Postal Service employees. <span class="Italic">Burke v. United States Postal Service</span>, 888 F.2d 833, 834 (Fed. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">see Bacashihua v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 811 F.2d 1498, 1502 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (5 USC &#x00A7; 7121 and implementing regulations do not apply to the Postal Service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with the Postal Reorganization Act, Pub. L. No. 91-375, 84 Stat. 719 (1970), Postal Service preference eligible employees may appeal directly to the Board or may invoke grievance/arbitration procedures under the agreement between the Postal Service and the American Postal Workers Union. <span class="Italic">Bacashihua</span>, 811 F.2d at 1502. With limitations, preference eligible employees may participate in both paths of appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mays v. United States Postal Service</span>, 995 F.2d 1056, 1059-60 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (discussing limitations on appeal procedures).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time of her separation Ms. Stahl was told, in the Letter of Decision, that an appeal to the Board would be deemed a waiver of grievance/arbitration procedures beyond Step 3. The letter stated certain limitations to her right to appeal to the Board, and that the time for appeal was "20 calendar days from the effective day of this decision." However, the MSPB regulations she was given at the time of separation stated that an arbitrator's decision can be appealed to the Board when there is an issue of prohibited discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Stahl argues that her appeal was filed within 35 days of the arbitrator's decision, as provided in the MSPB regulations she was given:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(d). If the appellant has filed a grievance with the agency under its negotiated grievance procedure in accordance with 5 USC 7121, he or she may ask the Board to review the final decision under 5 USC 7702 within 35 days of the date of issuance of that decision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC &#x00A7; 7121, which is referred to in &#x00A7; 1201.154(d), in turn provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d). An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1) of this title which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both.... Selection of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee to request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review the final decision pursuant to section 7702 of this title in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Stahl alleged discrimination based on handicap and retaliation for EEO activity, thus invoking 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b).&#x2003;Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;discriminate for or against any employee or applicant for employment--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(D)&#x2003;on the basis of handicapping condition, as prohibited under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC 791);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Stahl explains that although she has now been made aware that neither 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121 nor 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(d) applies to Postal Service employees, even preference eligibles, she was misled at the time of her separation. She states that the material she was given did not explain, and she was not told, that the MSPB regulations did not all apply to the Postal Service. Thus she argues that there was good cause for the delay, and that the agency's act in giving her the partly-inapplicable MSPB regulations was sufficiently confusing to warrant waiver of the untimely filing of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Stahl also argues that her interpretation of the information she was given at the time of separation was logical, for the provisions for concurrent grievance and Board appeal are meaningless or unfair if interpreted as the Postal Service interprets them. She points out that a preference eligible Postal employee who wishes to participate in a grievance procedure will find that the time for filing an appeal to the Board--a course that is available, according to the Letter of Decision--will have expired long before resolution of the grievance, even if the employee does not proceed beyond Step 3 of the grievance/arbitration process. Further, as the Board stated in its Initial Decision, "The Postal Service collective bargaining agreement may, however, and does, provide that an employee may not proceed to binding arbitration if the employee has appealed the same matter to the Board."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the issue before us is not the balance established in the procedures of the collective bargaining agreement, but whether Ms. Stahl was adequately notified of the correct appeal rights. As we have observed, in the Letter of Decision the Postal Service told Ms. Stahl that she had twenty days within which to appeal to the Board. The statement was plain and unambiguous. This notice, in a letter personal to Ms. Stahl, could not be ignored. It was a clear statement of an imminent time limit, and any apparent discrepancy with the MSPB's regulations should have engendered inquiry at the time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the complexities of the various appeal rights and procedures, Ms. Stahl was clearly and correctly informed of her choices, by personal letter containing correct time limits. The Board's finding that Ms. Stahl had reasonable notice of her appeal rights is supported by substantial evidence. We sustain the Board's ruling that good cause was not shown for waiver of the time limit and acceptance of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v.</span> <span class="Italic">USPS</span>, 695 F.2d 1389, 1390-91 (Fed. Cir. 1982) (waiver of time limit for filing appeal is committed to the sound discretion of the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Stahl also argues that she should be permitted to appeal to the Board because she raised a handicap discrimination claim. For appeals of discrimination claims and "mixed cases" before the Board, the Federal Circuit considers only procedural or threshold issues of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 738 F.2d 1244, 1246-47 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction of discrimination claims when an appealable adverse action is alleged to be based on discrimination. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 715 F.2d 1485, 1487, 1491 (Fed. Cir. 1983). <span class="Italic">See Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1245-46 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (there must be an appealable adverse action in order to assert discrimination). In this case there was an adverse employment action. However, in order to raise discrimination as a defense to that action Ms. Stahl was required to file an appeal to the Board from the adverse action; such an appeal must meet the condition of timeliness or achieve waiver of untimeliness. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hopkins v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 725 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Muse v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 164, 167 &#x00B6; 7 (1999) (Board lacks jurisdiction to review a USPS grievance decision); <span class="Italic">Allison v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 335, 340 &#x00B6; 13 (1999) (as to a Postal Service employee, the Board lacks authority to review arbitration award that denies a grievance); <span class="Italic">Marjie v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 95, 98 (1996) ("A Postal Service employee with Board appeal rights may file a grievance and a Board appeal from the same action, but such an employee does not have a right of Board review of an arbitration decision.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a Postal employee who may be a preference eligible appeals an arbitrator's award directly to the Board, the Board will dismiss the request for review under 5 USC 7121(d) and remand the case to a regional office for a docketing as a direct appeal from the adverse action. The AJ assigned to the case must then determine whether the appellant is a preference eligible, whether the direct appeal was timely filed, whether relitigation is barred by collateral estoppel, or whether factual findings on the case are appropriate. <span class="Italic">Newton v. USPS</span>, 98 MSPR 149, 151-52 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-7 (2005).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It can occur that a Postal employee arbitrates a discharge, obtains reinstatement with a period of retained jurisdiction by the arbitrator, and is fired after the arbitrator loses jurisdiction. At that point the postal employee can take his case to the Board if the employee is within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McGrath v.
