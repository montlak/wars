<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Henry v. VA</span>, 100 MSPR 124, 127-32 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-21 (2005) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Henry v. VA</span>, 108 MSPR 458, 467 &#x00B6; 26, 2008 MSPB 77 (2008), post)<span class="Italic">,</span> considered the agency's obligations, analyzed during enforcement proceedings, after a removal for inability to perform the essential functions of the position was reversed by reason of the agency's failure to demonstrate the unreasonableness of accommodations requested by the appellant. In the decision, the Board outlined a number of significant components of analysis in a disability case. The Board noted that an agency need not eliminate the essential functions of a position as an accommodation. The agency need not employ others to perform the essential elements of the position. Other accommodations are analyzed on what amounts to a cost/benefit analysis. Reassignment need be considered only as a last resort, and then only if the employee is qualified for the job and no extraordinary training is required. But if reassignment occurs, it matters not that the position has promotion potential:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where a disabled person[1] can perform the essential functions of her position with a reasonable accommodation and without endangering herself or others, the employing agency is obligated to provide the necessary reasonable accommodation unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the agency's operations. <span class="Italic">Combs v. Social Security Administration</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 148 &#x00B6; 23 (2002); <span class="Italic">Mazzarella v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 47, 50 (1992); 29 C.F.R. Part 1630. It is not disputed at this point that the appellant is a disabled individual under the law and that she is unable to perform the essential functions of her position without accommodation. The current issue before the Board centers on the reasonableness of the accommodation sought by the appellant and whether it would impose an undue hardship on the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;A disabled person is one who has a "physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities," has "a record of such an impairment," or is "regarded as having such an impairment." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g); <span class="Italic">see Otterstedt v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 688 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17 (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A reasonable accommodation means, among other things, modifications or adjustment to the work environment or to the manner or circumstances under which a position is performed and may include job restructuring or the modification of office equipment. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(1)(ii) &#x0026; (2)(ii). An agency is not obligated, however, to restructure a position if doing so would entail the removal of the essential functions of the position. <span class="Italic">Combs</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 148 &#x00B6; 25; <span class="Italic">Hurst v. Department of the Navy</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 277, 281 (1994); EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada">http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html#job</a> at 13 (stating that "[a]n employer never has to reallocate essential functions as a reasonable accommodation, but can do so if it wishes.") The "essential functions" of a position generally refer to the fundamental job duties or the reason for a position's existence as reflected in, among other things, the amount of time spent on a particular task. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n); <span class="Italic">see Fortin</span> <span class="Italic">v. Barnhart</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A46108, slip op. at 3 (June 16, 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the hearing on the merits of the appellant's appeal, the appellant's supervisor, John Bonaccorso, testified that the program support clerk position involves, among other things, opening and sorting mail about veterans' benefit claims and promptly filing the material in the appropriate veteran's claim file. He stated that individual files can weigh more than five pounds and that the file drawers in which the files are kept are very heavy, weighing up to 100 pounds. Bonaccorso also testified that filing consumed approximately one to one-and-a-half hours per day or more for each program support clerk. Bonaccorso's testimony regarding the nature of the program support clerk position is largely corroborated by the other evidence of record. Based on the testimony of Bonaccorso and <span id="Page_5031"></span>the other evidence, the administrative judge found in her initial decision on the merits of this appeal that filing was an essential function of the appellant's position. Neither party challenged that finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the appellant's medical limitations, the record shows that, among other things, she is restricted from lifting more than five pounds and from bending more than 30 degrees more than twice an hour. To accommodate her condition, the appellant advocates that her position be modified to comport with her medical restrictions. She has suggested, for example, that she be excused from performing the filing function of her position and that other employees perform her filing or that interns and temporary workers be employed to do her filing. She also suggested that other employees assist her by lifting files exceeding her limitations and by opening and closing file drawers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, excusing an individual from performing an essential function of her position is not a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Combs</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 148 &#x00B6; 25; <span class="Italic">Hurst</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 281; EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act at 13. Nor is using interns, temporary workers, or other employees to perform the essential functions of an individual's position a reasonable accommodation.[5] <span class="Italic">See Combs</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 148 &#x00B6; 25 (approving an administrative judge's finding that hiring another employee to perform the essential functions the appellant was unable to perform was not a reasonable accommodation); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Moon v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 412, 422 (1994) (an agency is not required to provide an individual to assist an employee in lifting where doing so would effectively require the agency to have another person stand by the appellant nearly full-time); <span class="Italic">see also Fortin</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A46108, slip op. at 4; <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Department of the Treasury</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 038540128, slip op. at 3 (Jul. 6, 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;To the extent that the appellant argues that the agency should create a new program support clerk position that does not involve filing, an agency is not required to create a new position to accommodate an employee's medical restrictions. <span class="Italic">See Saunders v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dalton</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03970160, slip op. at 4 (Jan. 30, 1998); <span class="Italic">see also Widger v. Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Administration</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 368, 371 (1988) (an agency is not required to restructure the way work is performed to accommodate an employee's disability).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the appellant's particular suggestion that other employees assist her in lifting heavy files and opening and closing file drawers, the agency cites to an analysis performed by Bonaccorso showing that such a practice would repeatedly interrupt other employees on an average of four-and-a-half hours a day. The appellant has provided nothing questioning that analysis and, given the severity of the appellant's medical restrictions and the nature of the program support clerk position, we discern no cause to doubt Bonaccorso's finding. Moreover, such an arrangement would excuse the appellant from performing the essential functions of her position and is thus unreasonable. <span class="Italic">See Fortin</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A46108, slip op. at 4 (stating that distributing certain duties to co-workers was not an effective accommodation because doing so would not enable the employee to perform the essential functions of her position and would have an unacceptable impact on working conditions and customer service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another accommodation proposed by the appellant was the installation of automatic drawer openers to aid her in opening file cabinet drawers. The agency contends that it considered such an accommodation but that the expense would impose an undue hardship. An agency is not required to adopt an accommodation--even one that would allow a disabled individual to perform the essential functions of her position--if doing so would impose an undue hardship on the agency. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(p)(1). In determining whether a proposed accommodation would create an undue hardship for the agency, the Board will consider: (1) The overall size of the agency's program with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities and size of budget; (2) the type of agency operation, including the nature and composition of the agency's work force; and (3) the nature and cost of the accommodation. <span class="Italic">Fox v.

Department of the Interior</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 645 &#x00B6; 8 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because she found that the agency was obligated to modify the program support clerk position to accommodate the appellant, the administrative judge did not analyze whether the installation of automatic drawer openers would impose an undue hardship on the agency. Furthermore, the record contains little evidence regarding the factors the Board considers in determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on an agency. Accordingly, remand is necessary to further develop the record on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge shall determine the nature and cost of the automatic drawer openers necessary for the appellant to perform the duties of a program support clerk, the overall size of the agency's program with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities and size of budget and the type of agency operation, including the nature and composition of the agency's work force. She shall then find whether the accommodation sought by the appellant would impose an undue hardship on the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that as an accommodation she should be reassigned to a GS-5 Veterans Service Representative (VSR) position. The record shows that such a position is the entry-level position for the VSR career ladder that has promotion potential to at least the GS-12 level. In a January 2, 2003 memorandum, Bonaccorso informed the appellant that she lacked sufficient experience and skills in claims processing to participate in the process to become a VSR. That was because the appellant first started performing claims processing work in September 2002. Bonaccorso's memorandum is consistent with New York Regional Office Director Patricia Amberg-Blyskal's testimony that, although the appellant met the minimum qualifications (time in grade, for example) to be considered for a VSR position, she lacked the experience to be selected for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that placing the appellant in the VSR program under the guise of a reasonable accommodation would allow her to circumvent the supervisory determination of skills and experience and the test that all other program support clerks must complete in order to be selected for a VSR position. According to the agency, doing so would give the appellant "a windfall rather than a reasonable accommodation." The agency notes in this regard that the purpose of the anti-disability discrimination statutes is to protect employees from disability discrimination and not to provide them more rights than they would otherwise have.[7] <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 490, 494 (1995); <span class="Italic">Patrick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 392, 396-97 (1988). The EEOC's Enforcement Guidance also states that for a reassignment to constitute a reasonable accommodation the individual must satisfy "the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the position." EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act at 19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;An agency may not decline to reassign an employee to a position at the same grade as a reasonable accommodation because the new position has a greater promotion potential. <span class="Italic">Sheehan v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 490, 494 (1995). In the instant case, the issue is one of qualification for the VSR position and not the fact that the VSR position has significant promotion potential.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues in contrast that a reassignment to a VSR position would not constitute a windfall because it would be a lateral transfer. She also asserts that there is an overlap of duties between the program support clerk position and a VSR position and that she meets the basic qualifications for a VSR position. Finally, in this regard, the appellant asserts that the agency has reassigned employees to VSR positions without requiring them to take and pass a test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her compliance recommendation, the administrative judge, with almost no analysis, concluded that the appellant's request to be placed in a VSR position "does not appear unreasonable." The administrative judge also stated that the appellant should be "given an opportunity to be trained to perform in the [VSR] position." Based on the current record, we are unable to assess the correctness of the administrative judge's findings. Accordingly, remand is necessary to further develop the record on this issue.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Because reassignment to another position is the accommodation of last resort, if the administrative judge finds that the agency is required to provide automatic drawer openers to accommodate the appellant, she need not address the matters related to the reassignment of the appellant to a VSR position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge shall determine the normal selection criteria, qualifications, and process for the GS-5 VSR position, whether the appellant meets those requirements, and under what circumstances, if any, the agency may deviate from, and has deviated from, the normal criteria, qualifications, and process in appointing individuals to a GS-5 VSR position.[9] The administrative judge shall then find whether the agency is obligated to reassign the appellant to a GS-5 VSR position.[10]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The administrative judge should determine the extent of on-the-job training provided to new GS-5 VSRs and what degree, if any, of additional training the appellant would need to perform in a VSR position. Even if the administrative judge finds that the appellant did not meet the requirements for a GS-5 VSR position at the time she first raised that option as a possible accommodation, the administrative judge should address whether the appellant meets the requirements at the time she issues her remand compliance decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;In making her determination, the administrative judge should <span id="Page_5032"></span>note that an agency is not required, as part of an accommodation, to provide training to allow an employee to acquire the skills necessary to take a position.<span class="Italic"> Sheehan</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 496; EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act at 19. She should also note that EEOC's guidance provides, however, that an agency must provide an employee with a disability who is being reassigned the training that is normally provided to anyone hired for or transferred to the position. EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act at 19.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After remand, <span class="Italic">Henry</span> was again adjudicated, resulting in more discussion concerning the concept of undue burden in terms of the cost of accommodation relative to the size of an agency's budget, and the use of reassignment as an accommodation when other accommodations cannot be made, <span class="Italic">Henry v. VA</span>, 108 MSPR 458, 462-66 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-23, 2008 MSPB 77 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A reassignment is an appropriate accommodation only after it has been shown that: (1) there are no effective accommodations that will enable the employee to perform the essential functions of her current position; or (2) all other reasonable accommodations would impose an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Combs v. Social Security Administration,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 26 (2002). Accordingly, before we consider the appellant's reassignment, we must first consider the record evidence whether the appellant can be reasonably accommodated in her previous program support clerk position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have previously addressed the appellant's requested accommodations of excusing her from filing, having other workers assist her by lifting files exceeding her limitations and by opening and closing file drawers, or hiring others to file for her. <span class="Italic">Henry,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-14. Because of the nature of the appellant's disability, including a significant limit on her ability to lift and pull, and the duties of her program support clerk position in the Veterans Services Division, we concluded that the proposed accommodations would impose an undue hardship on the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14. As discussed above, the administrative judge found in her August 18, 2006 recommendation that the proposed accommodation of the installation of automatic drawer openers would also impose an undue hardship on the agency.[3] The appellant has not contested that finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The agency provided undisputed testimony that the installation of automatic drawer openers on the 729 file drawers that program support clerks in the Veterans Services Division must file documents in would cost at least $1,500,000. MSPB Docket No. NY-0752-03-0330-B-2, Hearing Transcript (HT) at 9-15 (testimony of Patricia Amberg-Blyskal). The undisputed testimony also showed that, prior to the installation of an automated filing system, a study would have to be conducted to determine whether the building in which the agency facility was located could support the additional weight. Finally, the testimony also indicated an automated filing system would cost nearly twice the annual nonsalary budget of the agency's New York Regional Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">No other proposed accommodations were raised prior to the Board's September 1, 2005 decision. At the remand hearing, the appellant raised for the first time the possible accommodation of an adjustable cart and the use of open shelving units which, according to the appellant, would eliminate the need to open very heavy file draws.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will not usually consider new evidence and argument regarding the merits of a case during a compliance proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Ben Espinoza v. Department of the Navy,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 679, 683 (1996); <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 37 M.S.P.R. 129, 131 (1988). However, because the agency's obligation to accommodate the appellant is ongoing, the administrative judge did not err by considering the appellant's proposed accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Cason v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration,</span> 37 M.S.P.R. 261, 26869 (1988) (the fact that an appellant did not discover the existence of an accommodation until one week before Board hearing, at which accommodation issue was fully litigated, did not defeat his entitlement to the accommodation); <span class="Italic">see also Adams v. Department of the Navy,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. 276, 280 (1991), <span class="Italic">vacated on other grounds on recons.,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 289, 291-92, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 36 F.3d 1117 (Fed. Cir. 1994). The administrative judge did not address, however, whether the proposed filing system would impose an undue hardship on the agency. Thus, we do so now.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that an agency does not have to provide an accommodation that would cause an undue hardship. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(p); <span class="Italic">see Clemens v. Department of the Army,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6; 25 (2006); <span class="Italic">see also</span> EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act at 26. In determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on an agency, the Board will consider: (1) The overall size of the agency's program with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities and size of budget; (2) the type of agency operation, including the nature and composition of the agency's work force; and (3) the nature and cost of the accommodation. <span class="Italic">Henry,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">Fox v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 522, &#x00B6; 9 (1999); <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(p).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant provided evidence showing that various adjustable carts would cost less than $800. Such an expense would clearly not impose an undue hardship on the agency. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of the Navy,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. 10, 13-14 (1989) (finding that a piece of equipment with a catalog price of $992 would not impose an undue hardship on the agency). In contrast, based on the price estimates provided by the appellant, the open filing cabinet system she sought to accommodate her inability to open drawers would cost between $343.49 and $379.99 per cabinet. The cabinets have five or six drawers, and thus the cost to replace the 729 file cabinet drawers in the Veterans Services Division would be approximately $50,000. In addition, there would be additional unspecified expenses incurred from emptying the existing filing cabinets, storing the contents, installing the new filing cabinets, and returning the agency's files.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;These processes would presumably disrupt the office's operations and, therefore, the agency's ability to accomplish its mission of providing benefits to veterans.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director of the agency's New York Regional Office, Patricia Amberg-Blyskal, testified at the remand hearing that the office was responsible for five veterans benefits programs in 31 counties in eastern New York State. She also testified that the office had 161 employees and that there were 14 program support clerks in the Veterans Services Division, including the appellant. Amberg-Blyskal further testified that the office has a total budget of $14.9 million and that all but $623,000 of that amount was allocated for payroll. The non-payroll funds were used for guard services, vehicles, telephone costs, equipment maintenance, and other fixed expenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has not considered a case such as this one where the cost of a proposed accommodation is so significant. In <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Daley,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01951933, slip op. at 4 (June 20, 1997), however, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission considered a proposed accommodation that would have cost about 1.6% of the cost for an agency to occupy a campus of buildings. The EEOC found that the proposed accommodation was both unreasonable and unduly burdensome. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In the instant case, the replacement of the existing filing system with the system sought by the appellant would expend at a minimum over 8% of the nonsalary budget for the entire New York Regional Office. The expense would exceed the appellant's entire salary for a year. As in <span class="Italic">Taylor,</span> the expenditure of such a large percentage of a facilities budget to accommodate one employee would impose an undue hardship on the agency. Thus, the agency need not provide it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other than the accommodations addressed in the previous Board decisions and the open filing cabinet system addressed above, no other accommodations have been raised by the appellant. In her remand hearing testimony, the appellant acknowledged that after her reinstatement she was unaware of any other accommodations. Furthermore, the record contains a March 29, 2006 letter from a consultant at the Job Accommodation Network to an agency official stating that the only suggestion he had to address the appellant's situation was to reassign her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the record before us shows that the appellant cannot be accommodated in her program support clerk position in the Veterans Services Division. Thus, the question now before us is whether the agency has complied with the alternative action set forth in the Board's final order by reassigning the appellant to a position that does not involve heavy filing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, the agency reassigned the appellant to a permanent GS-5 program support clerk position in the Support Services Division of its New York Regional Office effective June 24, 2007. The agency states that the position encompasses the duties the appellant had been performing on a temporary basis since her return to duty. The agency has also produced a position description describing the major duties of the position and an SF-50 documenting the appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to the reassignment, the appellant's representative stated that, "[p]erhaps the most obvious accommodation of all is to allow [her] to remain in the job to which the [a]gency reinstated her..." The representative also stated before the appellant was appointed to the program support clerk position that if the position description accurately described the job, it would be a reasonable accommodation for the appellant. After the agency appointed the appellant to her new position, however, she asserted that it was not the same position that she had encumbered since her return to duty. The appellant also asserted that the position was a sham and that it was not properly classified at the GS-5 level. The appellant, however, provides no specifics to support her allegations that the position was not legitimate or that it differed from the temporary position she had been occupying.[5] <span class="Italic"> Bowden v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 505, &#x00B6; 4 (2004) ("[i]n the face of an agency's evidence of compliance, to show noncompliance an appellant must make more than <span id="Page_5033"></span>unspecific and unsupported general allegations.") Moreover, the agency has explained the classification of the position at the GS-5 level. Thus, based on a review of the record, we find that reassigning the appellant to the program support clerk position in the Support Services Division demonstrates compliance with the Board's final order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;To the extent that the appellant states that she is required to lift packages in excess of her medical limitations and that other employees are sometimes not available to assist her, she provides no information regarding the frequency of these circumstances. Nor is there any evidence suggesting that an essential function of her position is inconsistent with her medical limitations or that occasionally requesting assistance would interfere with other employees performing their duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her response to a June 22, 2007 Board order to submit evidence and argument regarding why the agency was not in compliance, the appellant argued that the agency is in noncompliance because it failed to consider her for a number of full-time positions for which she is qualified and which do not require heavy filing. One of those positions is the VSR position addressed by the administrative judge in her August 18, 2006 recommendation. The agency has consistently maintained that the appellant is not qualified to take the examination necessary to become a VSR. Because the agency is now in compliance, there is no reason to address the appellant's allegation of other possible accommodations. In any event, an employee is not entitled to the accommodation of her choice. <span class="Italic">McConnell v. Department of Army,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 163, 170 (1994); <span class="Italic">see Sheehan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 490, 494 (1995) ("a disabled employee is not entitled to accommodation which affords him rights superior to those he enjoyed prior to the onset of his condition, or to those of other non-disabled employees.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, because the agency is in compliance, the petition for enforcement is moot. As discussed below, the appellant's other arguments do not overcome the mootness of this compliance action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Conaway v. USPS</span>, 93 MSPR 6, 11, 15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 21 (2002), an enforced leave appeal, the compliance issue was whether the agency provided proper placement to an appellant who needed a light duty position that was within his medical restrictions and that was required by a collective bargaining contract. The Board's decision first noted that "the AJ should have limited the scope of his review to the source of the appellant's rights in a PFE proceedings, the EEOC's and the Board's Final Decisions, rather than revisiting the merits of the case and considering whether the agency engaged in the interactive process and what constituted a 'reasonable accommodation.'" The Board went on, however, to analyze whether the agency properly restored the appellant to duty when it changed the appellant's shift and found that medical evidence did not support the appellant's assertion that he could not work that shift.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Conaway</span> attempted to apply an EEOC decision, resulting in a remand to the Board from the Commission, that characterized the appellant as disabled with entitlement to reasonable accommodation. A problem, the Board determined, was that letters from the appellant's physician "present ever-changing accommodations, which often appear to be based on the appellant's subjective desires." Bowing to the need to resolve whether the agency engaged in an interactive process with the appellant in order to define a reasonable accommodation, the Board decided that the agency met its obligation to develop an accommodation with the appellant, but that the appellant failed to provide the information or responses necessary to ascertain a specific accommodation that could be provided, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 18-22 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 29-37:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On PFR, the appellant asserts that the agency's June 9, 1997 offer was not a reasonable accommodation and the agency did not engage in the "interactive process" to determine a reasonable accommodation for the appellant.... The appellant cites federal circuit court cases, asserting that the employer failed to engage in the interactive process and that such failure is the equivalent of failing to provide a reasonable accommodation. PFRC-3, Tab 5 at 20-22 (<span class="Italic">citing, e.g., Bultemeyer v. Fort Wayne Community Schools</span>, 100 F.3d 1281, 1284-85 (7th Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Taylor v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">However, Board precedent indicates that the employee must first show that a reasonable accommodation is possible before the employer may be required to engage in the interactive process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 46, 54 (1998) (clarifying that the agency's failure to look for a position as a reasonable accommodation does not relieve the appellant of her burden of ultimately showing that such positions existed and were available); <span class="Italic">Kitaura v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...In the present case, the EEOC and the Board, by adoption, have already considered the merits of the appellant's claim of discrimination after a hearing. In our view, the EEOC has already determined that the appellant's light duty assignment in the manual letter aisle <span class="Italic">was</span> a reasonable accommodation and, since the agency had offered appellant his light duty assignment back, the Board need not look further given the limited scope of a PFE proceeding. Thus, under our narrow reading of the EEOC decision, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether the agency has engaged in the interactive process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, however, a broader view of the EEOC Decision is taken and the agency was required to engage further in the interactive process in order to determine a "reasonable accommodation" for the appellant when he returned to work, the appellant's assertion that the agency did not make a good faith effort to engage in such a process because it "simply ceased any communication" with Dr. Rosenberg after his October 7, 1997 letter is an inaccurate description of the parties' interactions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Between June and August of 1997, the agency twice sought clarification from Dr. Rosenberg regarding the meaning of his letters requesting accommodations for the appellant, but Dr. Rosenberg's letters were not specific, did not appear to be based on objective medical evidence, and appeared to state changing "required accommodations." From October 1997 until December of 1997, the agency wrote to the appellant, notifying him that he needed to provide acceptable medical documentation in support of his absence or he would be considered AWOL. In 1997, the Department of Labor's Office of Worker's Compensation Programs (OWCP) found that the appellant had suffered disabling conditions and, in 1998, the Nurse Intervention Program, which utilizes registered nurses to monitor and manage work related injury claims for the OWCP, began working with the appellant to assist him in returning to work. In the meantime, Theresa Hensel, a labor relations specialist in the agency's Labor Relations Department who had been working on issues relating to the appellant' return to duty under the Board's and EEOC's decisions, handed over primary responsibility for this task to the Injury Compensation Unit, but continued to monitor developments and to have discussions with the appellant's attorney about the availability of positions to which the appellant might be assigned. Ms. Hensel testified that the Nurse Intervention Program was in contact with the appellant's doctor regarding where the appellant could work and Ms. Hensel remained in contact with the Injury Compensation Department, Dr. Evangelista in the Nurse's office, and the appellant's attorney to try to get the appellant back to work. The agency also repeatedly notified the appellant that he should provide acceptable medical documentation in support of his absence or be considered AWOL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 9, 1998, the appellant filed a petition for appeal with the Board contending that the agency was not in compliance with the EEOC's decision. In this petition, the appellant asserted that he could work in clerical or administrative positions at the 501 Benigno Boulevard building in Bellmawr, New Jersey, but that the agency had failed to provide a suitable accommodation. Ms. Hensel testified that this was the first time that she had considered accommodating the appellant with a position in the 501 building because that building could not provide the appellant with isolation. Ms. Hensel found a short term, clerical assignment for the appellant in that building and offered it to the appellant, but the appellant did not accept the position.... In late 1998, the agency requested updated medical information for the appellant and Dr. Rosenberg provided two more letters describing required accommodations. The agency offered another position to the appellant, which he did not accept. Then, the Labor Relations department handed over the appellant's case to the Law Department. As late as the year 2000, the agency was still making efforts to determine the appellant's restrictions, including scheduling a fitness for duty appointment for the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the AJ erred by failing to mention that Dr. Rosenberg invited the agency to speak with him about clarifying the doctor's diagnosis of the appellant if it had questions.... Ms. Hensel testified that she never called Dr. Rosenberg because the appellant's attorney requested that she not do so and she had understood this limitation to be a part of other requirements that the attorney had put on the agency, such as requiring that the appellant's medical records go to only one individual at the agency. Further, Ms. Hensel testified that it would not have made sense to meet with Dr. Rosenberg as the agency required documentation regarding medical restrictions.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5034"></span>Based on this evidence, the agency made a good faith effort to engage in the interactive process with the appellant's doctor and attorney for an extended period in an attempt understand the appellant's medical requirements and to locate an appropriate position for him. <span class="Italic">See Taylor,</span> 184 F.3d at 317 (explaining that employers can show their good faith by requesting information about the employee's condition and what limitations the employee has, asking the employee what he specifically wants, showing some sign of having considered the employee's request, and offering and discussing available alternatives when the request is too burdensome). The appellant, however, failed to provide the agency with clear and objective medical evidence of his required accommodations despite the agency's repeated and specific requests for such evidence. <span class="Italic">See Sarratt v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 405, 414 (2001) (<span class="Italic">citing</span>, in the concurring and dissenting opinion of Chairman Slavet, <span class="Italic">Templeton v. Neodata Services,</span> 162 F.3d 617 (10th Cir. 1998) (finding that the plaintiff's allegation that the agency did not provide a reasonable accommodation failed where the plaintiff did not provide medical information necessary to the accommodation process)); <span class="Italic">Beck v. University of Wisconsin Board of Regents,</span> 75 F.3d 1130, 1135 (7th Cir. 1996) (reasoning that where the missing information is of the type that can only be provided by one of the parties, failure to provide the information may be the cause of the breakdown and the party withholding the information may be found to have obstructed the process); <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, 184 F.3d at 317 (reasoning that participation is the obligation of both parties, so an employer cannot be faulted if, after conferring with the employee to find possible accommodations, the employee then fails to supply information that the employer needs or does not answer the employer's request for more detailed proposals). Thus, the appellant has not shown that the agency failed to engage in the interactive process, and the agency should not be held liable for failing to provide a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Steffes v. Stepan Co.,</span> 144 F.3d 1070, 1073 (7th Cir. 1998) (reasoning that when an employee fails to hold up her end of the interactive process by clarifying the extent of her medical restrictions, the employer cannot be held liable for failing to provide reasonable accommodations). We, therefore, conclude that even if we read the EEOC Decision broadly, the agency has shown that it complied with the EEOC's and the Board's Final Decisions by canceling the appellant's enforced leave, engaging in the interactive process, and providing the appellant with a reasonable accommodation for his disability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board was unclear on the extent of its involvement in the determination of reasonable accommodation for an employee who was restored to duty in <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 46 MSPR 75, 78-79 (1990), although the Board insisted that the agency avoid impairing the nature of the employee's appointed position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that the agency is not in compliance with the Board's decision because, although returned to his former grade and pay, he has been continually detailed into positions with duties that are physically demanding and violate his medical restrictions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Dacey v. United States Postal Service</span>, 36 MSPR 198, 200 (1988), the Board found that the burden is on the agency to submit to the Board proof of compliance with its order. Our review of the evidence concerning the appellant's reinstatement fails to reveal that the agency met this burden. Specifically, we find that it does not support the administrative judge's determination that the agency placed the appellant in a permanent light duty position....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who proves handicap discrimination is entitled to a permanent position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ellis v. United States Postal Service</span>, 37 MSPR 503, 509-10 (1988). Further, an employee who prevails in a Board appeal is entitled to be placed in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> by being returned to a position of the same grade, pay, status, and tenure.... Thus, an agency cannot comply with a Board order reinstating an appellant who occupied a permanent position by giving him light duty tasks that are not a permanent position....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 60 MSPR 279, 285 (1994), undercut <span class="Italic">Gonzales</span> when the Board would not direct the agency to accomplish required accommodation by assigning the employee to a specific work location or position. The agency was only required to cancel the adverse action against the insufficiently accommodated employee. [Refer to Chapter 12, "<a href="0100-2023-19-107.html#sec12-103">Undue Hardship</a>."]</p>
