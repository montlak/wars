<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-207"><span class="space">a.</span> Nepotism; Hiring of Friend</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Nepotism is prohibited by 5 USC 2302(b)(7) and 5 USC 3110(b). A public official may not advocate a relative for employment or appointment in the agency employing the official. 5 USC 3110 provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Employment of relatives; restrictions</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;For the purpose of this section--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;agency means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;an Executive agency;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_2714"></span>(B)&#x2003;an office, agency, or other establishment in the legislative branch;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;an office, agency, or other establishment in the judicial branch; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003;the government of the District of Columbia;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;"public official" means an officer (including the President and a Member of Congress), a member of the uniformed service, an employee and any other individual, in whom is vested the authority by law, rule, or regulation, or to whom the authority has been delegated, to appoint, employ, promote, or advance individuals, or to recommend individuals for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement in connection with employment in an agency; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;"relative" means, with respect to a public official, an individual who is related to the public official as father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, niece, husband, wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepfather, stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother, stepsister, half brother, or half sister.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the public official. An individual may not be appointed, employed, promoted, or advanced in or to a civilian position in an agency if such appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement has been advocated by a public official, serving in or exercising jurisdiction or control over the agency, who is a relative of the individual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;An individual appointed, employed, promoted, or advanced in violation of this section is not entitled to pay, and money may not be paid from the Treasury as pay to an individual so appointed, employed, promoted, or advanced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;The Office of Personnel Management may prescribe regulations authorizing the temporary employment, in the event of emergencies resulting from natural disasters or similar unforeseen events or circumstances, of individuals whose employment would otherwise be prohibited by this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;This section shall not be construed to prohibit the appointment of an individual who is a preference eligible in any case in which the passing over of that individual on a certificate of eligibles furnished under section 3317(a) of this title will result in the selection for appointment of an individual who is not a preference eligible.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 2302(b)(7) restates the prohibition against nepotism, in broader terms, making it a prohibited personnel practice to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position any individual who is a relative (as defined in section 3110(a)(3) of this title) of such employee if such position is in the agency in which such employee is serving as a public official (as defined in section 3110(a)(2) of this title) or over which such employee exercises jurisdiction or control as such an official.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">By notice of April 20, 2005, in the Federal Register, OPM issued a final regulation "on a plain language rewrite of its regulations regarding the employment of relatives" 70 Fed. Reg. 20457 (April 20, 2005). The regulatory changes were made to avoid a regulatory restatement of the underlying statute, 5 USC 3110. 5 CFR 310 (2022), effective May 20, 2005, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 310.101 <span class="Italic">Legal restrictions on public officials in the employment of relatives.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3110 of title 5, United States Code, sets forth the legal restrictions on the employment of relatives.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 310.102 <span class="Italic">Exceptions to the legal restrictions on the employment of relatives</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsection (d) of 5 U.S.C. 3110 authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to prescribe regulations authorizing the temporary employment of relatives, in certain conditions, notwithstanding the restrictions. This regulation sets forth exceptions to the restrictions. When necessary to meet urgent needs resulting from an emergency posing an immediate threat to life or property, or a national emergency as defined in &#x00A7; 230.402(a)(1) of this title, a public official may employ relatives to meet those needs without regard to the restrictions on the employment of relatives in 5 U.S.C. 3110. Such appointments are temporary and may not exceed 30 days, but the agency may extend such an appointment for one additional 30-day period if the emergency need still exists at the time of the extension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the regulations effective on May 20, 2005, the OPM regulations parsed the statute, with some additional language:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 310.101 <span class="Italic">Coverage.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This subpart applies to appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement in (a) the competitive service; and (b) the excepted service in the executive branch.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 310.102 <span class="Italic">Definitions</span>. In this subpart:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Relative</span> means father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, niece, husband, wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepfather, stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother, stepsister, half brother, or half sister.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Public official</span> means an officer, a member of the uniformed services, an employee, and any other individual, in whom is vested the authority by law, rule, or regulation, or to whom the authority has been delegated, to appoint, employ, promote, or advance individuals, or to recommend individuals for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Chain of Command</span> is the line of supervisory personnel that runs from a public official to the head of his agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 310.103 Restrictions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;A public official shall not advocate one of his relatives for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement to a position in his agency or in an agency over which he exercises jurisdiction or control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A public official shall not appoint, employ, promote, or advance to a position in his agency or in an agency over which he exercises jurisdiction or control:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;One of his relatives; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The relative of a public official of his agency, or of a public official who exercises jurisdiction or control over his agency, if the public official has advocated the appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement of that relative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;For the purpose of this section, a public official who recommends a relative, or refers a relative for consideration by a public official standing lower in the chain of command, for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement is deemed to have advocated the appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement of the relative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;This section does not prohibit the appointment in the competitive service of a preference eligible if (1) his name is within reach for selection from an appropriate certificate of eligibles and (2) an alternative selection cannot be made from the certificate without passing over the preference eligible and selecting an individual who is not a preference eligible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 310.201 <span class="Italic">Coverage</span>. This subpart applies to an office, agency, or other establishment in the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Federal Government, and in the government of the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 310.202 <span class="Italic">Exceptions</span>. When necessary to meet urgent needs resulting from an emergency posing an immediate threat to life or property, or a national emergency as defined in Sec. 230.402(a)(1) of this title, a public official may employ relatives to meet those needs without regard to the restrictions in section 3110 of title 5, United States Code, and this part. Appointments under these conditions are temporary not to exceed 1 month, but may be extended for a 2nd month if the emergency need still exists.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Advocacy is defined by the older regulation, 5 CFR 310.103(c) (2004), to include recommendations or referrals of relatives for consideration by a subordinate. The charge of advocacy of employment of a relative is not sustained if the appointing officer is not lower in the chain of command than the official making the referral or recommendation. <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 24 MSPR 621, 624 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Welch v. USDA</span>, 37 MSPR 18, 22-23 (1988) (sustaining a charge of nepotism; the appellant who actively engaged promoted his son's appointment); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Ponce</span>, 29 MSPR 385, 386 (1985) (accepting a settlement agreement imposing a 14-day suspension for nepotism). The constitutionality of anti-nepotism laws was reviewed in <span class="Italic">Cutts v. Fowler</span>, 692 F.2d 138, 140-41 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Keller v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 183, 189 (1996), suggested that nepotism was not involved in an appointment by an individual who was apparently not influenced by the appointee's relative, who then became the appointee's second-level supervisor:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency terminated the appellant during his probationary period for pre-appointment reasons, i.e., his appointment was the result of actions which the agency believed violated 5 USC 3110(b), which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the public official. An individual may not be appointed, employed, promoted, or advanced in or to a civilian position in an agency if such appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement has been advocated by a public official, serving in or exercising jurisdiction or control over the agency, who is a relative of the individual.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For discussion of the exception in Postal Service regulations permitting hiring of a relative under "emergency" situations, refer to <span class="Italic">Roberts v. USPS</span>, 12 MSPR 471, 474 (1982); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Chapman v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3239) (removal of <span id="Page_2715"></span>a human relations specialist who did not follow agency regulations requiring approval before hiring relatives). <span class="Italic">Rentz v. USPS</span>, 19 MSPR 35, 38-39 (1984), sustained dismissal of a customer services manager for misuse of his position to grant special treatment and privileges to his wife, who was employed in the same post office as her husband. The appellant engaged in nepotism by recommending his wife for promotion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Keller v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 183, 189 (1996), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, involving a probationer's termination, discussed decisions addressing improper advocacy of appointments by relatives:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that, on April 3, 1994, the appellant was appointed to the WG-7 Maintenance Worker position by Mr. Meadows and placed under the second-level supervision of Mr. Lang, his father-in-law. Further, the relationship between a father-in-law and son-in-law is included in the statutory prohibition of 5 USC 3110(b). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 3110(a)(3). It is also undisputed, however, that Mr. Meadows, who hired the appellant, was Mr. Lang's superior, rather than Mr. Lang's subordinate and, thus, Mr. Lang had no official authority over Mr. Meadows, including the authority to direct him to appoint or employ the appellant or to advance his employment. <span class="Italic">See Alexander v. Department of the Navy</span>, 24 MSPR 621, 625 (1984) (the appellant's conversations with a public official in which the appellant inquired of job opportunities and, upon that official's request, forwarded his daughter's SF-171, did not constitute advocacy under, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, 5 USC 3110, where the public official was not a subordinate of the appellant and there was no evidence that the appellant spoke in favor of, recommended, commended, or endorsed the employment of his daughter; moreover, even if the appellant's conduct revealed an interest in securing or facilitating his daughter's consideration for employment, his conduct was not improper because the public official concerned was not lower in the chain of command than the appellant); <span class="Italic">cf. Welch v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 37 MSPR 18, 22 (1988) (the appellant's stated intention of hiring his son and his order directing a subordinate employee to prepare a written justification for the temporary appointment of his son violated 5 USC 3110(b)); <span class="Italic">Roberts v. US Postal Service</span>, 11 MSPB 106, 12 MSPR 471, 475 (1989) (the appellant Postmaster's letter urging the agency to allow his daughter to take the civil service exam and, if her grade was sufficient, to replace another employee could be construed as advancement or advocacy of appointment of a relative to a civil service position in violation of 5 USC 3110), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1063 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant has asserted that Mr. Lang was in no way involved in his appointment, employment, or advancement as a WG-7 Maintenance Worker. Moreover, even if Mr. Lang had discussed, but not advanced or advocated, the appellant's employment with Mr. Meadows, Mr. Lang's conduct would not have been in violation of 5 USC 3110(b) because he was in a lower level of command than Mr. Meadows. <span class="Italic">See Alexander</span>, 24 MSPR at 625. Thus, the mere fact that Mr. Lang certified the position description for the WG-7 position, or was the appellant's second-level supervisor, does not indicate that he appointed or employed the appellant or advanced or advocated his employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a decision primarily concentrating on correction of factual analysis by the AJ, <span class="Italic">Wallace and Martin v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 106 MSPR 23, 29 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-13, 2007 MSPB 141 (2007), determined to be unsupported allegations that the appellant, acting chief of personnel for the Patent Office, violated nepotism statutes and associated OPM regulations, and that she created the appearance of a conflict of interest, through the hiring process when the appellant's sister was selected for a position with the agency's personnel office. The appellant recused herself from the process, involving two rounds of vacancy announcements. As to the few points of law discussed in the opinion, the Board determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3110(b) of title 5, United States Code, provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the public official. An individual may not be appointed, employed, promoted, or advanced in or to a civilian position in an agency if such appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement has been advocated by a public official, serving in or exercising jurisdiction or control over the agency, who is a relative of the individual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A recurring theme of the agency's charges against Wallace is that she served as the PTO's chief personnel officer at the same time that her subordinates in OHR selected Martin. The agency's second, third, and fourth charges all alleged that Wallace "continued to maintain a position of direct authority over each subordinate involved in the handling of the case[.] " However, Wallace's maintenance of such a position did not, standing alone, constitute any of the actions ("appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement") necessary to violate the statutes which prohibit nepotism with respect to federal employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(b)(7) and 3110(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In fact, prior to being abolished, the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM)[2] specifically provided, "The relative of a public official may be appointed by a subordinate of the official if the official is in no way involved in the action and if the agency concerned has no regulations prohibiting such employment." FPM, Chapter 310, Subchapter 1-3(b)(1) (1988)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The FPM was abolished on December 31, 1993; however, it may be relied upon for useful guidance in appropriate circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Drury v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6; 8 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the notice of proposed removal, the agency alleged that the actions Wallace took in violation of the anti-nepotism statutes included advocating in favor of Martin's appointment to a position within the agency and approving Britt's selection of Martin. The agency contended that Wallace's advocacy and approval of Martin's appointment occurred during one conversation with Grace and during two conversations with Britt. Even though "approval" of an appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement is not listed among the actions which the statute proscribes, the AJ found that Wallace had approved Martin's appointment by reviewing Martin's application and asking Britt if she made the selection properly. Beyond the advocacy and approval specified in the agency's charges, the AJ also found that Wallace's implicit approval of the selection panel for the 115 announcement, along with her alleged review of Martin's application, amounted to an "endorsement" of Martin's selection which also constituted advocacy in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3110.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency alleged that, during the conversation with Grace, Wallace advised Grace that Martin was interested in applying for the position under the 115 announcement and then asked whether Martin could use the same application for the 115 announcement that she had submitted for the 010 announcement. The agency's first charge alleged that Wallace "asked Ms. Grace if [Martin's] application from a previous vacancy announcement could be used to apply for other job openings" and that "[a]s a result of this discussion, Grace submitted [Martin's] application from announcement PTO-04-010 for consideration under vacancy announcement PTO-04-115." Further, the agency's fourth charge alleged that Wallace "referred [her] sister to a subordinate, Ms. Britt, for consideration for a promotion under vacancy announcement PTO-04-115," presumably through her alleged inquiry to Grace regarding reusing Martin's previous application for the new vacancy announcement. The regulations in effect at the time of the alleged referral provided, in pertinent part, that "a public official who recommends a relative, or refers a relative for consideration by a public official standing lower in the chain of command, for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement is deemed to have advocated the appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement of the relative."[3] 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 310.103(c) (2005)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Although part 310 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations has since been amended to delete this language, 70 Fed. Reg. 20,457 (April 20, 2005), the quoted language was in effect during the period relevant to this appeal. Nevertheless, OPM's authority to issue the regulations set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 310.101-310.103 does not derive from the anti-nepotism statute, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 3110, but instead derives from the general authority granted to OPM under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104. The anti-nepotism statute only grants OPM authority to prescribe regulations authorizing temporary employment, in the event of emergencies resulting from natural disasters or similar unforeseen events or circumstances, that would otherwise be prohibited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3110. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3110(d); <span class="Italic">see Alexander v. Department of the Navy</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 621, 624 n.4 (1984). Thus, there may be some question as to the amount of deference the Board should accord to the OPM regulation that was in effect during the relevant period. <span class="Italic">See Butterbaugh v. Department of Justice</span>, 336 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (the notable absence of explicit rulemaking authority must be weighed when determining the deference due to an agency regulation). Because we find, as set forth in the text, <span class="Italic">infra</span>, that the agency failed to prove that Wallace violated the regulation by recommending or referring Martin for consideration by a public official standing lower in the chain of command, we need not resolve whether this OPM regulation is entitled to deference.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wallace and Martin v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 106 MSPR 23, 28 &#x00B6; 7, 2007 MSPB 141 (2007), <span class="Italic">supra,</span> noted the position of the individual who receives a job through nepotism, the nepotee, and the draconian remedy exacted by statute (although Ms. Martin's removal was reversed by the Board since her sister, Mrs. Wallace, did not engage in nepotism):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 18, 2005, Matthews issued three letters to Martin. The first letter informed Martin that the agency was cancelling her appointment because Matthews found that it was made in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3110 and 2302, and it advised Martin of her appeal rights to the Board. The second letter notified Martin that, because her appointment was in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3110, she was not entitled to pay under the appointment and that she would receive a bill directly from the National Finance Center for the salary she received during the term of her illegal <span id="Page_2716"></span>appointment. The third letter noted that the agency must remove all references to the appointment from Martin's official personnel folder (OPF) and offered her the option of the inclusion of a "transcript of service," which would have explicitly stated that she had been illegally appointed, if she wanted "to have the service recorded in [her] OPF to use for qualifications purposes in the future."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Nichols</span>, 36 MSPR 445, 455-56 (1988), an OSC disciplinary case, considered the implications of hiring friends:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...This evidence is simply insufficient to support an inference that Nichols created the GS-12 job for Williams solely for the purpose of permitting her to compete for the GS-13 position, as charged....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the basis of the same factual findings, the CALJ found petitioner failed to prove its second charge that respondent's personnel actions created the appearance of giving preferential treatment to Williams in violation of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 735.201a(b). We have recognized that conduct which actually involves no wrongful use of public office for private purposes may nonetheless create an appearance of such wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">See Burnett v. U.S. Soldiers' &#x0026;</span> <span class="Italic">Airmen's Home,</span> 13 MSPR 311 (1982) (finding a violation of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 735.20la(a)). This is the first time, however, that we have addressed whether hiring a friend creates an appearance of impropriety in violation of section 735.201a(b). It seems evident that we must examine the question against an objective standard on the facts of each case. Fundamental fairness precludes disciplining an employee for conduct unless he or she should have known it would appear improper to a reasonable observer under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We believe this standard is in accord with the approach of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), the agency primarily responsible for developing rules and regulations pertaining to conflicts of interests and standards of conduct. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 738.102(a)(3). The OGE has recognized that "[a]ppearance questions require decisions on a case-by-case basis...." Letter No. 86-6, June 23, 1986. The only statutory prohibition addressing relationships in hiring is limited to the hiring of relatives. 5 USC &#x00A7; 3110; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(7); 5 CFR Part 310. The OGE has not expanded the statutory restriction by establishing general prohibitions relating to the appearance of preferential treatment in the hiring of friends and acquaintances. In these circumstances, it would be inappropriate for the Board to establish general prohibitions based on degree of friendship, and the Board will instead apply a case-by-case approach based on an objective, "reasonable person" standard to charges that section 735.201a(b) has been violated.</p>

SSA</span>, DE-0752-20-0346-I-1 (1/24/2023) ("The agency contends that a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts would find that the appellant's involvement in the hiring of her son's girlfriend created the appearance of lack of impartiality. In support of its assertion, the agency lists a number of facts that were available to the appellant. However...the appellant's first-level supervisor, R.C., had specifically advised her that her participation in the hiring process for R.N. did not raise any ethical concerns....Hence, we find that fundamental fairness precludes disciplining the appellant for creating the appearance of an ethical violation."); <span class="Italic">Tartaglia v.
