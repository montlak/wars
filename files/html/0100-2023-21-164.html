<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-162"><span class="space">1.</span> Estoppel as Basis to Create, Continue, or Adjust Benefit or Overpayment</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Benefits cannot be awarded or continued, contrary to law, because of an error by OPM, as <span class="Italic">Shelley v. OPM</span>, 6 MSPR 267, 269-72 (1981), determined when OPM terminated survivor annuity benefits to an annuitant's spouse despite its failure to notify the annuitant that her survivor annuity would be terminated, under the law then in effect, once she reached age 50:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The long-established rule has been that "estoppel cannot be set up against the Government on the basis of an unauthorized representation or act of an officer or employee who is without authority in his individual capacity to bind the Government." <span class="Italic">Byrne Organization, Inc. v. United States,</span> 287 F.2d 582, 587 (Ct. Cl. 1961). <span class="Italic">See also Federal Crop Insurance Corp. v. Merrill,</span> 332 U.S. 380 (1947). In <span class="Italic">Montilla v. United States,</span> 457 F.2d 978 (Ct. Cl. 1972), The Court of Claims held that the misrepresentations of officers of the U.S. Army to the plaintiff, leading him to believe that he had completed twenty years of active military service and was thus eligible for retirement pay upon reaching age sixty, could not alter the fact that the plaintiff had not actually completed twenty years of active service as computed under 10 U.S.C. 1332 (1964). The <span class="Italic">Montilla</span> court reasoned:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Unless a law has been repealed or declared unconstitutional by the courts, it is a part of the supreme law of the land and no officer or agency can by his actions or conduct waive its provisions or nullify its enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">457 F.2d at 987.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Wharton,</span> the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals departed from this principle in the context of estopping the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in 1975 from divesting a family of land which had been their homestead since 1919, because BLM agents had misinformed the family on several occasions that they could no longer file a desert entry application for the land, while in fact they could have filed such an application. 514 F.2d at 412. In <span class="Italic">Goldberg v. Weinberger,</span> 546 F.2d 477 (2d Cir. 1976), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom. Goldberg v. Califano,</span> 431 U.S. 937 (1977), however, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals declined to follow the lead of the <span class="Italic">Wharton</span> court where a Social Security Administration (SSA) officer misinformed a widow, who was receiving disability insurance benefits, that her remarriage before age sixty would only reduce her benefits, while in fact her remarriage a few months before her sixtieth birthday terminated her benefits under 42 U.S.C. 402(e)(4) (1970). The <span class="Italic">Goldberg</span> court explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The government could scarcely function if it were bound by its employees' unauthorized representations. Where a party claims entitlement to benefits under federal statutes and lawfully promulgated regulations, that party must satisfy the requirements imposed by Congress. Even detrimental reliance on misinformation obtained from a seemingly authorized government agency will not excuse a failure to qualify for the benefits under the relevant statutes and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">546 F.2d at 481 (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Leimbach v. Califano,</span> 596 F.2d 300 (8th Cir. 1979), the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that misinformation by SSA officials on several different occasions spanning several years as to a particular claimant's ineligibility for child's insurance benefits did not estop that agency from adhering to the statutory provision allowing for a maximum of one year of retroactivity from the date the application was filed, as implemented by the regulatory provision requiring that the application for such benefits be in writing. "Such action on the part of Agency employees, although regrettable," said the Court, "will not give rise to estoppel against the government." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 305.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, in <span class="Italic">Gressley v. Califano,</span> 609 F.2d 1265 (7th Cir. 1979), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that, even if an SSA claims representative had told the claimant's wife that the claimant could establish a sufficient period of employment to make him eligible for disability benefits if he were to file amended income tax returns showing self-employment income for two years, the SSA was not estopped from later denying benefits on the grounds that the returns were ineffective to establish credits for self-employment because they were filed after the statutory deadline. In reaching this conclusion, the Court acknowledged that it was among the minority of jurisdictions which have applied the estoppel doctrine to the Government, citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Fox Lake State Bank,</span> 366 F.2d 962 (7th Cir. 1966). It distinguished its ruling in <span class="Italic">Gressley</span> from its holding in <span class="Italic">Fox Lake,</span> however, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Congress leaves no discretion in the agencies and courts but to limit payment of benefits to those statutorily entitled to them. When we estopped the Government in <span class="Italic">Fox Lake,</span> we merely held that in light of the actions of the FHA it would be unfair for the Government to exercise its discretion to sue. Were we to estop the Government in the present case, we would instead be interfering with the duty of administrative agencies and courts to follow the mandate of Congress and limit payment to those whom our elected representatives have deemed eligible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">609 F.2d at 1268 (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with this distinction, in <span class="Italic">Molton, Allen and Williams, Inc. v. Harris,</span> 613 F.2d 1176, 1180-81 (D.C. Cir. 1980), the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that the Department of Housing and Urban Development was equitably estopped from insisting that applications for mortgage options be accepted in writing, as required by regulation, where the regulation gave loan representatives the authority to waive such a requirement and where a loan representative told a particular applicant that his application had been accepted. The Court emphasized that "waiver can occur only where the government agent has authority to waive, and then only under circumstances that would indicate waiver between private parties." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1181.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hansen v. Harris,</span> 619 F.2d 942 (2d Cir. 1980), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with the holding of the Eighth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Leimbach,</span> discussed above, and ruled that misinformation by an SSA field representative regarding a claimant's eligibility for divorced mother's insurance benefits estopped the SSA from invoking the regulatory requirement that all applications be in writing, so that the statutory maximum of one year's retroactivity could be applied as of the date on which the eligible claimant inquired about filing an application and received the misinformation. The Court expressly limited the application of the estoppel doctrine against a Government agency "to the situation where (a) a procedural not a substantive requirement is involved and (b) an internal procedural manual or guide or some other source of objective standards of conduct exists and supports an inference of misconduct by a Government employee." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 949.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the appeal now before the Board, the appellant's survivor annuity benefits were based on the following statutory provision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In case any officer or employee to whom this Act applies shall die subsequent to the date of enactment of this Act after having rendered at least five years of civilian service computed as prescribed in section 5 of this Act, or after having retired subsequent to such date of enactment under Section 1, 2, or 6, and is survived by a widow and a child or children, such widow shall be paid an immediate annuity terminable upon death, remarriage, or attainment of age fifty....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. 724(c)(2) (1952). Since the statutorily imposed age requirement for eligibility is clearly substantive rather than procedural, and since it allows for the exercise of no discretion on the part of the administrative agency, OPM cannot be estopped from enforcing it under the case law discussed above, despite the unfortunate fact that OPM's predecessor misinformed the appellant as to her continued eligibility for survivor annuity benefits. The <span class="Italic">Wharton</span> decision is inapposite to the case at hand because, as in <span class="Italic">Fox Lake,</span> it involved the Government's exercise of its discretion to bring suit, whereas this case involves the duty of OPM to follow the mandate of Congress and limit the payment of survivor annuities to those whom Congress deemed eligible. <span class="Italic">See Goldberg,</span> 546 F.2d at 481; <span class="Italic">Montilla,</span> 457 F.2d at 987.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Estoppel could not create service credit as a result of promise of credit for time in medical school to induce employment with the government. <span class="Italic">Enna v. OPM</span>, 8 MSPR 445, 446 (1981). Estoppel was again rejected as a basis to establish entitlement to annuity benefits in <span class="Italic">Krueger v. OPM</span>, 13 MSPR 348 (1982), and in <span class="Italic">Koch v. OPM</span>, 20 MSPR 461 (1984), when the employing agency incorrectly informed the employee that he had slightly over five years of creditable civilian service. Incorrect advice from officials of an employing agency concerning the level of benefits, involving application of pay retention provisions, did not estop OPM from correctly determining the level of an annuity. <span class="Italic">Ragunas v.

An estoppel theory could not require OPM to accept a redeposit <span id="Page_4379"></span>of withdrawn retirement funds in order to permit the appellant to obtain a retroactive deferred annuity; it was immaterial that officials of the employing agency provided incorrect advice. <span class="Italic">Mahan v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 639, 641 (1991).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant additionally challenges the administrative judge's reliance on <span class="Italic">Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, in finding that the appellant's alleged reliance on his facility manager's erroneous advice could not form the basis for an award of a retirement benefit to which he was not otherwise entitled. Specifically, the appellant argues that the Court in <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> left open the possibility that a claim of equitable estoppel could succeed against the government under certain circumstances, and he contends that the Board has "continued to confirm that affirmative misconduct by a government official would justify the application of equitable estoppels." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">McDonald v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 236 (2010)). The appellant alleges that, because the Board recognizes that equitable estoppel may be applied in situations where the government official displayed affirmative misconduct, the administrative judge erred in failing to advise him of his burden of proof to establish his equitable estoppel claim. Accordingly, the appellant submits new argument and evidence in an attempt to establish affirmative misconduct by the facility manager, who he claims knowingly and maliciously provided him false information about his retirement eligibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Equitable estoppel, however, is not available to the appellant under the circumstances. Contrary to the appellant's assertions, even though the Court in <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> did leave open the possibility that equitable estoppel may be applied against the federal government in cases involving affirmative misconduct, it specifically excluded cases, like the appellant's, in which the relief sought would result in the expenditure of public funds from the United States Treasury not appropriated by an act of Congress. <span class="Italic">Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. at 434. Indeed, in the case relied upon by the appellant to support his contentions, <span class="Italic">McDonald</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 11, the Board explained that equitable estoppel was available to the appellant in her particular situation because she did not seek to draw additional funds from the United States Treasury but rather requested that her husband's annuity be reduced to provide her with a survivor annuity.[1] Here, the administrative judge properly concluded that equitable estoppel is not available to the appellant under <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> because an award of an immediate retirement to the appellant would result in the expenditure of appropriated funds in contravention of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(e). Accordingly, the appellant's new argument and evidence with respect to his equitable estoppel claim are not material to the outcome of his appeal. <span class="Italic">See Russo v. Veterans Administration</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 345, 349 (1980); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(a)(1), (d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The appellant also cites <span class="Italic">Ramirez-Carlo v. United States</span>, 496 F.3d 41, 49 (1st Cir. 2007), to support his contention that equitable estoppel is available to him because of the affirmative misconduct of his facility manager. That case, however, involves a claim against the Department of Veterans Affairs for monetary damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act and is not analogous to the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dawson v. USDA</span>, 121 MSPR 495, 503-07 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15, 18-22, 2014 MSPB 67 (2014) (Member Robbins concurring), declined to apply estoppel to require belated extension of a VSIP offer to an employee who was on indefinite suspension and cut off from the email access that would have notified him of the VSIP offer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we disagree with the administrative judge's determination that the appellant demonstrated good cause for his untimely filed application to retire with a VERA benefit. There is no dispute that, because the appellant was serving an indefinite suspension, he lacked the only means to receive the agency's December 2012 VERA/VSIP notification during the "window" period, i.e., agency email. The administrative judge determined that, but for the indefinite suspension, the appellant would have received the December 2012 VERA/VSIP notification in the normal manner. The administrative judge further determined that, because the agency did not provide the appellant with a copy of the notification during the window period for submitting applications or at any time prior to his removal, the appellant was effectively denied the opportunity to timely apply for the December 2012 VERA/VSIP. The administrative judge concluded that, although the appellant's March 8, 2013 application for early retirement was untimely filed (i.e., filed outside the window period), good cause existed for its untimeliness. For the reasons set forth below, we disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next turn to the administrative judge's determination that the agency's failure to provide the appellant with a copy of the December 5, 2012 VERA/VSIP notification during the window period excused his untimely filing of his application for early retirement. Here, OPM's regulations provide that an agency may limit voluntary early retirement offers, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, based on "[a]n established opening and closing date for the acceptance of applications that is announced to employees at the time of the offer." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.114(h)(1). Subject to exceptions not applicable here, an agency may not offer or process voluntary early retirements beyond the stated expiration date of a VERA. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.114(m). As stated above, the appellant submitted a VERA application on March 8, 2013, after the agency's window period for filing applications had closed on December 21, 2012. Thus, the appellant's application was untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized that an agency's misconduct may preclude enforcement of a filing deadline under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, at least where such estoppel would not result in the expenditure of appropriated funds in contravention of statute. <span class="Italic">See Nunes v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 16 (2009). We find no misconduct on the part of the agency in this case that would warrant application of this doctrine. The administrative judge appears to have concluded that the agency effectively and unfairly denied the appellant the opportunity to timely apply for early retirement by indefinitely suspending him, thereby barring his access to his email, and by failing to send him the December 2012 VERA/VSIP notification during that period. As stated above, however, we conclude that the administrative judge erred in reversing the indefinite suspension and that the imposition of the suspension was proper. Because the imposition of the indefinite suspension, and the appellant's consequent lack of access to his email, are not attributable to any agency misconduct, these circumstances do not provide a basis for waiving the filing deadline on equitable grounds.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Board has recognized that an agency's failure to provide a notice of rights and the applicable filing deadline may warrant waiver of the deadline if a statute or regulation requires that such notice be given, <span class="Italic">see Nunes</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 16. We find, however, that the agency's email announcement was reasonably calculated to provide its employees with notice of the December 2012 VERA/VSIP opportunity, and therefore satisfied its obligation under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.114(h)(1) to announce to employees at the time of the offer the established opening and closing dates for the acceptance of applications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the application of equitable principles here, notably, the doctrine of unclean hands, heavily weighs against waiving the filing deadline in this case. <span class="Italic">Cf. Walls v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ("'broad equitable principles of justice and good conscience' should be applied in good cause determinations") (quoting <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980)). The doctrine of unclean hands "is a self-imposed ordinance that closes the doors of a court of equity to one tainted with inequitableness or bad faith relative to the matter in which he seeks relief, however improper may have been the behavior of the defendant." <span class="Italic">Princess Cruises, Inc. v. United States</span>, 397 F.3d 1358, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (quoting <span class="Italic">Precision Instrument Manufacturing Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co</span>., 324 U.S. 806, 814 (1945)) (an equity court has a wide range when exercising discretion to refuse to aid an unclean litigant; a court is not bound by formula or restrained by any limitation that tends to trammel the free and just exercise of discretion); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Filiberti</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 37, 39 (the unclean hands doctrine holds that "the person who seeks equity must do equity"), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 577 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has invoked the doctrine of unclean hands rarely, most notably in the context of a petition to enforce a settlement agreement. For example, in <span class="Italic">Wofford v. Department of Justice</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 367, 373 (2010), the Board denied the appellant's petition because the Board determined that she herself breached the agreement before she became aware of the agency's breach, and her actions of filing claims against the agency with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and in U.S. District Court were clearly a material breach. The Board further stated that "the appellant's actions were 'tainted with inequitableness or bad faith relative to the matter in which she seeks relief, however improper may have been the behavior of the agency.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Precision Instrument Manufacturing, Inc</span>., 324 U.S. at 814); <span class="Italic">see also Alderete v. Department of the Interior</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 16 (2005) (McPhie, Chairman, separate opinion, &#x00B6; 13) (the employee's involuntary retirement appeal should be dismissed because she came to the Board with unclean hands).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is appropriate to invoke the doctrine of unclean hands when there is an element of bad faith shown on the part of one or more of the litigants. <span class="Italic">See Precision Instrument Manufacturing, Inc</span>., 324 U.S. at 814. It is clear from the facts of this case that it was the appellant's misconduct, rather than any misconduct on the part of the agency, that precluded him from accessing the agency's notice. That is, the appellant engaged in a lengthy pattern of bad faith and deceitful behavior when he embezzled government funds over which he had control. <span class="Italic">See Promac, Inc. v. West</span>, 203 F.3d 786, 788-89 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (the lowest bidder for a government construction project was not entitled to reformation of that contract based on the government's alleged violations of regulations during the bidding process, given that the bidder benefitted from and actively <span id="Page_4380"></span>participated with the government in the challenged procurement process and thus had unclean hands and was not entitled to equitable relief); <span class="Italic">Richards v. General Motors Corp</span>., 876 F. Supp. 1492, 1511 (E.D. Mich. 1995) (an employee who back-dated asset transfer forms in an attempt to secure retroactive gains in his employer's stock purchase plan had unclean hands and was therefore precluded from asserting a claim against his employer under the Employees Retirement Income Security Act; the employee knew or should have known that back-dating the forms violated stock purchase plan rules and was "simply wrong"). Accordingly, application of equitable principles here weigh against waiving the filing deadline in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although estoppel may not create entitlement to a benefit not authorized by law, if OPM provides incorrect advice concerning options to be selected that impact the amount of an annuity, the annuity may be adjusted to avoid the impact of the error when the more choice could have been lawfully made with the proper advice from OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lessard v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 371, 375 (1990) (adjusting retirement date by reason of agency's incorrect advice to employee, with the result that the appellant was entitled to a recalculation of an overpayment); <span class="Italic">Keefe v. OPM</span>, 19 MSPR 609 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Hosford v. OPM</span>, 107 MSPR 418, 424 &#x00B6; 14, 2007 MSPB 295 (2007) (directing OPM to convert appellant's disability retirement into an immediate optional retirement when that would have been her choice, given proper information from her employing agency as to retirement options, so that she could have received the FERS Retiree Annuity Supplement until she reached age 62); <span class="Italic">Jano v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 297 (1985) (adjusting retirement date to allow adjustment for a cost of living increase based on reasonable and detrimental reliance on incorrect advice from employing agency); <span class="Italic">Salyer v. OPM</span>, 28 MSPR 301, 302 n.2 (1985) ("appellant's spouse was not informed of his option to waive his military retirement pay and elect to commence his retirement instead of continuing in sick leave status"); <span class="Italic">Biliter v. OPM</span>, 23 MSPR 143 (1984) (permitting retroactive selection of a retirement option, involving a statutory change, that could have been properly made had the appellant been properly informed of the available choices by his agency and by OPM); <span class="Italic">Potter v. OPM</span>, 21 MSPR 476 (1984) (adjusting retirement date based on incorrect information that resulted in a later retirement date than would otherwise have been available). It can happen that an employing agency provides incorrect advice on annuity matters. It has occurred that the Board has directed OPM to provide proper advice to an appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cortinas v. OPM</span>, 32 MSPR 513, 516-17 (1987); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">McBurney v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 126, 129-30 (1988) (OPM could be compelled to provide a lump sum refund to the appellant, rather than an annuity, when the appellant received incorrect information from his agency as to his options).</p>
