<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-372"><span class="space">c.</span> Merit Promotion, Open to External Candidates; Canceled Announcement; "Right to Compete" Claim</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 3304(f) establishes the right of veterans to apply for jobs, even if they lack veterans preference status, when an agency opens merit promotions to candidates outside the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)(1) Preference eligibles or veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;If selected, a preference eligible or veteran described in paragraph (1) shall receive a career or career-conditional appointment, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;This subsection shall not be construed to confer an entitlement to veterans' preference that is not otherwise required by law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;The area of consideration for all merit promotion announcements which include consideration of individuals of the Federal workforce shall indicate that preference eligibles and veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service are eligible to apply. The announcements shall be publicized in accordance with section 3327.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(5)&#x2003;The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations necessary for the administration of this subsection. The regulations shall ensure that an individual who has completed an initial tour of active duty is not excluded from the application of this subsection because of having been released from such tour of duty shortly before completing 3 years of active service, having been honorably released from such duty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board explained the impact of VEOA on merit promotion competition open to external candidates in <span class="Italic">Day v. DHS</span>, PH-3330-13-0004-I-1 (NP 12/23/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prevail on a VEOA claim, an appellant bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(q)] . Where, as here, the agency has used a merit promotion selection process, and the pool of applicants has been limited to certain categories of internal candidates, or to persons with competitive service "status," the ranking and selection rules that apply to the competitive examination process do not apply. <span class="Italic">See Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 505 F.3d 1380, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A second type of VEOA claim may be brought pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) and pertains to merit promotion procedures. In merit promotion procedures, veterans "who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B) ("A veteran described in section 3304(f)(1) who alleges that an agency has violated such section with respect to such veteran may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor."). Here, however, the vacancy announcement did not provide for outside applicants. Veterans' preference does not apply when an employee seeks a promotion under an announcement limited to internal candidates. <span class="Italic">Slater v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 28, &#x00B6; 7 (2009). Even if section 3304(f)(1) were to apply, the undisputed record shows that the appellant was referred for selection for the Deportation Officer positions, but ranked lower than the applicants that were selected. He was therefore given an "opportunity to compete," and simply not selected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the agency used a competitive selection process because the applicants were rated and ranked in numerical order. That the agency used numerical ranking as an aid in determining which applicants were best qualified is irrelevant. <span class="Italic">Cf., e.g., Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1383-84 (agency's initial use of the competitive process to review <span id="Page_705"></span>applications did not limit it to using only the competitive process to ultimately fill position, where agency had also advertised the position under the merit promotion process).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that GS-11 Supervisory Immigration Enforcement Agents were given a preference in selection, thus ruining the promotional opportunities for nonsupervisory GS-09 Immigration Enforcement Agents.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1998, Congress passed the VEOA to ensure that veterans receive due consideration when they apply for vacant positions available through the merit promotion process. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-339, 112 Stat. 3182 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 2, 3, 5, 10, 28, 31, 38, and 49 U.S.C.). In relevant part, Congress provided veterans "may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) (2012). The statute does not define "agency." To fill this gap, Congress provided that "[OPM] shall prescribe regulations necessary for the administration of this subsection." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 3304(f)(5).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM promulgated such regulations in Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The regulations parrot the statutory mandate, explaining that eligible veterans "may compete for vacancies under merit promotion when an agency accepts applications from individuals outside its own workforce" and, if selected, veterans "will be given career or career conditional appointments under &#x00A7; 315.611 of this chapter." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.106 (2012). The regulations define "agency" as "an executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 105." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.611(b). The statutory provision cited by the regulations defines "executive agency" as "an Executive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Because the agency advertised vacancy announcement number DON0346 under merit promotion procedures, the administrative judge should have provided the appellant with jurisdictional notice for a "right to compete" claim. To establish Board jurisdiction over a "right to compete" claim under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B), an appellant must (1) show that he exhausted his DOL remedy and (2) make nonfrivolous allegations that (i) he is a veteran within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), (ii) the actions at issue took place on or after the December 10, 2004 enactment date of the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2004, and (iii) the agency denied him the opportunity to compete under merit promotion procedures for a vacant position for which the agency accepted applications from individuals outside its own workforce in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). <span class="Italic">Styslinger v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted in the initial decision, the vacancy announcement in question was only open to current agency employees. Since the agency did not accept applications from individuals outside its workforce, the appellant's right to have an "opportunity to compete" was not triggered, and she was not entitled to any other veterans' preference in this process....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The operation of the "right to compete," without entitlement to preference, is illustrated by <span class="Italic">Hopkins v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-3330-16-0279-I-1 (NP 1/30/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant was not entitled to veterans' preference because the vacancy was announced pursuant to merit promotion procedures,[5] and the appellant was given an opportunity to compete for the position, consistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The appellant asserts on review that she should have been placed at the top of the certificate of eligibles. However, such procedures are only applicable in the competitive examination process, not the merit promotion process. <span class="Italic">Joseph v.

<p class="Body-Text">If the agency accepts applicants from outside the agency through a merit selection process, the veteran may have a "right to compete" claim if he is not provided an application opportunity, <span class="Italic">Kerner v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 778 F.3d 1336, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2015), also determining that no particular preference was provided for those with veterans preference already employed by the agency and seeking another position through merit promotion procedures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kerner's argument assumes that &#x00A7; 3304(f) requires federal agencies to apply &#x00A7; 3311 to merit-promotion vacancies that accept applicants from outside the agency's workforce, even when the applicant is already employed in the federal civil service. The statutory language, the legislative history, and the case law do not support this argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress enacted &#x00A7; 3311 as part of the Veterans' Preference Act, the precursor to the VEOA. Courts have interpreted the Veterans' Preference Act to give preference in a veteran's initial appointment to the federal civil service, but not to an employee's transfer or other intraagency movement, such as promotions. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 247 F.3d 1222, 1224 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("We affirm the proposition established in <span class="Italic">Crowley</span>, namely, that veterans are not accorded any preference under the VPA when seeking promotion or intra-agency transfers."); <span class="Italic">see also Bates v. Runyon</span>, 97 F.3d 1464, 1996 WL 532210, at *2 (10th Cir. 1996) ("[J]udicial interpretation clearly establishes that veterans' preference does not apply to an employee's transfer or other intra-agency movement.")

<p class="Block-Quote1">The text of the VEOA shows that it is intended to assist veterans in gaining access to federal civil service employment, not to give veterans preference in merit promotions. The VEOA's title itself--"Veterans Employment Opportunity Act"--shows that its purpose is to help veterans get the opportunity for federal employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 105-339, 112 Stat 3182. And &#x00A7; 2 of the VEOA, which amended &#x00A7; 3304(f), is titled "Access for Veterans," showing that the VEOA is intended to help veterans gain access to federal employment, not preferential treatment in promotion decisions. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at &#x00A7; 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, &#x00A7; 3304(f)(4) states that merit-promotion vacancies accepting applications from outside the agency's workforce must announce that preference-eligible veterans are "eligible to apply." This language shows that Congress intended the VEOA to assist veterans otherwise ineligible to apply. Veterans already employed by the competitive service are already "eligible to apply" to merit-promotion vacancies, and thus cannot be the intended target for &#x00A7; 3304(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the VEOA confirms that Congress did not intend for &#x00A7; 3304 to apply when a veteran or other preference-eligible applicant is already employed in federal civil service. When introducing the original version of the VEOA, Senator Charles Hagel stated that the purpose of the VEOA was to help veterans "<span class="Italic">get and hold</span> jobs with the Federal Government." 143 CONG. REC. 14,682 (1997) (emphasis added). There was no mention of promotion preference for veterans already employed in the competitive service. Indeed, statements show that the VEOA was specifically targeted to veterans not already employed in the federal civil service. <span class="Italic">E.g., id.</span> at 5,258 (statement of Rep. Maloney) "[T]he VEOA opens Federal employment opportunities for individuals honorably discharged from the military...by eliminating artificial barriers which prevent them from competing for Federal jobs <span class="Italic">because they are not already civilian employees or employees of a particular agency</span>.") (emphasis added); 144 CONG. REC. 24,806 (1998), (statement of Rep. Mica) ("Very often,...Federal agencies will only allow current civilian employees to apply for vacancies. <span class="Italic">Veterans who do not work for the Federal Government are barred from even competing on their merits for these jobs.

However, the opportunity-to-compete provision set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) does not apply to veterans, like the appellant, already employed in the Federal civil service who are seeking merit promotions. <span class="Italic">Oram v.

<p class="Body-Text">For there to be a cognizable "right to compete" claim, the appellant must use available means to apply for a job.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a preference-eligible disabled veteran, was appointed by the agency to a GS-12 Information Technology (IT) Specialist position in the competitive service effective May 1, 2017. On June 1, 2017, the agency posted a vacancy announcement for a GS-12 IT Specialist position. The vacancy announcement was a merit promotion announcement open to current or former competitive service employees, and the agency accepted applications from individuals outside of its own workforce, including Federal employees and veterans. The appellant applied for the position, but received a notification stating that he was ineligible for consideration because he failed to meet the area of consideration requirement specified in the vacancy announcement. After the appellant contacted the agency's human resources office requesting additional information concerning his disqualification the agency informed him that he was not considered because he had been employed in his current position for less than 90 days, and that an agency must wait at least 90 days after an employee's latest non-temporary competitive appointment before it can promote, transfer, reinstate, reassign, or detail that employee to a different position or to a different geographical region. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.502. Because the appellant had not served at least 90 days in his current appointment at the time he applied for the position advertised in the vacancy announcement, he was found ineligible for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge subsequently issued an initial decision based on the written record, concluding that, because it was undisputed that the appellant was a Federal employee at the time the agency declined to consider his application for the IT Specialist position that was announced under merit promotion procedures and for which the agency accepted applications from individuals outside its own workforce, pursuant to the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Kerner</span> [<span class="Italic">Kerner v. Department of the Interior</span>, 778 F.3d 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2015)], he could not prevail as a matter of law on his claim that he was denied the opportunity to compete for the position.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under VEOA, preference eligibles and certain veterans who unsuccessfully apply for a position being filled by a Federal agency for which the agency accepted applications from individuals outside of its own workforce under merit promotion procedures and who allege that they have been denied the opportunity to compete afforded to them under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) may seek administrative redress with the Board for a violation of their rights.[3] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d); <span class="Italic">Montgomery v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Board has held that VEOA right to compete appeals have an additional jurisdictional element, i.e., a nonfrivolous allegation that the actions at issue took place on or after the December 10, 2004 enactment date of the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2004. <span class="Italic">E.g. Styslinger v. Department of the Army</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 31 (2007). Without purporting to overrule this case law, we observe that nearly 20 years have now passed since the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act was enacted and that this jurisdictional issue will seldom, if ever, be dispositive in future cases. We therefore find that, going forward, an accurate exposition of the jurisdictional elements for a VEOA right to compete appeal may omit reference to the date that the action at issue took place. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Department of Defense</span>, 2022 MSPB 20, &#x00B6; 5 n.1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are two types of selection procedures that agencies generally use to fill vacancies in the competitive service: (1) the open "competitive examination" process, which is typically open to the public and is used for employees seeking to join the competitive service; and (2) the "merit promotion" process used when a position is filled from within an agency's workforce or by an applicant from outside the agency who has "status" in the competitive service, such as a competitive-service employee at another agency or a preference-eligible veteran. <span class="Italic">Kerner</span>, 778 F.3d at 1337; <span class="Italic">Montgomery</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6; 7 n.3; <span class="Italic">see Joseph v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant exhausted his administrative remedies with DOL and made nonfrivolous allegations that he is a preference eligible and that the actions at issue took place after the enactment of VEOA.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in <span class="Italic">Kerner</span> was an employee of the Department of the Interior at the time he applied for two merit promotion vacancies listed by his employing agency. <span class="Italic">Kerner</span>, 778 F.3d at 1337. Both vacancies required Federal employee applicants to meet certain time-in-grade requirements, which Mr. Kerner did not meet, so the agency found him <span id="Page_707"></span>unqualified for the positions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. After the Board denied Mr. Kerner's request for corrective action, he appealed to the Federal Circuit arguing that his employing agency violated his rights by denying him the opportunity to compete for the positions based on the agency's failure to credit his military and non-Federal civil service, as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311, when determining that he did not meet the time-in-grade requirements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1336-38.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's decision, but in doing so concluded that, because Mr. Kerner was already employed in the Federal civil service, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3304(f) and 3311 were inapplicable in his case. <span class="Italic">Kerner</span>, 778 F.3d at 1338-39. The Federal Circuit concluded that Mr. Kerner's argument that the agency was required to consider his military and non-Federal civil service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311 rested on the presumption that section 3304(f)'s "opportunity to compete" provisions applied even in instances in which an applicant already was employed in the Federal civil service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1338. After reviewing the text and legislative history of VEOA and its precursor, the Veterans' Preference Act (VPA), the Federal Circuit concluded that nothing in the statutory language, the legislative history, or case law supported such a presumption. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Instead, the court determined that the statutory text and legislative history of VEOA and the VPA only evinced an intent to assist veterans in obtaining an <span class="Italic">initial</span> appointment to the Federal service--not subsequent promotions or other intra-agency movement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Additionally, the court concluded that, because veterans currently employed in a competitive service position are already "eligible to apply" to merit promotion vacancies, such applicants could not have been the intended beneficiaries of section 3304(f). <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the administrative judge meticulously recounted the Federal Circuit's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Kerner</span> and concluded that, because the appellant was a Federal employee at the time the agency found him ineligible for appointment to the IT Specialist position based on its understanding of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.502 ("the 90-day rule"), the appellant could not prevail as a matter of law on his argument that he was denied the opportunity to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f). However, in reaching this conclusion, the administrative judge opined that the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Kerner</span> appeared to have answered a broader question than was necessary to resolve the factual dispute before it, and observed that the decision "would appear to be a marked departure from the application of [the] rights" articulated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B) and 3304(f).</p>

However, in reaching this conclusion, the administrative judge opined that the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Kerner</span> appeared to have answered a broader question than was necessary to resolve the factual dispute before it, and observed that the decision "would appear to be a marked departure from the application of [the] rights" articulated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B) and 3304(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's point is well taken. The holding the Federal Circuit appears to have reached in <span class="Italic">Kerner</span> is that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3304(f) and 3311 "do not require a [F]ederal agency to consider non-[F]ederal civil service experience when determining whether a veteran employed in the [F]ederal civil service meets a time-in-grade requirement for the purposes of a merit promotion." <span class="Italic">Kerner</span>, 778 F.3d at 1339. In arriving at this conclusion, however, the Federal Circuit seems to have gone well beyond this narrow question and addressed the broader question of whether Congress intended section 3304's opportunity-to-compete provision to apply to preference-eligible applicants who are already employed in the Federal civil service, and concluded that, based on Federal court precedent and the statutory text and legislative history of VEOA and the VPA, it did not. <span class="Italic">Kerner</span>, 778 F.3d at 1338-39.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In discussing the statutory language, the court stated that "[t]he text of the VEOA shows that it is intended to assist veterans in gaining access to [F]ederal civil service employment, not to give veterans preference in merit promotions." <span class="Italic">Kerner</span>, 778 F.3d at 1338. Continuing, the court also noted that "[t]he legislative history of the VEOA confirms that Congress did not intend for [section] 3304 to apply when a veteran or other preference-eligible applicant is already employed in [F]ederal civil service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1339. Finally, the court concluded its analysis of the legislative history of VEOA by observing that "statements [in VEOA's legislative history] show that the VEOA was specifically targeted to veterans not already employed in the [F]ederal civil service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we share the concerns expressed by the administrative judge, we agree with his conclusion that the Federal Circuit's broad statements in <span class="Italic">Kerner</span> cannot be dismissed as mere <span class="Italic">dicta</span> and must have been intended as essential to the central holding of the case. We are bound to follow precedential decisions of the Federal Circuit unless they are overruled by the court sitting <span class="Italic">en banc. See Conner v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 670, &#x00B6; 6 (2014), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 620 F. App'x 892 (Fed. Cir. 2015); <span class="Italic">Coley v. Department of Transportation</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 645, &#x00B6; 6 (2009). Accordingly, the administrative judge correctly concluded that, given the appellant's undisputed status as a current Federal employee, he was not entitled to recovery on his claim that he was denied an opportunity to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 604, &#x00B6; 12 (2007) (noting that a VEOA appeal may be decided on the merits, without an evidentiary hearing, when there is no genuine dispute of material fact and one party must prevail as a matter of law).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Prior Board decisions that are inconsistent with the Federal Circuit's decision in Kerner are overruled</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge observed, a number of prior Board cases appear to be in conflict with the Federal Circuit's holding in <span class="Italic">Kerner</span>. In <span class="Italic">Jolley v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 104, &#x00B6; 20 (2007), the Board specifically held that "[5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;]3304(f)(1) covers current employees along with those seeking initial [F]ederal appointment." Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Styslinger v. Department of the Army</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 32 (2007), the Board concluded that the agency could not rely on the appellant's status as a current Federal employee to reject his application without affording him the opportunity to compete for a vacancy that was announced under merit promotion procedures and for which the agency accepted applications from individuals outside its own workforce. In <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 175, &#x00B6; 6 (2010), and <span class="Italic">Shapley v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 7 (2008), the Board relied on the holdings in <span class="Italic">Styslinger</span> and <span class="Italic">Jolley</span> to conclude that "under the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), all covered individuals, including current employees and those seeking initial [F]ederal appointments, must be permitted to compete when applications will be accepted from persons outside the hiring agency's work force." Finally, although the Board in <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of the Navy</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 184, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6, 10 (2008), did not specifically state the proposition that current Federal employees are entitled to corrective action under VEOA if they are denied the opportunity to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f), it implicitly relied on the proposition in concluding that the current Federal employee applicant in that case was entitled to corrective action. Consequently, to the extent that they are inconsistent with the Federal Circuit's holding in <span class="Italic">Kerner</span>, these and similar decisions, which conclude that current Federal employees are entitled to corrective action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) when they are denied the opportunity to compete for a position that an agency announced using merit promotion procedures and for which it accepts applications from individuals outside of its own workforce, are overruled on this point.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Oram v. Dept. of Army</span>, DC-3330-18-0058-I-1 (NP 9/2/2022), explained that consideration under merit promotion procedures provides the opportunity to compete, but without special preference and without waiver of position requirements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge's finding that, because the Information Technology Specialist vacancy was filled using merit promotion procedures, the appellant was not entitled to a veterans' preference, and so his request for corrective action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A) was properly denied. <span class="Italic">See Joseph v.

We also agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that, based on the unrefuted evidence in the form of a declaration submitted by the agency's Human Resources Specialist responsible for reviewing applications for the position, the appellant was permitted to apply for the position and his application package was forwarded for a substantive assessment of his qualifications, but he was ultimately disqualified from further consideration because he failed to meet the specialized requirements for the job. Therefore, the appellant received all of the rights to which he was entitled under VEOA, and he was not denied an opportunity to compete for the position under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B) and 3304(f). <span class="Italic">See Abell v.

The agency generated two certificates, one for internal candidates domiciled at the employing facility and a second for VEOA eligibles. The appellant was placed on the list of VEOA-eligible candidates only. Both lists were referred to the selecting official. The selecting official chose one of the two candidates from the internal list and none of the candidates from the VEOA-eligible list.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The record reflects that the appellant is an eligible veteran under the VEOA hiring authority, the nonselection occurred after 2004, and the appellant alleged that he was denied the opportunity to compete for the position in question. Thus, we find that the appellant has satisfied his jurisdictional burden under this alternative standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant alleges that, contrary to the administrative judge's finding, the agency did not seriously consider him for the position but rather the selection process was a "ruse."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Agencies are permitted to fill vacancies by any authorized method. <span class="Italic">Montgomery</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6; 6. The Board will review the method used by an agency to fill a vacancy to determine if it is authorized when the use of an unauthorized method could have denied covered individuals the right to compete. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find that there is insufficient evidence in the record to determine if the agency denied the appellant the right to compete in filling the vacancy at issue in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency issues a vacancy announcement that is open to individuals outside its workforce, it cannot treat VEOA eligibles in a manner that denies them a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> opportunity to compete. <span class="Italic">See Montgomery</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6; 7 (explaining that the right to compete is triggered when an agency posts a vacancy externally, regardless of whether the agency elects to use merit promotion procedures); <span class="Italic">Gingery v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency accepted applications from both internal and external candidates. Yet, the agency created two separate certificates--one for internal candidates domiciled at the employing facility and one for VEOA eligibles. While the administrative judge found that the agency made its selection from a certificate of eligibles that included the appellant's name, the record does not support this finding. Rather, the record reflects that the agency made its selection from the internal facility certificate, which did not include the appellant's name. Whether the agency gave the appellant a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> opportunity to compete by considering candidates on both lists on an equal footing is a question we cannot resolve on the current record. The agency has not provided statements from anyone involved in the selection process. Absent additional information, the two separate lists alone may be enough to find the appellant's right to compete was violated. Thus, we must remand the case to the regional office for further development of the record and adjudication of this issue. <span class="Italic">Montgomery</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a position is filled through merit promotion processes allowing for consideration of candidates outside the agency's workforce, a veteran who applies must be given consideration but not preference, as the Federal Circuit noted in <span class="Italic">Boctor v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue in this case is whether the agency violated the VEOA when it did not select Mr. Boctor for the Program Specialist position, which was filled using the merit promotion process. In contrast to the competitive examination process, which gives veterans certain advantages such as additional points in their ratings scores, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309, the merit promotion process simply gives a veteran the "opportunity to compete" for vacancies that are otherwise open only to current agency employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) ("[Under the VEOA, veterans] may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures."); <span class="Italic">see also Joseph v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Unlike in the competitive examination process, preference eligible veterans are not entitled to any point preferences in the merit promotion process. <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 505 F.3d 1380, 1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing <span class="Italic">Perkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 48 (2005)). Veterans such as the appellant "may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures." 5 U.S.C. 7 &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). However, the right to compete for such vacant positions does not provide veterans with "an entitlement to veterans' preference that is not otherwise required by law." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(3). The appellant clearly had the opportunity to compete under vacancy announcement number HQ-2004-0172. He has therefore failed to establish that the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference with respect to that vacancy announcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the announcement indicated that agency would accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce. The agency was therefore required to permit the appellant, a preference eligible veteran, to compete under merit promotion procedures for the position. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Brandt v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vanderford v. VA</span>, 656 Fed. Appx. 537, 539-41 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP), again explained the process used to evaluate veterans' applications submitted through a merit promotion process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Preference eligible veterans receive statutory benefits in federal employment. <span class="Italic">See Lazaro v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 666 F.3d 1316, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (discussing statutes and regulations that provide veterans preference). Veterans receive preference in both the competitive examination hiring process and the MPP hiring process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The competitive examination process is open to the public and the hiring decision is premised on the rating and ranking of the candidates, with additional weight assigned to veteran status. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.101. The agency must comply with special statutes and regulations when it evaluates a veteran for a given position. <span class="Italic">Lazaro</span>, 666 F.3d at 1318. For example, in the competitive examination process, preference eligible veterans are entitled to an additional 5 points above a rating based on qualifications, and disabled veterans are entitled to an additional 10 points. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MPP process is used when the position is designated to be filled by a current competitive service employee, but in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(1) preference eligible veterans have the right to be considered for positions otherwise open only to persons who are already employed in the competitive service. When applying under the MPP process, a preference eligible veteran does not receive veterans preference points. <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1383-84. Instead, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) entitles veterans to compete on the same grounds as other applicants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MPP procedure may also be used to fill positions restricted by regulation to preference eligible veterans, such as these Housekeeping Aid positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3310; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.401, 330.402.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Vanderford argues that the Housekeeping Aid positions were improperly filled by the MPP procedure, and that veterans preference points should have been applied. As support, Mr. Vanderford points to his numerical score indicated in the March 5, 2014 email from the agency, the notation of the referral certificates as "non-competitive" and "competitive," and the occupational questionnaire he filled out as part of the application process. Mr. Vanderford's arguments are rooted in the confusing terminology and procedures and the murkiness of the agency's presentation both below and on appeal. Given the complexity of federal hiring procedures and the baffling terminology, we address the concerns raised by Mr. Vanderford.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under MPP procedures, we understand that questionnaires such as the one Mr. Vanderford filled out are used to assist the agency in evaluating whether an applicant possesses job-related knowledge, skills, and capabilities. This evaluation may take the form of a numeric score, but for the MPP procedure, the numeric score does not include veterans preference points. The VA states that such numeric scores are used <span id="Page_709"></span>only to create a list of the best qualified applicants to be referred to the selecting official by way of the "competitive referral" certificate. The term "competitive" does not refer to competitive examination hiring, and the numeric scores are not used to rank the referred applicants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Some positions to be filled under the MPP procedure also permit "non-competitive referral," whereby preference eligible veterans may be referred to the selecting official on a certificate, even if they are only minimally qualified. The VA explains that these candidates, including disabled veterans, may be referred for consideration regardless of whether they are within the best qualified category. Non-competitive referral requires that the candidate meets the minimum qualifications; listing does not mean that the candidate will be selected. It is possible for a particular candidate to be included on both the competitive and non-competitive referral lists as was Mr. Vanderford.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board determined that these Housekeeping Aid positions were properly filled by the MPP procedure. One of the positions was filled with a candidate from the "competitive referral" certificate. This candidate had a lower numeric score than did Mr. Vanderford. The MSPB stated that the use of scores to evaluate applicants' qualifications did not transform the MPP procedure into a competitive examination procedure, and that the MPP procedure permits the agency to consider all of an applicant's qualifications. On this reasoning, the MSPB held that an agency operating under the MPP procedure may properly hire a candidate with a lower score, without violating any requirement of veterans preference. Precedent supports this ruling, explaining that "[a]ll that [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1)] entitles veterans to is 'the opportunity to compete for vacant positions' to be filled...." <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1383.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Vanderford was listed on the competitive certificate as one of nine best qualified candidates, and he was listed on the non-competitive certificate because of his status as a disabled veteran. The selecting official declared that he considered Mr. Vanderford's qualifications but did not choose him because, in his judgment, he was not one of the two best qualified candidates on the lists. The MSPB found no error in the agency's procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board determined that the Housekeeping Aid positions were appropriately posted and filled by a veteran under the MPP procedure, applying 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3310 relating to veterans preference. <span class="Italic">See Patterson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To be entitled to relief under the VEOA, the appellant must show by preponderant evidence that the agency violated one or more of his statutory or regulatory veterans' preference rights.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., Lis v.

As the administrative judge found, the agency could properly choose a candidate, as it did here, under the merit promotion procedures; the appellant was not entitled to extra points for veterans' preference under those procedures, but only to the opportunity to compete; and the agency showed that it provided the appellant with that opportunity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wheeler v. Department of Defense</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 376, &#x00B6; 6 (2010); <span class="Italic">Joseph v.

The right to compete does not preclude an agency from eliminating a veteran or a preference eligible from further consideration for a position based on his qualifications for the position, and nothing requires that the veteran or preference eligible be considered at every stage of the selection process up to that process's final stage. <span class="Italic">Harellson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency also may make selections under an open competitive examination process, which is generally used to fill vacant positions in the competitive service and is based on a fair test of the relative capacity and fitness of the persons examined for the position to be filled. <span class="Italic">Perkins</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 10; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2.1. An integral part of the open competitive examination process is the assignment of numerical scores, followed by the rating and ranking of candidates according to those scores. <span class="Italic">Dean v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant challenges the administrative judge's finding that the agency properly announced the Housekeeping Aid positions under the merit promotion process and reasserts that the agency thereby violated his rights under VEOA. However, the vacancy announcement does not reflect that the agency was filling the WG-1 Housekeeping Aid positions under the competitive examining process. Although the appellant correctly notes that the "Key Requirements" section of the announcement provides that the applicant must be a U.S. citizen, that provision does not mean that any U.S. citizen may apply. As noted, consistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3310, the position was restricted to preference-eligible veterans only. Furthermore, nothing in the record shows that the agency assigned numerical scores to applicants and rated and ranked them based on those scores. In fact, both certificates of eligibles specifically state: "Vet points used: No" and "Priority Order Used: None." Consequently, we discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that the agency used the merit promotion process to select the best qualified candidates for the Housekeeping Aid positions. <span class="Italic">Joseph,</span> 505 F.3d at 1389 (finding that an agency has the discretion to fill a vacant position by any authorized method); <span class="Italic">Sherwood v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 208, &#x00B6; 10 (2001) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, veterans' preference points do not apply to the merit promotion process, which instead gives veterans the "opportunity to compete" for vacancies for which an agency will accept applications from outside its workforce. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1); <span class="Italic">Joseph,</span> 505 F.3d at 1381-82. Here, the appellant's name was among those forwarded to the selecting official for consideration. Thus, we find that the appellant was clearly allowed to compete for the position. Our finding is unaffected by the fact that the selecting official exercised his discretion not to interview any of the candidates but rather to make his decision based upon a review of their r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;s. In sum, the appellant has failed to show that the administrative judge erred in finding that he did not demonstrate a violation of his rights under VEOA in connection with these selections.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brandt v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BRANDT_DAVID_M_SF_3443_04_0614_I_3_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248160.pdf">103 MSPR 671</a>, 673-83 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-23, 2006 MSPB 316 (2006), considered the right of the agency, under 5 USC 3304, to use merit promotion procedures, avoiding a preference-based selection, when it permits applications from outside candidates:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency in this case issued a vacancy announcement covering the position of firefighter, GS-0081-05, at March Air Force Base, California. The announcement indicated that applications would be accepted from "[e]xternal" candidates and would be considered under "noncompetitive" appointing authorities. It also listed a number of examples of those authorities, including the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA) and the authority to transfer employees from other federal agencies. The appellant filed an application, and his name was listed on three certificates issued under various appointing authorities, including the certificate issued under VEOA. He was not selected for either of the two vacancies filled under the announcement, however. Instead, the agency selected another candidate from the VEOA certificate and a candidate from the certificate listing employees who were believed to be eligible for transfer. In doing so, it indicated that the selectee from the transfer certificate was "eligible under VEOA."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant responded to his nonselection by pointing out to the agency that he was a 10-point preference eligible, receiving compensation for service-connected disabilities rated at 30 percent or more, and by complaining to the agency that his preference rights had been violated....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">...</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge in this case found, and the parties do not deny, that the firefighter positions at issue here are in the competitive service. When a position in the competitive service is filled through open competitive examination, candidates are referred for consideration in an order generally consistent with numerical ratings they have been assigned. <span class="Italic">See Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 14 (2005). Those ratings are based in part on the candidates' qualifications for the kind of position to be filled, and in part on any veteran preference to which the candidates may be entitled. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> A disabled veteran, such as the appellant in this case, is entitled to have 10 points added to his basic rating. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2108(2), 3309(1). Moreover, if the veteran <span id="Page_710"></span>is receiving compensation for a disability of 10 percent or more, as the appellant in this case evidently is, his name ranks above those of others referred for consideration. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.401(b). In addition, without prior approval from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), a selecting official must select from among the three top-ranked candidates referred for consideration, and he may not "pass over" a higher-ranking preference eligible to select a lower-ranking candidate not entitled to preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency in this case did not assign numerical ratings to the candidates it referred to the selecting official. It also did not restrict consideration to a few top-ranked candidates on any list; instead, it listed all candidates who had been found to be among the "best qualified"--28 candidates in the case of the VEOA certificate--in alphabetical order on each of the certificates, permitting the selecting official to select--any listed candidate. Furthermore, the agency acknowledges that neither of the two candidates it selected was a preference eligible, and it does not deny that it failed to obtain OPM approval of its decision to select those candidates rather than preference-eligible candidates such as the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency's actions and omissions violated his rights as a preference eligible. The agency argues, however, that it was not required to follow the preference-related requirements described above. Specifically, it asserts that it filled the positions at issue under merit promotion procedures, rather than under an open competitive examination process; that veteran preference provisions are not applicable to merit promotion procedures; and that its use of merit promotion procedures was consistent with the provisions of VEOA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraph (f) of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304 provides as follows:</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">(1)</span> Preference eligibles or veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">(2)</span> If selected, a preference eligible or veteran described in paragraph (1) shall receive a career or career-conditional appointment, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">(3)</span> This subsection shall not be construed to confer an entitlement to veterans' preference that is not otherwise required by law.</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">(4)</span> The area of consideration for all merit promotion announcements which include consideration of individuals of the Federal workforce shall indicate that preference eligibles and veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service are eligible to apply. The announcements shall be publicized in accordance with section 3327.</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">(5)</span> The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations necessary for the administration of this subsection. The regulations shall ensure that an individual who has completed an initial tour of active duty is not excluded from the application of this subsection because of having been released from such tour of duty shortly before completing 3 years of active service, having been honorably released from such duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The right "to compete" that is granted by paragraph (f)(1) of this section ordinarily would suggest that an external preference-eligible candidate is entitled to the advantages such a candidate would have under the open competitive examination procedures described above, i.e., to preference over those external candidates who are not entitled to preference. The same paragraph also refers, however, to "merit promotion procedures." As indicated below, those procedures differ from open competitive examination procedures and do not provide the same advantages to preference eligible candidates. Moreover, while the phrase "under merit promotion procedures" easily could be regarded as indicating only that the paragraph applies to situations in which the employing agency is accepting applications under merit promotion procedures, it also could be regarded as modifying the verb "to compete," i.e., as meaning that veterans must be permitted, when the agency is accepting applications from outside candidates, to compete under merit promotion procedures, rather than to compete under open competitive examination procedures, for the position to be filled. The effect of paragraph (f)(1) on entitlement to preference therefore is unclear.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the intent of Congress in enacting legislation is expressed unambiguously, agencies and reviewing authorities must give effect to that intent. <span class="Italic">See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984). When the statute in question is ambiguous, however, and when the agency responsible for administering the statute has promulgated regulations interpreting it, that agency's interpretation is entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 844. If the interpretation represents a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies or interests, it may not be overturned on review. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 845.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM, which has express statutory authority to prescribe regulations necessary for the administration of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304, has promulgated such regulations. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(5); 63 Fed. Reg. 66705, 66705 (Dec. 3, 1998); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 65 Fed. Reg. 14431, 14431-32 (Mar. 17, 2000). In 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.106, it has interpreted the phrase "under merit promotion procedures" as modifying the verb "to compete." That is, it has provided in those regulations that covered veterans "may compete for vacancies under merit promotion when an agency accepts applications from individuals outside its own workforce."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see nothing unreasonable in this interpretation. Merit promotion procedures, like competitive examination procedures, provide for competition among the candidates. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(4). Interpreting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) as providing for competition under merit promotion procedures therefore is not illogical. Moreover, although merit promotion programs may apply to the hiring of some outside candidates, they are designed for use in selecting from among the agency's own employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(a) ("an agency may make promotions...only to positions for which the agency has adopted...a program" that must "conform to the requirements of" the section entitled "Agency promotion programs"); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(v) (merit promotion procedures are to be used in connection with certain transfers); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(vi) (merit promotion procedures are to be used in connection with certain reinstatements).[3] An agency interested in considering external candidates would not likely attempt to do so by issuing only a merit promotion announcement. Instead, it would likely do what the agency in this case did, i.e., issue a vacancy announcement referring to authorities more appropriately used for hiring external candidates. Interpreting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) as applying only when the vacancy announcement limits applications to those filed under a merit promotion program therefore could reasonably be regarded as inappropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(11), (15), (18) (defining the term "promotion" as "a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency," and indicating that "reinstatement" and "transfer" apply to the employment of persons not already employed by the agencies taking those actions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that the position OPM has taken in its regulations is the same as that it has taken in a publication it has posted on its internet website. In section 6 of its <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span>, OPM has stated that "VEOA eligibles are rated and ranked with other merit promotion candidates under the same assessment criteria...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have noted above that merit promotion procedures, like competitive examination procedures, provide for competition among the candidates. Requirements governing merit promotion competition, however, differ significantly from those applicable to open competitive examinations. The regulatory provisions governing merit promotion programs do not require selection from among the three top-ranked candidates; instead, they provide for selection of any of a group of "best qualified" candidates. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(4). Similarly, the appointing authority used by the agency in this case, provides for "select[ion] from among the best qualified" candidates. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.611.[4] These authorities also do not provide for the addition of preference points or for the other special preference-related procedures that are described above in connection with open competitive examinations. In fact, regulations governing merit promotions seem to prohibit such preferences. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(1) ("Actions under a promotion plan...shall be based solely on job-related criteria."). Finally, the Board has held that employees are not entitled to veteran preference under merit promotion regulations. <span class="Italic">E.g., Perkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 9 (2005); <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 492, &#x00B6; 9 (2005); <span class="Italic">see Brown v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 247 F.3d 1222, 1224 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (veterans are not accorded any preference under the Veterans' Preference Act when seeking promotion).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;This authority, established by OPM under the authority granted by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(5), is entitled to the same deference given to the OPM regulations described above. <span class="Italic">See Chevron U.S.A., Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. at 844-45.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In his petition for review, the appellant seems to argue that veteran preference rules are applicable (or may be applicable) to merit promotions. <span class="Italic">See</span> PFR (narrative statement at 3). He does not explain the basis for this argument, however, except for a brief statement that "[t]his was previously decided in the <span class="Italic">Augustine</span> case." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We assume that the appellant intended to refer to <span class="Italic">Augustine v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 407 (2001), <span class="Italic">vacated</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 293 (2003) (Table). Nothing in that decision, however, supports the proposition that preference rules apply to merit promotion procedures. Instead, the Board indicated in <span class="Italic">Augustine</span> that further consideration of preference eligibles' rights would be appropriate in part because of evidence that not all the positions <span id="Page_711"></span>filled in the case were filled by internal promotion. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14, 22-23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the initial decision in this case is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533 (2005), and <span class="Italic">Olson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 322 (2005). The Board noted in those cases that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b), an individual could be appointed in the competitive service only if he had passed an examination or was specifically excepted from examination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302; it found that section 3304(b) was a "statute relating to veterans' preference," and that a violation of that provision accordingly would constitute a violation that the Board could remedy in a VEOA appeal; and it found further that appointments under OPM's Outstanding Scholar Program (OSP) violated section 3304(b) because the authority under which that program was established did not create an exception that superseded preference rights under the competitive process. <span class="Italic">Olson</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 322, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9; <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-29; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1), (d)(1).[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Although the appellant argues on petition for review that <span class="Italic">Dean</span> and <span class="Italic">Olson</span> support the proposition that the use of multiple certificates violates veteran preference rights, PFR (narrative statement at 3), we see no support for this argument in either decision. Moreover, we see no basis for finding that the appellant's rights were violated by consideration of candidates named on the certificates from which no selections were made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Dean</span> and <span class="Italic">Olson</span> differ from the present case in that the selections made in those cases were based on an authority different from the appointing authority under which the selections in the present case were made. As indicated above, the <span class="Italic">Dean</span> and <span class="Italic">Olson</span> selections were made under the OSP. That program, as noted in <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-25, was among those established pursuant to a consent decree approving the settlement of a class action. In that action, black and Hispanic plaintiffs challenged OPM's Professional and Administrative Career Examination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, alleging that the examination discriminated against class members. <span class="Italic">See Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 24. The Board noted in <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 26-27, that the decree specifically referred to the rights of preference eligibles; it found that the reference suggested that the hiring programs established by the decree were not intended to override preference rights; it also noted that the court approving the decree had not found that the civil rights laws under which the case was brought superseded veteran preference laws; and it stated that such a finding would have been contrary to the language of the Civil Rights Act, which specifically provided, "Nothing contained in [the subchapter prohibiting discrimination in employment] shall be construed to repeal or modify any Federal, State, territorial, or local law creating special rights or preference for veterans." Under these circumstances, the Board concluded that use of the OSP to supersede veteran preference rights would be inconsistent with the express provisions of Title VII and with the acknowledgment of veteran preference rights in the consent decree itself. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 29.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a more recently decided case, <span class="Italic">Deems v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 161 (2005), the Board found a somewhat similar violation. In that case, two of the three selectees were hired under a program that used OPM's Clerical and Administrative Support Positions (CASP) assessment tool. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5. The Board found no basis for finding that this assessment tool constituted an exception to the examination process, and no indication that the two CASP selectees were hired under a competitive method that took preference rights into consideration. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14. It also noted the absence of any dispute that the third selectee was hired without any competitive examination or consideration of preference rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, as in <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, <span class="Italic">Olson</span>, and <span class="Italic">Deems</span>, there is no indication that, at the time of their selections, the selectees had become eligible for noncompetitive assignment to a competitive service position by passing a competitive examination. The agency in the present case, however, relies on an authority not at issue in those other cases. That is, it relies on the appointing authority created by OPM under authority of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have noted above that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) permits certain veterans and preference eligibles to compete for vacancies under merit promotion procedures even if they are not already employed by the agency announcing the vacancies. When it enacted this provision, Congress also enacted section 3304(f)(4), which required OPM to "establish an appointing authority to appoint such preference eligibles and veterans." VEOA, &#x00A7; 2, 112 Stat. 3182. In response to this requirement, OPM amended its regulations to include an excepted appointing authority under Schedule B. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(n) (1999); 65 Fed. Reg. 14431, 14431 (Mar. 17, 2000). Appointments made under this Schedule B authority were not made in the competitive service; instead, positions filled under that authority were in the excepted service. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3201(a); <span class="Italic">see</span> 65 Fed. Reg. 14431. A little over a year after it enacted the VEOA, however, Congress amended section 3304(f) by deleting paragraph (4) and adding the following as paragraph (2): "If selected, a preference eligible or veteran described in paragraph (1) shall receive a career or career-conditional appointment, as appropriate." Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, Pub. L. No. 106-117, &#x00A7; 511, 113 Stat. 1545, 1575 (1999). After enactment of this legislation, OPM terminated agencies' authority to make VEOA appointments under Schedule B, and it advised agencies that veterans who competed under a merit promotion announcement were to be converted to a career-conditional or career appointment retroactive to the dates of their original appointments under the VEOA. 65 Fed. Reg. 14431, 14431; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(n) (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not determine here whether appointment of the selectees in this case under the Schedule B authority mentioned above would have violated the appellant's preference rights. As indicated above, Congress itself has now excepted veterans covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) from the general requirement that persons may be appointed in the competitive service only if they have passed an examination. Moreover, OPM has reasonably interpreted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304 as providing that veterans covered by that provision are to be permitted to compete "under merit promotion procedures"--procedures that do not provide the advantage that a preference-eligible candidate traditionally would have over other candidates. In addition, while Congress did not include this exception to the competitive examination requirement in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302, the section to which 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b) refers, it included it in the very section--5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304--that contains the law whose alleged violation is at issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we find that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) and (2) create a valid exception to the general requirement, in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b), that individuals appointed in the competitive service either have passed an examination or have been specifically excepted from doing so. We note further that the agency asserts, and the appellant does not deny, that the selectees were eligible to apply under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). Accordingly, we conclude that the selectees' appointments in the competitive service are consistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) and (f)(2), and that they did not violate the appellant's rights as a preference eligible. The appellant's petition for review therefore is DENIED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Applying <span class="Italic">Brandt,</span> <span class="Italic">Weed v. SSA,</span> DE-1221-09-0320-B-1 (NP 9/10/2012), said of VEOA rights in promotion consideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Contrary to the initial decision, we find that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that the agency denied him the opportunity to compete under merit promotion procedures for a vacant position for which the agency accepted applications from individuals outside its own workforce in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), and met his burden of proof on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) when it used the FCIP to fill the positions in question because it did not submit evidence justifying its exception of those positions from the competitive service. The administrative judge made this determination within the context of her finding that the appellant was not aware of the vacancies and did not apply for them because the agency did not, among other things, advertise the FCIP positions on the USAJobs website. The appellant has been injured by this violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) because, as a preference eligible, he had a right to compete, under merit promotion procedures, for vacancies for which the agency was accepting applications from outside its workforce. <span class="Italic">See Dean</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 157, &#x00B6; 28. The appellant was thus deprived of the right to apply for the positions when the agency filled them under the FCIP without public notice, given that he could not apply for jobs about which he had no knowledge. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Thus, on the facts of this case, there is a substantial overlap between the appellant's claims under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302(1) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), and the agency's violation of section 3302(1) in its failure to justify its use of the FCIP also denied him the right to compete under section 3304(f)(1).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal agencies generally use two types of selection processes to fill vacancies. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> One type of selection process is the "merit promotion" process, which is used when an agency announces a position to those already employed in the agency or to those who have "status" in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">Perkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 9 (2005); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(2), (b)(4). We emphasize that the merit promotion process is not limited to the evaluation of and selection from among internal candidates. Under the merit promotion process, the agency has the right to select or not select from "other appropriate sources" than current employees such as reemployment priority lists, reinstatement, transfer, handicapped, or Veteran Recruitment Act eligibles or those within reach on an appropriate Office of Personnel Management certificate. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(4). Veterans' point preferences do not apply in the merit promotion process. <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 505 F.3d 1380, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The other selection process is the open competitive examination process, which is generally used to fill vacant positions within the competitive service and is based on a fair test of the "relative capacity and fitness of the persons examined for the position to be filled." <span class="Italic">Abell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378, 1380 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Perkins</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 10; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2.1. An integral part of the open competitive examination process is the assignment of numerical scores, followed by the rating and ranking of candidates according to those scores. <span class="Italic">Dean v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 137, &#x00B6; 2 n.* (2008); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(a). Preference-eligible veterans are entitled to five additional points, and disabled veterans, as well as certain relatives of disabled veterans, are entitled to ten additional points, which are added to their passing examination scores. <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 137, &#x00B6; 2 n.*; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant challenges the administrative judge's finding that the agency announced the Health Science Specialist position under the merit promotion process and reasserts that the agency violated his rights under the VEOA. However, the vacancy announcement does not reflect that the agency was filling the GS-0601-9/11 Health Science Specialist under the open competitive examination process. To the contrary, applications were limited to current agency employees and applicants from outside the agency with competitive status, and the stated method of evaluation examined the knowledge, skills and abilities of the candidates. <span class="Italic">See Perkins</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b). The appellant correctly notes that the "How to Apply" section of the vacancy announcement states that tentative five-point preference would be granted to veterans initially and that full preference would be granted upon receipt of the appropriate documentation. However, the reference to preference points does not indicate that competitive examining procedures would be used to assess applicants; points could be pertinent to the use of special hiring authorities, such as 30% disabled veterans. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 316.302(b)(4), 315.707. Furthermore, nothing in the record shows that the agency assigned numerical scores to applicants and rated and ranked them based on those scores. Consequently, we discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that the agency used the merit promotion process to select the best qualified candidate for the Health Science Specialist position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent the appellant contends that the agency violated his rights under the VEOA, we disagree. Veterans' point preferences do not apply in the merit promotion process, which instead gives veterans the "opportunity to compete" for vacancies for which an agency will accept applications from outside of its workforce or for which the agency has imposed an area of consideration. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1)(a); <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1381-82; <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 480, &#x00B6; 4 (2011). Here, the appellant's name was among those forwarded to the selecting official for consideration. Thus, he was clearly allowed to compete for the position. <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1381-82 (finding a preference eligible was given a full "opportunity to compete" in the merit selection process because the agency found him qualified, interviewed him, and considered him for the merit promotion). We therefore find that the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In February 2009, the agency issued essentially simultaneous vacancy announcements for a GS-5/6 Accounting Technician position under both its open competitive process and its merit promotion process. The appellant submitted his application under the open competitive process, however, the agency accepted his application for consideration under both the open competitive vacancy announcement and the merit promotion vacancy announcement. The agency prepared a certificate of eligibles under the merit promotion vacancy announcement that contained only the name of an internal candidate, as its internal policy provided that outside applicants would be considered under the merit promotion process only if no internal candidate was selected. The selecting official selected the internal candidate, and the agency notified the appellant by letter dated April 28, 2009, that it selected another candidate for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A violation of the opportunity to compete guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) is remediable under VEOA. <span class="Italic">Shapley v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 7 (2008); <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Army</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 16 (2006). Specifically, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) provides that "[p]reference eligibles...may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures." <span class="Italic">Boctor v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 580, &#x00B6; 7 (2009). Thus, under the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), all covered individuals, including current employees and those seeking initial federal appointments, must be permitted to compete when applications will be accepted from persons outside the hiring agency's work force. <span class="Italic">Shapley</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Styslinger v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency issued both an open competitive vacancy announcement and a merit promotion vacancy announcement for the Accounting Technician position. The merit promotion vacancy announcement explicitly provided that "[i]n the event that this position is not filled internally, 'Preference eligibles...may apply.'" This language is ambiguous because it suggests that preference eligibles were only permitted to apply if the agency decided not to fill the position with an internal candidate. However, in this case, it is clear that the agency accepted applications from external candidates under merit promotion procedures while the vacancy announcement was open, and before it decided whether to select an internal candidate. Further, even though the appellant applied under the open competitive vacancy announcement and not the merit promotion vacancy announcement, the agency admitted that it considered his application under merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, even though the agency's merit promotion vacancy announcement was not clear, we find that the agency issued a vacancy announcement that was open to individuals outside its workforce, and that the agency, in fact, accepted applications from individuals (such as the appellant) from outside its workforce. <span class="Italic">But see Brewer v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 563, &#x00B6; 8 (2009) (the agency did not deny the appellant the right to compete under a merit promotion vacancy announcement because the vacancy announcement was limited to internal candidates only and the appellant did not even apply under the merit promotion vacancy announcement); <span class="Italic">Dean v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 137, &#x00B6; 12 (2008) (the agency did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights because it placed his name on both certificates of eligibles issued under a simultaneous open competitive and merit promotion vacancy announcements and, therefore, he "was considered under all advertised hiring authorities"). The appellant, as a covered preference eligible, was entitled under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) to the opportunity to compete for the position. <span class="Italic">See Shapley</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency accepted the appellant's application under the merit promotion vacancy announcement and it reviewed the application and determined that he was qualified for the position. However, it did not place the appellant's name on a certificate of eligibles or forward his name or his application package to the selecting official for consideration, <span id="Page_713"></span>as it did with internal candidates determined to be qualified for the position. Because the agency accepted applications from individuals outside its own workforce but considered only applications from internal candidates, the agency did not afford the appellant a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> opportunity to compete in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). <span class="Italic">See Shapley</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency acted consistently with its own policy of considering internal applicants for positions before considering any external candidates. However, an agency's internal policy may not override applicable statutes, including 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). <span class="Italic">Boctor</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 580, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Shapley</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 16. Further, the Board has held that a preference eligible's right to compete for an announced vacancy arises whenever the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce, and not just when it considers those applications it indicated a willingness to accept. <span class="Italic">Boctor</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 580, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency's failure to consider the appellant for the position of Accounting Technician violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) by denying him a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> opportunity to compete for a vacancy in a situation where the agency was accepting applications from outside its workforce.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, and consideration of the reconstructed selection, the Board declined to fault the agency when it again declined to select the appellant, <span class="Italic">Gingery v. VA</span>, 117 MSPR 354, 360-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14, 16, 2012 MSPB 16 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant objects that, because one of the two interviewers of the internal candidate was no longer employed by the agency, a different second interviewer questioned the appellant and W.L. However, this necessary change did not prevent the same criteria from being applied to these candidates, nor did it require, as the appellant contends, the re-interviewing of the internal candidate, where the questioners' notes of her previous interview were available and could be re-reviewed before a decision was made. <span class="Italic">Cf. Wheeler,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 376, &#x00B6; 17 (awarding points based on prior performance ratings of internal candidates only did not violate the veteran appellant's right to compete under section 3304(f) where all external candidates, regardless of veteran status, were treated consistently).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant has presented no evidence that the questions were not relevant to the position or that the agency was required to ask questions that he believed were more specific to the duties of the position. The weight that such general qualities should be given in relation to the specific skills required by the particular job is a matter within the hiring agency's discretion. Moreover, as discussed below, the agency's selection criteria give considerable weight to familiarity with the specific agency practices that govern performance of the Accounting Technician position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gingery v. VA</span>, 480 Fed. Appx. 588 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP) ("To the extent that Mr. Gingery's complaint is that he was not awarded the position despite his VEOA rights, he is mistaken that his status entitles him to the job itself; it only entitles him to a lawful selection process. Finally, Mr. Gingery appears to challenge the reconstruction process as an improper remedy under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a), which requires the MSPB to 'order the agency to comply with' portions of the VEOA it violated. Yet, as Mr. Gingery indicates in his brief, this court recognized that reconstruction of the selection process is a proper means of complying with &#x00A7; 3330c(a) where it is uncertain whether the veteran would be selected for the position").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 2010 <span class="Italic">Gingery</span> decision was distinguished in another decision involving the same appellant when none of the individuals on an announcement were considered because the vacancy was canceled after the position was filled through another process, a settlement agreement involving another employee, <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 493 Fed. Appx. 64, 67-68 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Gingery also claims that the AJ erred in determining that Treasury was not obligated to consider him for the ET position because during the period of time that the vacancy announcement was open, the "area of consideration was not extended outside of the agency's own workforce." Mr. Gingery argues that the AJ misconstrued <span class="Italic">Montee v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 271, &#x00B6; 6 (2008) because here, the 503 Announcement was open at the same time as the internal COL announcement, thus satisfying the statutory requirements to consider preference-eligible veterans. He also relies upon <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 175, &#x00B6; 9 (2010), in which the Board held that, "[b]ecause the agency accepted applications from individuals outside its own workforce but considered only applications from internal candidates, the agency did not afford the appellant a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> opportunity to compete in violation of &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1)."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is distinguishable, however, because here, the selecting official non-selected <span class="Italic">all</span> of the putative appointees on the internal COL announcement when he learned that the position had been filled pursuant to a settlement agreement. Therefore, the selecting official did not consider applications received as a result of the internal announcement. Human Resources Assistant Lanita Barren provided a declaration, stating that Treasury only accepted applications from its employees for the vacancy announcement because it was only open to internal candidates. A certificate of eligibles was prepared only for applications received as a result of the internal COL announcement. Mr. Gingery's name was not included on the certificate because he could not apply under the internal vacancy announcement. The certificate was referred to the selecting official, who returned the certificate stating no selection was made. The agency never issued an external certificate of eligibles for applications received pursuant to the 503 Announcement because it cancelled that announcement and filled the position with the former Internal Revenue Agent. Mr. Gingery cites no authority to support his assertion that the exclusion of an external applicant's name on a certificate of eligibles prepared solely as a result of the receipt of applications in response to an internal announcement violates VEOA. Nor does the Treasury violate veterans' preference rights when it cancels a recruitment action for any lawful reason. <span class="Italic">See Abell v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, he did not adjudicate the merits of the appellant's claim that the agency improperly denied him the right to compete for the Assistant Chief of Staff position. To establish jurisdiction over a VEOA appeal in which an appellant alleges that an agency has violated his rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference, i.e., to establish VEOA jurisdiction over an appeal with respect to a complaint filed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A), an appellant must establish that he exhausted his Department of Labor remedy and make nonfrivolous allegations that he is a preference eligible within the meaning of the VEOA, that the actions at issue occurred on or after the October 30, 1998 enactment date of the VEOA, and that the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation related to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Isabella v.

Because an appeal in which the appellant claims that an agency has denied the appellant the right to compete for a position guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) arises under the same subsections of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a as the more traditional VEOA appeals, it is appropriate to apply a jurisdictional analysis similar to the analysis that applies to the more traditional VEOA appeals. Accordingly, we find that, in order to establish the Board's VEOA jurisdiction over an appeal with respect to a complaint filed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B), an appellant must establish that he exhausted his Department of Labor remedy and make nonfrivolous allegations that he is a veteran described <span id="Page_714"></span>in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), that the agency denied him the opportunity to compete under merit promotion procedures for a vacant position for which the agency accepted applications from individuals outside its own workforce, and that the denial occurred on or after the December 10, 2004 enactment date of the VBIA.[12] With regard to the instant appeal, we find that the appellant has established Board jurisdiction over this appeal by non-frivolously alleging that he is a veteran who has been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service, that the agency denied him the opportunity to compete for the GS-14 Assistant Chief of Staff (Program Management) position by rejecting his application without determining whether the appellant was qualified for the position, and that the denial occurred on or after December 10, 2004.

Rather, the Board concluded as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), all covered individuals must be permitted to compete when applications will be accepted from persons outside the hiring agency's workforce. We hold, therefore, that section 3304(f)(1) covers current employees along with those seeking initial federal appointments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Jolley</span>, 2007 MSPB 51, &#x00B6; 20. Thus, in accordance with <span class="Italic">Jolley</span>, we find that the agency could not rely on the appellant's status as a current federal employee to deny him the right to compete for the Assistant Chief of Staff (Program Management) position for which the agency accepted applications from outside its own workforce and that it violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) by rejecting the appellant's application without allowing him to compete for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, as discussed previously, <span class="Italic">see supra</span>, &#x00B6; 4 n.3, the record does not establish that the appellant met the time-in-grade requirements necessary to qualify for the position, and, while the VEOA guarantees preference eligibles and certain non-preference eligible veterans the right to compete for particular positions, it does not exempt them from the eligibility criteria, such as time-in-grade restrictions, that are applicable to all candidates. <span class="Italic">See Ramsey v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 9 (2000). Because the record is insufficient to establish whether the appellant would have been qualified for the GS-14 Assistant Chief of Staff (Program Management) position at the time the agency should have considered his application, the appropriate remedy is to order the agency to determine whether the appellant was qualified for the position, and, if he is found qualified, to reconstruct the selection process for the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a); <span class="Italic">Jolley</span>, 2007 MSPB 51, &#x00B6; 21; <span class="Italic">Deems v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties stipulated that the appellant is a "disabled veteran" as that phrase is defined 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2), and he therefore qualifies as a preference eligible, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(C); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.63 (the parties may stipulate to any matter of fact, and a stipulation will satisfy a party's burden of proving the fact alleged). In October 2004, in accordance with the agency's procedures for applying for vacancies, the appellant nominated himself for a position as an Equal Employment Specialist under vacancy announcement KOEZ04056132R. This vacancy announcement indicated that those eligible to apply included, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, all federal employees serving on a career or career-conditional appointment and "Veterans eligible under Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1998." The agency conceded that the Human Resources Assistant responsible for entering the appellant's self-nomination for this vacancy into the appropriate database failed to do so. On December 15, 2004, after the agency discovered its error, it notified the appellant that it would give him priority consideration for the next appropriate vacancy of the same grade and occupation in accordance with its internal regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed his complaint with the Board on April 18, 2005. After the agency filed its response, in which it conceded that it did not properly process the appellant's nomination for the position, the administrative judge issued an order which stated that it appeared that the agency had acknowledged that it violated the appellant's rights under VEOA, and it further stated that the only issues left to be resolved in the appeal were whether the violation was willful and what the appropriate remedy should be. While the appeal was pending before the administrative judge, the Board issued <span class="Italic">Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533 (2005), <span class="Italic">recons. denied,</span> 2006 MSPB 318 (MSPB Docket No. AT-0330-03-0076-R-1) (Oct. 26, 2006), which, according to the administrative judge, resolved the issue regarding what the appropriate remedy should be for a violation of the appellant's right to compete for the advertised position, i.e., reconstruction of the selection process. Shortly thereafter, the administrative judge issued an initial decision on the written record in which she found (1) that the agency had violated the appellant's right to compete for the vacant position guaranteed to him as a preference eligible by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f), and (2) that this subsection is a statute relating to "veterans' preference rights." Accordingly, the administrative judge granted the appellant's request for corrective action and ordered the agency to reconstruct the hiring process for the Equal Employment Specialist position for which the agency denied the appellant the opportunity to compete....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency raises three main arguments. It first argues that its failure to properly include the appellant on the list of candidates for the Equal Employment Specialist position did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights because the position was filled through an internal merit promotion action, and veterans' preference does not apply to such actions. In <span class="Italic">Brandt v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 671 (2006), the Board held that where, as here, an agency announces a vacancy open to internal candidates and external "status" candidates, it must permit preference eligibles and other veterans described at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) to apply, but the agency may make a selection under merit promotion procedures and is not required to follow veterans' preference rules.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the agency has not contested the fact that it indicated the position would be filled through merit promotion procedures and that it would accept applications from outside its own workforce. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(4) (selection procedures under a merit promotion plan will provide for management's right to select from among a group of best qualified candidates and from other appropriate sources, such as reemployment priority lists, reinstatement, transfer, handicapped, or Veteran Readjustment Act eligibles or those within reach on an appropriate OPM certificate). Thus, while &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) does not grant the appellant any advantage, beyond the right to compete for particular positions, to which he is not otherwise entitled, there is no question that &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) precluded the agency from denying the appellant the opportunity to compete for the position at issue in this case. Because the appellant timely filed his application in accordance with the agency's instructions, we discern no error in the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency's failure to properly process the application, and its failure to include the appellant among the list of candidates referred to the selecting official for consideration, denied the appellant the right to compete for the position guaranteed to him by &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, while the agency essentially conceded that it denied the appellant the right to compete for the position, it also argued that such a denial does not fall within the realm of veterans' preference violations that can be remedied under VEOA. We reject the agency's argument for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, while the agency correctly asserts that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) does not appear in the list of veterans' preference requirements enumerated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(e)(1), the remedial provisions of VEOA are not limited to providing a remedy for a violation of the "veterans' preference requirements." Rather, VEOA provides a remedy for a violation of an "individual's rights under any statute or regulation related to veterans' preference." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1), 3330c; <span class="Italic">see Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17 (a statute or regulation "relates to" veterans' preference if the statute or regulation "stands in some relation to," has a bearing on, concerns, and "has a connection with" veterans' preference rights). Thus, <span id="Page_715"></span>the fact that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) does not appear in the list of "veterans' preference requirements" does not mean that a violation of the right to compete under that subsection is not remediable under VEOA; it merely means that an agency's failure to comply with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) does not amount to a personnel practice prohibited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11) (an employee shall not take or fail to take any personnel action that would violate a veterans' preference requirement), <span class="Italic">see Ramsey v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 11 (2000) (the regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) cannot be a basis for committing a personnel practice prohibited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11) because Congress specifically excluded the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) from the "veterans' preference requirements"), and that the individuals responsible for the agency's failure to comply with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) are not subject to disciplinary action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215 for violating &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11), <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(e)(2) (although there is no authority to order corrective action with respect to a personnel practice prohibited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11), nothing in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(e) shall be considered to affect any authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215 (relating to disciplinary action)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to pointing out that &#x00A7; 3304(f) is not listed as a "veterans' preference requirement," the agency further contends that &#x00A7; 3304(f) is not a "statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference." There is some authority to support the agency's contention. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hunt v. United States</span>, 154 F. Supp.2d 1047, 1051 (E.D. Mich. 2001), the district court, relying on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Ramsey</span> and on the language in &#x00A7; 3304(f)(3), specifically found that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) "is not a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference," and the judge therefore concluded that the district court did not have jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330b to consider the appellant's allegations that the Department of the Army violated his right to compete for various positions. Furthermore, in <span class="Italic">Schott v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 35, &#x00B6; 30 (2004), the Board cited its decision in <span class="Italic">Ramsey</span> for the proposition that, while 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) mandates that agencies shall give preference eligibles the opportunity to compete for vacant positions, it does not provide preference eligibles with a remedy should an agency violate this provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the weight of authority establishes that a violation of the opportunity to compete guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) is remediable under VEOA. First, we find that <span class="Italic">Hunt</span> and <span class="Italic">Schott</span> misinterpreted the Board's findings in <span class="Italic">Ramsey</span>. <span class="Italic">Ramsey</span> was a regulation-review case under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f), which authorizes the Board to review provisions of rules and regulations issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and to declare such provisions invalid if their implementation would require any employee to commit a personnel practice prohibited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b). The issue the Board decided in <span class="Italic">Ramsey</span> was whether OPM's application of minimum qualification standards to VEOA appointments required agencies to commit prohibited personnel practices by obstructing a veteran's right to compete for employment. <span class="Italic">Ramsey</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 98, &#x00B6; 8. The Board ultimately determined that OPM's regulations did not obstruct a veteran's right to compete, and it specifically found that the regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) could not be a basis for committing a personnel practice prohibited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11) because "section 3304 is not included as a 'veterans' preference requirement,' at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(e)(1)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 11. Thus, the Board in <span class="Italic">Ramsey</span> merely determined that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) was not a "veterans' preference requirement." It did not determine that this section was not a "statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, in the case of <span class="Italic">Abell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 9 (2002), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 343 F.3d 1378, 1384-85 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the Board and the Federal Circuit each issued a precedential decision addressing the merits of the appellant's claim that the agency interfered with his right to compete for positions guaranteed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Campion v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 326 F.3d 1210, 1214 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (because the court concluded that VEOA provided no right of appeal to the non-preference eligible appellant, it expressed no opinion regarding whether the Board would have jurisdiction over a preference-eligible veteran's appeal alleging a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1)).[3] In <span class="Italic">Abell</span>, the Board and the Federal Circuit each reached the merits of the appellant's claim and determined that the agency's cancellation of a vacancy announcement without making a selection for a position for which the appellant applied did not violate the appellant's right under &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) to compete for the position. While the appellant in <span class="Italic">Abell</span> did not prevail, neither the Board nor the Federal Circuit dismissed the appellant's VEOA claim on the basis that a preference eligible's right to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) is not remediable under VEOA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The court's holding in <span class="Italic">Campion</span>, i.e., that VEOA provides no right to appeal a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) to a non-preference-eligible veteran, was arguably superseded when Congress amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a in 2004. <span class="Italic">See infra</span>, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, Congress amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1) in 2004 to specifically allow "[a] veteran described in section 3304(f)(1) who alleges that an agency has violated such section with respect to such veteran [to] file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor." Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-454, Title VIII, &#x00A7; 804(a), 118 Stat. 3598, 3626 (2004). The report issued by the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs indicated that the purpose of the amendment was to afford the non-preference eligible veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years of active service, to whom Congress granted the same right as preference eligibles to compete under &#x00A7; 3304(f), the same right to seek redress for a violation of that right that VEOA previously provided to preference eligibles. S. Rep. No. 108-352, at 11-12 (2004), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3148, 3159. Because non-preference eligible veterans entitled to compete for positions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) have the right to file complaints with the Department of Labor, these veterans also presumably have the right to file a Board appeal if the Department of Labor is unable to resolve their complaints. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1) ("If the Secretary of Labor is unable to resolve a complaint under subsection (a) within 60 days after the date on which it is filed, the complainant may elect to appeal the alleged violation to the Merits Systems Protection Board...."). Although the view of a later Congress cannot control the interpretation of an earlier enacted statute, <span class="Italic">see Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citing <span class="Italic">O'Gilvie v. United States</span>, 519 U.S. 79, 90, (1996)), the legislative history of VEOA suggests that Congress always intended to provide a right to a preference eligible to file a complaint if he believed an agency violated his right to compete for a position guaranteed by VEOA. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, H.R. Rep. No. 105-40(I), at 12 (1997) ("Veterans who believe their veterans' preference rights or their right to compete for positions under this Act have been violated may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor."). In addition, an interpretation of the statute that would preclude preference eligibles from filing complaints regarding an agency's denial of the opportunity to compete guaranteed by &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) would lead to the absurd result that non-preference eligible veterans have greater remedial rights under VEOA than preference eligibles with respect to the right to seek redress regarding such a denial. <span class="Italic">See Wassenaar v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 21 F.3d 1090, 1092 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (in construing a statute, it should be read to avoid an absurd result when it can be given a reasonable application consistent with its words and legislative purpose).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) is more closely related to veterans' preference than &#x00A7; 3304(b), the subsection that the Board determined was a statute "related to" veterans' preference in <span class="Italic">Dean</span>. Although &#x00A7; 3304(b) does not specifically refer to "veterans' preference" or "preference eligibles," the Board in <span class="Italic">Dean</span> determined that it was a statute related to veterans' preference because, "[b]y establishing the principle that examinations are the norm and that individuals may not be appointed in the competitive service unless they have passed an examination or are specifically excepted from examination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302," this subsection ensured that the veterans' preference provisions that provide an advantage to preference eligibles in the competitive examination process will generally be applied to the appointment process for positions in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 17. In other words, despite the fact that &#x00A7; 3304(b) does not, standing alone, provide any advantage to preference eligibles, the Board determined that it was related to "veterans' preference" because it ensured the applicability of other statutory provisions that do explicitly provide the preference in the competitive examining process. In contrast to &#x00A7; 3304(b), &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) specifically refers to "preference eligibles" as being among the group to which the benefit provided by the subsection applies, despite the fact that &#x00A7; 3304(f)(3) provides that "[t]his subsection shall not be construed to confer an entitlement to veterans' preference that is not otherwise required by law." Thus, while &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) does not provide preference eligibles with any advantage beyond the opportunity to compete for particular positions, <span class="Italic">see Abell</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 8 ("We find that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f) permits the appellant and others in like circumstances to apply, but otherwise they receive no special treatment in the process of filling a position under merit promotion procedures."), preference eligibility granted to an individual pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108 is one basis under which an individual can qualify for the benefit provided by the subsection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons set forth above, we find that &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) stands in some relation to, has a bearing on, concerns, and has a connection with veterans' preference rights and is, therefore, a statute "relating to veterans' preference" for which VEOA provides a remedy in the event of a violation thereof. <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17. Accordingly, we overrule <span class="Italic">Schott v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 35 (2004), to the extent that decision is inconsistent with this finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's final argument is that the Board has no authority to grant relief under &#x00A7; 3330c(a) for a violation of &#x00A7; 3304(f) and that <span class="Italic">Dean</span> provides no legal authority for the Board to order the agency to reconstruct the selection process in this case. First, our acceptance of the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency violated &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) by denying the appellant the opportunity to compete for the Equal Employment <span id="Page_716"></span>Specialist position through its failure to process his application and our conclusion that &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) is a statute "related to veterans' preference" inexorably leads to the conclusion that the agency violated the appellant's "rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1). VEOA clearly authorizes the Board to grant a remedy for such a violation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;This subsection provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the Merit Systems Protection Board (in a proceeding under section 3330a) or a court (in a proceeding under section 3330b) determines that an agency has violated a right described in section 3330a, [(i.e., an individual's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference),] the Board or court (as the case may be) shall order the agency to comply with such provisions and award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual by reason of the violation involved. If the Board or court determines that such violation was willful, it shall award an amount equal to backpay as liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Previously, when an agency has improperly denied an appellant consideration for a position, the Board has generally stated that the appropriate remedy is to provide the appellant with priority consideration for a future vacancy, as the agency agreed to do in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00B6; 2 <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Azdell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 133, &#x00B6; 52 (2000) (priority consideration for future vacancies is the proper remedy for an appellant who was denied consideration for a position for which he was qualified), <span class="Italic">aff'd on reconsideration</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 88 (2001), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Meeker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 319 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Yet, priority consideration for a future vacancy is a remedy that provides prospective relief for the denial of the opportunity to compete, but it does not correct the agency's error with respect to the actual position for which the agency denied the appellant consideration. In the context of a VEOA appeal, such relief would be inappropriate because VEOA requires the Board to do more than merely provide a remedy for a past wrong; it mandates that the Board "shall order the agency to comply with" the violated provisions and award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual by reason of the violation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 44 (under VEOA, an appellant whose veterans' preference rights were violated with respect to a selection process is entitled to a selection process consistent with law). In addition, VEOA provides that the Board shall award an amount equal to back-pay as liquidated damages if it determines that the violation was willful. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a). Therefore, where an agency violates a statute related to veterans' preference by denying an appellant the right to compete for a particular position, the Board must craft a remedy that allows the appellant to compete for that position, allows the Board to determine whether the appellant suffered any loss of wages or benefits by reason of the violation, and, assuming that the Board finds that the violation was willful, allows the Board to determine whether the appellant might be entitled to backpay for the purposes of awarding liquidated damages. Reconstruction of the selection process requires the agency to comply with the provisions it violated, allows the Board to make the determinations necessary to award the appropriate relief, and, at the same time, is consistent with the principle that &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) requires that agencies give preference eligibles the right to compete for particular positions but does not guarantee these preference eligibles a position. <span class="Italic">See Abell</span>, 343 F.3d at 1384-85. Therefore, contrary to the agency's argument, we reaffirm our determination in <span class="Italic">Dean</span> that &#x00A7; 3330c authorizes the Board to require agencies to reconstruct a selection process when it has improperly prevented an appellant from competing for a position by violating such appellant's rights with respect to a statute or regulation related to veterans' preference. Accordingly, we find that the agency failed to establish that the administrative judge erred in ordering the agency to reconstruct the selection process under the circumstances of this case.</p>

Cir. 1999) (Table); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Abell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (finding that '[a]n agency may cancel a vacancy announcement for any reason that is not contrary to law'). Although the appellant argues that he was qualified for the positions, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency's decision not to select anyone for the PHA position under these vacancy announcements did not violate the appellant's rights under any statute or regulation related to veterans' preference.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is no job announcement for a position sought by the appellant, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the VEOA appeal for failure of the appellant to demonstrate that the agency denied him the right to compete under merit promotion procedures for a vacant position. <span class="Italic">Becker v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 409, 412 &#x00B6; 6, 2010 MSPB 220 (2010).</p>
