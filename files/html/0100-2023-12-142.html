<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-141"><span class="space">E.</span> REVIEW OF NEW LAW</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">An adverse action commences with the employee's receipt of the proposal notice, and the law then applicable shapes the case<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Bucci v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 43 MSPR 558, 562-63 (1990). Normally the law operative on the date of the appellate decision is the law that controls the disposition of the case, even if the case was correctly decided earlier under preexisting law. The Board impliedly recognized this rule in <span class="Italic">Lyles v. Dept. of Army</span>, 19 MSPR 114, 115-16 (1984). The appellant was subjected to adverse action for failing to maintain a security clearance. The law was that the Board would not second-guess the military officials who granted and revoked clearances: If the job depended on the clearance and the clearance was revoked, the agency needed only to prove the connection between the two and that was the end of the case. That approach was successfully challenged in <span class="Italic">Hoska v. Dept. of Army</span>, 677 F.2d 131 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (merits); 694 F.2d 270 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (counsel fee application). The court directed the Board to examine the basis for revocation of the clearance. <span class="Italic">Hoska</span> was decided a day before the <span class="Italic">Lyles</span> hearing. As a result, the appellant won under the new rule, the Army either not knowing of the <span class="Italic">Hoska</span> decision, or perhaps knowing of it and being unprepared to put evidence before the AJ on the security issue. On PFR, the Board remanded for rehearing under the <span class="Italic">Hoska</span> standards to permit the employer to present a complete case. The same result followed in <span class="Italic">Bivens v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 38 MSPR 67, 72 (1988), an enforced leave appeal, citing <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Neil</span>, 409 U.S. 505 (1973). The law that determined the case was the law created by the Federal Circuit during the pendency of the appealed action; it was immaterial that the agency's conduct may have been justified under preexisting law. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-12-177.html#sec5-176">Ignorance of Law; Late Discovery of Legal Defense; Subsequent MSPB Decision in Another Case</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is a substantial change in law while the Board appeal is pending, the Board may remand the case to the region for development of additional evidence concerning the issues raised as a result of the change in the law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Vegotsky v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 358, 361 (1988). The Board stated in <span class="Italic">In re Invalidation of 5 CFR 752.404(d)(3)</span>, 13 MSPR 621, 623 (1982), that although judicial decisions apply retroactively, retroactive application ordinarily extends only to those cases pending at the time of the judicial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the law changed after a Board decision became final, it first appeared that the Board might not apply the change to an active case (one subject to an <span id="Page_1729"></span>enforcement proceeding). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gray v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 281, 284 (1985) (applying a change in law relating to Board authority over security clearances to one aspect of reinstatement compliance but not invalidating, as a result of the new law, a final decision ordering reinstatement of the appellant after the loss of his clearance); <span class="Italic">Shaughnessy v. OPM</span>, 24 MSPR 35, 37 (1984) (an amendment to a disability retirement statute, providing a completely new statutory basis for entitlement, did not constitute "new evidence" affecting the correctness of an OPM decision to reject a retirement application under the preexisting statute).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board reexamined retroactive application of new decisional law in <span class="Italic">Stephens v. OPM</span>, 33 MSPR 292, 294-98 (1987), reopening earlier final decisions that denied counsel fees to employees who prevailed in disability retirement appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a rule, judicial decisions apply "retroactively." <span class="Italic">Solem v. Stumes</span>, 465 U.S. 638 (1984), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Neil</span>, 409 U.S. 505, 507-508 (1973). A legal system based on precedent has a built-in presumption of retroactivity<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> While this principle, which evolved out of a common law rule favoring complete retroactivity, now generally applies to cases pending before the courts when the judicial pronouncement is issued, there is no bar to retroactively applying a change in the law to decisions which have become final before rendition of the decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Linkletter v. Walker</span>, 381 U.S. 618 (1965), the Supreme Court determined that the decision on whether to apply a case law rule retroactively or prospectively is a policy choice rather than a mandate of law. In establishing the theoretical framework for deciding such retroactivity issues, the Court said:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Once the premise is accepted that we are neither required to apply, nor prohibited from applying, a decision retrospectively, we must then weigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[OPM] argues that a finding of retroactivity would be in clear conflict with the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson</span>, 404 U.S. 97 (1971). In that case the Court set out the following tripartite test for determining when a decision should have prospective, rather than retroactive application:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">First, the decision to be applied nonretrospectively must establish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied...or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.... Second...weigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation.... Finally...where a decision of this Court could produce substantial inequitable results if applied retroactively, there is ample basis in our cases for avoiding the "injustice or hardship" by a holding of nonretroactivity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he issue in this case is not whether to apply the <span class="Italic">Simmons</span> decision prospectively, but whether retroactive application of the decision should extend to cases which were closed through the issuance of a final decision before the <span class="Italic">Simmons</span> decision was issued. In any event, we find that even if we analyzed the issue in accordance with the <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> decision, retrospective application of <span class="Italic">Simmons</span> to the present cases is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[R]etroactive application of <span class="Italic">Simmons</span> will not produce "substantial inequitable results." We are aware that the Supreme Court has refused to give retroactive effect to its holdings when such application would have devastating financial results on the losing party....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board is sensitive to the need for fiscal restraint, we find that retroactive application of <span class="Italic">Simmons</span> does not raise the same specter of harm that the Supreme Court guarded against....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency estimates that the total cost of retroactive application could be about $4 million. However, that figure is not realistic. The maximum amount would approach only about one-fifth the agency's estimate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board denied a PFR as untimely, then reopened the case on its own motion to correct a back pay award as a result of a subsequently-issued GAO opinion concerning back pay calculations in <span class="Italic">Phelps v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 35 MSPR 273, 276 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Klages v. DOD</span>, 80 MSPR 594, 597 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (applying a recent decision concerning the timeliness of an appeal to a belated appeal of an involuntary resignation, citing <span class="Italic">Stephens, supra</span>, for the proposition that a "legal system based on precedent has a built-in presumption of retroactivity and applies to cases pending before the system.").<span class="Italic"> But see</span> <span class="Italic">Knox v. USPS,</span> SF-0353-10-0054-I-1 (NP 7/29/2015) ("The Board generally will not apply one of its precedential decisions to a case that is already closed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smart v. Department of Justice</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 582, &#x00B6; 11 (2011)."); <span class="Italic">Loomis v. Dept. of Army</span>, 106 MSPR 431, 434 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8, 2007 MSPB 196 (2007) (initial decision in another case was insufficient to permit a belated PFR; the initial decision was of no precedential value and the delay in the PFR--10 months--was substantial).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to appeals that are settled, <span class="Italic">Mannion v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> PH-315H-08-0586-I-1 (NP 12/23/2010) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Mannion v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 429 Fed. Appx. 986 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>), suggested a settlement will not be set aside because, following settlement, the law changed in a way that might have led to a different result had the settled appeal instead been litigated to a merits decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's primary argument in her petition for review compares her case to the facts in the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Abdullah v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 99 (2009), which was issued approximately eleven months after she withdrew her appeal. Despite the surface similarities between <span class="Italic">Abdullah</span> and this appeal, the reasons not to reopen this case are stronger than any arguments the appellant might set forth. First, the appellant withdrew her appeal based on a settlement agreement. Had the appellant, like Mr. Abdullah, litigated her case, the Board might have had opportunity to examine the issues she has raised. A party's considerations during settlement, however, presumably include the weighing of options and choosing between immediate finality with a known result and the possibility that one will fare better--or worse--in litigation, or even that the tribunal will change the law. Because we favor settlement and the finality it brings, we will not reverse the appellant's decision to withdraw her appeal pursuant to a settlement agreement simply because she now believes that she may prevail on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mannion</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Mannion v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 429 Fed. Appx. 986, 989-90 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Mannion contends that we should set aside the settlement agreement, because she decided to settle after receiving erroneous advice from the administrative judge. Specifically, Ms. Mannion contends that her decision to settle was based on the administrative judge's "false assumption" that she was a probationary employee and, thus, not entitled to full appeal rights. Ms. Mannion contends that the Board's later holding in <span class="Italic">Abdullah</span> indicates that that administrative judge was incorrect and she was a nonprobationary employee with adverse action appeal rights. Ms. Mannion also cites to other evidence, including the 2010 Federal Personnel Handbook, numerous government websites, and an email from an attorney she hired to review her case, that she contends support her argument that she was not a probationary employee at the time of her termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no reason to set aside the settlement agreement in light of the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Abdullah</span> or any of the other evidence cited by Ms. Mannion. "It is well established that in order to set aside a settlement, an appellant must show that the agreement is unlawful, was involuntary, or was the result of fraud or mutual mistake." <span class="Italic">Sargent v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 229 F.3d 1088, 1091 (Fed. Cir. 2000). As a letter from Ms. Mannion's legal counsel to the Board illustrates, prior to settlement, the parties disputed whether Ms. Mannion was a probationary employee. The letter states that "[a]lthough [Treasury] contends that Ms. Mannion is a probationary employee, please note that she disputes this allegation and maintains that she was a tenured employee who completed any probation to which she may have been subject." Even if the administrative judge during settlement informed Ms. Mannion that she was unlikely to prevail on her arguments that she was a tenured employee, Ms. Mannion was fully represented by counsel during this process. Although her attorney previously contended that she was not a probationary employee at the time of her termination, Ms. Mannion decided to forgo her claims against Treasury in exchange for, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, $25,000 in attorney's fees and the issuance of a SF-50 stating her removal was a voluntary resignation "for personal reasons."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Public policy favors settlement and a party cannot set aside a settlement agreement simply because changing precedent or new evidence makes its chances of achieving success on the merits more likely. To hold otherwise would mean no settlement agreement would truly be final, and the government would have no incentive to enter into settlements that reach fair compromises and avoid costly litigation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit has not shown much interest in permitting relitigation of settled cases based on changes in case law. The court observed in <span class="Italic">Frias v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3531), that "[p]arties cannot relitigate issues that they have previously resolved between themselves each time a new opinion comes out that supports a position more favorable to one of them." <span class="Italic">Wright v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3119), added as to a PFR that the Board rejected as untimely:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The only truly new fact presented by Peggy Wright, either to the AJ in her submission regarding timeliness, to the Board on her appeal of the AJ's dismissal or on appeal to this court, was her discovery of the <span class="Italic">Brush</span> case while working in a library. However, as we have recently held, the discovery of new legal arguments or the discovery of a precedential decision which may affect the outcome of an appeal does not, by itself, establish good cause for the untimely filing of a petition for review. <span id="Page_1730"></span><span class="Italic">Nelson v. Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Deposit Ins. Corp.</span>, 83 F.3d 1375, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 1996). This rule applies even where, as here, the new decision issued after the due date of an appeal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> ("Even if <span class="Italic">Fox</span> had issued between...the due date of Nelson's petition [and] ...the date he actually filed it, its discovery by the petitioner cannot constitute good cause for untimeliness...."); <span class="Italic">see also Romero</span>, 66 MSPR at 111-12; <span class="Italic">Acree v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 566, 569 (1994). It is particularly applicable where the decision relied upon by a petitioner does not contain any hint that it was meant to be applied retroactively to alter the outcome of final decisions that were not timely appealed. <span class="Italic">Brush</span> is such a decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A change in the law does not automatically lead to acceptance of an otherwise untimely PFR. In <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 135, 137 (1994), the appellant settled an adverse action assuming that he would not be able to recover back pay since, under Postal Service regulations then prevailing, he was required to seek work during the back pay period. Several years later the law changed and the Board declined to adhere to the Postal Service policy. Instead, the Board required back pay to otherwise eligible appellants even though they did not seek other work during the pendency of their appeals. The change in the law did not suggest misrepresentation by the Postal Service in the settlement negotiations, and the change in the law did not furnish a basis for late acceptance of the PFR seeking reopening of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If, despite a change in the law, the circumstances of the case show that the change would not assist the appellant, the Board may decline to reopen the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bagunas v. USPS</span>, 100 MSPR 328, 331 &#x00B6; 6 (2005) (court decision that VEOA limitation periods were open to equitable tolling was insufficient to reopen an appeal when an earlier decision considered the possibility of equitable tolling but found it would not excuse the appellant's late filing of a VEOA complaint).
