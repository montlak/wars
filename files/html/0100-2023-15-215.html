<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-214"><span class="space">b.</span> Prohibited Personnel Practice Analysis</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the Reform Act, 5 USC 2302(b)(8), it is a prohibited personnel practice to take or fail to take a personnel action against any employee or applicant for employment as reprisal for a disclosure that the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences (1) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation; (2) gross mismanagement; (3) a gross waste of funds; (4) an abuse of authority; or (5) a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. The disclosure must not be specifically prohibited by law or specifically required by executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs. The statute is often pleaded as a defense to actions based on verbal disclosures or complaints. The statute may be interpleaded with constitutional arguments. Analysis of the various statutory and constitutional arguments tends to be the same and is principally dependent upon the <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> balancing test. [Refer to statutory whistleblowing defenses in Chapter 13 on "<a href="0100-2023-20-004.html#sec13-5">Whistleblowing Reprisal</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Shockro v. FCC</span>, 5 MSPR 113, 5 MSPB 181 (1981), involving a defense that an employee was downgraded in reprisal for unfavorable testimony about his agency to a congressional committee, determined that the appellant's burden in whistleblowing includes a demonstration that the communication is protected by 5 USC 2302(b)(8) and that the personnel action complained of was taken with retaliatory intent. To qualify for &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) protection, the disclosure must be one the employee reasonably believes demonstrates mismanagement or abuse of authority, or specific danger to public health or safety. Finding that the appellant distorted the agency position and was advised of those distortions, the Board determined that his disclosures were removed from the penumbra of protected conduct because they were not made in the reasonable belief that they were true. The disclosures lacked protection because they were not specific; they were general criticisms of agency policy not within the Board's interpretation of a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety. Not explained in the opinion was whether the Board viewed the disclosures, revealing the termination of agency research into child abuse and neglect and the developmental origins of violence, as possible allegations of abuse of authority or mismanagement. Considering that the disclosures to outsiders through the letters written by the appellant were the basis for his removal, the Board concluded the appellant did not prove that the agency engaged in unlawful retaliation for the filing of an administrative grievance or authorship of what was an apparently critical article in a popular magazine. The Board may have been implying that if the agency demonstrates a solid basis for a removal, reprisal may not be considered as a defense, although this was not explicitly held, and the Board did not discuss the issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Depending on the circumstances of disclosure, protected statements may encompass an appellant's charges within the agency and to an external agency advisory board about allegedly improper details or performance evaluations, if they are coupled both with allegations of gross disparities in the awards of agency grants, to the detriment of minority educational institutions, and with allegations of general insensitivity toward minority participants in an agency program. <span class="Italic">Oliver v. DHHS</span>, 34 MSPR 465 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Oliver v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 87-3527). Citing <span class="Italic">Warren v. Dept. of Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 656, 658 (Fed. Cir. 1986), and <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR 163, 193-96, 1 MSPB 159 (1979), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 672 F.2d 150 (D.C. Cir. 1982), <span class="Italic">Oliver</span> explained that under 5 USC 2302(b)(8)(A), a protected disclosure is one that the employee reasonably believes evidences (1) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (2) mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. To establish a claim of reprisal in violation of this section, the proponent must show that (1) a protected disclosure was made; (2) the accused official knew of the claimant's disclosure; (3) under the circumstances, the adverse action under review could have been retaliation; and (4) after careful balancing of the intensity of the accused official's motive against the gravity of the misconduct, a nexus exists between the adverse action and the motive. Although <span class="Italic">Warren</span> suggested that the fourth criterion need not be reached when the targets of the disclosures are involved in the action and the protected disclosures are themselves included in the charges, the Board determined in <span class="Italic">Oliver</span> that the nexus issue would be reached because, among other reasons, <span class="Italic">Warren</span> did not involve an appellant whose protected activities also evidenced great disrespect for authority.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Balancing the protected nature and the abusive nature of the appellant's memos, the Board favored the employer in <span class="Italic">Oliver</span>, 34 MSPR at 472-75:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we must determine if the agency would have proceeded with an adverse action, absent the retaliatory motive which we have inferred. The tone and wording of her numerous memoranda, we find, are so intemperate and otherwise inappropriate as to warrant discipline. Merely illustrative of the multitude of abusive criticisms appellant levied at her supervisors, she described them as lacking in personal integrity and moral authority, dishonest, incompetent, and appallingly ignorant. In addition, she openly accused them of being not qualified for their positions, of instituting management practices "akin to lunacy," of possessing paranoid assumptions, and of having a lynch mob mentality. She described their criticism of her as irrational, hysterical, and "ludicrous in the extreme."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In enacting 5 USC 2303(b)(8)(A), Congress sought to protect whistleblowers whose "dedication to the highest moral principles" helps create "a more effective civil service."...It recognized that this protection was not absolute, however, by providing certain exceptions, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, employees who claim to be whistleblowers in order to avoid an otherwise meritorious adverse action....&#8197;Thus, in deciding whether certain types of conduct should be immunized from sanction because of the law, the Board has held that the relevant inquiry is whether expanding the protections of the law to include the conduct under review would effectuate the purposes of 5 USC 2302(b)(8)....&#8197;We conclude, for the following reasons, that protecting appellant's diatribe would not further the purpose of the law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is not alone in employing this kind of analysis to determine whether conduct which might appear to be protected loses that status for any reason. For example, even when dealing with paramount constitutional issues, the Supreme Court has recognized in first amendment cases to which we analogize, that whether an employee's speech addresses a matter of public concern, and is therefore protected, is circumscribed, and must be determined by the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Connick v. Myers</span>, 461 U.S. 138, 147-48 (1983). While the case presently before the Board was not argued in the first amendment context, the analogy is nevertheless apt, and supports the notion that in determining whether speech is protected, it is necessary to carefully scrutinize the facts surrounding the employee's declaration. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Murray v. Gardner</span>, 741 F.2d 434, 438 (D.C. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 470 U.S. 1050 (1985) ("[T]he role of the whistleblower merits protection; the expressions of personal dissatisfaction by a discontented employee do not.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in cases falling within the purview of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), employees' statutory rights to concerted activity and to the full benefit of the collective bargaining process are protected, but these protections may be lost where their conduct exceeds proper bounds....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[S]tatements made in the context of a campaign to organize employees into a union, an activity normally protected by the NLRA, may nonetheless provide adequate grounds for discharge....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, by analogy to NLRA cases, the Board has held that while simply rude or impertinent conduct in the course of presenting a grievance provides no basis for discipline, gross insubordination or threats of physical harm do. <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. Department of the Army</span>, 22 MSPR 190, 194 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Red Top, Inc.</span>, 455 F.2d 721 (8th Cir. 1972).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that in the context of specific race and sex discrimination allegations, cases decided under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act...also apply a similar balancing test. For example, in <span class="Italic">Hochstadt v. Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, Inc.</span>, 545 F.2d 222, 233 (1st Cir. 1976), the court found that Title VII "does not afford an employee unlimited license to complain at any and all times and places." It thereby held that all conduct related to an employee's opposition to discrimination was not immune from discipline and concluded that the plaintiff's conduct, which it found hostile, disruptive, and disloyal, was not protected. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Garrett v. Mobile Oil Corp.</span>, 531 F.2d 892, 896 (8th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 429 U.S. 848 (1976) (holding that employee's activities, allegedly in furtherance of her Title VII rights, constituted valid reasons for discharge because they were disruptive to the workplace).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, too, that in <span class="Italic">Arnett v. Kennedy</span>, 416 U.S. 134, 161-62 (1974), the Court stated that it is "inherent in the employment relationship as a matter of common sense if not [of] common law that [a government] employee...cannot reasonably assert a right to keep his job while at the same time he inveighs against his supervisors in public with intemperate and defamatory" remarks....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering appellant's statements in this light, the Board finds that the balance required by the fourth step of the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> test must be struck in favor of the agency. We conclude that, while appellant's allegations were in and of themselves protected, the bulk of them do not concern the public interest when considered in their entirety. Rather, her apparent interest in causing office disruption, as evidenced by her insubordination, and her obvious desire to malign the targets of her disclosures, as evidenced by her insolent manner and caustic style, substantially overshadowed the alleged waste, fraud, or mismanagement addressed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This result is supported by a decision recently issued by the...Federal Circuit. In <span class="Italic">Mings v. Department of Justice</span>, 813 F.2d 384 (Fed. Cir. 1987), a border patrol agent was removed for...using insulting and abusive language concerning agency employees and others in a letter to an agency official. Like the instant appellant, the appellant there used internal agency channels exclusively to vent his dissatisfaction. The court found limited public interest in petitioner's complaints, but stated that even if his letter did address a matter of public concern, the potentially disruptive effect that the letter could have on agency operations substantially outweighed whatever public interest the letter addressed. Similarly, in this case we conclude that the limited public interest concern is outweighed by the disruptive effect of appellant's statements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus we find that the inference to retaliate on the part of appellant's supervisors is outweighed by the gravity of her misconduct, particularly the manner and means by which she made her disclosures....&#8197;To the extent that application of this balancing test in whistleblower situations serves to limit, based on the totality of circumstances, the degree to which the statute offers protection, we find that such a limit is justified, and that the fourth part of the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> test is not compromised by subjecting it to a rule of reason. Nothing in 5 USC 2302(b)(8), its legislative history, or the cases interpreting it indicates that all statements made in the course of alleged whistleblowing, no matter the degree of invective employed, are unconditionally protected. We conclude that the purposes of the law would not be advanced by providing unconditional protection to statements made in the manner at issue here.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">When a disclosure is of protected subject matter, it is more likely than not to be critical of management, perhaps highly critical. The WPA protects those employees who are willing to speak out on subjects that could incur retaliation if unshielded. We have not been shown substantial evidence in support of the agency's burden to establish by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken these disciplinary actions absent the protected disclosures. The Board's contrary finding cannot be sustained. We reverse the Board's decision, and remand for further proceedings including determination of the remedy appropriate to the improper disciplinary actions.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...the Board does consider the context in which purported inappropriate remarks were made to ascertain whether they constitute misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Daigle</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 625, 628. In the context of whistleblowing, there may also be more leeway for employee speech, as protection under the WPA is not removed "when protected subject matter is stated in a blunt manner." <span class="Italic">Greenspan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 464 F.3d 1297, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2006). But this is not a general license for bad behavior--the character and nature of the disclosure can still be a legitimate basis for discipline. <span class="Italic">See Kalil v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the appellant's assertions, the great majority of the incidents recounted in the specifications under Charge 1 did not occur in a whistleblowing context. In particular, Specification A dealt with his response to being placed on administrative leave, Specification B dealt with a request for leave, Specification C dealt with his response to his supervisor's investigation of a security issue, Specification D dealt with his inquiry about a protocol manual, Specification E dealt with his response to a letter of instruction, Specification G dealt with his request to punish another employee, and Specification I dealt with his comments to a respiratory therapist during a medical procedure. Thus, the appellant's conduct took place in normal employment contexts, where normal standards would be expected to apply. <span class="Italic">See Beaudoin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 489, &#x00B6; 16 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to Specification J, the memorandum can be read as disclosing waste in the handling of cold kit materials, which could potentially be a protected disclosure. However, in addition to the potential disclosure, the memorandum criticizes management for "this western style range war" and implies that decisions were made for reasons of power and control. This criticism which reflects lack of respect is properly subject to punishment, even if a portion of the document is arguably protected whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See Kalil</span>, 479 F.3d at 825.</p>

Cir. 2004), involving a claim under the RTC Whistleblower Act and the First Amendment, determined that if the government establishes, for purposes of the whistleblower reprisal analysis, clear and convincing evidence that it would have fired the employee without regard to retaliatory animus, that proof defeats the constitutional claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our determination that the district court's factual conclusions are not clearly erroneous is fatal to Koszola's contention that the court erred by not inquiring into whether he had stated a First Amendment claim. He correctly contends that courts conduct a multifactor inquiry to decide whether a public employee has established a cause of action under the First Amendment. <span class="Italic">See Connick v. Myers</span>, 461 U.S. 138, 142 (1983); <span class="Italic">Hall v. Ford</span>, 856 F.2d 255, 258 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The government, however, can rebut any such claim by showing by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same action regardless of any protected speech by the employee. <span class="Italic">See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977). The statutory and First Amendment counts in Koszola's complaint refer to identical disclosures. The district court correctly reasoned that, because the RTC had already adduced clear and convincing evidence that it would have terminated Koszola regardless of any protected activity, <span class="Italic">a fortiori</span> it would prevail under the First Amendment's less demanding rebuttal standard. As we do not disturb the district court's finding of clear and convincing evidence, its ruling on Koszola's First Amendment claim stands.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of our disposition, we have no occasion to reach the FDIC's arguments that Koszola's disclosures were not protected under the RTC Whistleblower Act or the First Amendment.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">That protected statements (safety concerns) are involved in the charge of failure to undertake a directed fitness examination does not invalidate the charge as retaliatory, <span class="Italic">Cerulli v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent Mr. Cerulli argues that his conduct cannot be separated from the content of his disclosures, we disagree. The WPA does not require "that the adverse action be based on facts completely separate and distinct from protected whistleblowing disclosures." <span class="Italic">Watson v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 64 F.3d 1524, 1528 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (internal quotations omitted). Nor does the act shield an employee's conduct from agency action merely by virtue of having made a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Greenspan v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 464 F.3d 1297, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Greenspan</span>, cited by Mr. Cerulli, is consistent with these principles.

We concluded that the protections of the WPA are not removed simply because protected subject matter is conveyed in a "blunt and arrogant manner." 464 F.3d at 1304-305. However, we declined to consider whether the employee's behavior went beyond blunt to become "disruptive" or "disrespectful" because the agency had not relied on such a ground at the time of discipline. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1305.</p>
