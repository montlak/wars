<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-36"><span class="space">11.</span> Incarceration; Work-Release Program</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Conviction of a crime resulting in AWOL is no less blameworthy than intentionally absenting oneself from work for personal reasons. <span class="Italic">Gibbs v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3417). An agency is not obligated to grant leave to an incarcerated employee because the absence is "beyond his control." <span class="Italic">Henderson v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 11, 16 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Rojas v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 544, 549 (1997) ("[A]n agency may remove an employee for AWOL caused by his incarceration.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under some circumstances the agency may be required to honor an employee's request for annual leave during incarceration. Under <span class="Italic">Benally v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 71 MSPR 537, 540-42 (1996), the agency's denial of annual leave will be assessed against work-force needs, not on the basis for the leave requested:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn now to the finding below that the approval of the appellant's request for annual leave for a seven-day period of incarceration was properly rescinded. Annual leave is an entitlement, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 6303, subject to the agency's right to fix the time at which it is taken, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 6302(d). <span class="Italic">See also Matter of Dr. Omer K.</span> <span class="Italic">Petty,</span> No. B-201156 (unpublished), 1981 WL 24312 (C.G., Mar. 16, 1981) (the taking of annual leave is subject to the right of the agency head to fix the time of the taking of the leave).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although a period of incarceration is not listed among the purposes of annual leave, neither is that purpose (or any other purpose) forbidden. <span class="Italic">See</span> General Accounting Office, Office of General Counsel, <span class="Italic">Civilian Personnel Manual</span>, Binder III (Personnel), tit. II, ch. 2 at 211 (3d ed. 1990). Nor has any Board or Federal Circuit case authorized an agency to deny, or to rescind, annual leave based purely on the purpose for which it is requested. Indeed, the Board has recognized that annual leave may be used for periods of incarceration<span class="Italic">. See Meade v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 12 MSPB 86, 13 MSPR 516, 518 (1982) (appellant could have requested annual leave before he was jailed, but did not).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Pearson v. Department of the Navy,</span> 8 MSPB 93, 8 MSPR 405, 407 (1981), the Board held that denial of an employee's request for leave during his incarceration was not error. That result, however, was based on three factors: The agency demonstrated that the appellant was a "key <span id="Page_2488"></span>individual" with "indispensable skills"; that his "absence during a peak workload period created a serious shortage of manpower"; and that the agency had a "reasonable belief, at the time, that [the] appellant's absence would continue until he had completed serving his original 80-day sentence." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The opinion additionally noted that the employee's 30 days of accumulated annual leave would have covered less than half of his projected absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the <span class="Italic">Pearson</span> criteria--expected length of absence, and impact on the workplace--to the case at hand yields a different result. Here, the length of the appellant's absence on the second charge was seven days, not a projected 80. Nor did the agency make the showing that, <span class="Italic">at the time,</span> it had determined that it needed the appellant on the job. In fact, the agency at first approved the appellant's request for annual leave, prior to learning the reason for the request. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge erred in sustaining the AWOL charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not hereby rule, however, that a requested period of seven days, slightly more or slightly less, will always support a grant of annual leave. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Veterans Administration</span>, 792 F.2d 1111, 1113 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (court found no error in a charge of AWOL resulting from an agency denial of annual leave, when a nurse's request for annual leave from August 5-13, 1981 was denied because another nurse had requested those same days first; removal sustained). We note only that under different circumstances, the interaction of such criteria as length of sentence, impact on agency operations, and (as appropriate) length and quality of the appellant's work and disciplinary records, can lead to different resolutions in cases involving AWOL resulting from denial of annual leave.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies may have work-release programs aiding the rehabilitation of employees who have been sentenced for some types of crimes. If a regulation does not require the agency to participate in the program for the appellant's particular crime, the participation is discretionary. Should the appellant be removed for absence without leave during incarceration, the action will not be set aside because the agency refused to allow the employee to return to work under the release program unless it is shown that the refusal to permit participation was an abuse of discretion. The removal for AWOL is a result of the employee's own misconduct, but it is the AWOL, not the criminal misconduct, that is the basis for the removal; there is no need for the agency to establish a nexus between the crime and the removal. <span class="Italic">Winslow v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 46 MSPR 246, 250 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 15 MSPR 690, 692 (1983) ("The decision to deny participation in appellant's case was made after review and recommendation by several people, and was based on the nature of appellant's case in light of a serious drug problem at the agency facility. We cannot find any authority requiring the agency to accept appellant in the work release program and there is no basis for finding that the agency abused its discretion by refusing to accept appellant in such program.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">AWOL could be a basis for removal, even if there was also some concern about the underlying criminal charges leading to incarceration, <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 501, 505 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Commander Wallace...testified that he considered the fact of the appellant's arrest and incarceration based on the criminal charge of attempted rape in denying his request for LWOP and determined that he owed it to his female employees not to permit the appellant to return to duty until it was decided if he was guilty or innocent. He stated moreover, that, if the criminal charge against the appellant were dismissed, he would permit him to return to duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On balance, we find that the appellant did not prove his claim that the charge of excessive unauthorized absence was a pretext for his removal. Commander Wallace provided persuasive testimony with regard to the effect of the appellant's unplanned and unauthorized absence on the agency's mission. Further, his decision to remove the appellant was consistent with his past practice of removing employees for similar offenses of excessive unauthorized absence. Thus, we conclude that the charge of excessive unauthorized absence was the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> reason for the appellant's removal....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Evidence of work disruption is not essential to an AWOL removal during incarceration, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DLA</span>, 54 MSPR 370, 372-73 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's failure to describe precisely how the appellant's absence affected its work during the period of incarceration does not show that the denial of LWOP was an abuse of discretion. The Board has previously upheld agency decisions to deny LWOP in similar circumstances without requiring the agency to demonstrate the impact of the appellant's absence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Henderson</span>, 36 MSPR at 16. Furthermore, even though the Board in <span class="Italic">Hawkins</span> relied, in part, upon "persuasive" testimony that the appellant's absence adversely affected the agency's work, we find that such evidence is not always necessary. Whatever an agency's workload, an employee's absence will tend to disrupt its operations. Either some work will remain undone or others will have to do it. Where, as here, the employee's reason is insufficient to justify leave, that should be enough....&#8197;Hence, we find that a showing of an impact, absent unusual circumstances, e.g., proof that the workload was so low that employees were being transferred to other units or laid off, is not required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, to the extent that the administrative judge relies on the agency's failure to grant leave after the appellant was told that he could apply for it, we find that she misses the point. The supervisors whom he asked made no promise that the request would be granted. Indeed, they did not have the authority to grant such leave. Nonetheless, they would have been remiss in not telling the appellant that he had the option of applying for LWOP when he asked them for advice. Even if they had misled him in this respect, the appellant, after his arrest, did not have the option of avoiding incarceration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency has established that its denial of the appellant's leave request was reasonable and thus that AWOL charge is supported by preponderant evidence....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Fisher v. DOD</span>, 54 MSPR 675, 684 (1992) (as to absence caused by a medical condition, the agency's failure to describe precisely how the absence affected its work does not show that the denial of LWOP was an abuse of discretion without unusual circumstances, e.g., proof that the workload was so low that employees were being transferred to other units or laid off; evidence demonstrated that management needed to have appellant's position filled, that there were staff shortages, and that the agency had to pull an individual from another shift to fill the position).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are some decisions suggesting that an agency needs to follow a rational policy. Under <span class="Italic">Pearson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 8 MSPR 405, 409 n.2 (1982), a blanket agency policy refusing to participate in work-release programs might raise an inference of arbitrariness in agency discipline against employees charged with AWOL; discretion should be exercised in individual cases. But without evidence of well-defined agency policies, the Board does not appear to involve itself in the fairness of agency responses to work-release requests. In <span class="Italic">Huettner v. Dept. of Army</span>, 54 MSPR 472, 474 (1992), the appellant was fired for AWOL when he would have merited consideration for work release had the agency simply verified his employment with the sentencing judge. The Board brushed aside the agency's failure to provide the information that might have resulted in appellant's release and the avoidance of serious AWOL charges with the unsympathetic observation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency was under no obligation to provide information verifying the appellant's employment. Thus, we find that it was not an abuse of discretion for the agency to fail to participate in the work-release program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency did not act to prohibit the appellant from working; rather, the appellant's incarceration for his criminal activity resulted in his absence from duty....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rawls v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/RAWLS_WILLIE_M_AT020707I1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248744.pdf">94 MSPR 614</a>, 618 &#x00B6; 10 (2003) ("It is well settled that agencies are not obligated by law, rule, or regulation to accept an appellant for duty under a work release program.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Abrams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 480, 486 (1984), added guidance on work release. An agency may not establish nexus (as to off-duty misconduct) by relying on absence resulting from incarceration that the agency could avoid by accepting the employee into a work-release program, but the agency may lodge a separate adverse action charge for AWOL. There is no abuse of discretion in refusing to permit work-release participation given the nature of serious misconduct, e.g., conviction of an off-duty shooting. The majority opinion in <span class="Italic">Abrams</span> sparked a dissent from Board Member Devaney, who felt that if a court found the defendant suitable for work release, the agency should require no more. He cited <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 4 MSPR 534, 535, 5 MSPB 60 (1981), involving a stay granted under 5 USC 1208 [now 5 USC 1214(b)] to prevent the removal of an employee for AWOL after a court had granted work release. The argument in that case (not reflected by the Board's decision) was that removal under those circumstances on an AWOL charge would be a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC 2302(b)(10): the action would be taken for reasons unrelated to performance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nielson v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> DE-0752-13-0230-I-1 (NP 2/25/2015) ("The Board previously found that an agency is not obligated by law, rule, or regulation to accept an appellant for duty under a work release program. <span class="Italic">Winslow v.

However, if the agency does consider an appellant for duty under a work release program, it must not abuse its discretion in making its determination. <span class="Italic">Abrams v. Department of the Navy</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 480, 487 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 770 F.2d 181 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). The agency provided no explanation as to how the deciding official reached his conclusion that the appellant was not ready, willing, and able to report for work."); <span class="Italic">Green v. Dept. of Army</span>, 22 MSPR 557, 558 (1984) (concurring opinion of Member Devaney, who argued that agencies abuse their discretion when they refuse to authorize participation in a work-release program and then remove the employee for the resultant AWOL); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Poe v. Dept. of Army</span>, 22 MSPR 506, 509 (1984) (an appellant was not constructively suspended when a work release was refused). [Refer to the earlier discussion of "<a href="0100-2023-15-021.html#sec8-22">LWOP; Other Leave Arrangement; Compensable Injury; Disability Accommodation</a>" and refer to "<a href="0100-2023-13-083.html#sec6-83">Enforced Leave; Constructive Suspension</a>" in Chapter 6.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Faber v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 315, 319-21 (1988), implied the possibility <span id="Page_2489"></span>that an agency may have a duty to accommodate an employee who pursues rehabilitation during or before incarceration (resulting in AWOL charges) following an offense--DWI and leaving the scene of an accident--caused by the disabling condition of alcoholism. The Board did not thoroughly treat accommodative responsibility. The appellant was ordered reinstated after a period of incarceration. <span class="Italic">Harbo v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 450, 455 (1992), again avoided deciding the agency's responsibility to an employee (short of placing him on AWOL) who is confined to a custodial drug treatment program. In <span class="Italic">Harbo</span>, the agency did not know of the appellant's confinement and the appellant did not request leave during his confinement. The decision by the agency to place the appellant in an AWOL status during the period of his absence was "both proper and reasonable."
