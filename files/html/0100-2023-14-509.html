<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-510"><span class="space">1.</span> Weapons</h4>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was nonnegotiable that the agency provide a secure facility for employees' privately-owned weapons (that were neither required nor permitted to be used in the performance of official duties). It did not affect working conditions. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1917 and DOJ, INS, New York City Dist. Office</span>, 4 FLRA 150 (1980). To the extent the proposal could have been interpreted to require the agency to provide a secure facility for storage of agency-issued weapons, it was negotiable only at the election of the agency under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) because the proposal concerned the technology of performing agency work. FLRA decided that the proposal determined whether the agency would use a particular technology of performing work, e.g., the use of a "gun box" as opposed to some other facility for storage of weapons or no facility for storage at all. It did not provide the employees access to a facility already in use by the agency. The proposal did not constitute an appropriate arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management authority under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). Management had not yet exercised its authority. The proposal improperly required management to exercise its rights in a particular manner.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another proposal, that the agency negotiate the availability of storage for employees' weapons at the worksite, was nonnegotiable because it infringed on the right to determine security practices. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 59 FLRA 749, 755 (2004) (proposal did not constitute appropriate arrangement: extent of benefit to employees was not established by record; proposal as arrangement had effect of requiring negotiation over exercise of management right). But <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>was remanded by a reviewing court in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 404 F.3d 454, 457-58 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (again remanded, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 437 F.3d 1248 (D.C. Cir. 2006), <span class="Italic">post</span>), when FLRA did not properly evaluate the matter of a practice by Customs Service that was seemingly inconsistent with its position concerning the proposal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In the present context, to apply the <span class="Italic">KANG </span>test the Authority had to ascertain how the agency exercised its right to determine its internal security practices so that the Authority could then determine whether the proposal "excessively interfere[d]" with the agency's exercise of its right. In the decision before us, the Authority did not follow its own precedent established in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Association of Civilian Technicians v. FLRA</span>, 370 F.3d 1214, 1221 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (vacating an Authority decision and directing application of the <span class="Italic">KANG </span>test on rehearing).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that, despite the narrow scope of court review of FLRA decisions, any agency's "unexplained departure from prior agency determinations" is inherently arbitrary and capricious in violation of APA &#x00A7; 706(2)(A). <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2761 v. FLRA</span>, 866 F.2d 1443, 1446 (D.C. Cir. 1989). The Authority's failure to follow its own well-established precedent without explanation is the very essence of arbitrariness. Therefore, we must set aside its determination that the proposal did not constitute an appropriate arrangement and return the question to the Authority for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and Authority precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, the Authority must conduct a so-called "excessively interferes with" inquiry "by weighing the practical needs of the employees and managers." 21 F.L.R.A. at 31-32. It did not do so on the present record. The Authority's path to error was set when it erroneously found that "the agency has exercised its right to determine its internal security by having employees who are trained and qualified to carry firearms maintain possession and access to their weapons when off duty." 59 F.L.R.A. at 754. That finding was crucial to the Authority's conclusion that the proposal "would operate so as to completely preclude the agency from exercising that right." In fact, the record did not support the Authority's description of the agency's security policy. On the record, the agency apparently, in many locations, permitted on-site storage of firearms of off-duty officers, and, indeed, provided facilities for such storage. We are not suggesting that the Authority must rule that the agency must make such arrangements in all locations, but only that the Authority must consider the evidence in the record before it, conduct the balanced inquiry required by the <span class="Italic">KANG </span>line of precedent, and then reach its conclusion as to whether the proposal "excessively interferes" with the agency's internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the record before it and this Court, the Authority has not established that the proposal would "negate and nullify" the agency's right to implement the practice it followed at the time the Union made the proposal. The most the proposal would require is the institution at other facilities of a method of carrying out agency internal security policies already in place at some locations. Whether this constitutes an appropriate arrangement is a question for the Authority to answer in the first instance, but it must do so on findings based on the record before it, and by a process consistent with its own precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent">After remand, more intensive treatment was provided to the provision (Proposal 10(a)) requiring the agency to provide all officers who are required to carry a firearm with a suitable locker or safe for overnight storage. The proposal was nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 60 FLRA 367, 370-73 (2004), principally because it allowed no exceptions or flexibility based on variations in the structure or capabilities at local agency facilities:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The proposal affects management's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that the right to determine internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute includes the authority to determine the policies and practices that are part of an agency's plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property, or operations against internal or external risks. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 581. Where the agency shows a link, or reasonable connection, between its objective of securing or safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations and the policy or practice designed to implement that objective, a proposal that "conflicts with" the policy or practice affects management's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 55 FLRA 1174, 1186 (1999) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>). Upon finding such a link, the Authority will not "inquire into the extent of the measures employed to achieve the objective as long as they reasonably relate to the purpose for which the particular security plan or practice is adopted." <span class="Italic">Local 987</span>, 37 FLRA at 200.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute "encompass actions integral to the exercise of the right, including discussion and deliberation on the relevant factors upon which the decision to act is made." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3434</span>, 49 FLRA 382, 387 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Local 3434</span>). Further, the management rights set forth in &#x00A7; 7106 protect an agency's judgments as to the factors that it will take into account in exercising those rights. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 47 FLRA 705, 723-25 (1993) (Authority explained that a proposal dictating factors an agency must consider when evaluating employee performance directly interfered with management's right to direct employees and assign work)<span class="Italic">; AFGE, Local 683</span>, 30 FLRA 497, 499-500 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Local 683</span>) (Authority found management's right to determine its internal security practices extends to the judgments it makes in deciding between various internal security practices.) Therefore, the Authority will not review the merits of the deliberations, discussions and judgments an agency makes in reaching its ultimate determination as how to exercise its right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">AFSCME, Locals 2910 &#x0026; 2477</span>, 49 FLRA 834, 839 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Locals 2910 &#x0026; 2477</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 1920</span>, 47 FLRA 340, 349 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Local 1920</span>)). To do so would involve the <span id="page_980"></span>Authority in reviewing an agency's judgments as to how it exercises its management right to determine internal security practices. For the same reason, the Statute precludes the negotiating process from intruding into an agency's substantive decision-making process pursuant to the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, we find that all of the Agency's duty locations do not have the same level of staffing nor are they under the same level of control by the Agency. Thus, all of its locations are not equally secure. As a result, the Agency has determined that the safest and most secure way to store firearms is by having the employee, who is trained and qualified with the firearm, maintain possession of it while off-duty. The Agency has decided that precluding firearm storage during off-duty periods at locations lacking adequate security for such storage reduces the risk of theft and misuse of firearms which protects Agency employees, property, operations and the public. As the Agency policies and practices at issue in this case relate to the protection of Agency personnel, property and operations, the Agency has established a link between its policies and practices and internal security concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, management's right to determine its internal security policies and practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute includes the right to determine the level of security necessary to protect its personnel, property, and operations and the measures required to achieve that security level. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Local 2050</span>, 36 FLRA 618, 625-27, 652-53 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Local 2050</span>). In this regard, the Agency states that the existing security measures and controls at most of the Agency's duty locations are not sufficient to adequately secure firearms during off-duty hours. That is, in order to protect against theft or misuse of firearms during off-duty hours, implementation of the proposal would require the Agency to establish a level of security at all locations comparable to the security provided at duty locations where off-duty storage is currently allowed. By requiring such actions, the proposal affects management's right to determine its internal security policies and practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1).[7] <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;Recently, the Authority considered a substantially similar proposal which stated that the Agency would ensure that a secure and locked container would be available at all government offices where employees who carried a firearm were assigned. The Authority determined that the proposal in that case, like the proposal here, affected management's right to determine its internal security practices by requiring the Agency to establish a certain level of security at all facilities. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA 749, 753 (2004), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed</span>, No. 04-1157 (D.C. Cir. May 10, 2004) (Member Pope dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's arguments in support of its claim that the proposal does not concern the Agency's internal security policies and practices essentially challenge the efficacy of the Agency's security policy regarding the storage of firearms during off-duty periods. However, as the Authority has consistently made clear, it will not review the alleged lack of effectiveness of an agency's choice of security policy as part of the negotiability determination. <span class="Italic">See Locals 2910 &#x0026; 2477</span>, 49 FLRA at 839; <span class="Italic">Lodge 1-F, </span>51 FLRA at 145. <span class="Italic">See also AFGE, Local 3302</span>, 37 FLRA 350, 355 (1990). For these reasons, we find that the proposal affects management's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The proposal does not constitute a procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that require the adoption of security measures to ensure a specific level of security do not constitute negotiable procedures under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>59 FLRA at 754 (citing<span class="Italic"> NFFE, Local 1482</span>, 44 FLRA 637, 648 (1992))<span class="Italic">; Local 987</span>, 37 FLRA at 202. By requiring the Agency to make changes and adopt measures at all duty locations where the Agency deems security currently insufficient to adequately secure firearms stored during off-duty hours, the proposal in this case does not constitute a procedure within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;The proposal does not constitute an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The test for determining whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) is set out in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under that test, the Authority initially determines whether a proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. An arrangement must seek to mitigate adverse effects "flowing from the exercise of a protected management right." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31. Proposals that address speculative or hypothetical concerns do not constitute arrangements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Local 2015</span>, 53 FLRA 967, 973 (1997). The alleged arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1687</span>, 52 FLRA 521, 523 (1996). If a proposal is an arrangement, the Authority then determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management rights. <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency acknowledges that the proposal would operate as an arrangement by mitigating the adverse effects the Union believes result from the Agency's action of making employees responsible for the security of their authorized firearms during off-duty hours. We agree that the proposal constitutes an arrangement and we find that the proposal addresses concerns that are neither speculative nor hypothetical. Additionally, we find that the proposal is sufficiently tailored to those employees who take their authorized firearms home. However, although the proposal constitutes an arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), we find for the reasons discussed below that the proposal is not an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency has exercised its right to determine its internal security practices by having employees who are trained and qualified to carry firearms maintain possession of their firearms when off-duty. The Union's proposal would preclude the Agency from exercising that right by mandating a change that is inconsistent with the Agency's internal security decision. This proposal would allow employees to leave their firearms at the duty location upon completion of their shift even though the Agency has concluded that Agency personnel, property and operations would be better served if employees maintained possession and access to their firearms when off-duty. As such, the proposal excessively interferes with the exercise of the Agency's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that proposals do not constitute appropriate arrangements where the proposals negate or nullify management's proposed exercise of its &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU, </span>59 FLRA at 755 (a proposal completely precluding the agency from having employees retain possession of their firearms while off-duty found to excessively interfere with management rights)<span class="Italic">; AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, Local 2139</span>, 57 FLRA 292, 294 (2001) (proposal that completely precluded the agency from using language it wished to use in customer service policy excessively interfered with management rights); <span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local 1</span>, 49 FLRA 225, 249 (1994) (<span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>) (proposal that acted as an absolute restriction on the right to assign particular duties to certain employees found to excessively interfere with management's rights); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 28</span>, 47 FLRA 873, 876-80 (1993) (proposal allowing unannounced random spot checks of hand-carried items only where there was reason to believe unauthorized possession or theft occurred found to eliminate the agency's internal security determination and excessively interfere with management rights); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 15</span>, 30 FLRA 1046, 1057-58 (1988) (proposal that completely negated the agency's decision to use random drug testing for purposes of protecting security would reverse the substantive impact of that decision and found to excessively interfere with management rights); <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R7-23</span>, 23 FLRA 753, 759 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Local R7-23</span>) (proposal negating management's exercise of its right to determine internal security found excessive when it reversed the substantive effect of management's action). The Authority reached these conclusions, even where the proposals' benefits to employees were significant, finding that proposals which erode or reverse the substantive effect of a management action taken pursuant to its management rights do not constitute appropriate arrangements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., IFPTE</span>, 49 FLRA at 249; <span class="Italic">Local R7-23, </span>23 FLRA at 759.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the risk of harm to employees and their families from firearms properly stored and secured at home is not taken lightly, the Authority is not in a position, and does not have the ability to second-guess the merits of an agency's determinations about what its internal security practices should be. <span class="Italic">Lodge 1-F</span>, 51 FLRA at 145 and <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Here, the Agency has determined that in order to protect its personnel, property and operations, firearms used by Agency employees in the performance of their duties need to be secured by the employees when they are off-duty. While we find that some employees would benefit from the Union's proposal, the burden on the Agency to secure facilities that are ill-equipped and unsuitable for off-duty storage of firearms is impractical and outweighs the benefits to employees. Thus, the proposal excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The fact that the Agency provides overnight firearms storage facilities at some locations also constitutes a determination by management that security at those locations is safe and effective--itself an exercise of the right to determine internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we conclude that by precluding the Agency from having employees retain possession of their firearms while off-duty, the Union's proposal imposes a burden upon the Agency's exercise of its management right to determine its internal security practices that outweighs the benefits provided to some unit employees. <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>59 FLRA <span id="page_981"></span>at 755;<span class="Italic"> AFGE, Nat'l Veterans Admin. Council</span>, 40 FLRA 1052, 1056 (1991) (a proposal that precludes an agency from exercising a management right inherently cannot constitute an appropriate arrangement); <span class="Italic">see also,</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1164</span>, 55 FLRA 999, 1004 (1999); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1917</span>, 55 FLRA 228, 235 (1999). Therefore, the proposal does not constitute an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While one might argue that the Agency is not precluded from exercising its management right in some other way, we note that the effect of such a proposal would be to permit an exclusive representative to bargain over an agency's substantive exercise of its management rights, a conclusion explained <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The Authority has made clear that Congress did not empower agencies to bargain away their authority to make decisions regarding the exercise of their management rights. <span class="Italic">Great Lakes Program Serv. Ctr., Soc. Sec. Admin., Dep't of Health and Human Servs., Chicago, Ill.</span>, 9 FLRA 499, 510-11 (1982). To hold otherwise would permit the same type of improper outcome discussed by the court in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>, 702 F.2d 1183, 1188 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (a union does not have the ability, through impact and implementation bargaining, to undo or negate an agency's substantive exercise of its &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain because it excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. In view of this result, there is no need to address the Agency's argument regarding the interference the proposal places upon its right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 60 FLRA 367, 373-74 (2004), also considered nonnegotiable Provision 11, allowing officers who carry their weapons to and from their residences to make reasonable diversions and stops along the way. The proposal was contrary to agency policies governing transportation of weapons.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 437 F.3d 1248, 1250-56 (D.C. Cir. 2006), again reviewed and again remanded FLRA's negotiability determinations regarding the weapons proposals. FLRA did not sufficiently explain the evidence of record or its analysis of that evidence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Treasury Employees Union represents U.S. Customs Service employees who have been carrying firearms as part of their duties for many years. According to undisputed facts recited in the Authority's Opinion, these employees are located in approximately 300 locations, only some of which have facilities for on-site storage of Agency-issued firearms during non-duty work hours. The Union identified approximately ten locations currently permitting such storage. Hence, at most locations Agency employees carrying firearms must travel directly from work to home and store their firearms overnight at home under secure conditions with an Agency provided safety lock, unless they are covered by the 24-hour carry policy for Office of Field Operations Personnel promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The 24-hour carry policy, dated March 3, 2000, provides that eligible Agency employees may carry their service-issued firearms twenty-four hours a day, provided they "significantly modif[y]" their behavior while armed. Such behavioral modifications and restrictions include refraining from the consumption of alcoholic beverages, limiting use of the firearm and concealing the firearm when the employee is not in uniform. The policy emphasizes that authority to carry a firearm "presents a tremendous responsibility and has potential for significant liabilities to the individual officer, as well as the Customs Service." Eligible employees who elect to be covered by the 24-hour carry policy and to be bound by its terms are not required to travel directly between home and work while carrying their Agency-issued firearms. Under the guidelines contained in the Agency's handbook on firearms, employees must maintain current credentials in order to carry a firearm, and the handbook lists the types of conduct that could result in the loss of credentials "based on a nexus between these actions and a threat to the safety of the employee or others." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service, Firearms and Use of Force Handbook</span> (July 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By the terms of the 24-hour carry policy dated December 28, 2000, all employees authorized to carry firearms in the performance of their official duties "are personally responsible for the security of all firearms to prevent unauthorized use, unintentional discharge, and theft," and specific requirements are set on how firearms not in the employee's immediate control are to be secured. The Union sought to bargain over implementation of the changes in the 24-hour carry policy and made a number of proposals, two of which are at issue here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Union proposed that employees who carry their weapons to and from their residences be permitted "to make <span class="Italic">reasonable diversions and stops</span> between their residence and work. These diversions and stops will be defined as those that any ordinary citizen would make before and after work," Proposal 11 (emphasis added). Examples of "reasonable diversions and stops" on which the Union sought to bargain included shopping at a supermarket, stopping for gas, or attending a child's after-school soccer match. The Union claimed that the proposal would mitigate the burden of the current policy, which restricts employees' freedom of movement without monetary compensation, reduces employees' non-duty hours, and increases the effort and expenses associated with the extra travel necessitated by the policy. The Agency advised the Authority that Proposal 11 interfered with management's right to determine its internal security practices, including the right to determine those policies and actions that will safeguard its personnel and physical property, and that employees with 24-hour carry authority who have completed firearms training are automatically eligible for that authority and were free to make reasonable diversions and stops. Because, in the Agency's view, the proposal applied only to employees who elected to carry personally-owned firearms and the Agency no longer permitted such carriage, the proposal was moot.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority rejected the notion that Proposal 11 was moot, but concluded that Proposal 11 excessively interfered with management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) and thus was not within the Agency's duty to bargain under section 7106(b)(2). The Authority stated that the Agency had determined that, in order to safeguard its personnel, the public, and physical property, employees not covered by the 24-hour carry policy should be required to carry their firearms directly from work to home during non-duty hours, without stops, until their firearms could be secured. The Authority found that although Proposal 11 was an "arrangement sufficiently tailored to aid those employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right, as it would benefit only those employees who either fail training or refuse to sign the 24-hour carry certificate," <span class="Italic">Opinion</span> at **11, it was not an "appropriate arrangement," <span class="Italic">id.</span> The Authority reasoned that the "minimal benefit" to be gained by such employees who cannot or do not accept the conditions of the 24-hour carry policy "is more than outweighed by the Agency's interest in protecting the public from the danger posed by employees carrying firearms, especially if those employees are not operating under the restrictions concerning conduct provided for in the 24-hour carry policy." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Union proposed that internal investigations upon suspension or rescission of an employee's authority to carry a firearm be conducted expeditiously. The Union made several proposals regarding suspension or rescission, including prompt notice to the employee of the reasons for the disciplinary action, with an opportunity to respond promptly and to appeal, and the Union's right to file a grievance, but only one is at issue on appeal. The Union proposed that "[i]n the event that [the Agency] takes an officer's firearm pending an internal investigation, it will conduct an <span class="Italic">expeditious investigation on a priority basis.</span>" Proposal 14(f) (first sentence) (emphasis added). In the absence of such language, the Union told the Authority, it "cannot show arbitrators any [contract] language which obligates the Agency to take <span class="Italic">any</span> action within <span class="Italic">any</span> time frames once it has removed firearm carriage authority," and that the Agency "has no incentive, and before an arbitrator it will argue it has no obligation, to conduct its investigations in an expeditious manner, and as a result its firearms investigations will continue in the same desultory manner that has been the case for years." The Union explained that the proposal would not prevent the Agency from taking the time necessary to conduct a thorough investigation, but it would reduce the amount of time between the initial denial, revocation, or suspension of firearm carry authority and thus benefit the employee whose authority is ultimately reinstated. The Agency advised the Authority that Proposal 14(f) (first sentence) would require it to make a decision based on set time frames rather than on investigative facts and thus without full knowledge of the circumstances. The Agency also claimed that the proposal would interfere with management's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority concluded, with one Member dissenting, that to the extent that Proposal 14(f) (first sentence) would require the Agency to conduct an expeditious investigation on a priority basis, the intrusion of the proposal into management's right to determine its internal security practices outweighed the benefits it would provide some employees and therefore was not an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3). The Authority construed the Union's proposal to "require the Agency to give investigations related to firearms carriage authority greater priority than any other investigations it conducts in the course of accomplishing the Agency's mission no matter how much more time-critical or important those other investigations might be." <span class="Italic">Opinion</span> at **22. It rejected the Agency's position that the proposal would interfere with its ability to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, 404 F.3d at 458, the court remanded the Union's proposal concerning the storage of handguns after the Authority had ruled the proposal excessively interfered with management's rights to determine its internal security practices, because the Authority's determination was not supported by the record before it. The Union contends the same defects exist in the Authority's decision here, particularly as the Authority failed to abide by its precedent requiring it to balance the practical effects of a proposal on management and employee interests. Specifically, the Union contends that the Authority's finding that Proposal 11 was of "minimal benefit" to Agency employees was without explanation <span id="page_982"></span>or record support; that the Authority's finding regarding the Agency's interest in "protecting the public" is without record support and was not an interest asserted by the Agency; and that the Authority's implicit finding that employees not covered by the 24-hour carry policy pose a greater threat to the public than those who elect to be governed by its restrictions is contradicted by the record. Similarly, the Union contends that the Authority's finding that Proposal 14(f) (first sentence) would require the Agency to make investigations of suspended certifications to carry firearms the Agency's top priority is neither based on record evidence nor a burden that was asserted by the Agency. Because the Authority's determinations are not supported by the record, the Union maintains that the Authority did not engage in a proper application of its balancing test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority applies a two-part test, known as "the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> test," to determine whether proposals impinging upon management rights under section 7106(a) should nonetheless be considered negotiable under section 7106(b)(3) as "appropriate arrangements" for adversely affected employees. <span class="Italic">See NTEU I</span>, 404 F.3d at 457; <span class="Italic">NLRB, </span>2 F.3d at 1192, <span class="Italic">citing Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Employees Local R14-87</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. 24 (1986) ("<span class="Italic">Kansas Army National Guard</span>" or "<span class="Italic">KANG</span>"). Under the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> test, the Authority first examines the record to determine whether a proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. at 31. The burden is on the Union to explain how employees will be detrimentally affected by management's action and how the proposal for bargaining is intended to address or compensate for such effect. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Under the second step, the Authority must evaluate whether an "arrangement" "is inappropriate because it excessively interferes" with the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This requires the Authority to "weigh[ ] the practical needs of employees and managers," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 31-32, and involves an "open ended balancing analysis that may include consideration of such factors as 'the nature and extent of the impact experienced by the adversely affected employees' and 'the nature and extent of the impact on management's ability to deliberate and act pursuant to its statutory rights,'" <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 2 F.3d at 1193, <span class="Italic">citing KANG</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. at 31-32.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, the court held that the Authority erred in applying the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> test to determine that a proposal did not constitute an "appropriate arrangement" subject to bargaining under section 7106(b)(3) because the record before the Authority did not support its description of the Agency's security policy. <span class="Italic">See NTEU I</span>, 404 F.3d at 457-58. The Authority had concluded that a proposal on the storage of firearms would preclude the Agency from exercising its right to determine its internal security practices, notwithstanding the fact that the record established that in many locations the Agency had permitted on-site storage of firearms for off-duty employees and even provided facilities for such storage. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 458. The court declared:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">On the record before it and this [c]ourt, the Authority has not established that the proposal would "negate and nullify" the [A]gency's right to implement the practice it followed at the time the Union made the proposal. The most the proposal would require is the institution at other facilities of a method of carrying out [A]gency internal security policies already in place at some locations. Whether this constitutes an appropriate arrangement is a question for the Authority to answer but it must do so on findings based on the record before it, and by a process consistent with its own precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly here, the Authority found both Union proposals were arrangements within the internal security exception of section 7106(a)(1), but the Authority's determinations that the proposals were not appropriate arrangements is not supported by findings based on the record before it. The Authority reasoned that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Proposal 11 would require the Agency to permit employees who cannot or do not accept the conditions required for 24-hour carry authority to make stops between their work site and their residence, while in possession of their authorized firearm. This <span class="Italic">minimal benefit</span> is more than outweighed by the Agency's interest in <span class="Italic">protecting the public</span> from the danger posed by employees carrying firearms, especially if those employees are not operating under the restrictions concerning conduct provided for in the 24-hour carry policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Opinion</span> at **14 (emphasis added). The Authority offers no explanation or basis in the record for its conclusion that the benefit to the officers in being permitted to make the "reasonable diversions and stops" would be "minimal." Neither does the Authority explain its conclusion that this "minimal benefit" was "more than outweighed by the Agency's interest in protecting the public from the dangers posed by employees carrying firearms, especially if those employees are not operating under the restrictions concerning conduct provided for in the 24-hour carry policy." In purporting to describe the Agency's safety policy, the Authority pointed to nothing in the record to indicate that the Agency, in fact, has an internal security policy based on protecting the public from the greater danger posed by employees carrying firearms who are not bound by the 24-hour carry restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority maintains on appeal that the restrictions in the 24-hour carry policy and the Agency handbook "are reasonably understood as objective evidence of [the Agency]'s public safety concern over the carriage of firearms by employees who are off-duty." "Firearms are dangerous, and extraordinary dangers sometimes justify unusual precautions." <span class="Italic">Florida v. J.L.</span>, 529 U.S. 266, 272 (2000). The question posed by the Union's proposal, however, is whether there is any material difference between the conditions under which employees who volunteer for the 24-hour carry policy carry firearms and the conditions under which other authorized employees carry firearms. The Union contends there are no material differences. The Authority also maintains that Proposal 11 would have nullified certain safety-oriented restrictions on employee carriage of firearms off duty. Maybe so, but the Authority did not identify those restrictions in its Opinion, much less balance the practical effect of any differences against the employee benefits, which the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> test requires. Finally, the Authority maintains that it was reasonable for it to recognize that the Agency has an interest in safeguarding the public as part of management's right to determine its internal security practices. Even so, this leaves open the question presented by Proposal 11. The Agency did not identify any specific safety concern to explain why employees who did not have 24-hour carry authority could not be granted some of the leeway in carrying firearms off duty that the 24-hour policy affords. Moreover, the Agency's reason for refusing to bargain over this proposal was that after completion of training all employees are automatically eligible for 24-hour carry authority. This lends some support for the Union's position that employees who do not have 24-hour carry authority do not pose any greater danger to public safety and, therefore, should not be bound by greater firearm carriage restrictions than those employees covered by the 24-hour carry policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union expressed concern that the internal security policy as stated by the Authority in its Opinion, and not advanced by the Agency, is so broad as to render any Union proposal involving firearms non-negotiable, rather than reflecting an actual <span class="Italic">KANG</span> balancing of competing needs, which would give meaning to section 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See Am. Fed of Gov't Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>, 702 F.2d 1183, 1186-87 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The problem is not one of overbreadth but rather the Authority's dismissal without explanation of any counter-balancing benefit to employees under Proposal 11. The Authority may be of the opinion that no employee interest could outweigh the Agency's interest in controlling and restricting the use of firearms. It nonetheless remains incumbent on the Authority in considering Proposal 11 to examine the record to determine the relevant differences, if any, between restrictions for employees who are and who are not subject to the 24-hour carry policy, to identify the significance of any differences, to weigh the practical effects of such differences on the competing interests under the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> test, and to set forth its reasoning and the principles underlying its ultimate determination. <span class="Italic">See NTEU I</span>, 404 F.3d at 458. The Authority has not yet done this.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for Proposal 14(f) (first sentence), the Authority reasoned that expedited investigation related to firearm carriage authority would come at the expense of all other pending internal security investigations, and that this "intrusion upon the Agency's right to decide which investigative work is most important to the accomplishment of the Agency's operations outweighs the benefits." <span class="Italic">Opinion</span> at **22. The opinion of the dissenting Member, who characterized the expeditious investigation provision of Proposal 14(f) as "a significant benefit for employees," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at **34 (Member Pope, dissenting in part and concurring in part), highlights the problems with the Authority's determination. First, the Agency had failed to explain how expediting a relatively small number of cases would intrude on its management right. The dissenting opinion noted that the Agency had cited a survey showing the proposal would apply to only 55 out of 8,000 employees who have had their firearms authority removed for other than medical or qualifications reasons. Second, the Agency did not dispute the Union's claim that employees are unable to perform important aspects of their job when firearm carry permission is withdrawn. Third, the Agency never asserted that proposal caused the burden that the Authority found. Fourth, the Agency's claim that the proposal would require it to conclude investigations prematurely was not only "inconsistent with the wording of the proposal [but] expressly disavowed by the Union." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at **34.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Authority points to the Union's statement that its proposal called for firearm-authority investigations to be given priority in relation to other Agency investigations. This still is not the same as a proposal calling for top priority over all other Agency investigations. The Union's statement, viewed in context, was that its proposal was designed to provide employees with an expected time frame for completion of the <span id="page_983"></span>internal investigation and some incentive for the Agency to conduct investigations more expeditiously. The Union submitted evidence that employees could not find out when their investigations might be completed and that investigations, despite Union inquiry, could linger for several years for no apparent reason, to the detriment of employee loyalty, motivation, and ability to earn overtime pay. The Union noted that the situation was exacerbated by the fact that the Agency was understaffed. Because the Authority's determination that Proposal 14(f) (first sentence) is not an appropriate arrangement is based on findings that are unsupported by the record and, in fact, appears to be contradicted by it and the Authority failed to engage in a proper <span class="Italic">KANG</span> balancing, we reverse the nonnegotiability determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we grant the petition, remanding Proposal 11 to the Authority to clarify its rationale and reversing the Authority's determination that Proposal 14(f) (first sentence) is not an appropriate arrangement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent">The case returned to FLRA. The result was that the weapons locker proposal was negotiable, based in part on the rational explanation of the benefits of the proposal from the union and based in part on lack of evidence for some of the agency objections to the proposal. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 62 FLRA 321, 321-26 (2007), brought the weapons locker negotiability controversy to a close:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is before the Authority on remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 404 F.3d 454 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (<span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>) (reviewing <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>,<span class="Italic"> </span>59 FLRA 749 (2004) (<span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>) (Member Pope dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court remanded the case to the Authority to determine whether the proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute). For the reasons that follow, we find that the proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement because it does not excessively interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. Moreover, we find that the proposal does not affect the Agency's right to assign work or to determine the technology, methods, or means by which work is performed. Accordingly, we find that the proposal is within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Proposal</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Customs will ensure that either a lockbox or other secure and locked container such as a safe, file cabinet, or desk is available at all government offices where armed employees work or are assigned. Routine overnight storage of a firearm in a government office is permitted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;The Authority's Decision in NTEU I and the Court's Decision in NTEU II</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, the Authority determined that the Union's proposal affected the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a). Further, the Authority found that the proposal did not constitute a procedure pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute because the proposal required adoption of security measures to ensure a specific level of security. Moreover, the Authority determined that the proposal did not constitute an appropriate arrangement because the proposal would preclude the Agency from requiring employees to maintain possession of and access to their weapons while off duty. Additionally, the Authority concluded that the proposal did not constitute an appropriate arrangement pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute "[b]ecause this proposal would mandate that the Agency undertake actions to provide such security even at locations that are not under its control[.]" <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, 59 FLRA at 754. Accordingly, the Authority determined that the "Union's proposal imposes a burden upon the Agency's exercise of its management right to determine internal security practices that outweighs the benefits provided to some unit employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 755.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its decision, the court upheld the Authority's determination that the proposal affected the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices and that it did not constitute a procedure. <span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>, 404 F.3d at 456-57. Moreover, the court left undisturbed the Authority's conclusions that the proposal could not be severed; constituted an arrangement; and that it was sufficiently tailored. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, 59 FLRA at 753, 754. However, the court ultimately determined that the Authority did not sufficiently support its conclusion that the proposal excessively interfered with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. It specifically noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">On the record before [it] [the Authority] and this Court, the Authority has not established that the proposal would `negate or nullify' the agency's right to implement the practice it followed at the time the Union made the proposal. The most the proposal would require is the institution at other facilities of a method of carrying out agency internal security policies already in place at some locations. Whether this constitutes an appropriate arrangement is a question for the Authority to answer in the first instance, but it must do so on findings based on the record before it, and by a process consistent with its own precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>, 404 F.3d at 458.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the court remanded the matter to the Authority for review consistent with the court's instruction set forth above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">VI.&#x2003;Meaning of the Proposal</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth in <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, 59 FLRA at 752-53, the proposal would permit the overnight storage of Agency-authorized firearms in a lock box or other secure storage container at all Agency offices where armed employees work or are assigned. Further, the proposal: (1) affords the Agency discretion to determine the type of container provided, as long as it complies with the standard of security set forth in the proposal; (2) by using the term "overnight," allows employees to store their firearms in the secure container during off-duty hours and on weekends; (3) permits employees working a midnight to morning shift to store their firearms during the day; and (4) by referencing "government offices," applies wherever bargaining unit employees regularly work. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The parties also agreed that the proposal allows employees to retrieve their firearms during off-duty hours. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In this regard, "the Union explained further that `employees who choose to store their firearms during their non-work hours would most likely leave their firearms in the container until they resumed duty status.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">VII.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The proposal is an appropriate arrangement</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, 59 FLRA at 753-54, the Authority determined that the proposal affects management's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute and that the proposal does not constitute a procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. As noted above, the court affirmed the determinations of the Authority on both of these issues. <span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>, 404 F.3d at 457. However, the court found that the Authority had not explained whether the proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement based upon the record before the Authority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 458.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority applies the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under that test, the Authority initially determines whether a proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31. An arrangement must seek to mitigate adverse effects "flowing from the exercise of a protected management right." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The alleged arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Local 2015</span>, 53 FLRA 967, 973 (1997). If a proposal is determined to be an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management right. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, the court did not disturb the Authority's finding that the proposal constitutes an arrangement that is sufficiently tailored. <span class="Italic">See NTEU I</span>, 59 FLRA at 754. Accordingly, the Authority must determine whether the proposal is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying the excessive interference test, we first note that the Agency initially argued that as part of its internal security determinations "Customs policy and practice have never authorized routine overnight storage of issued firearms in employees' work locations." However, in its reply, the Agency conceded that it "does allow routing overnight storage in certain locations where appropriate storage is available." Accordingly, the Authority will resolve the remaining issue consistent with the court's statement that "[t]he most the proposal would require is the institution at other facilities of a method of carrying out agency internal security policies already in place at some locations." <span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>, 404 F.3d at 458.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency describes its internal security policy as a policy that will not permit routine overnight storage of firearms "at locations with inappropriate storage facilities[.]" The Agency also makes the following general claims concerning the burdens the proposal would place upon that Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. It argues that: (1) it would cost too much to secure these facilities; (2) some facilities are not under Customs' control; (3) some facilities are unguarded during off-duty hours; (4) storing firearms at facilities, especially where seized evidence such as narcotics is also stored, could increase the potential for theft; and (5) a facility, even one under the Agency's control, may not have sufficient security to provide overnight storage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's argument, the proposal itself only requires storage of firearms in a "lockbox or other secure and locked container[.]" It does not, as the Agency argues, require storage of firearms in unsuitable <span id="page_984"></span>containers. As such, the Agency has not substantiated its claim that the proposal would require it to allow storage in "inappropriate storage facilities," and, thus, that argument is inapposite because the proposal allows storage only in containers the Agency deems secure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Agency argues generally that many of its locations cannot be secured because of cost. However, the Agency does not provide information on the costs of securing these locations and the Agency does not argue that the proposal affects its right to determine its budget under &#x00A7; 7106(a). As we stated in <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1904</span>, 57 FLRA 28, 30 n.5 (2001), in a similar appropriate arrangement context, "when considering cost arguments in contexts other than management's budget right under section 7106(a)(1),...an agency is not exempt from the obligation to bargain over a union proposal solely because th[e] proposal may result in some increase in cost."<span class="Italic"> Id., </span>citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1122</span>, 47 FLRA 272, 283 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Local 1122</span>). <span class="Italic">See also United States Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., Washington, D.C</span>., 55 FLRA 322, 326-27 (1999) (agency may not establish that its right to determine its budget is affected by a bare assertion). Accordingly, we reject the Agency's reliance upon the costs of securing certain of its locations to demonstrate the burden the proposal would place on the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Agency's second and third arguments, the record shows, as set forth above, that the Agency already allows the overnight storage of firearms in some of its facilities, and it does not dispute that these facilities include airports that are not under Agency control and certain ports and airports that are not manned on a 24-hour basis. Accordingly, because the Agency provides secure overnight storage for employee firearms at facilities that are not under Agency control or manned on a 24-hour basis, we find that the Agency has failed to explain how the proposal would significantly burden the exercise of its right to determine its internal security in those circumstances. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU</span>, 61 FLRA 48, 51 (2005) (an agency has the burden of articulating why it cannot allow a particular agency-approved security policy at other locations.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, as to its fourth argument, the Agency has not explained why it would be a burden to provide appropriate security if stored firearms were placed in Agency-approved lockboxes co-located near seized narcotics. In this regard, the Agency has provided no evidence that it has experienced security problems in areas where seized narcotics are stored. <span class="Italic">Cf. NFFE, Local 2050</span>, 36 FLRA 618, 628, 653-54 (1990) (union provided evidence as to thefts from and assaults on employees in and around agency building to substantiate claim that proposed arrangement affecting the agency's right to determine internal security practices was appropriate). With respect its fifth argument, the Agency does not explain why it would be unable to provide sufficient security at its facilities to accommodate overnight storage of firearms other than by asserting that to do so would be costly, an argument that we have previously rejected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Agency has not established that the proposal would constitute a significant burden on its right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, the Union relies on various benefits to employees from allowing overnight storage of firearms. Specifically, it asserts that such storage would: (1) reduce the risk of civil/criminal liability and disciplinary action; (2) allow greater freedom of movement for employees; (3) reduce the increase in travel costs that results from having to first go straight from work to home before engaging in other activities once the employee has secured the firearm at home; (4) reduce the possibility of public assault from a criminal trying to obtain a firearm; (5) allow employees to engage in activities after work without any modification in their behavior under the Agency's 24-hour carry policy; and (6) reduce the possibility of accidental shootings or theft of the weapon that might otherwise occur in the home. Consistent with these Union arguments, the Authority found in <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, that the proposal would benefit employees because they would have the discretion to leave firearms at work rather than bringing them into their homes, thus avoiding any inherent risks associated with having those firearms in the home. <span class="Italic">See NTEU I</span>, 59 FLRA at 755. Although this risk may, as the Agency argues, be partially offset by the use of gun locks and placing the weapon in secure storage at home, we find, as the Authority did in <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, that because there is still an inherent risk associated with having weapons stored in the home, the employees would benefit under the proposal by having the discretion to leave their firearms in secure storage at work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, under the terms of the proposal, employees could choose to leave their firearms in secure storage at work rather than carry their firearms to or from work. In this respect, the Agency requires employees carrying their firearms in public to exercise the "highest degree of care against theft or loss," and notes the risk of "significant liabilit[y] to the individual officer" that would require an officer to significantly modify his or her behavior while armed. SOP at 3; <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, 59 FLRA at 756. Accordingly, the proposal would benefit employees by allowing them to choose not to assume the risks associated with carrying a firearm while off-duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In weighing the benefits to employees against the burdens placed upon the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices, we find that the record establishes significant benefits to employees from the proposal, including the discretion to eliminate the risks associated with storing firearms in the home and carrying firearms while off-duty. In contrast, the Agency has failed to support its claims that the proposal creates a significant burden upon the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Local 1122</span>, 47 FLRA at 283 (parties act at their own peril if they fail to support their claims as to a proposal's benefits to employees or the burdens the proposal places on an agency.) As such, we hold that the proposal does not excessively interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The proposal does not affect the Agency's right to assign work</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_985"></span>The Authority has long held that management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute includes the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom or what position the duties will be assigned. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees Org.</span>, 37 FLRA 392, 399 (1990); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 85</span>, 32 FLRA 210, 216 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the proposal directly addresses only the manner in which the Agency will store employee firearms during non-work periods. It does determine when, where, whether, or how the Agency will assign work. In this respect, the proposal is silent as to whether employees would retrieve their firearms prior to an overtime assignment, for example, or whether employees would retrieve them at the beginning of such an assignment. Any delay involved would result not from the proposal, but from the amount of notice provided the employee by the Agency. The proposal thus does not affect management's right to assign work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also AFGE, Local 1698</span>, 38 FLRA 1016, 1023 (1990) (only proposals that directly and integrally go to the specified right are barred from negotiation; proposals that indirectly affect a right are not precluded); <span class="Italic">POPA</span>, 47 FLRA 10, 46 (1993). Accordingly, as the proposal does not affect the Agency's right to assign work, we reject the Agency's claim that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain on this ground.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The proposal does not affect the Agency's right to determine the technology, methods, and means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, pursuant to <span class="Italic">AFGE, HUD Council of Locals 222, Local 2910</span>, 54 FLRA 171, 178-79 (1998), it is necessary to consider whether the proposal constitutes a matter over which the Agency may elect to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. Although neither the Statute nor the legislative history define "technology...of performing work," the Authority has defined the phrase as "the technical method that will be used in accomplishing or furthering the performance of the [a]gency's work." <span class="Italic">AFSCME, AFL-CIO, Local 2477</span>, 7 FLRA 578, 582-83 (1982). Further, the Authority has construed the term "method" to refer to "the way in which an agency performs its work." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1920</span>, 47 FLRA 340, 343 (1993). The Authority has defined the term "means" to refer to "any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or [the] furtherance of the performance of its work." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The legislative history of the Statute indicates that the term "methods" was intended to mean "how" work is performed; the term "means" was intended to mean "with what." <span class="Italic">See Legislative History of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978</span>, U.S.C.C.A.N. 2830, 2831; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, 54 FLRA 1582, 1590 n.6 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, as the Union points out, the Agency has already exercised its discretion under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) to require a lockbox or a secure alternative for employee storage of their firearms while on-duty. The Union seeks to negotiate over only the scope of the use of such storage. Thus, rather than negotiating over the technology, methods, or means of performing the Agency's work, as claimed by the Agency, the proposal merely involves bargaining over the implementation of the Agency's choice of a particular technology, method, or means, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, a lockbox or other secure storage. <span class="Italic">Cf. Local 1917</span>, 4 FLRA at 154. As such, the proposal does not affect the Agency's right to determine the technology, methods, and means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Alternatively, assuming that the proposal affected the Agency's right to determine the technology, methods, or means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), we would find that the proposal was nevertheless negotiable because it constituted an appropriate arrangement, consistent with our previous analysis.</p>
