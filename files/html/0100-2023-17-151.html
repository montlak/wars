<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-149"><span class="space">E.</span> DENIAL OF FAIR HEARING</h3>
<p class="noindent">FLRA follows decisions of federal courts requiring arbitrators to grant parties a fundamentally fair hearing that provides adequate notice, a hearing on the evidence, and an impartial decision. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Boston Region and AFGE Local 3760</span>, 48 FLRA 1414, 1419 (1994); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and POPA</span>, 60 FLRA 869, 879 (2005) ("Arbitrators are required only to grant parties a fundamentally fair hearing, which provides adequate notice, a hearing on the evidence, and an impartial decision by the arbitrator."). The exception based on the lack of a fair hearing is distinct from an exception based on bias. FLRA will not imply an exception for the former based on the latter ground. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 2052 and Bureau of Prisons, FCC, Petersburg</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-13.html">73 FLRA 59</a> (2022) (Chairman DuBester concurring) (compare footnote comments of FLRA members and concurrence of the Chairman).</p>
<p class="noindent">"The Authority will find an award deficient because the arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing when it is established that an arbitrator's refusal to hear or consider pertinent and material evidence, or other actions in conducting the proceeding, prejudiced a party so as to affect the fairness of the proceeding as a whole." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1869 and Dept. of Air Force, Charleston AFB</span>, 50 FLRA 172, 174 (1995); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1617 and Dept. of Air Force, Kelly AFB</span>, 51 FLRA 1645, 1647 (1996) (restating rule concerning fairness of proceeding). An arbitration award is deficient if the arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing, e.g., by refusing to hear pertinent and material evidence, <span class="Italic">HCFA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 26 FLRA 860, 863 (1987), <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Birmingham and AFGE Local 2206</span>, 35 FLRA 830, 833 (1990), or by denying a party an opportunity adequately to present its case. <span class="Italic">OPM, Cent. Office and AFGE Local 32</span>, 44 FLRA 287, 291 (1992). According to <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2338 and VAMC Poplar Bluff</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-226.html">71 FLRA 1185</a>, 1187 (2020) (Member Abbott concurring) (recon. den., <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2338 and VAMC Poplar Bluff</span>, 72 FLRA 176 (2021) (Member Abbott dissenting)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Authority will find an award deficient on the ground that an arbitrator failed to provide a fair hearing where a party demonstrates that the arbitrator refused to hear or consider pertinent and material evidence, or that other actions in conducting the proceeding so prejudiced a party as to affect the fairness of the proceeding as a whole.[31] It is well established that an arbitrator has considerable latitude in conducting a hearing and an arbitrator's limitation on the submission of evidence does not, by itself, demonstrate that the arbitrator failed to provide a fair hearing.[32]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[31]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1668</span>, 50 FLRA 124, 126 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[32]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFGE, Council of Prison Locals, Local 3828</span>, 66 FLRA 504, 505 (2012) (<span class="Italic">Local 3828</span>) (denying fair-hearing exception where arbitrator limited consideration of evidence to particular time period, but did not prevent union from submitting relevant evidence); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office, Arlington, Va</span>., 60 FLRA 869, 879 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator is not required to reopen the record and hold a hearing only because FLRA remanded a case for determination or redetermination of an issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VA Johnson Med. Ctr. and NAGE Local R5-136</span>, 57 FLRA 72, 74 (2001). The arbitrator's refusal to decide a collateral dispute over official time did not deprive the union of a fair hearing, although the union apparently argued that the lack of resolution of the dispute adverse implicated the union's ability to proceed with the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 171 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's assertions challenge the Arbitrator's evaluation of the <span id="page_1924"></span>evidence and testimony and the weight to accord them. The Authority has long held that disagreement with an arbitrator's findings of fact and evaluation of the evidence and testimony, including the credibility of witnesses and the weight given their testimony, provides no basis for finding an award deficient. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3627</span>, 64 FLRA at 551; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 900</span>, 63 FLRA at 540.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will find an award deficient on the ground that an arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing when it is demonstrated that the arbitrator refused to hear or consider pertinent and material evidence, or that other actions in conducting the proceeding so prejudiced a party as to affect the fairness of the proceeding as a whole. <span class="Italic">See GSA, Region 9, Los Angeles, Cal</span>., 56 FLRA 978, 979 (2000) (<span class="Italic">GSA</span>) (<span class="Italic">citing AFGE, Local 1668</span>, 50 FLRA 124, 126 (1995)). Further, it is well established that an arbitrator has considerable latitude in conducting a hearing, and the fact that an arbitrator conducts a hearing in a manner that a party finds objectionable does not, by itself, provide a basis for finding an award deficient. <span class="Italic">See GSA</span>, 56 FLRA at 979 (<span class="Italic">citing AFGE, Local 22</span>, 51 FLRA 1496, 1497-98 (1996)); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Defense, Defense Mapping Agency, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr</span>., 44 FLRA 103, 108-09 (1992). Finally, federal courts have held that arbitrators are required only to grant parties a fundamentally fair hearing which provides adequate notice, a hearing on the evidence, and an impartial decision by the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 109.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims it was denied a fair hearing when the Arbitrator asked questions, urged the Union to proceed with its presentation, and asked whether certain testimony was already in the record.[5] In conducting a hearing, nothing prevents an arbitrator from asking questions, avoiding repetitious testimony, or suggesting that the proceeding progress expeditiously. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Homeland Security, Customs &#x0026; Border Prot. Agency, New York, N.Y</span>., 60 FLRA 813, 817 (2005) (Authority found arbitrator did not fail to conduct fair hearing when a witness was not allowed to testify, but where another witness had testified on same matter). As arbitrators have considerable latitude in conducting arbitration hearings and there has been no showing that the Arbitrator's conduct of the hearing was improper or prejudiced the Union, we deny the exception. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3495</span>, 60 FLRA 509, 512 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Absent extraordinary circumstances, issues involving arbitrator conduct at the hearing should be raised at the hearing. When they could have been, but were not raised before the arbitrator, such issues will not be considered for the first time on review of an award unless extraordinary circumstances are present. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bremerton Metal Trades Council</span>, 59 FLRA 583, 588 (2004). It is clear from the record that the Union raised these matters to the Arbitrator at the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Union's exception challenges the Arbitrator's determination regarding the relevance of the evidence. As a general matter, such arguments do not provide a basis for finding an award deficient. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1858</span>, 59 FLRA 90, 92 (2003) (<span class="Italic">citing United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Ralph H.

<p class="noindent">An arbitrator's decision to grant an agency motion seeking dismissal of a grievance for lack of prosecution did not support an exception based on alleged denial of a fair hearing, <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1804 and DHUD</span>, 66 FLRA 700, 702-03 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the Arbitrator denied it a fair hearing.&#x2003;An award will be found deficient on the ground that the Arbitrator failed to provide a fair hearing when the excepting party establishes that an arbitrator's refusal to hear or consider pertinent and material evidence, or other actions in conducting the proceeding, prejudiced a party so as to affect the fairness of the proceeding as a whole. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Local 1668, </span>50 FLRA 124, 126 (1995). However, an arbitrator has considerable latitude in the conduct of a hearing, and the fact that an arbitrator conducted a hearing in a manner that a party finds objectionable does not in and of itself provide a basis for finding an award deficient. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of Def., Def. Mapping Agency, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr., </span>44 FLRA 103, 108-09 (1992). Further, federal courts have held that arbitrators are required only to grant parties a fundamentally fair hearing which provides adequate notice, a hearing on the evidence, and an impartial decision by the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 109.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's assertion that the Arbitrator failed to provide it with a fair hearing is without merit. Specifically, the Union argues that the Arbitrator did not allow it to have a hearing. However, the record demonstrates that the Arbitrator provided the Union with three weeks of hearings to present its case. The Union chose not to take advantage of this opportunity. In this regard, the Union cancelled two weeks of scheduled hearings. Moreover, the Arbitrator noted that, during the second week of scheduled hearings, the Union only "went through the motions" and accomplished very little. <span class="Italic">See also Wachovia Sec., LLC v. Brand, </span>671 F.3d 472, 480 (4th Cir. 2012) (taking into consideration that the plaintiff rather than the arbitrators "cut short the hearing on the issue of attorneys' fees" in finding that the arbitrators provided a fair hearing).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, the Union asserts that it was unaware that the Arbitrator would dismiss the grievance if it did not schedule additional hearings. As an initial matter, during the second week of hearings, the Arbitrator expressed to the Union his dissatisfaction with the slow pace of the proceedings. Moreover, the record demonstrates that the Union was on notice that the grievance could be dismissed for want of prosecution when the Agency filed its motion. <span class="Italic">See </span>Exceptions at 5 (acknowledging that it was aware of the Agency's motion asserting that the Arbitrator should dismiss the grievance for want of prosecution). Further, the Arbitrator also gave the Union the opportunity to file a brief to contest the Agency's motion to dismiss. <span class="Italic">See also U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Griffiss Air Force Base, Rome, N.Y.</span>, 36 FLRA 338, 341, 342-43 (1990) (rejecting the Union's contention that it was unaware that it had to rebut certain testimony given off-the-record and that, as a result, it was denied a fair hearing when, among other things, the Arbitrator permitted the parties to file post-hearing briefs).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, although the Union argues that, "in light of the many outstanding issues, it did not [b]elieve it was appropriate to conduct additional hearings," the Union has not shown that the Arbitrator improperly refused to delay the proceedings. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Serv., Soc. Sec. Admin., Balt., Md., </span>37 FLRA 766, 773 (1990) (finding that the mere fact that an arbitrator did not grant a postponement of the hearing does not demonstrate that the arbitrator conducted the hearing unfairly). In this regard, the Arbitrator concluded it was inappropriate to delay the proceedings until the Authority issued its decision concerning his prior award. The Arbitrator found that his conclusions with respect to the remaining sectors would not be dependent upon his public housing sector award because such conclusions would be based on the evidence and testimony presented to him concerning those sectors. Moreover, the Arbitrator determined that delaying the proceedings would burden unfairly the remaining parties and the Agency. <span class="Italic">See also El Dorado Sch. Dist. #15 v. Cont'l Cas. Co., </span>247 F.3d 843, 848 (2001) (finding that a determination that "the parties had expended considerable time, effort and money based on the hearing dates" would provide a reasonable basis for an arbitrator's decision not to postpone the hearing).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, the Union has not shown that it was denied a fair hearing. Accordingly, we deny the Union's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2338 and Pershing VAMC</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-47.html">73 FLRA 229</a>, 231 (2022) (fair hearing not denied when arbitrator determined that the union did not take steps needed to comply with contractual requirements for timely scheduling of arbitration hearing: "The Union identifies nothing in &#x00A7; 7121 or Authority precedent that guarantees a hearing on a grievance's merits when a negotiated agreement's procedural requirements have not been satisfied.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Rarely has FLRA determined that a party was denied a fair hearing, although often has the allegation been raised. But in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 39 FLRA 103, 105-08 (1991), the arbitrator refused to consider some of the union's positions on the merits of a grievance challenging a one-day suspension. The arbitrator ruled that he would not consider the arguments because he did not have enough time to do so under the parties' expedited arbitration procedure. FLRA sustained exceptions to the award and sent the case back to the parties for resubmission to an arbitrator of their choice:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will find an award deficient when it is established that the arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing by refusing to consider pertinent and material evidence....&#8197;Although the Authority has recognized this ground, the Authority has never found an arbitration award deficient because the arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing by refusing to consider pertinent and material evidence....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we conclude that under these standards commonly applied by Federal courts in private sector labor relations cases, the award is deficient because the Arbitrator denied the Union a fair hearing. We find that the Arbitrator refused to consider evidence that was pertinent <span id="page_1925"></span>and material to the issue of whether the suspension of the grievant was for just cause. We also find that the refusal prejudiced the right of the Union to fully and completely present its case and affected the fairness of the arbitration. In our view, the prejudicial effect on the fairness of the proceedings is confirmed by the Arbitrator's statement that the Union's position with respect to one of the two issues that he refused to consider appeared to have "enough merit to...warrant serious consideration of it." To have denied the Union the serious consideration its position warranted denied the Union a fair hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, we find no justification for the Arbitrator's refusal to consider these matters. We agree with the Union that the fact that the case would have no precedential value in no manner justified the Arbitrator's refusal to permit the Union to fully present its position that the suspension was not for just cause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Arbitrator's justification that he believed he only had the "mandate under [Section] 7.08 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement" to consider the simple question of whether the grievant failed to perform his work in a timely manner. To the extent that the Arbitrator based his refusal on his interpretation and application of the agreement, we find that his justification fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. We will find that an award fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement when the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the agreement as to "manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator"; (3) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement; or (4) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties' agreement unequivocally provides for the right of the parties to fully and completely present evidence and exhibits in support of their respective positions. The sole limitation of the agreement on the presentation of their cases is that more than five witnesses cannot be called without the agreement of the other party or without the permission of the arbitrator. In our view, the Arbitrator's determination that Section 7.08 permits his refusal to have considered the Union's position on the grievant's performance standards and the propriety of the Agency's action based on <span class="Italic">Lovshin [v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 676 F.2d 826 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 475 U.S. 1111 (1986),] fails to draw its essence from the agreement. We conclude that the determination cannot in any rational way be derived from Section 7.08 and manifestly disregards its provisions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the Union, the Arbitrator never sought to withdraw or renegotiate the terms of expedited arbitration once he found out about the complexities of the case. Consequently, we need not address whether the award would have been justified if the Arbitrator had requested a waiver of the time limit for issuing a decision and the parties would not mutually agree to the waiver.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we will vacate the award denying the grievance. We will remand this case to the parties for submission to an arbitrator of their choice to consider, in accordance with Section 7.08 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, the Union's position on the grievant's performance standards....</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">GSA Region 9 and AFGE Council 236</span>, 56 FLRA 978, 978-79 (2000), concluded that the agency was denied a fair hearing when the arbitrator granted some official time to the grievant. The issue of official time was collateral to the subject matter of the grievance, the matter was not among the stipulated issues, the issue was raised only in the union's posthearing brief, and the agency had no opportunity to address the matter before the arbitrator issued his award. FLRA vacated the official time award and remanded it to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator if the matter was not otherwise resolved. An award was vacated and remanded to the parties for resubmission to an arbitrator because a fair hearing was denied to the agency when the arbitrator relied on evidence in a prior arbitration proceeding without notice to the agency, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP, JFK Airport and AFGE Local 1917</span>, 62 FLRA 360, 362-63 (2008):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award will be found deficient on the ground that an arbitrator failed to provide a fair hearing when it is demonstrated that the arbitrator refused to hear or consider pertinent and material evidence, or that other actions in conducting the proceeding so prejudiced a party as to affect the fairness of the proceeding as a whole. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1668</span>, 50 FLRA 124, 126 (1995). It is well established that an arbitrator has considerable latitude in conducting a hearing and the fact that an arbitrator conducts a hearing in a manner that a party finds objectionable does not, by itself, provide a basis for finding an award deficient. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 22</span>, 51 FLRA 1496, 1497-98 (1996). As an example, an arbitrator does not fail to conduct a fair hearing by accepting and considering additional information or memoranda submitted by a party with its post-hearing brief, where the opposing party had an adequate opportunity to respond to the additional information. <span class="Italic">See NATCA, MEBA/AFL-CIO</span>, 47 FLRA 638, 647-48 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority vacates awards when a party demonstrates that an arbitrator denied the party a fair hearing.&#x2003;For instance, in <span class="Italic">General Services Administration, Region 9, Los Angeles, Calif.</span>, 56 FLRA 978, 979 (2000), the Authority found that an arbitrator, by failing to provide the agency with an opportunity to respond to an official time issue raised for the first time in the union's post-hearing brief, prejudiced the agency in a manner that affected the fairness of the proceeding as to that issue. Additionally, in <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Air Force, Hill Air Force Base, Utah</span>, 39 FLRA 103, 107 (1991), the Authority found that the arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing because the arbitrator's acknowledged failure to consider the union's position prejudiced the right of the union to fully present its case and affected the fairness of the arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the above precedent here, the Arbitrator's award shows that the Arbitrator determined that the Agency must adhere to the 2000 Agreement by relying on documentary and testimonial evidence from a previous award involving the Arbitrator. There is no dispute that this evidence was not presented at the arbitration hearing in this case. It is also undisputed that the Agency had no opportunity to contest such evidence before the Arbitrator rendered his award. In this circumstance, the Arbitrator, by considering evidence and basing his findings on evidence that had not been presented by the parties at the hearing prejudiced the Agency in a manner that affected the fairness of the proceeding. Therefore, the Arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing and the award must be vacated.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although an arbitrator should not refuse to consider issues presented by the parties, the arbitrator may defer to the decision of another arbitrator who is concurrently considering the same issues in the context of another case. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 44 FLRA 527, 532-34 (1992) (arbitrator in expedited proceeding decided to defer on an issue to arbitrator hearing a case under regular arbitration procedure). [But see discussion in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-17-384.html#sec9-382">Adherence to Precedent; <span class="Italic">Res Judicata</span>; Collateral Estoppel</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1990, FLRA signaled that if a party raises an issue as to the fairness of the proceedings, that objection should be raised first before the arbitrator, not initially with FLRA, explaining in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 34 FLRA 986, 990 (1990), as to an asserted <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e note the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Early v. Eastern Transfer</span>, 699 F.2d 552 (1st Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">Early</span>). In <span class="Italic">Early</span>,...the First Circuit rejected an allegation of bias which was raised for the first time before the court. The court noted that the allegation of bias could have been, but was not, raised before the joint committee which made a final and binding decision to uphold the grievants' discharges. The court concluded that it would "not entertain a claim of personal bias where it could have been but was not raised at the hearing to which it applies. This is the accepted rule in arbitration cases."...&#8197;The court stated further as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">While it may be unpleasant to have to choose between possibly alienating a decisionmaker in advance by objecting and waiving the issue of bias, we cannot accept that parties have a right to keep two strings to their bow--to seek victory before the tribunal and then, having lost, seek to overturn it for bias never before claimed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not claim, and the record does not disclose, that the Union raised an allegation of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication at the arbitration hearing. If the Union had raised the alleged <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication at the hearing, the content of the alleged communication, if any, could have been revealed and questions concerning it could have been resolved.</p>
<p class="noindent">The requirement that a fairness issue be first raised with the arbitrator was reiterated, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2923 and DHHS, NIH, Research Triangle Park</span>, 69 FLRA 286, 291 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Union does not demonstrate that it objected during the hearing to the Arbitrator's conduct at the hearing that the Union challenges.
