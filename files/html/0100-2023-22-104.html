<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-104"><span class="space">a.</span> Demise of the Cost-Plus Formula</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Through 2000, attorneys employed by unions on a salaried basis were limited to recovery based on a rate that reflected their hourly salary, supplemented with an equal amount representing "overhead." The basis for the "cost-plus" formula was the notion that if unions recovered more for their lawyers than the lawyers were paid, the unions would be engaged in fee-splitting with counsel, a practice prohibited by disciplinary rules governing lawyers that prohibit division of fees between an attorney and a client. The Board's rule was based on <span class="Italic">Powell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 8 MSPR 322, 330-31 (1981), and <span class="Italic">Goodrich v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 733 F.2d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Raney v. Bureau of Prisons</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20001149222f3d92711042">222 F.3d 927</a>, 931-938 (Fed. Cir. 2000), recognizing developments in other circuit courts and changes in the interpretation of disciplinary rules, discarded the cost-plus formulation and permitted salaried union counsel to recover hourly rates based on the market rate:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are faced with the issue of whether the petitioner is entitled to receive market-rate fees for work by union attorneys under the Back Pay Act, when such fees are deposited in a fund controlled exclusively by lawyers to support litigation on behalf of employee rights and the fund is separate from other union funds. As with any question of statutory interpretation, our starting point is with the language of the statute itself. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Good Samaritan Hosp. v. Shalala</span>, 508 U.S. 402, 409 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Back Pay Act provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a]n employee of an agency who...[is found] to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee (A) <span class="Italic">is entitled</span>, on correction of the personnel action, <span class="Italic">to receive</span>...<span class="Italic">reasonable attorney fees</span> related to the personnel action which...shall be awarded in accordance with the standards established under 7701(g) of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii) (emphases added). We begin by noting that the text of the statute does not define "reasonable attorney fees." In addition, the plain language does not differentiate between an attorney in private practice and an attorney who is employed by a non-profit legal organization, including one established by a labor union (footnote omitted). The text of the Back Pay Act therefore provides no basis for distinguishing between in-house and private firm counsel when calculating or assessing such fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before 1978, when the Back Pay Act was amended, the phrase "reasonable attorney fees" had been used by Congress in numerous federal fee-shifting statutes and had uniformly been interpreted to require the payment of "market-rate" fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886, 894-96 (1984). As the Supreme Court noted in <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, "[n]one of the cases decided [before 1976] ...had adopted a cost-based approach to calculating fees. Reference to market rate was uniform." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 465 U.S. at 894 n.10. The same was true in the period from 1976 to 1978<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hughes v. Repko</span>, 578 F.2d 483, 488 n.7 (3d Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">King v. Greenblatt</span>, 560 F.2d 1024, 1026 (1st Cir. 1977). Congress is presumed to have created the attorney fee provision of the Back Pay Act with this established statutory construction in mind<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 894 n.10; <span class="Italic">Cannon v. University of Chicago</span>, 441 U.S. 677, 696-98 (1979) (explaining that Congress is presumed to enact legislation with knowledge of the law and a newly-enacted statute is presumed to be harmonious with existing law and judicial concepts). Thus, Congress was undoubtedly aware that courts have consistently interpreted "reasonable attorney fees" as the prevailing market-rate fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 440 (1983). In this case, Congress added the "reasonable attorney fees" provision to the Back Pay Act as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 95-454, Title VII, &#x00A7; 702, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978). A variety of relevant fee shifting statutes was passed in the years prior to this Act with the inclusion of reasonable attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, 42 USC &#x00A7; 1988 (Civil Rights Act Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976);<span id="Page_4639"></span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1132(g) (Employees Retirement Income Security Act of 1974); 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(g) (Privacy Act of 1974); 26 USC &#x00A7; 6110(i) (Tax Reform Act of 1976); 5 USC &#x00A7; 504 (Equal Access to Justice Act of 1980); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Marek v. Chesny</span>, 473 U.S. 1, 43 (1985) (appendix to Brennan, J., dissenting) (listing approximately 100 federal fee-shifting statutes providing for reasonable attorney fees). Given Congress' knowledge and understanding of the construction of this phrase, we hold today that "reasonable attorney fees" in the Back Pay Act means "prevailing market-rate attorney fees."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court's instructions in <span class="Italic">Blum</span> are crystal clear that a non-profit legal services organization is entitled to receive a prevailing market rate pursuant to a statute that authorizes the prevailing party to be awarded "a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the cost." 465 U.S. at 894. The Supreme Court clearly rejected the notion that legal fees for a non-profit legal services organization must be calculated according to cost (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Supreme Court made it clear that when a statute authorizes a non-profit legal services organization to receive "reasonable attorney's fees" when it represents the prevailing party, it is in the interest of the public "that such law firms be awarded reasonable attorney's fees to be computed in the traditional manner when its counsel perform legal services otherwise entitling them to the award of attorney's fees." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 895 (citing with approval <span class="Italic">Stanford Daily v. Zurcher</span>, 64 F.R.D. 680 (N.D. Cal. 1974) and <span class="Italic">Davis v. County of Los Angeles</span>, 8 EPD &#x00B6; 9444 (C.D. Cal. 1974)). We conclude that, like the legal service organization in <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, the Legal Representation Fund in this case lies among those organizations contemplated by Congress to be entitled to reasonable attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissenting opinion crafts a rather unique statutory interpretation argument to salvage the government's case. In the first place, the dissenting opinion interprets "incurred by an employee or applicant." The second piece of the statutory argument is that the Back Pay Act confines market rate fees to cases involving discrimination. On both points, the dissenting opinion is not correct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent agrees that the language of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) must be understood to authorize the payment of fees for legal services provided on behalf of the employee, even if the fee payment is made to a third party such as the union in this case. However, under the dissent's rationale, the authorized "reasonable attorney fees" under the Back Pay Act must mean something different than in <span class="Italic">Blum</span> because in <span class="Italic">Blum</span> the Supreme Court addressed the words "reasonable attorney fees" under the Civil Rights Act. In support of its position the dissent points to the Back Pay Act's references to the "standards...under section 7701(g)" and to "payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant," and emphatically contends that "this language means what it says." Of course, if this language really "means what it says," then there is no reason for the dissent either to add the footnote clarifying the "incurred" language or to append the term "actually" to the language selected by Congress. In fact, both of these "clarifications" are nothing more than rationalizations required to reach a desired conclusion, while avoiding the undeniably irrational result that the employee would receive, under the literal statutory language, no fee award at all.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Mr. Raney plainly understood that any fees collected in the litigation over the grievance would go to the union. In that setting, it makes sense to regard the understanding between the union and the employee as a fee arrangement with the amount of the fee to be determined by the adjudicator and the fee to be paid only in the event of an award. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. General Servs. Admin.</span>, 924 F.2d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (construing a contingent fee arrangement to mean that if an award of attorney fees is obtained on the client's behalf "she is obligated to turn it over to her attorney. In this sense, [the client] incurs the fees that may be awarded her."). The adjudicator should be free under such an arrangement to award a reasonable fee, i.e., the market rate for the services rendered, and to award that fee to the union pursuant to the express or implied agreement between the union and the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent's attempt to restrict "reasonable attorney fees incurred" to "reasonable attorney fees <span class="Italic">actually</span> incurred" constitutes precisely the type of legislative rewrite that any court should avoid. It imposes a limitation which Congress neither expressed nor intended. Congress has passed a variety of statutes that have specifically referred to attorney fees as "incurred," <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, 5 USC &#x00A7; 552(a)(4)(E) (Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA")); 5 USC &#x00A7; 552a(g) (Privacy Act of 1974); Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(4), but the courts have neither interpreted the "incurred" term in these statutes to restrict or limit the payment of fees to those <span class="Italic">actually</span> incurred, nor prevented market-rate fees from being awarded. For example, in <span class="Italic">Jordan v. United States Dep't of Justice</span>, 691 F.2d 514, 523 (D.C. Cir. 1982), the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that fee awards under FOIA must "be measured by the market value of the services rendered, not the amount actually received by the attorney nor the amount that would have been received absent an award of fees," even if the services are provided by unpaid law-student interns. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Textor v. Northern Illinois University</span>, 711 F.2d 1387 (7th Cir. 1983), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals considered the term as used in Rule 37(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ("reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining the order, including fees"), and held that litigants employing a salaried in-house counsel were just as entitled to market-rate fees under the rule as litigants using hourly-rate attorneys. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1397; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund v. Central Cartage Co.</span>, 76 F.3d 114, 115-16 (7th Cir. 1996) (ERISA decision citing <span class="Italic">Textor</span>, noting that "both lawyers and nonlawyers may recover fees at the market rate, whether they obtain legal services by the hour in a spot market or by the year through employment contracts," and criticizing <span class="Italic">Devine</span> and <span class="Italic">Goodrich</span> as "disregard[ing] the principle that the litigant owns the award"); <span class="Italic">Crooker v. United States Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 663 F.2d 140, 141 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (rejecting the government's argument that <span class="Italic">pro</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> prisoner was not entitled to fees under FOIA for his own litigation efforts).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court also interpreted the term "incurred" in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. General Servs. Admin.</span>, 126 F.3d 1406, 1409 (Fed. Cir. 1997), and noted that "courts have awarded attorney fees under EAJA [Equal Access to Justice Act] <span class="Italic">and similar fee-shifting statutes</span> requiring that fees be 'incurred' when the prevailing party is represented by a legal services organization or counsel appearing <span class="Italic">pro bono</span>") (emphasis added). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">National Ass'n of Criminal Defense Lawyers v. United States Dep't of Justice</span>, 182 F.3d 981, 987 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (FOIA decision dismissing the government's appeal of fee award to non-profit organization and denying petition for writ of mandamus). Clearly then, the fees "incurred" in this case may also be "reasonable" according to the prevailing rates of the market.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is also a practical objection to using a cost-based method of calculating fees, because trying to determine the "cost" of legal services to the provider can prove elusive, as this case demonstrates. To calculate the "reasonable attorney fees" based on a <span class="Italic">pro rata</span> allocation of the attorneys' salaries, as the arbitrator did in this case, clearly understates the true cost to the union of the attorneys' services. In addition to their salaries, the union must pay for benefits for the attorneys, support services, equipment, office space, attorney recruitment, attorney training and continuing education, and administrative overhead. Moreover, the cost to the union of devoting the attorneys' time to Mr. Raney's case cannot properly be calculated without taking into account the opportunity cost involved in devoting attorney time to one case when it could be devoted to others. Cases that are foregone could well include cases clearly eligible for market-rate fees, such as cases involving claims of unlawful discrimination. Because of the difficulty of calculating "cost" in this setting, the preferable method of valuing attorney fees for particular legal services is the market value of those services. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Central States</span>, 76 F.3d at 116.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the rule were otherwise, attorneys hired on a straight hourly basis would recover their full fee up to the market rate, but attorneys on retainers, attorneys with contingent fees, and attorneys offering services under prepaid legal plans would recover less. This court has not drawn such a distinction under the Equal Access to Justice Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, 924 F.2d at 1582 &#x0026; n.4. There is no reason to draw such a distinction in cases arising under the attorney fee provisions of the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the second point, the dissenting opinion notes and makes much of the fact that the statute has a separate express provision for awards when discrimination is the basis for the cause of action. That, however, is of no consequence to whether market fees can be awarded under the Back Pay Act. The separate provision for awards in discrimination cases simply broadens the scope of the reasonable attorney fee recovery in those cases to include the fees of experts. No such broadened scope of recovery is at issue in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By providing separate subsections 7701(g)(1) and 7701(g)(2), Congress merely recognized that federal employees terminated due to discrimination are entitled to obtain not only reasonable attorney fees, i.e., market-rate fees, but also expert fees, which costs may be necessary to establish the discriminatory action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2). Thus, the dissent misinterprets a complementary redundancy in the subsections, because the amount available under the one could be greater than the amount available under the other.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Congress amended the Back Pay Act to provide for fee awards more broadly, it sought to eliminate the strong financial disincentives for those who would protect their employment from unjustified governmental action. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep., No. 95-969, at 60 (1978). In so doing, it sought to deter the unreasonable exercise of governmental authority. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Ardestaini v. INS</span>, 502 US 129, 138 (1991); <span class="Italic">Commissioner, INS v. Jean</span>, 496 US 154, 165 n.14 (1990) ("[A] party who chooses to litigate an issue against the Government is not only representing his or her own vested interest but is also refining and formulating public policy."). The effect of the dissent's rationale subverts this very purpose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This construction of the operative phrase by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, coupled with the statutory interpretation of the Back Pay Act should <span id="Page_4640"></span>resolve this case; however, even though the government did not raise the statutory issue, it specifically argued (footnote omitted) that the award of such market-rate fees would violate canons of ethical conduct such as the prohibition against fee-splitting arrangements with non-lawyers and the prohibition against lawyers aiding in the unauthorized practice of law. In two of our prior cases, we agreed with the government's position that only a "hermetically sealed" litigation fund could meet these ethical requirements. In <span class="Italic">Goodrich</span>, we held that a salaried union attorney is only entitled to attorney fees calculated at cost-plus-overhead under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), even if the fees were deposited in a segregated legal representation fund controlled exclusively by attorneys for employee-related litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goodrich</span>, 733 F.2d at 1580. We believed this separate fund would be insufficient to overcome the ethical barriers because such an arrangement would result in an indirect payment of funds to the union.[6] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> We reasoned that "[b]y reducing the amount of its general funds the union is required to use to provide legal services, the payment to the fund of legal fees that exceed the union's of providing the services would result in the union's indirectly utilizing legal fees for its ordinary expenses." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Goodrich</span> opinion follows the reasoning outlined in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Department of Treasury</span>, 656 F.2d 848 (D.C. Cir. 1981), which held that an attorney employed by a union could not receive legal fees in excess of the union's expenses despite the fact that the union had established a legal representation fund. The rationale of <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span> was subsequently rejected in <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, AFL-CIO Local 3882 v. Federal Labor Relations Auth.</span>, 944 F.2d 922 (D.C. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly in <span class="Italic">Devine</span>, we denied market-rate fees to union attorneys under section 2412(d)(2)(A) of the Equal Access to Justice Act because we feared that awarding market-rate fees would relieve the union of the burden of financing its litigation activities with its general funds, thereby effectively resulting in a fee-splitting arrangement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Devine</span>, 805 F.2d at 388-89. We noted that, because the litigation fund was not "fully supportive" of the union's litigation activities, the union would benefit indirectly from the award of market-rate fees and therefore we awarded only the costs of litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 389. In sum, the concern in these cases was that, even if a separate legal fund was established, ethical problems would remain because the union would merely be relieved from the burden of financing litigation activities through funds from general revenues and thus would benefit indirectly from an award of market-rate fees.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The rationale in both <span class="Italic">Goodrich</span> and <span class="Italic">Devine</span> was based at least in part on the fact that claimant did not seek to protect rights of a constitutional nature. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Devine</span> we noted that "different concerns exist when awarding attorney fees in civil rights cases where encouraging private attorney generals to come forth and challenge governmental abuses is undeniably an important concern." <span class="Italic">Devine</span>, 805 F.2d at 388. However, personnel cases such as Mr. Raney's do involve the deprivation of a constitutionally protected right, namely a worker's property right in continued federal employment in the absence of due process of law. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 538-39, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed.2d 494 (1985); <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insur. Corp.</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nowhere in its brief does the government argue the statutory interpretation now being posited by the dissent. Nor did <span class="Italic">Goodrich</span>, which according to the dissent "got it right," rely upon the dissent's rationale. A careful analysis of <span class="Italic">Goodrich</span> shows that the <span class="Italic">Goodrich</span> court's holding was premised specifically on the ethical restriction that payment of the market-rate fees would provide the union an indirect benefit. In distinguishing <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, the court stated that the Legal Aid Society of New York received the entire fee whereas "[i]n the present case.... part of the fee would inure to the benefit of a nonlegal organization, the union, and it was for that reason that the Board limited the union's fees to its expenses of rendering the service." <span class="Italic">Goodrich</span>, 733 F.2d at 1580.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Several of our sister circuits, however, have held that these ethical concerns do not require "hermetically sealed" or "fully supportive" litigation funds. These circuits have held that market-rate fees can be awarded to litigants who employ union staff counsel when all attorney fees are deposited into a separate fund controlled exclusively by lawyers and the fund is used to support litigation on behalf of employees' rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kean v. Stone</span>, 966 F.2d 119 (3d Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3882 v. Federal Labor Relations Auth.</span>, 944 F.2d 922 (D.C. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Curran v. Department of Treasury</span>, 805 F.2d 1406 (9th Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude today that there is a serious flaw with the reasoning set forth in our precedent and the government's position. According to <span class="Italic">Devine</span>, <span class="Italic">Goodrich</span>, and the government, establishing a separate fund that is controlled solely by attorneys does not resolve the ethical concerns because money is fungible and attorney fees paid into a litigation fund may simply save the union from contributing to that fund in other ways. Under this reasoning, union attorneys therefore can recover only cost-based fees. If money is fungible, however, then awarding the union attorneys <span class="Italic">any</span> fees will in fact simply save the union from contributing to the litigation fund. If it is acceptable to pay <span class="Italic">some</span> fees, which in effect alleviates the LRF from obtaining some union funding, why is it is unacceptable to pay market-rate fees? In order to be consistent, our precedent and the government's reasoning must result in a complete prohibition on the payment of any fees to union attorneys. If unions are not allowed to benefit indirectly from legal fees then they should be barred from obtaining any benefits either from cost-based fees or from market-based fees. The restrictive analysis of our precedent is logically untenable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that our sister circuits have discussed this inconsistency in the reasoning of our precedent. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Fed.</span>, 944 F.2d at 936 (explaining that if the union does "gain indirectly from market-rate fees, so also it [benefits] from fees that are cost-limited, and the ethical considerations are precisely the same. The size of the benefits varies...but its character not one whit, and it defies logic to say that in one instance the benefit is ethically permissible but in the other it is not."); <span class="Italic">Curran</span>, 805 F.2d at 1409-10 (pointing out an indirect benefit from market-rate fees also accrues to any contributor to a <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> legal project receiving such an award, which includes "contributors to the Legal Aid Society of New York, to which the Supreme Court approved an award of market-rate fees in <span class="Italic">Blum</span>") (footnote omitted); <span class="Italic">Kean</span>, 966 F.2d at 123 (explaining that "it is specious to reason that simply changing the amount a union will receive will resolve the 'ethical' dilemma").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reasoning of our precedent, which we reject today, would mean that any prevailing market rates obtained by any non-profit legal organization affiliated with any public organization, such as the NAACP or the Sierra Club, would allow their respective organizations to obtain an indirect benefit by decreasing the amount which each organization would need to raise to continue their non-legal activities. Such concerns necessarily have been repeatedly rejected by the Supreme Court as well as our sister circuits. For example, in <span class="Italic">Missouri v. Jenkins</span>, 491 U.S. 274 (1989), the Supreme Court allowed the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc. to receive prevailing market-rates for its legal services<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 284-85. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Sierra Club v. Gorsuch</span>, 684 F.2d 972 (D.C. Cir. 1982), the Sierra Club was awarded prevailing market rates for service rendered by its outside counsel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 975; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">National Wildlife Fed. v. Hanson</span>, 859 F.2d 313, 318 (4th Cir. 1988) (awarding fees for services rendered by public interest law firm); <span class="Italic">Environmental Defense Fund Inc. v. EPA</span>, 672 F.2d 42, 63-64 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (awarding fees for work by outside counsel); <span class="Italic">Oldham v. Ehrlich</span>, 617 F.2d 163, 169 (8th Cir. 1980) (awarding fees for services provided by legal aid societies). In <span class="Italic">Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven Recreation Ass'n, Inc.</span>, 517 F.2d 1141 (4th Cir. 1975), the court rejected the contention that fees should be denied because they would be donated to the civil rights organization that assisted the litigants in presenting their grievances instead of being paid to the lawyers<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1148.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the Supreme Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Blum</span> and the persuasive logic of the opinions from our sister circuits, we overturn our precedent in <span class="Italic">Devine</span> and <span class="Italic">Goodrich</span> to the extent that these decisions require union legal representation funds to be "hermetically sealed" or "fully supportive" of the union's litigation activities. Rather, when a legal fund is separated from other union funds and is controlled exclusively by attorneys for the sole benefit of employee litigation, such segregation eliminates ethical barriers to market rate calculation for attorney fee awards. Whether the fund is "hermetically sealed" or "fully supportive" of the union's litigation activities is simply irrelevant. Squaring our precedent with every other court in the land that has considered this issue, we thus agree with the court in <span class="Italic">Kean</span> that "[a]llowing a union to benefit indirectly from the proceeds of law practice no more violates ethical rules than allowing a union to maintain lawyers to represent its members...." <span class="Italic">Kean</span>, 966 F.2d at 123.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there is no reason to assume that non-lawyer union officials exercised control over union attorneys. When fees are paid into a separate account used solely by lawyers for employee litigation purposes, we discern no unethical fee splitting with a lay entity and no encouragement of the unauthorized practice of law. We perceive no realistic threat that depositing fees in the LRF will encourage the unauthorized practice of law or result in the interference with the professional judgment of union attorneys. As our sister circuit put it in <span class="Italic">Kean</span>, "[t]he fear that the benefit may amount to unauthorized practice of law or compromise an attorney's independent judgment or constitute splitting fees with laypersons is <span class="Italic">highly speculative</span>." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added). The union's influence, while theoretically possible, is hardly a real danger here. We therefore hold there is no ethical barrier to compensation of Mr. Raney's attorneys at the market rate. The decision of the arbitrator denying market-rate fees is therefore vacated and the matter is remanded for the entry of a market-rate fee award in accordance with this opinion for services rendered during Mr. Raney's grievance proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4641"></span>The Supreme Court specified in <span class="Italic">Blum</span> that something more than an attorney's own affidavit is required to establish the prevailing market rate for attorney's fees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">To inform and assist the court in the exercise of its discretion, the burden is on the fee applicant to produce satisfactory evidence--in addition to the attorney's own affidavits--that the requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience and reputation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 895 n.11. Various appellate courts that have addressed <span class="Italic">Blum</span>'s "satisfactory evidence" requirement have demanded more than the affidavits presented here by Hobbie and Schrier. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spegon v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago</span>, 175 F.3d 544, 566 (7th Cir. 1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Blum</span> and stating that "[a]n attorney's self-serving affidavit alone cannot satisfy the plaintiff's burden of establishing the market rate for that attorney's services."); <span class="Italic">Washington v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the government in this case did not contest the affidavits and the court accepted them as reasonable, we do not disturb the findings below. However, in future cases, the trial court should demand adequate proof from individuals familiar with the market of the community billing rate charged by attorneys of equivalent skill and experience performing services of similar complexity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Applying <span class="Italic">Raney,</span> in <span class="Italic">Thompson v. DOJ</span>, 115 MSPR 564, 2010 MSPB 244 (2010), the Board found no impediment to a fee award (subject to a remand to determine the adequacy of the union legal defense fund under <span class="Italic">Raney</span> criteria) that went to private counsel whose agreement with a union provided that the private practice attorney would be paid on a scale of 40-50% of fees recovered for covered work, the remainder of the fees to be turned over to the union's litigation representation fund for the purpose of payment of litigation costs and expenses pertaining to representation. The arrangement created no improper influence by the union over counsel or loss by counsel of independent judgment.</p>
