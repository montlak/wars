<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-17"><span class="space">6.</span> Position Classification</h4>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7103(a)(14)(B), conditions of employment are defined to exclude policies, practices, and matters relating to the classification of any position. <span class="Italic">March AFB, Riverside and AFGE Local 1953</span>, 13 FLRA 255, 255-60 (1983), considered the bargaining exclusion for matters pertaining to position classification. Congress intended to remove from negotiations threshold determinations of what duties and responsibilities constitute a given position and the characterization of that position for purposes of personnel and pay administration. The bargaining exclusion was intended to ensure uniformity of position classification throughout the federal service. Bargaining proposals directly relating to the classification of positions do not concern "conditions of employment," and they are not within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Statute "excludes from the definition of 'conditions of employment' matters 'relating to the classification of any position[,]' it is clear that other matters directly concerning position classification, including the impact and implementation of downgradings resulting from classification actions, are within the duty to bargain." <span class="Italic">Army Armament Research, Dev. And Eng'r Ctr. And NFFE Local 1437</span>, 49 FLRA 77, 82 (1994). Commenting on the duty to bargain over the impact of classification downgradings, <span class="Italic">March AFB</span>, 13 FLRA 255, 258-60 (1983):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[N]ot all matters related to classification are excluded from the scope of bargaining....&#8197;"[E]ach employee has a right to union representation [in] all meetings with management involving classification matters, including desk audits"...nothing...prevent[s] bargaining over such matters as repromotion opportunities for downgraded employees, certain matters related to position descriptions, or the timing of a reclassification. Moreover, in section 7121 of the Statute, Congress provided in effect that the classification of any position which results in the reduction of an employee's grade or pay is subject to coverage under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. Thus, such matters are within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, there is no evidence to indicate that AFGE sought to bargain on the classification of the disputed positions--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the specific duties or any other matter to be considered in classifying such positions. Rather, AFGE wished to bargain over the implementation of the downgradings and their impact on affected employees. The Authority concludes, based upon the foregoing, that proposals concerning such matters, to the extent consonant with law and regulation, are within the duty to bargain under the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority also rejects the Respondent's contentions that it had no obligation to bargain because the downgrading action was covered by section 7103(a)(14)(C) of the Statute which excludes from conditions of employment matters specifically provided for by Federal statute, and that even if a bargaining obligation existed, the Respondent had little discretion under the applicable statutes and regulations to bargain on such matters. While certain matters such as grade and pay retention are specifically provided for in the cited provisions of law and regulation and, therefore, may not be subject to bargaining, the Respondent has presented no evidence that all matters relating generally to classification are removed from the scope of bargaining either because they are specifically provided for within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14)(C), or because the agency is left with no discretion to act in those particular instances. Rather, as has already been noted, matters not directly related to the actual classification of a position may be raised in the context of collective bargaining and, to the extent that agencies have been authorized to exercise discretion with regard to such matters, they have a corresponding duty to bargain with the exclusive representative.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Meaning of the Proposal</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's explanation makes it clear that this proposal concerns nursing assistants. By its terms, the proposal would require the Agency to do three things: 1) increase the Nas' grades; 2) change their job description to reflect the change in duties and pay; and 3) change the title of the NA position to nursing technician.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The Proposal Relates to Classification and Is Outside the Duty to Bargain</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(14)(B) of the Statute excludes policies, practices, and matters "relating to the classification of any position" from the definition of conditions of employment. In enacting this section, "Congress intended to remove from the scope of bargaining threshold determinations as to what duties and responsibilities will constitute a given position and the placement of that position in a class for purposes of personnel and pay administration. <span class="Italic">See International Organization Of</span> <span class="Italic">Masters, Mates and Pilots, Marine Division, Panama</span> <span class="Italic">Canal Pilots Branch and Panama Canal Commission,</span> 51 FLRA 333, 339 (1995) <span class="Italic">(Panama Canal Commission), citing March Air Force Base, Riverside, California, </span>13 FLRA 255, 258 (1983) <span class="Italic">(March AFB).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In construing section 7103(a)(14)(B), the Authority relies on the definitions of the terms "classification" and "position" that appear in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101<span class="Italic">. See National Association of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">R5-168 and U.S. Department of the Army, Fort Polk,</span> <span class="Italic">Louisiana, </span>53 FLRA 1622, 1624 (1998); <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local</span> <span class="Italic">49, </span>52 FLRA at 667; <span class="Italic">March AFB, </span>13 FLRA at 257. Pursuant to these definitions, the term "classification" means: "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by OPM under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." The term "position" means: "the work, consisting of the duties and responsibilities, assigned by competent authority for performance by an employee." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c) and I. Under the system established by OPM, classification entails the identification of the appropriate title, series, grade, and pay system of a position. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.701(a) (a classification action is the determination to establish or change the title, series, grade or pay system of a position).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that the assignment of a particular "pay level" or "grade level" to a position based on its duties and responsibilities is part of the classification process. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Panama Canal Commission, </span>51 FLRA at 339. <span class="Italic">See also IFPTE Local 49</span>, 52 FLRA at 668 (proposal that required the job series to be the same for all project managers was outside the duty to bargain because it concerned the classification of positions). In relevant part, the proposal here would require the Agency to change the title of employees from nursing assistants to nursing technicians, and to increase the employees' grades accordingly. There is no evidence in the record that the Agency presently employs, or has positions classified as, nursing technicians. Therefore, it does not appear that the proposal would have the effect of placing individuals currently serving as nursing assistants into positions that were previously classified by the Agency. <span class="Italic">Compare National</span> <span class="Italic">Association of Government Employees, Local R3-76</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Logistics</span> <span class="Italic">Agency, Defense Automated Printing Service, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</span>, 55 FLRA 509 (1999) <span class="Italic">with American Federation of Government Employees, Local 948</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of Labor, Employment Standards</span> <span class="Italic">Administration, Office of Workers Compensation Programs, Boston, Massachusetts, </span>55 FLRA 582 (1999), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed, </span>No. 99-1330 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 18, 1999) (Proposal 1) <span class="Italic">(ESA). </span>Rather, consistent with the precedent cited above, the proposal concerns a classification matter that is excluded from the obligation to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal is nonnegotiable that an agency not reclassify positions, or that the agency defer reclassification, as in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-23 and Defense Commissary Agency, Ft. Lee</span>, 54 FLRA 1302, 1308-10 (1998), involving Proposal 2, requiring that the agency wait six months before conducting a desk audit of certain positions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether matters relate to classification within the meaning of 7103(a)(14)(B), it is well established that, "the Authority relies on the definitions of the terms classification and position that appear in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 49 and U.S. Department of the Army, Army Corps of Engineers, South Pacific Division, San Francisco, California</span>, 52 FLRA 665, 667 (1996); <span class="Italic">March Air Force Base, Riverside, California and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1953</span>, 13 FLRA 255, 257 (1983). As defined by that regulation, "classification" is: "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by OPM under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 510.101(c). More specifically, classification entails the identification of the appropriate title, series, grade, and pay system of a position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.701(a) (defining "agency classification action" as the determination to establish or change the title, series, grade or pay system of a position).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to this definition, the last sentence of the proposal relates to classification.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Union, both of the proposals in this case were made in response to the Agency's decision to "reorganize and downsize" certain offices. Also according to the Union, the Agency's proposed reorganization would "result in...a reduction in the employee's grades." The last sentence of Proposal 2 requires the Agency to maintain the classification of the affected employees as GS-525-5 Accounting Technicians until desk audits are performed 6 months after implementation of the reorganization. By preventing the Agency from identifying the appropriate title, series, grade, and pay system of the reorganized positions, the sentence effectively requires the Agency to classify the employees' positions in a particular way--as GS-525-5 Accounting Technician positions--for a particular time period, without regard to whether the positions warrant that classification and grade and even though, according to the Union, the reorganization will result in employee downgrades. For a period of 6 months, the proposal directly identifies the title, series, grade, and pay system of the affected employees, satisfying the standard the Authority has set out for this exclusion from the definition of conditions of employment.[7] By requiring that the Agency maintain a particular classification for a certain period of time, this case is distinguishable from the cases relied on in the dissenting opinion.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The last sentence in Proposal 2 prohibits the Agency from reclassifying the affected positions. We do not understand that there is any dispute that the sentence would have this effect. Surely, prohibiting the Agency from reclassifying a position relates just as clearly to "classification," within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14)(B), as requiring that the position be classified in a particular way to begin with. Thus, the proposal's requirement that the Agency <span class="Italic">not reclassify</span> the affected positions is, in itself, an effective classification of the positions, regardless of whether, on the merits, the proposal provides a logical method for determining such classification.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Our dissenting colleague relies on three cases: <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 2015 and U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 967 (1997) (<span class="Italic">NFFE</span>); NAGE, 52 FLRA at 1031; and <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 14 FLRA 243, 249-50 (1984) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>). The proposal in <span class="Italic">NFFE</span>, 53 FLRA at 971, required that "two existing same graded individuals...be assigned" to particular positions; the proposal in <span class="Italic">NAGE</span> required the agency to use a "dental hygienist to provide coverage of the dental assistant's duties." 52 FLRA at 1028 (brackets omitted). Neither of these proposals, as plainly worded or as interpreted by the unions, required the agencies to establish or maintain any particular classifications or grades with respect to any positions. The proposal in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> prohibited the agency from reassigning work "for the purpose of avoiding reclassification during a classification appeal." 14 FLRA at 249. Thus, like the proposals in <span class="Italic">NFFE</span> and <span class="Italic">NAGE</span>, this proposal did not require the agency to do anything with regard to the classification of the positions. The proposal attempted to remove the predicate for a classification by restricting assignments of work. More importantly, however, in none of the three cases was a classification argument made to or addressed by the Authority. As such, these decisions, which are not cited by the Union, cast no light on the issues before us.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the last sentence of the proposal relates to classification, it is outside the duty to bargain. The Union's contentions regarding section 7106(b)(1), (2), and (3) would not affect this conclusion. In this regard, section 7106(b) applies to negotiations affecting the exercise of management's rights only. Section 7106(b) is not an exception to the definition of conditions of employment or the exclusions from that section. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local No. 1 and U.S. Department of the Navy, Nuclear Business Office, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia</span>, 52 FLRA 1341, 1346 (1997). As such, the conclusion that Proposal 1, establishing the <span class="Italic">number</span> of these positions to be maintained by the Agency, is bargainable at the Agency's election under section 7106(b)(1) does not change the conclusion that the second sentence in Proposal 2, which requires that the positions to be classified as "GS-525-5 Accounting Technician," concerns a <span class="Italic">classification</span> matter.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">March AFB</span> suggested that although the Statute makes classification matters <span id="page_517"></span>nonnegotiable, secondary effects of classification matters may be negotiable. A negotiable proposal set the effective date of promotions resulting from reclassification of blocks of positions. <span class="Italic">PATCO and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 4 FLRA 232, 235 (1980) (discussed as to the negotiability of proposals concerning promotion). A proposal was proper that required management to refrain from reassigning work during the pendency of a classification appeal if the purpose of the reassignment was to avoid reclassification of the position. The proposal delayed the reassignment of work but it did not prevent management from acting at all to assign work. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 14 FLRA 243, 249-50 (1984) (Provision 3). A grievance over the accuracy of a position description was not a classification matter barred from arbitration. <span class="Italic">VARO, Winston-Salem and AFGE Local 2880</span>, 16 FLRA 50, 50-51 (1984). [Refer to Chapter 9, "<a href="0100-2023-17-012.html#sec9-13">Claim for Back Pay, Promotion</a>," for interplay of classification principles and promotion entitlement.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Helping to divide negotiable from nonnegotiable proposals concerning the classification process was <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3295 and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Thrift Supervision</span>, 47 FLRA 884, 900-02 (1993), involving Section 6 of Proposal 1, for joint labor-management review of classifications and subsequent correction of classification errors following arbitration. The review process was negotiable. The remedial procedure was not negotiable, FLRA adding in its discussion that it was immaterial for purposes of its negotiability determination whether the pay system for the agency required classification issues to be resolved under Chapter 51 of Title 5, USC:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(14)(B) of the Statute excludes matters related to the classification of positions from the definition of conditions of employment. Although the word "classification" is not defined in the Statute, it is commonly understood to mean the process by which a level of compensation is assigned to a particular position based on the duties and responsibilities of that position. <span class="Italic">See</span> Roberts, Dictionary of Industrial Relations 102 (3d ed. 1986). As relevant in this case, the first sentence of section 6 of Proposal 1 obligates the parties to jointly review the classification of all bargaining unit positions. Nothing in the wording of the this [sic] sentence, or in the record in this case, indicates that this sentence would require the Agency to take any particular action concerning the classification of any bargaining unit position. Rather, this sentence creates a forum for the exchange of information between the Union and management concerning Agency classification decisions. Consequently, even assuming that the establishment of a classification system for OTS employees is an aspect of the Director's sole and exclusive discretion to set the compensation of OTS employees, nothing in the first sentence is inconsistent with that discretion. In addition, insofar as the first sentence merely provides for a forum for the exchange of information between the Union and management concerning classification decisions, we find that the first sentence is not excluded from the obligation to bargain by section 7103(a)(14)(B) of the Statute. As such, we find the first sentence negotiable....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second sentence of section 6 would provide for arbitration (with the retroactive corrective action specified in the third sentence) of disputes as to the appropriateness of the grade levels assigned to positions in the bargaining unit. However, section 7121I(5) of the Statute excludes from the coverage of a grievance procedure negotiated under section 7121(a) and (b) any grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee."...&#8197;Because the second sentence of section 6 of Proposal 1 provides for arbitration of the appropriateness of the grade levels assigned to positions in the bargaining unit, it is inconsistent with section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. In addition, as the third sentence concerns the appropriate corrective action for employees found to have been undergraded as a result of the arbitration required by the second sentence, we find that the third sentence is inextricably linked to the second sentence, and is also inconsistent with section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, we reject the Union' [sic] claim that the term "classification," as used in the Statute, is limited to classification which is accomplished pursuant to a position-classification plan established by the Office of Personnel Management under chapter 51 of title 5 United States Code. We note, in this regard, that the Union has not referred to anything in the wording of the Statute, or in its legislative history, and no such reference is apparent to us which suggests that Congress sought to exclude from either the definition of conditions of employment set out in section 7103(a)(14)(B), or the coverage of negotiated grievance procedures required by section 7121(a) and (b), only those classification matters accomplished under chapter 51 of title 5 United States Code.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal Is nonnegotiable that has the direct effect of upgrading positions by requiring the agency to use a certain level of positions at a facility employing individuals below that level. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 948 and Dept. of Labor, Employment Standards Admin.</span>, 55 FLRA 582, 584 (1999), explained the bar to negotiability of Proposal 1, requiring the agency to fill claims examiner positions at the GS-12 level when the positions were, at the time of the proposal, GS-11:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(14)(B) excludes policies, practices, and matters relating to the classification of any position from the definition of conditions of employment and, by extension, the duty to bargain. In construing that section, the Authority relies on the definitions of the terms "classification" and "position" that appear in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 49 and U.S. Department of the Army, Army Corps of Engineers, South Pacific Division, San Francisco, California</span>, 52 FLRA 665, 667 (1996) <span class="Italic">(Corps of Engineers, San Francisco</span>). Pursuant to those definitions, the term "classification" means: "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by [the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)] under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code; and the term "position" means: "the work, consisting of the duties and responsibilities, assigned by competent authority for performance by an employee." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c) and I<span class="Italic">. Id. </span>At 667-68.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held consistently that a proposal that assigns a specific grade level to a specific existing position concerns a classification matter under section 7103(a)(14)(B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1978 and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation,</span> <span class="Italic">Lower Colorado Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada,</span> 51 FLRA 637, 641-45 (1995) (proposal to establish among existing employees a "leadman" position with a five percent increase in the employee's pay concerned classification); <span class="Italic">see also National Association of Government Employees Local R5-168 and U.S. Department of the Army, Fort Polk, Louisiana, </span>53 FLRA 1622, 1624-25 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Fort Polk</span>). In <span class="Italic">Fort Polk</span>, an agency audit determined that grades would be raised for some employees while the grades of other employees would be lowered and, in response, the Union proposed that the agency raise the grades of all the employees. The Authority found that, by identifying the series and grade into which specified positions would be placed, the proposal "relate[d] to the classification of those positions" and was outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1625. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also March Air Force Base, </span>13 FLRA at 258 ("[I]t appears that Congress intended to remove from the scope of bargaining threshold determinations as to what duties and responsibilities will constitute a given position and the placement of that position in a class for purposes of personnel and pay administration.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1, as construed, would require the Agency to classify the four GS-11 LSCEs as a specified series (991) and grade (12). Accordingly, consistent with the precedent cited above, we find that the proposal as construed relates to the classification of those positions. <span class="Italic">International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, Marine Division, Panama Canal Pilots Branch and Panama Canal Commission</span>, 51 FLRA 333, 339 (1995). Because the proposal concerns classification, it is outside the duty to bargain without regard to management's rights. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1978 and U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada</span>, 51 FLRA 637, 644 n.10 (1995) ("Because we have found that [the proposal], in its entirety, does not concern 'conditions of employment' within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14), we do not address the parties' arguments concerning section 7106.").
