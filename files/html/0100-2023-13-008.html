<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-9"><span class="space">3.</span> Matters Statutorily Entrusted to Agency Discretion</h4>
<p class="noindent">Agencies may argue that statutes vest them with exclusive authority to determine certain matters affecting employees, i.e., that they should be able to make those determinations free of collective bargaining obligations or constraints. FLRA avoids equating statutory discretion with nonnegotiability. Matters concerning conditions of employment within the agency's discretion are negotiable if the agency's discretion is not exclusive and if the matters to be negotiated are not inconsistent with law, rule, or regulation. Typical of the analysis is <span class="Italic">VA, VAMC, Veterans Canteen Serv., Lexington and NAGE Local R5-184</span>, 44 FLRA 162, 163-66 (1992), assessing negotiability of food prices at the medical center canteen:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent contends that the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the head of the Respondent Agency, has exclusive statutory authority to establish prices for goods or services provided by the Veterans' Canteen Service (VCS) in the Respondent's canteens, including its cafeterias, and that, therefore, it had no obligation under section 7114(a)(1) to bargain with the Union over the changes in cafeteria prices that affected the unit employees. We disagree with this contention, as did the Judge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an agency claims that a matter is not negotiable because it possesses statutory authority to take certain actions concerning that <span id="page_494"></span>matter, the Authority examines whether the authority granted to the agency is exclusive and unfettered or whether the agency may lawfully exercise its authority through collective bargaining. Thus, where law or applicable regulation vest an agency with unfettered discretion over a matter, the agency's discretion will not be subject to negotiation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, the Authority has consistently held that matters concerning conditions of employment over which an agency has discretion are negotiable if the agency's discretion is not exclusive and the matters to be negotiated are not otherwise inconsistent with law or applicable rule or regulation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Respondent argues that the statute establishing the VCS grants exclusive discretion to the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to establish prices in its canteens and cafeterias because it states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Secretary shall--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(7)&#x2003;fix the prices of merchandise and services in canteens so as to carry out the purposes of this chapter;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7802.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find nothing in the statute establishing the VCS or its legislative history that prohibits the Respondent from setting those prices through negotiation with the Union.&#x2003;Rather, the statute simply grants the Secretary of the Agency the discretion to fix the prices. Under established Authority law, that discretion may be exercised through negotiations....&#8197;Significantly, the statute contains no language excluding or limiting the application of other laws<span class="Italic">. Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span>, 851 F.2d at 1490-91 (where amendment to statute stated that "[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, no provision of title 5 or any other law pertaining to the civil service system which is inconsistent with any provision of [the applicable statute] shall be considered to supersede, override, or otherwise modify such provision of this subchapter[,]" court held that the agency's authority to determine conditions of employment was not subject to bargaining under the Statute);...<span class="Italic">Park Police</span>, 18 FLRA at 354-56 (where statute provides that it takes effect notwithstanding any other law, the appeals procedures of that statute constitute an exception to the negotiated grievance procedures mandated by the Statute). We consider the absence of such preemptive language in this case to be a strong indication that Congress did not intend the Secretary of the VA to have unfettered discretion to set prices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent also claims that the exclusive authority of the Secretary of the VA derives from 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7808, which is entitled "Service to be independent unit" and which states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It is the purpose of this chapter that, under control and supervision of the Secretary, the [VCS] shall function as an independent unit in the [VA] and shall have exclusive control over all its activities including sales, procurement and supply, finance, including disbursements, and personnel management, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we read this provision and its legislative history, its purpose was to ensure that the VCS would be operated as an independent entity within the VA, and not to dictate how the Secretary of the VA would exercise its delegated discretion regarding those operations....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the wording of 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7808, read in its entirety, and the explanatory material in the legislative history, we are not persuaded that the requirement that the VCS have "maximum direct control over its activities" is meant in any way to limit the scope of the discretion granted the Secretary of the VA by 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7802(7). Indeed, we note that although 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7808 also grants the VCS "exclusive controls" over "personnel management," the VCS is expressly included in section 7103(a)(3) of the Statute as an agency covered by the Statute. We view this express coverage under the Statute as indicating that Congress intended that the VCS have bargaining obligations with regard to matters of significant interest to its employees....&#8197;The Authority has consistently held that the pricing of food in a cafeteria used by employees is a mandatory subject of bargaining....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">This case concerns the Agency's duty to bargain over the implementation of the Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 (Accountability Act).[2] Arbitrator Hyman Cohen found that the Agency did not have a duty to bargain, and therefore, did not violate the parties' agreement or &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute) by unilaterally implementing the Accountability Act without providing notice and an opportunity to bargain.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the award is deficient because the Arbitrator's finding that there was no duty to bargain is contrary to the Statute. We agree.

<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The relevant facts of the case are straightforward.&#x2003;On June 23, 2017, the Accountability Act was signed into law, providing authority, under Title 38, for the Agency to address performance and misconduct concerns. On July 1, 2017, the Union submitted a demand to bargain implementation of the Accountability Act. The Agency proceeded to unilaterally implement the applicable provisions and procedures of the Accountability Act, without bargaining. Soon thereafter, the Union filed a national grievance against the Agency for its failure to engage in the bargaining process before implementing the Accountability Act, and subsequently invoked arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The stipulated issue was whether the Agency's unilateral implementation of the Accountability Act violated the Statute and the parties' agreement. The Arbitrator found that the Agency did not have a duty to bargain because, while the Accountability Act provided new procedures that would otherwise be conditions of employment, the procedures were not conditions of employment due to the Statute's exclusion of matters "specifically provided for by federal statute" from the definition of conditions of employment.[3] He also found that the Agency did not have a duty to bargain because it had sole and exclusive discretion over the matter.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The award is contrary to law because the Accountability Act does not specifically provide for all procedures that would preclude bargaining under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) and (3) of the Statute and the Agency does not have sole and exclusive discretion.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law when he found that the Agency did not have a duty to bargain over the implementation of the Accountability Act.&#x2003;Specifically, the Union argues the Accountability Act does not specifically provide for all aspects to be followed in exercising the authority provided, and it is not a matter over which the Agency has sole and exclusive discretion. The Union contends that it only sought to bargain over the implementation of the prescribed procedures. The Union also claims that the Arbitrator misunderstood the difference between the procedures that are prescribed by the Accountability Act and the bargaining over procedures and appropriate arrangements required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) and (3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After reviewing the record, we find that the award is contrary to law. The Accountability Act does not specifically provide for all aspects that would preclude bargaining over procedures and appropriate arrangements,[10] and the Accountability Act does not give the Agency sole and exclusive discretion that would excuse bargaining over those procedures and arrangements.[11]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">A. <span class="Italic">The Accountability Act does not specifically provide for all aspects that would preclude bargaining on its implementation and impact.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator correctly asserted that conditions of employment do not include "policies, practices, and matters--...<span class="Italic">to the extent such matters are specifically provided for</span> by statutes." However, the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law by concluding that mere mention of a matter precludes &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) and (3) bargaining. The Authority has rejected arguments that reference to a particular matter in a statute excepts that entire matter from the definition of conditions of employment.[14] Instead the Authority has found where "'the governing statute leaves any discretion to the agency'...that discretion is subject to being exercised through negotiation, and the matter is not specifically provided for by [f]ederal statute."[15]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Accountability Act leaves the Agency with discretion regarding aspects of the disciplinary process under Title 38.[16] While the Accountability Act leaves no discretion for the Agency on the timeline in a removal, demotion, or suspension,[17] it does give the Agency discretion in determining the form of the notice and how it is to be communicated to the employee, how the employee will respond, and whether the employee can request the record to assist in his or her response.[18] Therefore, the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law by summarily concluding that all bargaining was precluded because the Accountability Act specifically provided for some aspects of the disciplinary process under Title 38.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Luke Air Force Base v. FLRA</span>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit found that the Secretary of Defense had sole and exclusive discretion over access to commissaries and exchanges, relying on the fact that the language of the section governing commissaries and exchanges was almost identical to the language in the section that authorized Branch Secretaries to "'prescribe regulations to carry out [their] functions, powers, and duties under this title,' <span class="Italic">subject only to</span> 'the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense.'"[27] Here, however, the plain wording of the Accountability Act does not support a conclusion that the Agency has sole and exclusive discretion that would preclude bargaining over any processes, procedures, or matters relating to the disciplinary process provided by Title 38. For example, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(a)(1) provides "the Secretary may remove, demote, or suspend a covered individual...if the Secretary determines the performance or misconduct...warrants such removal, demotion, or suspension.[28] This is in contrast to another portion of Title 38, which provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">an issue of whether a matter or question concerns or arises out of (1) professional conduct, (2) peer review, or (3) the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation under this title <span class="Italic">shall be decided by the Secretary and is not itself subject to collective bargaining and may not be reviewed by another agency</span>.[29]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, if Congress intended to exclude &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) and (3) regarding the implementation of the Accountability Act, it could have used similar language as other portions of Title 38 to do so.[30]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history of the Accountability Act does not indicate that Congress intended to provide the Agency with sole and exclusive discretion.[31] Unlike <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, where the Authority found that the Agency had sole and exclusive authority to set the pay of employees because the House Report emphasized that "all personnel-related matters including determinations regarding pay are within the 'exclusive authority of the [Agency] to determine,'"[32] here, there is no such indication by Congress.[33] Therefore, we find that the Accountability Act does not provide sole and exclusive discretion over all processes, procedures, and matters related to the disciplinary process. Accordingly, we find that the award is contrary to law.

<p class="noindent">A statute vesting in the agency head the ability to require performance to be a dominant basis for determining RIF retention standing did not preclude bargaining over proposals setting weights for elements of ratings, <span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local 4, and Army Eng'r Research &#x0026; Dev.

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we consider the negotiability of a proposal that would require the Agency to consider a broad range of performance-based elements when determining which employees will be separated in a reduction in force (RIF). The Agency argues that the Union's proposal is non-negotiable under 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1597I because the Agency has sole and exclusive discretion to establish procedures for using performance as the primary factor in determining which employees will be separated in a RIF, and that the Union's proposal is otherwise both contrary to law and regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (the Act), effective December 25, 2015, added a new provision to Section 1597 of Title 10 of the United States Code (&#x00A7; 1597I) that stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Secretary of Defense shall establish procedures to provide that, in implementing any [RIF] for civilian positions in the Department of Defense in the competitive service or the excepted service, the determination of which employees shall be separated from employment in the Department shall be made primarily on the basis of performance, as determined under any applicable performance management system.[1]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">A RIF refers to the process that a federal agency can initiate, upon certain circumstances, to eliminate positions within the agency. On January 17, 2017, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum with guidance on new RIF policies and procedures. Included in the new policy was a provision addressing how ratings of record (performance ratings) would be established for RIF purposes, in order to make retention decisions. The provision stated, in relevant part, that: "An employee's rating of record is the average of the ratings of record drawn from the two most recent performance appraisals received by the employee within the four-year period preceding the 'cutoff date' established for the RIF."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties began negotiating over the new RIF policy in April 2017 and engaged in negotiations for over two years.&#x2003;During negotiations, the Union submitted a proposal that would require the Agency to consider a broader range of long-term performance elements in addition to the two most recent annual performance appraisals in order to determine the rating of record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Union's proposal is non-negotiable because the plain language of &#x00A7; 1597I and the legislative history of the Act demonstrate that the Agency has sole and exclusive discretion to establish the procedures for using performance as the primary factor in determining which employees will be separated in a RIF. When analyzing an agency's claim that a matter is not negotiable because it possesses sole and exclusive discretion to act concerning that matter, the Authority looks at the plain wording and legislative history of the statute in question.[10] While unfettered discretion is typically indicated by such phrases as "notwithstanding any law" or "without regard to the provisions of other laws," such a signal is not required and the entire wording of the legislation must be considered.[11] In the absence of any indication that Congress intended the agency's discretion to be sole and exclusive, the exercise of discretion through collective bargaining is consistent with law.[12]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find nothing in the plain language of the Act prohibiting the Agency from negotiating with the Union over its procedures for using performance as the primary factor in determining which employees will be separated in a RIF.

<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we disagree with the Agency that the legislative history of the Act indicates that Congress intended to provide the Agency with sole and exclusive discretion. The Agency points out that the subsection immediately following the subsection at issue here states that "[i]t is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Defense should proceed with the collaborative work with employee representatives on the 'New Beginnings' performance management and workforce incentive system authorized under section 1113 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal year 2010."[15] The Agency argues that if Congress had intended for the Agency to engage in collective bargaining regarding the establishment of the RIF procedures for using performance as the primary basis for retention, "it would have said so," and that the difference in language of these two subsections shows that "Congress was conscious of the distinction between giving the Secretary exclusive authority" and requiring him to collaborate with employee representatives.[16] We do not agree that Congress, in directing the Agency to collaborate with employee representatives on a matter the Agency pointed out is "unrelated"[17] to the RIF policy at issue here, intended by the absence of such a direction in a separate provision to give the Secretary sole and exclusive discretion over establishing the RIF procedures. Furthermore, we do not find any language in the legislative history specifically regarding the provision here indicating that Congress intended the Agency to have exclusive authority over the RIF procedures.[18] Thus, we find nothing in the legislative history of the Act indicating that Congress intended to give the Agency sole and exclusive discretion.[19] Consequently, we find that the Agency has failed to demonstrate that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain because it has sole and exclusive discretion.[20]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Our conclusion is consistent with existing precedent addressing similar statutory provisions.&#x2003;Where a statutory provision pertaining to a given subject matter provides for the matter to be determined "notwithstanding" or "without regard to" any other law, the provision affords agency officials "sole and exclusive discretion" to determine that subject matter<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent-1">If a law indicates that an agency's discretion over a matter affecting employees' conditions of employment is intended to be "sole and exclusive," i.e., that it is intended to be exercised only by the agency, "then the agency is not obligated under the Statute to exercise that discretion through collective bargaining." <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 59 FLRA at 816. In <span class="Italic">NIMA</span>, the Authority held that an agency's sole and exclusive discretion to establish certain conditions of employment without bargaining also precludes grievances and arbitration over those conditions, once established. 57 FLRA at 842-43.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that <span class="Italic">NIMA</span> was wrongly decided and requests that the Authority reexamine that decision. For the reasons that follow, we agree. In so doing, we reject our dissenting colleague's view that reexamination of <span class="Italic">NIMA</span> is not necessary because, even if <span class="Italic">NIMA</span> was wrongly decided, the grievance is not arbitrable under the parties' agreement and PPM 3110-30. In this regard, the Arbitrator based his award solely on his interpretation of <span class="Italic">NIMA</span>; he did not assess whether the grievance was nonarbitrable based on the parties' agreement, PPM 3110-30, or any other ground. It is well established that determining the meaning of an agreement is a matter for an arbitrator, rather than a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review by the Authority. <span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, Council 220,</span> 54 FLRA 156, 160 (1998) (remand to arbitrator appropriate where arbitrator failed to interpret potentially dispositive contract provision that appears to conflict with award).

Therefore, if the parties' agreement permits the grievance in this case, then any contrary terms in PPM 3110-30 are irrelevant. Further, if <span class="Italic">NIMA </span>was correctly decided, then there would be no basis to remand for interpretation of the parties' agreement. As such, we reexamine <span class="Italic">NIMA.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving this issue, two lines of Authority precedent are relevant. The first line of relevant Authority precedent involves the scope of negotiated grievance procedures. Section 7121 of the Statute provides, with certain exceptions not relevant here, that the negotiated grievance procedure "shall be the exclusive administrative procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1). The Authority has held that "Congress intended that la]ll matters that under the provisions of law could be submitted to the grievance procedures shall in fact be within the scope of any grievance procedures negotiated by the parties unless the parties agree as part of the collective bargaining process that certain matters shall not be covered by the grievance procedures."' <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 15,</span> 33 FLRA 229, 236 (1988) (quoting Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee on Conference, H.R. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong. 2d Sess., 157, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 2723, 2891)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A law may expressly preclude grievances over a particular subject matter.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121I (excluding certain matters from the scope of the grievance procedure). In addition, a law may create an exclusive appeals procedure with regard to certain matters and thereby preclude the use of the negotiated grievance procedure to challenge those matters. "[W]here laws other than the Statute limit the scope of negotiated grievance procedures, there have been clear, specific indications that the statutory procedures were intended to be exclusive." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3258,</span> 53 FLRA 1320, 1325 (1998) (citations omitted) (<span class="Italic">Local 3258</span>). In this connection, "where the exclusivity of an appeals procedure concerning certain challenges to an agency's conditions of employment decision is not established by the plain wording of a law, or its accompanying legislative history, the Authority has found that the negotiated grievance process is available." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1327. For example, "[w]here a statute states that an appeals procedure takes effect 'notwithstanding' any other law, such a statute constitutes a clear, specific indication that the statutory procedure is intended to be exclusive." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1326. In addition, "[e]ven where a law or regulation does not use such `notwithstanding' language, the Authority will find matters excluded from the negotiated grievance process if the expressed intent to do so is unmistakable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the first line of precedent here, 12 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 481 pertinently provides that the Comptroller shall employ certain individuals "without regard to the provisions of other laws applicable to officers or employees of the United States[,]" and 12 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 482 pertinently provides that, "[n]otwithstanding any of the provisions of [&#x00A7;] 481...to the contrary, the Comptroller...shall fix the compensation...of, and appoint and direct, all employees of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency." Neither &#x00A7; 481 nor &#x00A7; 482 states that matters concerning compensation are excluded from negotiated grievance procedures. In addition, neither &#x00A7; 481 nor &#x00A7; 482 creates an exclusive procedure--or any procedure, for that matter--for appealing applications of the Agency's established compensation policy. Thus, the first line of Authority precedent lends support to a conclusion that individual applications of the Agency's established compensation system are subject to the parties' negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second line of relevant Authority precedent involves the difference between the scope of bargaining and the enforceability of agreements--including the use of the negotiated grievance procedure to enforce those agreements. In this regard, it is well established that although a particular matter may be outside the duty to bargain as a permissive subject, if the parties reach an agreement over such a matter, then the agreement is enforceable in arbitration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wash., D.C.,</span> 56 FLRA 393, 395 (2000), <span class="Italic">reconsid. Denied,</span> 56 FLRA 935 (2000) (contract provisions involving permissive subjects under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute are enforceable in arbitration); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3302,</span> 52 FLRA 677, 68083 (1996) (Member Armendariz concurring) (contract provisions involving matters that are not conditions of employment, and thus permissive subjects, are enforceable in arbitration). Further, federal employment is governed by a host of laws and government-wide regulations that establish various conditions of employment. For example, it is well established that most federal employees are not entitled to bargain over their wage rates because those rates are established by law. <span class="Italic">E.g., Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge # IF,</span> 57 FLRA 373, 383 (2001) (wage rates of General Schedule employees are outside the duty to bargain). Nevertheless, grievances regularly are filed regarding agencies' alleged misapplication of established wage rates. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Small Bus./Self Employed Operating Div.,</span> 65 FLRA 23, 23 (2010) (grievance challenged agency's calculation of grievant's rate of pay upon her permanent promotion); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Okla. City, Okla.,</span> 64 FLRA 615, 615 (2010) (grievance alleged improper <span id="page_499"></span>termination of grievant's grade and pay retention). Therefore, there is a meaningful difference between what an agency is required to bargain over and what is grievable under a negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying that second line of precedent here, there is no dispute that the Agency had sole and exclusive discretion to establish employee compensation without bargaining. However, the mere fact that the Agency had no duty to bargain over compensation does not compel a conclusion that alleged misapplications of the Agency's established compensation system in PPM 3110-30 are not <span class="Italic">grievable</span>. In this regard, there is no dispute that PPM 3110-30 is an Agency regulation. The Authority has held that "unless there is a specific exclusion in the agreement, a grievance concerning a violation of an agency regulation...is arbitrable under negotiated grievance procedures." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Louisville Dist.,</span> 36 FLRA 375, 380 (1990). Thus, unless the parties' negotiated grievance procedure excludes alleged violations of PPM 3110-30 from its coverage--a matter that the Arbitrator did not reach, because he relied solely on <span class="Italic">NIMA</span>--such alleged violations would be included within the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure. In addition, the compensation grievance alleged a violation of not only PPM 3110-30, but also the parties' agreement. For these reasons, the second line of Authority precedent also lends support to a conclusion that &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 481 and 482 do not preclude the compensation grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NIMA</span>, the Authority stated that it would be "incongruous" for Congress to give sole and exclusive discretion over a matter without also precluding grievances over that matter, and that "the more compelling and reasonable statutory construction" of the statutory wording at issue in <span class="Italic">NIMA</span> was to preclude such grievances. 57 FLRA at 842. For support, the Authority cited: <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Ass 'n v. FLRA,</span> 851 F.2d 1486 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span>); <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 848 F.2d 1273 (D.C.

Ctr., Danville, Ill.,</span> 34 FLRA 131, 134-35 (1990) (<span class="Italic">VAMC Danville</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Authority did not address in <span class="Italic">NIMA</span> the two lines of precedent discussed above or explain how its decision was consistent with that precedent. Moreover, the decisions on which the Authority relied do not support a conclusion that sole and exclusive discretion to establish a particular matter precludes grievances over that matter. In this regard, <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses </span>and <span class="Italic">VAMC Danville </span>involved the application of title 38 of the United States Code, "an independent personnel system that...is exempt from all laws governing the terms and conditions of federal employment except as otherwise explicitly provided in" title 38. <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses,</span> 851 F.2d at 1489. By contrast, neither the laws at issue in NIMA nor the laws at issue here involve such an independent personnel system. In <span class="Italic">Local 3258,</span> the Authority actually found that a particular matter was not barred from a negotiated grievance procedure, <span class="Italic">see</span> 53 FLRA at 1327-30; thus, that decision did not support the Authority's conclusion in <span class="Italic">NIMA</span>.[7] Finally, in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> the court found that allowing probationary employees to use the negotiated grievance procedure to challenge their discharges would be contrary to law because, according to the court, the Civil Service Reform Act "affirmatively intended agencies to retain the power to summarily terminate probationary employees[,]" and that Office of Personnel Management regulations allowed agencies to dismiss probationary employees "with only written notice and a brief statement of reasons,...and an exceedingly limited right to appeal[&#8197;]...." 848 F.2d at 1275. Here, by contrast, there are no statutory or regulatory provisions that either indicate that agency applications of its established compensation system are not subject to review or specifically set out limited procedures for such review.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;We note that, in <span class="Italic">Local 3258,</span> the Authority characterized <span class="Italic">Illinois National Guard v. FLRA,</span> 854 F.2d 1396, 1402 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">Ill. Nat'l Guard</span>), as holding that matters over which an agency head has sole and exclusive discretion may not be covered by a negotiated grievance procedure. However, <span class="Italic">Ill. Nat'l Guard</span> addressed only the duty to bargain over union proposals regarding compressed work schedules, not whether a matter was grievable. Thus, <span class="Italic">Ill. Nat'l Guard</span> also did not support the Authority's conclusion in <span class="Italic">NIMA.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, two lines of Authority precedent support conclusions that: (1) sole and exclusive discretion to establish certain conditions of employment does not preclude grievances over individual applications of those conditions of employment, once established; and (2) in reaching a contrary conclusion in <span class="Italic">NIMA,</span> the Authority erred. Thus, we reverse <span class="Italic">NIMA</span> and conclude that nothing in the Agency's sole and exclusive discretion to establish compensation precludes grievances over individual application of the Agency's established compensation system. Consequently, we set aside the award.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">I. <span class="Italic">Statement of the Case</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has the sole&#8209;and&#8209;exclusive discretion to set the rates of pay for power&#8209;system dispatchers (dispatchers), so it was contrary to law for the Arbitrator to permit the Union to challenge the dispatchers' holiday&#8209;pay rate through the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. Accordingly, we set aside Arbitrator Fred D. Butler's award holding otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Awards</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Historically, the Agency had difficulty retaining dispatchers because they could earn more money elsewhere. Therefore, Congress gave the Agency the authority to set dispatchers' rates of basic and premium pay, "[n]otwithstanding provisions of title 5 [of the] United States Code [(Title 5)]," but required that dispatchers' "rates [be] based on those prevailing for similar occupations in the electric power industry."[1] The Agency has exercised this pay&#8209;setting authority since 1989.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;Act of Nov. 1, 1985, Pub. L. No. 99&#8209;141, 99 Stat. 564. In the same provision, Congress maintained an overall limit on dispatchers' rates of pay, but that limit is not relevant here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance on behalf of a group of dispatchers who alleged that they were not receiving the prevailing rate of pay for work on holidays.&#x2003;The Agency denied the grievance. At arbitration, as relevant here, the Arbitrator addressed whether the grievance was arbitrable and whether the Agency should have paid the dispatchers a higher rate of holiday premium pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the Arbitrator, the Agency emphasized that it had the authority to set dispatchers' pay notwithstanding Title 5, which contains not only the compensation provisions that apply to most federal&#8209;government employees, but also the Federal Service Labor&#8209;Management Relations Statute (the Statute).[2] And the parties negotiated their grievance procedure <span class="Italic">pursuant to</span> the Statute. Therefore, because the Agency had the authority to set dispatchers' pay <span class="Italic">notwithstanding</span> the Statute, the Agency argued that the dispatchers could not challenge their rates of holiday premium pay through a grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-7135.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator rejected the Agency's argument, citing the "important function[s]" of the negotiated grievance procedure and arbitration in the federal sector. Further, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had failed to provide dispatchers with prevailing holiday premium pay, and he awarded the grievants backpay. Finally, because the Union prevailed on most of the issues before the Arbitrator, he made the Agency responsible for two&#8209;thirds, and the Union responsible for one&#8209;third, of the costs of arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The award is contrary to the Agency's sole&#8209;and&#8209;exclusive discretion to set dispatchers' pay.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that dispatchers' holiday premium pay is not subject to grievances or arbitration because the Agency's pay&#8209;setting authority operates "notwithstanding" Title 5, which includes the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If a law indicates that an agency's discretion over a matter is "sole and exclusive"--in other words, that such discretion is intended to be exercised only by the agency--"then the agency is not obligated under the Statute to exercise that discretion through collective bargaining."[7] However, in <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 302</span> (<span class="Italic">Chapter 302</span>), the Authority held that, once an agency exercises its sole&#8209;and&#8209;exclusive discretion to establish an employee&#8209;compensation system, "<span class="Italic">individual applications</span>" of that system may be subject to grievances and arbitration.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA 815, 816 (2004); <span class="Italic">see also, e.g., Dep't of VA, VA Med.

<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;65 FLRA 746, 748 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case illustrates why the distinction between <span class="Italic">establishing</span> a compensation system and <span class="Italic">applying</span> that system is untenable in the context of sole&#8209;and&#8209;exclusive discretion.[9] Here, the Agency exercised its sole&#8209;and&#8209;exclusive discretion to establish a rate of holiday premium pay. Nevertheless, the Union filed a grievance on behalf of a group of dispatchers contesting the <span class="Italic">individual application</span> of that pay rate--a grievance of the type that the majority decision in <span class="Italic">Chapter 302</span> would permit. Then, using the grievance and arbitration processes that the Statute provides, the Union obtained an award that directs the Agency to <span class="Italic">change</span> its rate of holiday premium pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See id</span>. At 751 (Dissenting Opinion of Member Beck) ("If [certain]...compensation decisions are not subject to the coverage <span id="page_500"></span>of our Statute, then, <span class="Italic">a fortiori</span>, they are not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures that exist pursuant to our Statute.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By allowing the grievance and arbitration processes to apply to this dispute, the precedent set in <span class="Italic">Chapter 302</span> permitted the Union to employ provisions of Title 5--namely, the Statute--to override the Agency's pay&#8209;setting discretion, even though Congress prohibited that very result.[11] Therefore, we overrule previous decisions that distinguished between establishing and applying compensation systems in the context of sole&#8209;and&#8209;exclusive discretion.[12] If an agency's discretion over a matter is "sole and exclusive," then the exercise of that discretion is not subject to negotiation <span class="Italic">or</span> grievances and arbitration.[13]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Applying that rule here, the Arbitrator's award is contrary to the statute granting the Agency sole&#8209;and&#8209;exclusive discretion to set dispatchers' pay notwithstanding Title 5. Accordingly, we set aside the award.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that if a law indicates that an agency's discretion is intended to be exercised only by the agency--referred to by the Authority as "sole and exclusive" discretion--then the agency is not obligated under the Statute to exercise that discretion through collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R5-136</span>, 56 FLRA 346. 348 (2000); <span class="Italic">POPA, 53 </span>FLRA 625, 648 (1997). In determining whether an agency's discretion is sole and exclusive, the Authority examines the plain wording and the legislative history of the relevant statute. <span class="Italic">See Int'l</span> <span class="Italic">Assoc. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Franklin Lodge No. 2135</span>, 50 FLRA 677, 691-92 (1995), petition for review denied as to other matters, 88 F.3d 1279 (D.C. Cir. 1996). A law need not use any specific phrase or words in order to confer sole and exclusive discretion. <span class="Italic">See ACT, Tex. Lone Star Chapter 100, 55</span> FLRA 1226, 1229 n.7 (2000), petition for review denied as to other matters, 250 F.3d 778 (D.C. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 4(a) of the Act provides that the "conduct of any demonstration project shall not be limited by...any provision of [Title 5] which is inconsistent with the action, including any provision of law...(7) relating to the methods of involving...labor organizations...in personnel decisions." Collective bargaining is one method by which labor organizations become involved in personnel decisions under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114. <span class="Italic">See also United States Dep't of Justice, INS, Wash., DC, </span>56 FLRA 351, 356 (2000). On its face, therefore, &#x00A7; 4(a)(7) refers to, among other things, collective bargaining under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the GC's argument that it is necessary not only to find that &#x00A7; 4(a)(7) refers to collective bargaining but also that collective bargaining is inconsistent with the Act. In our view, the GC's argument is not supported by the plain, and complete, wording of &#x00A7; 4(a). In this regard, &#x00A7; 4(a) specifies, in relevant part, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The conducting of any such demonstration project shall not be limited by any lack of specific authority under title 5, United States Code, to take the action contemplated, or by any provision of such title or any rule or regulation prescribed under such title which is inconsistent with the action, including any provision of law, rule or regulation relating to [the matters enumerated in subsections I through 8].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the GC views the enumerated matters as provisions from which the Respondent is exempt only if <span class="Italic">they are inconsistent </span>with the Respondent's authority, we believe that the better view is that the enumerated matters are provisions that Congress has deemed are <span class="Italic">inconsistent </span>with the Act. Section 4(a) provides that the Respondent is not limited by any provision of law "which is inconsistent" with Respondent's actions. The matters set forth in subsections (1) through (8) are examples of such inconsistent provisions--not examples of provisions that may or may not be inconsistent. In deciding whether the Respondent is exempt from provisions relating to matters other than those enumerated it would be necessary to determine whether the provisions are inconsistent. For the enumerated matters, however, Congress has made the determination that they are inconsistent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other aspects of the Act are consistent with this finding.&#x2003;For example, &#x00A7; 4(b) of the Act requires the Respondent to consult only with the board of regents when developing a demonstration project. Although the Respondent may consult with others it deems "appropriate," it is not required to do so. The GC is correct that the terms "consult" and "negotiate" are not the same. However, it is reasonable to conclude, as the Judge did, that if the Respondent is not obligated even to consult with the Charging Party, then the Respondent likewise was not obligated to bargain. Section 4(c) of the Act is also consistent with the Judge's conclusion. In this regard, &#x00A7; 4(c)(3) provides that a demonstration project may not require employees to pay union dues. As the Judge pointed out, &#x00A7; 4(c)(3) restates a provision in the Statute and, as a result, would be unnecessary if the Statute applied to the demonstration project.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, although &#x00A7; 4I(2)--which provides that a demonstration project may not impose a duty to bargain over classification, pay, benefits, or other forms of compensation--implies that the Respondent is prohibited from bargaining only over those subjects, that is not inconsistent with a conclusion that the Respondent has sole and exclusive discretion to decide whether to bargain over other aspects of the demonstration project. In this connection, the Authority has routinely found that statutes vested agencies with sole and exclusive discretion with respect to particular subject matters. <span class="Italic">See, for</span> <span class="Italic">example, AFGE, Local 3295, </span>47 FLRA 884, 893 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. AFGE, Local 3295 v. FLRA, </span>46 F.3d 73, 76 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision had sole and exclusive discretion to determine employee compensation). Nothing in those decisions holds or implies that the affected agencies were thereby required to bargain, or excused from bargaining, over other subject matters. For similar reasons, the GC's reliance on &#x00A7; 4(h)(3)(D), which provides that collective bargaining agreements continue to exist under the Act, is misplaced. In this regard, the Respondent's discretion under the Act applies, by its terms, only to the demonstration project. Thus, the Act would not affect the Respondent's bargaining obligation with respect to changes in employees' conditions of employment that are unrelated to the demonstration project.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Two additional factors support the Judge's decision. First, at the time the Act was promulgated, there was authority--the demonstration statute set forth in 5 U.S.C. chapter 47--for demonstration projects. With one notable exception, the Act and the demonstration statute are essentially identical with respect to relevant provisions. Both contain provisions permitting the conduct of demonstration projects without limitation by inconsistent provisions of title 5, and both enumerate as one particular provision "the methods of involving...labor organizations in personnel decisions." 25 U.S.C. 3731, note, &#x00A7; 4(a)(7); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4703(a)(7). The one notable exception is that, unlike the demonstration statute, the Act does not require consultation or negotiation prior to inclusion of unit employees in a demonstration project. The fact that the Act is patterned virtually word-for-word on the demonstration statute but does not require consultation/negotiation is an indication that the intent of the drafters of the Act was to exempt the Respondent from such requirement. Further, the fact that the demonstration statute included a requirement for consultation/negotiation is, itself, an indication that without that provision, the demonstration statute would not require it. <span class="Italic">See Phoenix Area Indian</span> <span class="Italic">Health Serv., Sacaton Serv. Unit, Hu Hu Kam Mem'l</span> <span class="Italic">Hosp., Sacaton, Ariz., </span>53 FLRA 1200, 1210-11 (1998) (where Authority found that virtually identical provisions from different acts should be "read consistently"). Without the provision, the demonstration statute and the Act are functionally identical.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the legislative history supports construing the Act as providing sole and exclusive discretion. The GC claims, in this regard, that the Judge's reliance on statements in the minority report was "pure conjecture." However, by its terms, the wording of the minority report clearly indicates that those opposing the Act believed that the Respondent had sole and exclusive discretion.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Judge's Decision at 15 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 105-700, pt. 1, at 12 (1998)). Therefore, it is relevant to the issue, and supports the Judge's conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude that the Respondent had sole and exclusive discretion to determine whether to bargain with the Charging Party over the demonstration project prior to its implementation. Therefore, the Respondent's failure to do so did not violate the Statute and the complaint is dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent">But the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) was construed not to give the agency exclusive discretion to discontinue preexisting access by employees to web-based email services, <span class="Italic">DHS, ICE and AFGE Council 118</span>, 67 FLRA 501, 502-05 (2014) (Member Pizzella dissenting) (reviewing an arbitrator's award):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Authority should interpret FISMA as giving the Agency sole and exclusive discretion to take "security actions to protect" information systems under the Agency's control, and the Agency contends that the webmail block in this case was such an action. Matters concerning conditions of employment over which an agency has discretion are negotiable if the agency's discretion is not sole and exclusive, and if the matters to be negotiated are not otherwise inconsistent with law or applicable rule or regulation.[21] In resolving claims of sole and exclusive discretion, the Authority "examines the plain wording and the legislative history of the statute being relied on."[22] For example, the Authority has found sole and exclusive discretion where a statute empowered an agency to act "without regard to the provisions of <span id="page_501"></span>other laws applicable to officers or employees of the United States,"[23] and also when a statute provided that an agency's conduct "shall not be limited by...any provision of law...relating to the methods of involving...labor organizations...in personnel decisions."[24] Although a law need "not use any specific phrase or words in order to confer sole and exclusive discretion,"[25] the absence of wording that expressly preempts the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute or other laws is a "strong indication that Congress did not intend the [agency] to have unfettered discretion"[26] over a matter.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With regard to FISMA's legislative history, the Agency argues that the Authority should interpret FISMA in light of Congress's concern with "terrorists, transnational criminals, and foreign intelligence services...us[ing] tools such as computer viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, and eavesdropping sniffers that can destroy, intercept, degrade the integrity of, or deny access to information and systems."[34] The Agency also contends that, because "the level of protection that agencies provide should be commensurate with the risk to agency operations and assets,"[35] the protection of information systems containing criminal-investigative materials should be under an agency's sole and exclusive discretion. However, neither Congress's concern with the security of information systems, nor its conviction that agencies should tailor their responses to address that concern, demonstrates congressional intent to vest the Agency with sole and exclusive discretion over information-security matters. In other words, the legislative history is consistent with the Agency's obligation to bargain to the extent of its discretion regarding its information-security policies.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The dissent disagrees with our analysis, but does not explain how the wording or the legislative history of 44 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3544(a)(2)(C) and (b)(2)(D)(iii) supports the Agency's claim of sole and exclusive discretion. Rather, the dissent focuses on the number of pages in the arbitration-hearing transcript and the Agency's brief; a vacated federal-district-court opinion;[37] the appeals-court decision that vacated that district-court opinion (and that, as the appeals court stated, did not involve "FISMA compliance");[38] and the number of cyber attacks at agencies other than the one in this dispute. Those factors provide no basis for finding sole and exclusive discretion. And although the dissent quotes extensively from post-enactment FISMA guidance--which, by definition, is not FISMA's legislative history--none of that guidance indicates congressional intent to preempt the Statute either. Further, the dissent's suggestion that the Statute should not apply in this case because Congress enacted it before the "advent of the internet, is unsupported. Indeed, courts employ the very opposite presumptions: "[S]tatutes continue in force until abrogated by subsequent action of the legislature."[42] In this respect, we agree with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which explained that "we cannot simply say [a] statute is 'too old' and decline to apply it to...newer technology."[43] And besides that general presumption, we note that one of the Statute's primary architects specifically stated that the Authority should treat the "concept of negotiability" as a "dynamic and growing one" such that it would never presume, as the dissent does, that the Statute was insufficiently "responsive to changing and particularized circumstances."[44]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As for the dissent's suggestion that FISMA should be read to confer sole and exclusive discretion because it deals with time-sensitive information-security threats, there is no dispute that Congress considered an agency's right to safeguard internal security extremely important. Specifically, Congress expressly set forth management's right to determine the "internal[-]security practices of the agency"[45]--which undoubtedly includes the right to establish information-security practices[46]--as one of the first management rights listed in the Statute. But, by the very act of including this provision in &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute and making it subject to bargaining under &#x00A7; 7106(b),[47] Congress signaled that collective bargaining is wholly compatible with management's right to determine internal-security practices.[48] And while Congress instructed agencies (in FISMA) to protect federal information security, it also expressly included in the Statute an injunction to "safeguard[&#8197;] the public interest"[49] and "contribute[&#8197;] to the effective conduct of public business"[50] through the institution of collective bargaining. Although attaining both internal-security and collective-bargaining objectives may require planning and coordination, the laws at issue here (FISMA and the Statute) assign that responsibility in various ways to federal managers <span class="Italic">and</span> their union counterparts.[51] In fact, Congress--by simultaneously finding both that the Statute "should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient [g]overnment"[52] and that "labor organizations and collective bargaining in the civil service are in the public interest"[53]--clearly envisioned that the parties would collaborate to further their shared interest in a secure, safe, effective, and efficient government.[54] By finding sole and exclusive discretion based on the mere presence of internal-security considerations, the dissent would sacrifice the benefits that Congress intended collective bargaining to provide. And by suggesting that the Authority has "no...standing" to apply the Statute in cases that implicate other statutes, like FISMA, the dissent ignores the responsibility Congress assigned the Authority to apply the Statute in the legally complex environment of the federal government. There can be no serious debate that the Authority not only can but also must interpret laws other than the Statute in resolving disputes.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we note that the Arbitrator interpreted the parties' agreement as permitting "expedited implementation of new policies or practices" in some situations. But in the circumstances of this case, the Arbitrator found the Agency's expressed security <span class="Italic">concerns</span> were inconsistent with the Agency's <span class="Italic">actions</span>, which the Arbitrator found "less than deliberate and speedy." And given these actions--which included the Agency's allowing violations of its webmail policy for years, its waiting six months between deciding to block webmail and actually implementing the block, and its decision to un-block webmail for two months--there is no basis for finding that, as a practical matter, the Agency actually was attempting to expedite its decision or that bargaining with the Union before implementing the change would have impeded any such attempts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that the Arbitrator did not direct the Agency to restore employees' access to webmail, or to bargain over the substance of the change; he directed bargaining over only the impact and implementation of that change. Thus, nothing in the award or our decision requires the Agency to bargain over proposals that actually conflict with law or government-wide regulation, including FISMA. Rather, we hold only that the Agency has not demonstrated that the cited provisions of FISMA foreclose bargaining <span class="Italic">altogether</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Agency has not established that the Arbitrator erred in finding that it lacked sole and exclusive discretion over the matters in dispute. Consequently, the Agency has not provided a basis for finding the award contrary to law.</p>

<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit stepped into the <span class="Italic">Luke AFB </span>cases to set aside FLRA's views of what constitutes statutory grants of agency discretion, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Luke AFB v. FLRA</span>, 844 F.3d 957, 958-64 (D.C. Cir. 2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Labor Relations Authority ordered the Air Force to bargain collectively with its civilian employees over access to an on-base shoppette--a gas station and convenience store that forms part of the military's network of commissaries and exchanges. The Air Force challenges that decision, arguing, among other things, that the issue is not a proper subject of bargaining because Congress has given the military unfettered discretion to determine whether civilians may patronize commissaries and exchanges. For the reasons set forth below, we agree and grant the Air Force's petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin with the Air Force's first argument, and because it relies on a particular interpretation of several provisions of Title 10, we think it best to proceed by first exploring the parties' understanding of these provisions and then setting forth our own interpretation of the statute's meaning. In doing so, we owe the Authority no deference, as we "review[&#8197;] <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the FLRA's interpretation of a statute it is not charged with administering." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 648 F.3d 841, 846 (D.C. Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force anchors its unfettered-discretion argument in 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2481, which provides that "[t]he Secretary of Defense shall operate, in the manner provided by this chapter and other provisions of law, a world-wide system of commissary stores and a separate world-wide system of exchange stores." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2481(a). Both systems may "sell, at reduced prices, food and other merchandise" to a closed set of military and military-related patrons--i.e., "members of the uniformed services on active duty, members of the uniformed services entitled to retired pay, dependents of such members, this title." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 101(a)(5) (defining "uniformed services"). Chapter 54 extends shopping privileges to members of the Guard and Reserve, along with certain retirees, dependents, and survivors. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1061-1064. Section 2481 also sets forth Congress's reasons for creating these stores, explaining that they are "intended to enhance the quality of life of members of the uniformed services, retired members, and dependents of such members, and to support military readiness, recruitment, and retention." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2481(b). As the Air Force points out, missing from section 2481's list of authorized patrons and beneficiaries is any mention of civilian employees of the Defense Department.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force then moves to a more specific provision of Title 10, section 2484, which prescribes in subsection (b) an exacting list of goods that may be sold in commissaries: "[m]eat, poultry, seafood, and fresh-water fish," etcetera. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2484(b). Subsection (c)(1) provides that the Secretary may add additional items to that list, so long as he notifies Congress, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 2484(c)(1), and subsection (c)(2) then explains that "[n]otwithstanding [subsection (c)](1), the Department of Defense military resale system shall continue to maintain the <span class="Italic">exclusive right to operate</span> convenience stores, <span class="Italic">shopettes</span>, and troop stores...[,]" <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 2484(c)(2) (emphases added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force argues that the phrase "exclusive right to operate...shopettes," <span class="Italic">id</span>., means what it says: that the military has unfettered discretion to operate "shopettes" like the one at Luke AFB. And because, in its view, "common usage [of] the term 'operate' includes access determinations," Congress conferred "unfettered discretion" on the military to determine who may patronize commissaries and exchanges, thereby exempting the Air Force from bargaining over the union's proposal, <span class="Italic">see Illinois National Guard</span>, 854 F.2d at 1402.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For its part, the Authority argues that section 2484I(2)'s reference to the Secretary's "exclusive right to operate...shopettes" relates not to who can patronize them, but rather only to the selection of merchandise and the setting of prices. The Authority also points out that the commissary-and-exchange provisions nowhere state that the Secretary has authority to control access "'notwithstanding' other provisions of law"--language that, according to the Authority, this court has found signals congressional intent to exempt an agency from the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See</span> Respondent's Br. 38 (quoting <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Association v. FLRA</span>, 851 F.2d 1486, 1488 (D.C. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">superseded by statute</span>, Department of Veterans Affairs Labor Relations Improvement Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-40, title II, &#x00A7; 202, 105 Stat. 187, 200, <span class="Italic">as recognized in National Federation of Federal Employees Local 589 v. FLRA</span>, 73 F.3d 390, 390-91 (D.C. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree that Congress has given the military unfettered discretion to determine whether civilians may patronize commissaries and exchanges, though for reasons that are slightly different from those offered by the Air Force. Our starting point is section 113(b) of Title 10, which gives the Secretary of Defense "the authority, direction, and control over the Department of Defense." 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 113(b). Sections 3013, 5013, and 8013, in turn, grant the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force "the authority necessary to conduct[&#8197;] all affairs of the[ir respective] Department[s]," including the "functions [of]...Recruiting[,]...Administering (including the morale and welfare of personnel)[,]...and Maintaining" Department personnel. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3013(b); 5013(b); 8013(b). Those sections also authorize the Branch Secretaries to "prescribe regulations to carry out [their] functions, powers, and duties under this title," subject only to "the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3013(b), (g); 5013(b), (g); 8013(b), (g).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These three enumerated duties--recruiting, administering, and <span id="page_503"></span>maintaining--appear in almost identical form in section 2481, in which Congress explained that it "intended [commissaries and exchanges]...to <span class="Italic">support military readiness, recruitment, and retention</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2481(b) (emphasis added). The symmetry between these purposes and the functions delineated in sections 3013, 5013, and 8013 is unmistakable, and we draw from it two basic conclusions. First, Congress intended commissaries and exchanges to advance the objectives of recruiting, administering, and maintaining the armed forces. Second, Congress gave the Branch Secretaries authority to decide how best to achieve those objectives, subject only to direction by the Secretary of Defense. <span class="Italic">See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3013(b), (g); 5013(b), (g); 8013(b), (g).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given these legislative directives, we cannot imagine that Congress intended to empower a civilian agency like the Federal Labor Relations Authority to second-guess the military's judgment about non-military access to commissaries and exchanges. As the Supreme Court has made clear, "[i]n construing a statute that touches on" matters of internal military governance, like troop morale or discipline, "courts must be careful not to circumscribe the authority of military commanders to an extent never intended by Congress." <span class="Italic">Brown v. Glines</span>, 444 U.S. 348, 360 (1980) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have taken this concern seriously in the federal-labor-relations context, declining to require bargaining over proposals that could potentially undermine military judgment even where the relevant statute never expressly shields the military from bargaining. In <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1623 v. FLRA</span>, 852 F.2d 1349 (D.C. Cir. 1988), for example, we found "unbargainable" a proposal by dual-status guard technicians that would have required civilian supervisors to attempt to "convince military officials to assign personnel in some manner other than the one they originally thought best." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1352. Although the proposal would not have led to civilians directly interfering with military-management choices, and although the Technician Act "d[id] not <span class="Italic">specifically</span> countermand the Local's proposal," we concluded that it fell outside the duty to bargain because it would "subject [military personnel decisions] to civilian <span class="Italic">influence</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1352-53 (second emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2953 v. FLRA</span>, 730 F.2d 1534, 1544-46 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (rejecting a proposal requiring military leaders to disregard National Guard technicians' military evaluations in favor of civilian evaluations when conducting layoffs, where the statute's purpose was "to assure that the <span class="Italic">military</span> mission of the Guard would be carried out effectively and efficiently").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, by requiring negotiation over the Shoppette proposal, the Authority has similarly second-guessed the Secretary's judgment in deciding how best to use a military benefit to achieve military purposes. The panel arbitrator required civilian access to the Shoppette because, in her view, "it is illogical that it is acceptable to have civilians enter a store to buy hot dogs, but damaging to [troop] morale if they are allowed to purchase aspirin, batteries, or tissues." Agreeing with the arbitrator, the Authority reasoned that nothing in Title 10 "suggests that the incremental extension of benefits...from hot dogs to aspirin, batteries, [and] tissues...is unlawful." <span class="Italic">Local 1547 II</span>, 67 F.L.R.A. at 530 (internal quotations marks omitted) (alteration in original). But the Air Force Secretary, exercising his delegated "authority...to conduct[&#8197;] all affairs of the Department" subject only to review by the Defense Secretary, 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8013(b), decided otherwise. Contrary to both the arbitrator and the Authority, this case is not about hot dogs and aspirin, but rather whether the military retains its unfettered authority to determine if and under what circumstances non-military persons may enjoy access to commissaries and exchanges.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2761 v. FLRA</span>, 866 F.2d 1443 (D.C. Cir. 1989), we concluded that access to a military exchange fell within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1447. But that decision predated by fifteen years Congress's enactment of Title 10's commissary-and-exchange provisions which, as we have explained, vest the Secretary with sole discretion over civilian-employee access to commissaries and exchanges. <span class="Italic">See</span> Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, Pub. L. No. 108-375, &#x00A7; 651, 118 Stat. 1811, 1964-73 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority nonetheless argues that the Shoppette proposal is negotiable because nothing in Title 10 expressly precludes civilian employees from bargaining over access to commissaries and exchanges.&#x2003;In support, it points to <span class="Italic">Illinois National Guard</span>, in which we held that the Technician Act gives the Army Secretary unfettered discretion to determine National Guard technicians' work schedules because the statute provides that, "[n]otwithstanding [the scheduling and overtime provisions] of title 5 or any other provision of law, the Secretary concerned may...prescribe the hours of duty for technicians." 854 F.2d at 1401 (quoting 33 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(g)(2) (1988) (emphasis omitted)); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) v. FLRA</span>, 435 F.3d 1049, 1051 (2006) (holding that Comptroller of the Currency had sole and exclusive discretion over bank-examiner salaries where Congress provided that the "'employment and compensation of examiners...shall be without regard to the provisions of other laws applicable to officers or employees of the United States'" (quoting 12 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 481 (2006))). Since Title 10 contains no similar carve-out for commissaries and exchanges, the FLRA reasons, Congress must have intended them to be a proper subject of collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's argument suffers from two flaws. First, although it is true that the Authority "consider[s] the absence of such preemptive language...to be a strong indication that Congress did not intend [an agency] to have unfettered discretion" over a given matter, <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Administration Medical Center, Veterans Canteen Service</span>, 44 F.L.R.A. 162, 164-65 (Feb. 28, 1992), neither it--nor for that matter this Court--has ever held that a statute <span class="Italic">must</span> contain phrases like "notwithstanding any law" to place a subject outside an agency's duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, in each of the cases cited by the Authority, the agency argued that the statute it administered--a statute that expressly addressed employment matters, such as hours, pay, and benefits, for a defined category of federal employees--exempted it from Title 5's broadly applicable civil-service rules, including collective-bargaining requirements. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury</span>, 435 F.3d at 1051 (interpreting statute giving the Treasury Secretary authority to employ and compensate bank examiners); <span class="Italic">Illinois National Guard</span>, 854 F.2d at 1403 (interpreting statute giving the Army Secretary authority to set work schedules for dual-status guard technicians); <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Association</span>, 851 F.2d at 1488 (interpreting statute giving the Secretary of Veterans Affairs authority to control hours and working conditions of medical personnel). In this case, however, the Air Force is not seeking to exempt itself from collective bargaining; it merely seeks to limit the scope of bargaining with respect to a matter that it believes Congress has committed to its unfettered discretion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, Title 10's commissary-and-exchange provisions differ significantly from the statutes at issue in the case cited by the Authority. Those statutes all directly addressed an agency's employment-related authority, so it makes sense that the FLRA would describe its interpretive task as "ascertain[ing] whether Congress has clearly expressed an intent to <span class="Italic">deprive employees</span> of their rights under the [FSLMRS]." <span class="Italic">See Colorado Nurses</span>, 851 F.2d at 1489 (court must determine whether Congress intended to "exempt [a federal employer] from all laws governing the terms and conditions of federal employment"). Title 10's commissary-and-exchange provisions stand on wholly different footing, as they have absolutely nothing to do with civilian employment and everything to do with creating a military benefit designed to "support military readiness, recruitment, and retention." 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2481(b). Given Congress's focus on defining a military benefit, which has nothing at all to do with terms and conditions of civilian employment, it would have had no reason to include a "notwithstanding" clause exempting that benefit from "'other laws applicable to [civilian] <span class="Italic">officers or employees of the United States</span>.'" <span class="Italic">National Treasury</span>, 435 F.3d at 1051 (quoting 12 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 481).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For all of these reasons, we hold that civilian access to commissaries and exchanges is not a proper subject of collective bargaining because Congress has vested the military with "unfettered discretion" over the matter. <span class="Italic">See Illinois National Guard</span>, 854 F.2d at 1401....</p>
<p class="noindent">Vacating an arbitrator's award reviewing a grievance concerning an agency's refusal to waive debt collection for a salary overpayment, and over the persuasive dissent of Chairman DuBester, FLRA determined that the agency had exclusive, nonreviewable authority to determine "whether there is fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee requesting the waiver," <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRBU</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-25.html">72 FLRA 133</a>, 135 (2021) (Chairman DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5584(b)(1), governing waiver of debt as a result of salary overpayment, because the Agency has the discretion to evaluate any indication of fault by the grievant. The Agency also argues that under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5584(b)(1), once the Agency's authorized official finds that the grievant is at fault, the official <span class="Italic">must</span> reject any request for a debt waiver.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that if a law indicates that an agency's discretion over a matter is intended to be sole and exclusive, or exercised only by the agency, then, under the Statute, the agency is not required to exercise discretion on that matter through collective bargaining and the matter may not be grieved.[21] In determining whether discretion is sole and exclusive, the Authority examines the plain wording of the relevant law.[22]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5584(a) states that an authorized official may properly waive a debt arising from an erroneous payment if, as relevant here, the collection of that payment would be "against equity and good conscience."[23] However, the authorized official's discretion is limited. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5584(b)(1), in granting such a waiver, the authorized official "may not exercise his authority...to waive any claim...if, in his <span id="page_504"></span>opinion, there exists, in connection with the claim an indication of fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the employee...[requesting] a waiver of the claim."[24] Because &#x00A7; 5584 prohibits the Agency from granting a waiver if the authorized official believes there is fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the requesting employee, &#x00A7; 5584 also prohibits an arbitrator from second guessing such an agency determination through the negotiated grievance process.[25]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;For the reasons discussed in this decision, we overrule prior Authority decisions holding to the contrary. <span class="Italic">E.g., Overseas Priv. Inv. Corp</span>., 68 FLRA 982 (2015) (<span class="Italic">OPIC</span>) (Member Pizzella dissenting). The dissent cites a 1987 Authority decision upholding an arbitrator's debt-waiver determination. Dissent at 7 n.1. However, that decision contains minimal legal analysis and no analysis whatsoever of whether agency determinations of fault may be grieved. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Navy Pub. Works Ctr</span>., 27 FLRA 156, 157-58 (1987) (rejecting agency exception arguing that the arbitrator's award conflicted with Comptroller General decisions as "mere disagreement" with the arbitrator). Even if the Authority has repeatedly considered exceptions to such awards, that is no reason to keep repeating the same mistake. <span class="Italic">See OPIC</span>, 68 FLRA at 988 (Dissenting Opinion of Member Pizzella) ("If...'two wrongs don't make a right,' it is readily obvious that a third will not bring about a good result."). The dissent fails to explain how the plain wording of &#x00A7; 5584 empowers arbitrators to do what the Agency itself cannot--grant a debt waiver where the authorized official, "in his opinion," believes there is fraud, misrepresentation, fault, or lack of good faith on the part of the requesting employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5584(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's authorized official found that, in his opinion, the grievant was at fault because, as an experienced federal employee, she should have raised the legitimacy of her early promotion with the appropriate personnel.[26] And, under the plain wording of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5584, once the authorized official finds any amount of fault, he is prohibited from granting a waiver.[27]</p>
