<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-210"><span class="space">12.</span> Settlement of Fee Claim</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Fee petitions can generate a second generation of litigation. It might be best if Congress enacted a provision stating that all winners recover fees at a set rate per hour for counsel. Until then, litigation over fees will continue. Most Board AJs know nothing about the economics of private practice, having arrived at the Board from another government job. Agency lawyers know little about billing practices and are not in a position, given the short period of time for the response to the fee motion, to gather information supporting a responsible challenge to either the accuracy or the reasonableness of a fee motion. What can be done to improve matters? First, if large sums are involved in a fee motion, a hearing and opportunity for discovery should be routinely granted concerning issues in contention. Second, there is everything to be said for the use of expert witnesses concerning fee motions. AJs, who have both the authority to regulate the course of the proceedings and the duty to develop evidence to avoid injustice or misapplication of law, may call their own witnesses, and this has been done in fee disputes. Third, settlement is <span id="Page_4737"></span>the most reasonable approach: if fees are going to be awarded, the ultimate award will include the time spent litigating the issues relating to the size of the fees. If the Board errs and forces a petition for review, the agency, i.e., the employer, pays to correct the Board's mistake. There is no good reason for counsel to scrimp on his time in a fee contest if some award is certain. This means that there is every reason for the agency to avoid further damage by settling the case as early as possible. Some fee settlements exceed $50,000. Active intervention by the AJ in the settlement process in a fee dispute may avoid protracted litigation of secondary issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Regarding settlement and all aspects of litigation over fee petitions, the agency ought to be represented by counsel if a case has reached the level of a fee petition. A few agencies still provide representatives to the Board who are not lawyers. Someone who has no knowledge about the practice of law cannot be expected to offer cogent analysis of a lawyer's skill, rates, or time involved. A layman will not have the trust or respect of appellant's counsel when the time comes to speak of settlement of the fee dispute. A layman cannot provide management with the expert advice needed to evaluate or settle a fee petition. The result can be that the fee petition is paid, but without proper scrutiny, or the fee litigation continues without proper resolution, and the agency's potential and actual liability increases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the parties may reach an oral settlement that may form the basis for dismissal of a fee petition (the far better practice is a written agreement), the AJ should ensure that the parties are aware of their right to have a written settlement entered into the record for purposes of enforcement, and the AJ should explain the requisites and procedures for the agreement to be recorded and capable of enforcement. <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 38 MSPR 584, 587 (1988). The settlement of a counsel fee motion should be in writing, and filed with and accepted by the Board, if enforcement is to be secured through Board procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Swanson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-10-0650-X-1 (NP 12/23/2013) ("We likewise decline to address the appellant's attorney fee contention. Even if the parties have entered into such an agreement--which is unclear, given the agency's assertion that the agreement was never finalized--any such agreement was reached outside the Board's proceedings. The parties have not requested that the agreement be entered into the record for enforcement purposes or that the Board retain jurisdiction to enforce it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stewart v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 104, 107 (1997); <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 146, 149 (1988). Accordingly, we will not consider the purported agreement and will not condition our finding of compliance on its fulfillment."). The AJ should not advise the appellant that he has the right to petition for fees if a settlement agreement specifically waives the right to claim fees. <span class="Italic">Brannon v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 675, 677 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming jurisdiction, an AJ should not dismiss a counsel fee motion believing that the parties had reached an agreement on fees without a written stipulation that moots the petition. Without the stipulation, the AJ should rule on the fee motion. <span class="Italic">Long v. Dept. of Army</span>, 5 MSPR 549, 551, 6 MSPB 11 (1981). A fee motion or petition should not be dismissed as moot if the agency agrees to pay fees and provides a copy of an internal authorization for payment; without a settlement agreement providing for dismissal of the fee petition, the fee petition should lead to an initial decision granting fees when the agency agrees to pay and the Board finds the fees in the interest of justice. Only with a formal Board decision can the appellant secure later compliance if difficulties develop concerning payment of the fees. <span class="Italic">Corcoran v.

<p class="Body-Text">Settlement agreements relating to fees can create some procedural anomalies. The settlement may simply provide for the appellant to file a fee motion with the Board, a clause that avoids waiver of the right to petition for fees but places before the Board the full range of issues inherent in fee litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carson v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 86 MSPR 192, 197 &#x00B6; 12 (2000) (settlement provided for a fee for one lawyer and left for Board resolution the entitlement, hourly rate, and reasonableness of the fees of another lawyer); <span class="Italic">Abraham v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 65 MSPR 11, 14 (1994) (settlement did not provide fees to be paid by the agency, but it provided that the appellant could file a motion for fees under the standards of the Civil Rights Act; appellant did not forego her right to seek an award of fees based on her prevailing party status). If the agreement provides that the agency will pay reasonable fees, but that the Board retains jurisdiction to resolve disputes over the fees, appellant may secure a counsel fee ruling by filing an enforcement petition rather than a motion for an award of counsel fees (although there are decisions that appear to approve the use of a fee motion in these situations). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gubino v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 85 MSPR 518, 520 &#x00B6; 2 (2000) (settlement provided that the agency would pay reasonable fees, as agreed by the parties, or should the parties not agree, as determined by MSPB); <span class="Italic">Montreuil v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 685, 690 (1992) (appellant properly requested fees through an enforcement petition when a settled agreement called for fees to be paid and reserved to the Board jurisdiction to resolve disputes concerning the fees); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Casali v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 81 MSPR 347 (1999) (considering fee motions following settlement that called on agency to pay fees), <span class="Italic">post</span>; <span class="Italic">Beall v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 68 MSPR 231, 234-35 (1995) (settlement set $50,000 as the maximum fee; through enforcement proceedings the Board adjudicated a dispute over the reasonableness of fees and awarded $50,000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board explicitly approved the procedure of settling a fee petition through an agreement that the agency pay fees, while leaving the amount of those fees to be determined by the Board, <span class="Italic">Jones v. DHHS</span>, 56 MSPR 311, 314-15 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question presented here is whether the Board can award attorney fees to the appellant under the settlement agreement. The attorney fee provision provides: "The parties agree that the appellant is entitled to a reasonable amount of attorney fees. The amount of fees is to be determined by the Board in accordance with the provisions of 5 CFR 1201.37."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agreed-upon language of this provision establishes that the parties intended that the appellant receive reasonable attorney fees. Instead of agreeing on the amount of these fees, the parties delegated this determination to the Board in accordance with 5 CFR 1201.37. This regulatory provision describes the requirements for filing a request for payment of attorney fees, including the documents that must be submitted to justify such a request.[3] <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.37(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We find nothing <span class="Italic">per se</span> improper in the parties' resolution of only some of the attorney fee issues, while leaving other matters for Board disposition, and we note that the Board has tacitly approved such settlements in other cases. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, in <span class="Italic">Meyers v. United States Postal Service</span>, 53 MSPR 177 (1992) (table), the Board enforced a settlement agreement under which the agency agreed to pay all reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred by the appellant, at the rate of $130.00 per hour, by determining the appropriate number of hours worked. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Pecotte v. Department of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 165 (1992), the Board adjudicated the issue of fee enhancement under a settlement agreement that determined the issue of reasonable attorney fees, but left open for the Board's later determination the question of whether the appellant was entitled to an enhancement of the agreed-upon fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties' filings are fully consistent with the language of this provision. The appellant's fee request is accompanied by relevant documents of the type provided for by the above-noted regulation. The agency's response challenges the appellant's fee request only with respect to the claimed hourly rate, costs, and the number of hours billed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no reason not to give full effect to this contractual expression of the parties' mutual intent, and therefore we conclude that the administrative judge improperly modified the settlement agreement by denying the appellant a determination of reasonable attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Veterans Administration</span>, 44 MSPR 594, 599 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our decision in <span class="Italic">West v. Department of Energy</span>, 24 MSPR 99, 101-04 (1984), is not to the contrary. There, we recognized that our authority to award attorney fees depended upon certain statutory requirements. However, here we are not awarding attorney fees. Rather, we are merely enforcing the parties' contractual agreement to pay the amount we determine to be reasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harrison</span>, 44 MSPR at 599 (settlement agreement is a contract).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the settlement requires the agency to pay fees, but leaves to the Board resolution of a dispute over the reasonableness of the fees, the AJ properly confines his review to the reasonableness of the amount of any disputed fees, not the underlying statutory justification for the fee award under the "interest of justice" standard, <span class="Italic">Sherrell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 92 MSPR 15, 16-17 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 4 (2002):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement before the Board provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Agency agrees to pay SMITH-HIMMELMANN [the law firm representing the appellant]...reasonable attorney fees and costs, upon submission of an itemized fees report. If a dispute arises, the Agency further agrees to pay any undisputed portion of such fees within 30 days of such submission. The parties agree to submit to the Merit Systems Protection Board any dispute concerning the reasonableness of attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency argues that the administrative judge erred by not requiring the appellant to satisfy the "prevailing party" and "interest of justice" standards governing entitlement to attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) in order to determine the reasonableness of his requested fees<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. The agency is mistaken. This case involves the enforcement of a settlement agreement in which the agency agreed to pay attorney fees, not an award of fees under section &#x00A7; 7701(g). <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 56 M.S.P.R. 311, 315 (1993). Therefore, the appellant was not required to demonstrate entitlement to fees under section 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">Id. See</span> <span class="Italic">also Greco v. Department of the Army,</span> 852 F.2d 558, 561 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (because the settlement agreement provided for the payment of attorney fees, it was unnecessary to determine whether the employee was entitled to fees under section 7701(g)(1)). Indeed, the plain language of the agreement entitled the appellant to attorney fees and provided that the Board would only resolve a dispute concerning the reasonableness of the amount of fees requested. Thus, the administrative judge correctly confined her inquiry to that issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the settlement provides for reasonable counsel fees, but the agreement does not state the amount of the fees, the Board will entertain a fee motion <span id="Page_4738"></span>based on the settlement agreement and then adjudicate the amount of allowable fees under the statutory standard, 5 USC 7701(g). <span class="Italic">Casali v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 81 MSPR 347, 352 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (without some other indication, a settlement agreement's provision calling for "reasonable attorney fees" adopts, by reference, the MSPB's standard of reasonableness); <span class="Italic">Steele v. Dept. of Army</span>, 39 MSPR 139, 140 (1988) (adjudicating the amount of fees called for by a settlement that did not define "reasonable fees"). If the agreement provides for payment of reasonable fees, the Board will likely construe this obligation in terms of the Board's standards governing reasonableness of fee awards. To achieve compliance with the agreement, appellant should submit the proof normally required to substantiate the reasonableness of fees requested through a counsel fee motion for a prevailing party. <span class="Italic">Montreuil v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 685, 690-91 (1992), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Mudrich v. USDA</span>, 92 MSPR 413, 418 &#x00B6; 12 (2002).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If jurisdiction was not established as to the underlying appeal, e.g., a whistleblower or constructive adverse action appeal, the AJ is not likely to accept a settlement agreement concerning fees into the Board's record for purposes of enforcement. [The jurisdictional complications involving acceptance of settlements is explored in Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-016.html#sec16-17">Jurisdiction to Accept Settlement: <span class="Italic">Delorme</span></a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Many settlements waive rather than provide fee entitlement. The waiver will be construed according to the law governing contract interpretation. <span class="Italic">Kwartler v. VA</span>, 108 MSPR 330, 336 &#x00B6; 12, 2008 MSPB 58 (2008), provides an example of a fee waiver reviewed by the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term of a settlement agreement providing for attorney fees should be interpreted as a question of contract law<span class="Italic">. Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In construing the terms of a written settlement agreement, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance, and parol evidence will be considered only if the written agreement is ambiguous<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> We note that, in the settlement agreement, the appellant "waive[d] any and all actions, claims, complaints, EEO Complaints, grievances, appeals and proceedings of whatever nature against VA...including attorney fees...." Moreover, the agreement specifically stated that the appellant was personally responsible for her attorney fees without contribution from the agency. Given this clear language and the absence of any new or material evidence on PFR, the administrative judge did not err by denying the appellant's request for attorney fees. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(d).</p>
