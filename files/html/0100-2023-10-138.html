<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-139"><span class="space">6.</span> Good Faith Doubt as to Majority Status; Decertification</h4>
<p class="noindent">Most representation cases proceed through a union petition seeking unit determination, election, and certification. A challenge may be launched, however, as to the status of an incumbent representative through a petition asserting a good faith doubt as to the majority status of the union. Under 5 USC 7111:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;An agency shall accord exclusive recognition to a labor organization if the organization has been selected as the representative, in a secret ballot election, by a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit who cast valid ballots in the election.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;If a petition is filed with the Authority--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;by any person alleging--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;in the case of an appropriate unit for which there is an exclusive representative, that 30 percent of the employees in the unit allege that the exclusive representative is no longer the representative of the majority of the employees in the unit;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the Authority shall investigate the petition, and if it has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, it shall provide an opportunity for a hearing (for which a transcript shall be kept) after a reasonable notice. If the Authority finds on the record of the hearing that a question of representation exists, the Authority shall supervise or conduct an election on the question by secret ballot and shall certify the results thereof. An election under this subsection shall not be conducted in any appropriate unit or in any subdivision thereof within which, in the preceding 12 calendar months, a valid election under this subsection has been held.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA regulations provide as to decertification, 5 CFR 2422.1-2 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2422.1 What is your purpose for filing a petition?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">You, the petitioner, may file a petition for the following purposes:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Elections or eligibility for dues allotment. To request:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;An election to determine whether employees in a unit no longer wish to be represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by an exclusive representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;Petitions under this subsection must be accompanied by an appropriate showing of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Clarification or amendment.</span> To clarify, and/or amend:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;A recognition or certification then in effect; and/or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Any other matter relating to representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2422.2 Who may file a petition?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An individual; a labor organization; two or more labor organizations acting as a joint-petitioner; an individual acting on behalf of any employee(s); an agency or activity; or a combination of the above may file a representation petition. But,</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Only a labor organization may file a petition under &#x00A7; 2422.1(a)(1);</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Only an individual may file a petition under &#x00A7; 2422.1(a)(2); and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;Only an agency or a labor organization may file a petition under &#x00A7; 2422.1(b) or (c).</p>
<p class="noindent">A showing of interest was insufficient in a petition for decertification of the incumbent union because the documents that constituted the showing did not clearly demonstrate that the signers no longer wanted to be represented <span id="page_121"></span>by the union, <span class="Italic">Sacramento Army Depot and Burnett</span>, 49 FLRA 1648, 1650-51 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner submitted two different types of signed documents with his original petition to demonstrate a showing of interest.&#x2003;The first contains numerous signatures on two sheets, and states that the signers "deem it necessary to revoke [their] loyalty and support" of two specified officials of the Union and that the signers "collectively execute [their] rights...to decertify the current union executive board members, mentioned above[.]" The second form, which contains one signature per sheet, requests that the signer indicate his or her preference by checking one or more of the following options: (1) "petition[&#8197;] for a labor organization to cease to be the exclusive [representative]"[;] (2) "conduct an election for secret ballot for a new president and vice-president"[;] and (3) "I do not agree with this process and suggest the following[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the RD that the submitted showing of interest does not clearly indicate that the signers desired an election to decertify the Union as their exclusive representative.&#x2003;Rather, it appears that in signing the forms described above, the employees were seeking only the ouster from office of the current Union leadership, a procedure that does not require the decertification of the previously chosen exclusive representative. In particular, we note that the multi-signature forms, which contain almost all of the submitted signatures, speak only about revoking the support for certain specified Union officials and the election of new executive board members. And, although the other form contains one option that would involve a decertification election, it also contains language relating to an election for new officers. Moreover, even if both showing of interest forms were to be viewed, as the Petitioner contends, as having "two presented implied meanings[,]" they would still be unacceptable as evidence of the employees' interest in decertifying the Union as the employees' exclusive representative....&#8197;<span class="Italic">See</span> Report on a Ruling of the Assistant Secretary No. 52, 2 A/SLMR 641 (1972), (the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Labor ruled that under Executive Order 11491, which preceded the Statute, it was inherently confusing to obtain signatures on dual purpose documents, and that, therefore, the resultant signatures were unreliable and unacceptable as evidence of the employees' interest).

<p class="noindent-1">Prior to 1995, the Authority's regulations explicitly stated that an agency could file a petition "seeking to clarify a matter relating to representation...where the activity or agency has a good faith doubt, based on objective considerations, that the currently recognized or certified labor organization represents a majority of the employees in the existing unit." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.1(c) (1994). The Authority revised this regulation in 1995. Meaning of Terms as Used in This Subchapter; Representation Proceedings, Miscellaneous and General Requirements, 60 Fed. Reg. 67288-01 (Dec. 29, 1995). Although the new regulation removed the language concerning a good faith doubt, it retained for agencies the ability to file petitions "[t]o clarify...[a]ny other matter relating to representation." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.1(b)(2). As the Authority revised its regulations "for the purpose of streamlining the regulations and making the rules more flexible in addressing the representational concerns of agencies, labor organizations, and individuals," the revisions were not meant to limit agencies from filing good-faith-doubt petitions. 60 Fed. Reg. 67288-01, 67288. Consequently, although the regulation no longer contains the term "good faith doubt," the Agency's petition is proper.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another agency established a good faith doubt that the certified labor organization represented a majority of the unit, warranting clarification of a unit. The local union notified the activity by letter that, as of a certain date, it would no longer function. The letter, although asking for a transfer of dues deductions to another union, did not advise the activity that the other union was a successor or that it was merging with the other union. No suggestion was made that the other local sought to act as the representative of the employees at any time between the disclaimer and the agency petition. <span class="Italic">Duluth Int'l Airport, 4787th Air Base Group and AFGE Local 502</span>, 15 FLRA 858, 859-60 (1984).</p>

Instead, "the issue of whether an employer has questioned a union's majority in good faith cannot be resolved by resort to any simple formula. It can only be answered in the light of the totality of all the circumstances involved in a particular case"[13] and "factors asserted to support a good faith doubt...must be viewed both in their context and in combination with each other."[14] In other words, the agency must demonstrate "that a reasonable doubt exists that a union continues to represent a majority of employees" or "that a majority of eligible employees voting in an election...would vote in favor of continuing the union as their exclusive representative."[15]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">If an agency demonstrates that there is a good faith doubt, the Authority will order a regional director to conduct an election.[16] Such an order, however, impacts those employees' right to self-determination. Consequently, it should not be easier for an agency to bring about an election by establishing doubt regarding the status of the exclusive representative than it is for employees to petition for an election on their own behalf. An employee petition requires a showing of 30% of the unit's employees.[17] Employee self-determination is an "essential tenet of our Statute."[18] Comparatively, the burden on an agency to demonstrate good faith doubt must be at least as high.[19]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency alleges that there is a good faith doubt due to the following factors: (1) the Union has not negotiated a CBA with the Agency in over nineteen years; (2) the Union has not filed any grievances; (3) the Union has been inactive for over ten years; (4) the Union has lacked officers and currently lacks officers that are bargaining-unit employees; and (5) the Union has a "low level of Union membership and dues[-]paying members."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we find that the following factors do not indicate a good faith doubt in this case. First, rather than a "low level" of Union membership, the record indicates that at least five out of approximately twenty bargaining-unit employees are dues-paying members. This represents a membership rate of 25%, a much higher percentage than the 8% and 2.5% found in previous cases to indicate a good faith doubt. As such, we find that the number of dues-paying members, in this case, is not an indication of good faith doubt.[23]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[23]&#x2003;Although the Agency suggests that the Union should have to show that a majority of unit employees pay dues, <span class="Italic">see</span> Application at 1 (The Union "lack[s] of majority support through dues checkoff."); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 6 ("[T]he Union can point to no objective evidence of employee support, other than five dues-paying members out of 20--far fewer than a majority."), this has never been the Authority's standard, and we decline to adopt that standard now. We also decline the Agency's request to adopt "majoritarian principles." The Agency's requested development in case law would not only shift the burden onto unions to show that they have majority support, it would create a lesser burden on agencies than that required of employees to reach the same result sought here. This change would go against the principles of self-determination by employees stated above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, as to the Agency's argument that the Union lacked local officials, the record indicates that the Union has maintained its leadership with few exceptions and continued to fulfill its representational duties. The fact that occasionally Union officials were not employees in the bargaining unit does not itself support good faith doubt. As we recently held, "the Authority has long recognized, and still does today, the prerogative and necessity of federal unions to select their own officials."[24] As such, the Agency's reliance on the selection of Union officials from outside of the bargaining unit does not demonstrate a good faith doubt.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Finally, although the Union has neither negotiated a current agreement with the Agency nor filed any grievances, these two factors alone are not sufficient to demonstrate a good faith doubt, especially in light of the evidence indicating that the Union actively represents the interests of the bargaining unit and bargaining-unit employees and has not been dormant for over ten years.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD determined that, rather than being inactive for over ten years, the Union "has actively represented" the interests of its bargaining[-]unit employees in negotiations over changes in policy; represented bargaining-unit employees in adverse actions, a hostile work environment complaint, and a work-safety issue; and represented bargaining-unit employees in legislative and lobbying efforts and recent representational matters. In addition, the RD stated that the Union "monitored day-to-day union operations and took action to respond to matters affecting the unit."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Considering all of the factors raised by the Agency and considered by the RD, we find that the evidence does not indicate that there is good faith doubt that the Union represents a majority of the bargaining-unit employees. Consequently, the RD properly applied established law when she dismissed the Agency's petition.</p>
<p class="noindent">Following <span class="Italic">Export-Import Bank</span>, FLRA returned to its regional director for more particularized factfinding and analysis an agency petition seeking elections in 12 certified units based on the agency's alleged good faith doubts concerning the union's representation status, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Wainwright, Alaska, and AFGE Locals 1712 and 1834</span>, 71 FLRA 471, 471-76 (2019) (Member DuBester concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the attached decision and order (decision), Federal Labor Relations Authority Regional Director John R. Pannozzo (the RD) denied twelve agency-filed petitions, to the extent that they sought representation elections in twelve certified bargaining units. The petitioner based its election requests on its alleged good-faith doubts that the exclusive representatives continued to represent a majority of the employees in their respective certified units, but the RD found that the petitioner's doubts were unsubstantiated. The petitioner filed ten applications for review (applications) challenging the RD's denials of representation elections for ten of the twelve certified bargaining units that were at issue in the petitions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In all the applications, the petitioner argues that the RD rejected its asserted good-faith doubts without examining the totality of the circumstances that were relevant to each of the ten challenged bargaining units. Because the RD's findings are insufficient to support his rejections of the petitioner's good-faith-doubt claims regarding the ten challenged units, the applications raise a genuine issue about whether the RD failed to apply established law. Therefore, we grant the applications and remand the portions of the decision concerning the ten challenged units to the RD for further findings consistent with this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and RD's Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, AFGE, AFL-CIO (AFGE, National); AFGE, Local 1712, AFL-CIO (Local 1712); and AFGE, Local 1834, AFL-CIO (Local 1834) are the certified exclusive representatives of twelve bargaining units in Alaska, and the employees in those bargaining units are primarily located at three Army installations. The petitioner, on behalf of an assortment of Army activities and commands, filed twelve representation petitions asserting good-faith doubts that the exclusive representatives were supported by the majority of the employees in each of their respective bargaining units. The RD consolidated the twelve petitions for the purposes of his investigation and decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to all of the bargaining units, the petitioner contended that a combination of factors--such as a low percentage of dues-paying union members, a lack of formal grievances being filed, the infrequency (or absence) of negotiations, or the dearth of union officers and stewards--supported the petitioner's good-faith doubts that the exclusive representatives were supported by a majority of the employees in each of their respective units. Although the twelve petitions were similar in many ways, the petitioner tailored its arguments about each unit to reflect the ways in which that unit--and any representational activities concerning that unit--differed from the others.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD examined the petitioner's contentions. First, he made findings regarding circumstances that undermined the petitioner's good-faith-doubt claims. In connection with each of these findings, the RD provided several examples. But he did not explain how the examples related to particular units, except for the examples that he credited as evidence of representational activity in all twelve units. Specifically, the RD found that: (1) all of the units were covered by collective-bargaining agreements; (2) Local 1834's president (president) and Local 1712's trustee (trustee) communicated regularly with the human-resources officials tasked with labor relations; (3) the president and trustee lobbied Congress about employees' concerns; (4) "the [u]nion has negotiated over matters that impacted all of the employees in all of the bargaining units at issue here," such as a new Department of Defense performance-management system; (5) human resources regularly notified "the [u]nion" when employees from seven of the units "request[ed]...an alternate work schedule"; (6) the trustee conducted six "'lunch and learns'...at a variety of locations"; (7) the president "has represented employees subject to discipline," and the trustee "has filed grievances on behalf of employees" facing discipline; (8) the president raised a number of "informal grievances" with human-resources officials; and (9) Local 1834 has three vice presidents and between thirteen and fifteen stewards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD also made findings regarding circumstances that supported the petitioner's good-faith-doubt claims. In particular, he found that: (1) regarding one unit with only two employees--neither of whom was a dues-paying union member--a former supervisor testified that the employees had not engaged in any "discernable union activity," and the supervisor was previously unaware that they were part of a bargaining unit; and (2) the percentage of dues-paying union members for two bargaining units was "0%," and other units had percentages of "5%, 6%, 8%, 9%, 13%, 13%, 16%, 20%, 22%, and 32%." The RD did not identify the particular units to which the percentages related, and he did not explain which percentages he credited as evidence that would bolster a good-faith doubt about an exclusive representative's majority support. However, he characterized these percentages as the "[p]etitioner's strongest argument."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The petitioner argued that the RD should consider additional circumstances as evidence that supported the good-faith-doubt claims--such as contract articles that provided the exclusive representatives with rights that the representatives never exercised, and the length of time that had passed since the bargaining units were certified. But the RD discounted those circumstances because the Authority had not examined them--or had expressly disclaimed reliance on them--when determining whether good-faith doubts existed in previous decisions. The petitioner also cited the number of times that the exclusive representatives did not respond to, or did not request to bargain concerning, notifications about changes affecting unit employees. But the RD found that the local unions "look[ed] into these situations," even if the unions did not request to bargain concerning them; and that the president and trustee "engaged in negotiations when it mattered."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Considering all the evidence and arguments, the RD found that "the [u]nion has demonstrated substantial representational activity that <span id="page_123"></span>benefits all the employees...represent[ed] in all the bargaining units." For support, he cited the president's and trustee's lobbying efforts "on behalf of all federal employees...and for provisions benefitting all Army employees in the bargaining units here"; the president's role in developing the performance-management system "applicable throughout [the Department of Defense], not just [to] employees of the Army or those in Alaska"; the "substantial number of matters that have been informally resolved"; and the unions' "represent[ation of] individual employees when called upon." He added that "the [u]nion is not at all dormant," and "no employees from any of [the units at issue] have sought to decertify the union."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the petitioner's "strongest argument" in support of its good-faith-doubt claims--the percentage of dues-paying union members in each unit--the RD found that the percentages could be misleading in small units. As an example, the RD stated that if one of the employees in the two-person unit began paying dues, the unit would go from 0% to 50% dues-paying members. He found that relying on the dues-payment rates was "cherry-picking that unfairly disadvantage[d] the [u]nion under all the relevant circumstances, particularly in light of the many other things the [u]nion [did]...to benefit all employees."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, the RD rejected all of the petitioner's good-faith-doubt claims. However, the RD granted uncontested updates to eight unit descriptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The petitioner filed ten applications for review challenging the RD's determinations concerning ten of the twelve units that were at issue in the decision, and the exclusive representatives filed an opposition to the petitioner's applications.[26]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;The exclusive representatives request leave to file a motion to dismiss the applications on the ground that the petitioner's choice to "break[&#8197;] up" the RD's decision "into ten separate...[a]pplications...confounds the purpose of consolidation and undermines" the RD's determination to resolve the petitions in a single decision. And the exclusive representatives reiterate the same argument in their opposition. We need not decide whether to grant leave to file a motion to dismiss because, even if we did, we would deny the motion. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1547</span>, 68 FLRA 557, 558 (2015). Regarding the contention that the petitioner improperly presents its arguments in multiple applications rather than a single application, we note that the merits of the petitioner's arguments remain the same no matter the number of documents submitted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: We remand the decision, in part, due to a genuine issue about whether the RD failed to apply established law concerning good-faith doubts.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2422.31(c)(3)(i) of the Authority's Regulations, the Authority may grant an application for review when there is a genuine issue over whether the RD has failed to apply established law. The petitioner argues that the RD failed to apply established law when he rejected the good-faith-doubt claims about the ten units in Case Nos. SF-RP-19-0020 through SF-RP-19-0029. In particular, the petitioner notes that the Authority has stated that an evaluation of good-faith-doubt claims depends on considering the totality of the relevant circumstances affecting each unit. But, according to the petitioner, the RD's analysis relied so heavily on national-level activities that it would allow any national union that lobbied Congress to effectively immunize all of that union's local affiliates from good-faith-doubt challenges, regardless of the absence of "activity or representation...at the local level."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has recently addressed the manner in which it evaluates good-faith-doubt claims. The evaluation does not turn on any single factor.[32] Instead, "the issue of whether an employer has questioned a union's majority in good faith cannot be resolved by resort to any simple formula. It can only be answered in the light of the totality of all the circumstances involved in a particular case."[33] And "factors asserted to support a good[-]faith doubt...must be viewed both in their context and in combination with each other."[34] Because a union must have majority support in every bargaining unit for which it is the certified exclusive representative,[35] the Authority assesses good-faith-doubt claims based on the particular circumstances that apply to each unit, even if multiple units share the same certified exclusive representative.[36]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the RD's decision lacks the particularized findings necessary for the Authority to determine whether and how the RD evaluated the evidence of majority support for each certified bargaining unit. For example, many of the RD's findings relate to the activities of the president and trustee. But it is not clear whether the RD credited the actions of both individuals as evidence of majority support in all of the contested bargaining units, or only some of the units. If the RD credited the actions of both individuals as evidence relevant to all of the units, then the decision lacks any explanation about why the RD found that approach suitable for all circumstances. As another potential indication that the RD considered all of the evidence collectively rather than assessing the evidence's significance to each unit, the decision frequently refers to "the union," even though there are three distinct exclusive representatives at issue in these cases. Thus, throughout the decision, we cannot determine if the RD's findings are limited to particular units or exclusive representatives, or if the findings are intended to apply to all units and all three exclusive representatives.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the RD had the discretion to consolidate these cases if "necessary to effectuate the purposes of the Federal Service Labor-Management Statute or to avoid unnecessary cost or delay,"[45] the RD failed to consider "all [of] the circumstances" of each one of the ten distinct bargaining units.[46] While the RD gave several examples to support his overly broad findings that might undermine the petitioner's claims, he did not identify the unit or units from which he drew those examples--in matters such as disciplinary actions, grievances, or dues-payment rates--or consider the "context and...combination" of the "factors asserted to support [or undermine] a good[-]faith doubt" as to each unit.[50] And when examining the petitioner's "strongest argument" about dues-payment rates,[51] the RD did not explain which percentages he credited as evidence that would bolster a good-faith doubt about an exclusive representative's majority support in each unit.[52]</p>

Consequently, it is unclear whether the RD's legal conclusions relied on findings from both of these sections, or only the latter section.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[52]&#x2003;We reiterate that dues-payment rates, like all other factors asserted to support a good-faith doubt, "must be viewed both in their context and in combination with each other." <span class="Italic">Exp.-Imp.

<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding the foregoing discussion, some consideration of circumstances of potential relevance to all units may be warranted, but specific evidence that shows continued majority support at one unit does not necessarily establish majority support for the exclusive representative of all bargaining units, or other individual units.[53]</p>

<p class="noindent">The law governing agency protestations of doubt concerning a union's continued majority status was earlier summarized, <span class="Italic">Overseas Private Inv. Corp. and AFGE Local 1534</span>, 36 FLRA 480, 484-88 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We believe that the basic approach used by the National Labor Relations Board in dealing with similar questions is equally appropriate in the Federal sector.&#x2003;As the NLRB stated in <span class="Italic">Celanese Corp.</span>, 95 NLRB 664, 673 (1951), and has applied in subsequent cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">By its very nature, the issue of whether an employer has questioned a union's majority in good faith cannot be resolved by resort to any simple formula. It can only be answered in the light of the totality of all the circumstances involved in a particular case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, factors asserted to support a good faith doubt as to majority status must be viewed both in their context and in combination with each other in determining whether such doubt is warranted. An agency filing a petition asserting doubt as to the continuing majority status of an exclusive representative is not required to prove that an actual numerical majority opposes the union. Rather, the agency must only demonstrate objective considerations sufficient to support a conclusion that a reasonable doubt exists that a union continues to represent a majority of employees in an existing unit, or, in other words, that a majority of eligible employees voting in an election on the issue would vote in favor of continuing the union as their exclusive representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Union was dormant for a period of approximately 10 years. Under Authority precedent, if a petition had been filed during such a state of extended dormancy, an election would have been ordered....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD, however, focused on the Union's attempts since July 1988 to reassert itself as an active representative of the bargaining unit and its efforts to revive employee support....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that a recent history of an approximately 10-year period of dormancy gives rise to a serious question concerning whether the Union continues to enjoy majority status. According to the record in this case, during that 10-year period a number of disciplinary actions occurred, a number of changes in conditions of employment were implemented, and the Agency even ceased distributing copies of the collective bargaining agreement to new employees notwithstanding a contractual requirement that it do so without any response from or involvement by the Union. The doubt about the Union's majority status that would reasonably result from such a hiatus is not offset by sufficient evidence indicating that the Union has retained the support of a majority of employees in the bargaining unit or regained significant support since it began its efforts to reassert itself as an active exclusive representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While a low level of membership, standing alone, would not support a doubt as to majority status, neither does it contribute to overcoming the doubt that reasonably results from a lengthy period of virtually total inactivity. Also, we agree that ordinarily it is valid to presume that employee turnover does not justify a good faith doubt because new employees will support the exclusive representative in the same ratio as those they replace. However, the idea that such proportional support will occur is, itself, based on a presumption that in normal circumstances unions will "probably...[recruit]...a proportionate share of adherents from the new employees."...&#8197;Here...the Union's lengthy period of inactivity undermines the otherwise valid presumption that employee turnover does not generally support a good faith doubt about a union's continued majority status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we do not find that evidence that employees have disavowed an exclusive representative is necessary in order to support a good faith doubt as to a union's continued majority status. Although such evidence may be relevant, we do not view it as essential to supporting a good faith doubt in all cases....&#8197;If other factors presented are sufficient to support a good faith doubt as to a union's continued majority status, a failure to establish that employees have expressly disavowed a union will not, by itself, nullify that doubt....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We stress that our conclusion here is only that a reasonable doubt exists that the Union continues to enjoy majority status and we do not conclude that it does not, in fact, continue to represent a majority of employees in the bargaining unit. That is neither our purpose nor our role. That determination is one that rightfully belongs to the employees in the bargaining unit consistent with the rights granted by the Statute to self-determination, through secret ballot election, in their choice of which, if any, labor organization will represent them exclusively....</p>
<p class="noindent">Unless a group of employees seeks a change in its name or decertification, a representation petition seeking a change in union affiliation will be dismissed as beyond the processes of FLRA--an internal union matter beyond FLRA's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC Fayetteville and AFGE Local 1738</span>, 65 FLRA 191, 191 &#x0026; n.2 (2010) (assertion that petitioner employees desire to establish new local because they are dissatisfied with representation by national union is internal union matter or dispute concerning application of constitution within the jurisdiction of the Labor Department).

<p class="noindent">The issue of whether the insulated period of 5 USC 7111(f)(3) applies to a decertification petition was raised and briefing was solicited in <span class="Italic">NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr. and AFGE</span>, 67 FLRA 258 (2014). FLRA decided in <span class="Italic">NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr. and AFGE</span>, 67 FLRA 670, 672-78 (2014) (Member Pizzella concurring), that the contract bar applies to decertification petitions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner argues that because &#x00A7; 7111(f)(3) specifies application of the contract bar only to petitions for exclusive recognition, Congress <span class="Italic">implicitly</span> indicated that it applies only to such petitions.[27] And it is well established that "where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another..., it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion."[28] But that presumption does not resolve the issue before us. In this regard, the U.S. Supreme Court has stated that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"[n]ot every silence is pregnant." In some cases, Congress intends silence to rule out a particular statutory application, while in others [Congress's] silence signifies merely an expectation that nothing more need be said in order to effectuate the relevant legislative objective. An inference drawn from congressional silence cannot be credited when it is contrary to all other textual and contextual evidence of congressional intent.[29]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The U.S. Supreme Court has also stated that "[s]tatutory construction is a holistic endeavor," and that a statutory provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation may be clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme.[30] And a plain-meaning interpretation of a statute should be rejected if that interpretation would produce an "absurd result."[31]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Inferring that the statutory silence in &#x00A7; 7111(f)(3) precludes application of the contract bar to decertification petitions would be contrary to "other textual and contextual evidence of congressional intent."[32] As an initial matter, declining to find that the contract bar applies to decertification petitions would be--in at least three ways--in serious tension, and even conflict, with other provisions of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[32]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Burns</span>, 501 U.S. at 136.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, as some briefers argue, there is support in &#x00A7; 7111 itself for applying the contract bar to decertification petitions. In this connection, &#x00A7; 7111(b) of the Statute allows "any person" to file a decertification petition. If such a petition is filed, then a labor organization that "has been designated by at least [ten] percent of the employees in the unit specified in [the] petition" may intervene and be placed on the ballot in any election with regard to the petition. And a labor organization that "receives the majority of the votes...<span class="Italic">shall be certified</span>...<span class="Italic">as the exclusive representative</span>."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, if the contract bar did not apply to decertification petitions, then the following scenario could occur, even where there is a lawful, written, collective-bargaining agreement in place: a decertification petition is filed; a non-incumbent union obtains a ten-percent showing of interest and is placed on the ballot; and that union wins the election and is certified as the exclusive representative. Under that scenario, if the contract bar did not apply to the decertification petition, then the non-incumbent union would be able to circumvent &#x00A7; 7111(f)(3)'s express direction that "[e]xclusive recognition shall not be accorded to a labor organization" when a lawful, written, collective-bargaining agreement is in place. This would be an "absurd result"[39] that is avoided simply by interpreting the Statute's silence as to application of the contract bar to decertification petitions as not precluding such application. The Supreme Court's admonition that absurd results should be rejected[40] supports an interpretation of &#x00A7; 7111 as applying the contract bar to such petitions.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[40]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, as some briefers argue, refusing to apply the contract bar to decertification petitions would effectively give preferential treatment to those petitions, thereby making it easier to decertify than to certify a union. As one briefer argues, interpreting the Statute this way would be inconsistent with &#x00A7; 7101(a) of the Statute, which states that labor organizations and collective bargaining are in the public interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, declining to apply the contract bar to decertification petitions would allow an individual to file a decertification petition at any time during the term of a collective-bargaining agreement, perhaps as little as one day before the agreement expires. And this would be permitted even if the parties to the contract had bargained and reached agreement on a new contract. That is, as one briefer notes, after parties have spent their resources (and perhaps the Authority's as well) to negotiate and reach agreement, any individual could--at any time--essentially render those efforts meaningless. As another briefer notes, such a result would be inconsistent with &#x00A7; 7101(b) of the Statute, which states that "[t]he provisions of [the Statute] should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient [g]overnment."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, as several briefers argue, applying the contract bar to decertification petitions would be consistent with precedent established by the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations (the Assistant Secretary) and the Federal Labor Relations Council (the Council) under the executive order--the "predecessor" to the Statute[48]--as well as private-sector precedent under the Act. We note that, in interpreting the contract bar under &#x00A7; 7111(f)(3) of the Statute, the Authority previously has relied on contract-bar rulings under both the executive order and the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As some briefers argue, declining to apply the contract bar to decertification petitions would make it difficult to administer collective-bargaining agreements. And this would adversely affect both the exclusive representative and management. In this connection, as noted above, declining to apply the contract bar to decertification petitions could result in such a petition being filed on the last day of the term of a contract, even if the parties to the contract had already negotiated a successor agreement. As one briefer argues, "management--having expended time and resources bargaining with the existing union for a collective[-]bargaining agreement--could lose the benefit of its bargain and the predictability and stability that flows from having reached an agreement governing its workforce." Also, as one briefer claims, "[d]uring the term of a contract, the agency must have confidence that the current exclusive representative is the entity [that] it should work with for purposes of administering the contract," and "[u]ncertainty is injected into that relationship...by any decertification petition."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By contrast, applying the contract bar to decertification petitions would, as one briefer states, allow parties "to engage in meaningful bargaining and build relationships to the benefit of both bargaining[-]unit members and the agency as a whole." Such an application would lend stability to collective-bargaining relationships by precluding continuous challenges to an exclusive representative's status, while at the same time giving employees the opportunity at reasonable intervals to choose a different exclusive representative, or no representative at all. In addition, it restores the predictability of periods when representation petitions may be filed, enables the employer and incumbent representative to engage in long-range planning free from unnecessary disruption, and promotes effective dealings and efficiency of agency operations.[81] Further, from an administrative viewpoint, it would have the "salutary effect" of enabling the Authority's regional offices, "by obtaining a limited amount of information, to dismiss prematurely filed petitions, thus preventing a large percentage of such cases from being processed until an appropriate time."[82]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[81]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Oakland II</span>, 6 FLRC at 335; <span class="Italic">see also Oakland I</span>, 7 A/SLMR at 522-23.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[82]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Deluxe Metal Furniture</span>, 121 NLRB at 1000.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As one briefer argues,[98] the plain wording of &#x00A7; 2422.12(d) provides that the contract bar applies to "a petition seeking an election."[99] Without question, a decertification petition is a petition seeking an election: a decertification election.[100] Thus, by its plain terms, the contract bar in &#x00A7; 2422.12(d) applies the contract bar to decertification petitions. We note, in this regard, that the Petitioner acknowledges that &#x00A7; 2422.12(d) "does not plainly state that it applies only to labor organizations," but contends that "because it was created to enforce a statutory right that is plainly limited to labor organizations, the regulation is constrained by the plain language of the Statute."[101] However, for the reasons discussed above, the plain wording of the Statute does not preclude applying the contract bar to decertification petitions, and the Statute expressly gives the Authority broad power to promulgate regulations in representation matters. Accordingly, the Petitioner's claim does not provide a basis for declining to apply &#x00A7; 2422.12(d) to decertification petitions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, as the Authority,[112] the Board,[113] the courts,[114] and several briefers[115] recognize, the contract bar strikes an appropriate balance between ensuring stability in labor relations, on the one hand, and the right of individual employees to change or decertify their representative, on the other. The contract bar ensures that individuals need not wait more than three years to file decertification petitions.[116] And, during those three years, petitions are not limited solely to the open period; they also "may be filed at any time when unusual circumstances exist that substantially affect the unit or majority representation."[117] Additionally, as discussed below, in order to serve as a bar, an agreement must meet certain requirements that are designed to ensure that petitioners know when they are able to file.[118] Moreover, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) of the Statute requires the exclusive representative to "represent[&#8197;] the interests of all employees in the unit it represents without discrimination and without regard to labor[-]organization membership."[119] This duty of fair representation is protection for employees whose "individual rights" may be affected by the "grant of power to a union to act as [their] exclusive bargaining representative."[120] Thus, although the contract bar places a time limitation on when employees may exercise their right to choose a different exclusive representative, or no representative at all, that limitation is not absolute--and the Statute provides protections for employees who are exclusively represented by a union.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, in its brief responding to the Federal Register notice, the Petitioner claims--for the first time before the Authority--that the plain wording of &#x00A7; 7111(f)(3) of the Statute does not allow the contract bar to "apply beyond the initial three-year term of...an agreement." But it is well established in Authority precedent that the contract bar applies to agreements that automatically renew.[122] And the Petitioner could have argued--but did not argue--in its application for review that this "[e]stablished law or policy warrants reconsideration." Further, the Federal Register notice did not invite the parties and amici to address this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[122]<span class="Italic">See, e.g., KANG Topeka</span>, 47 FLRA at 944.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But, even assuming that this argument is properly before us at this late stage, &#x00A7; 7111(f)(3) of the Statute does not expressly address agreements that automatically renew, and, thus, does not expressly preclude applying the contract bar to such agreements. Further, as the Authority has stated in the context of applying the contract bar to such agreements:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Preserving the ability of parties to avail themselves of the benefit of automatic renewal of agreements is consistent with the purposes and policies of the Statute. In addition to promoting labor[-]management stability, a policy permitting automatic renewal is consistent with effective and efficient [g]overnment in that it preserves the time and resources that would be expended in renegotiating collective[-]bargaining agreements where renegotiation is otherwise deemed unnecessary by the parties.[124]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[124]<span class="Italic">KANG Topeka</span>, 47 FLRA at 941-42.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with these well-established policies, which the Petitioner has not shown to conflict with &#x00A7; 7111(f)(3) of the Statute, we reject the Petitioner's claim regarding this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, one briefer who filed his brief as an <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span> argues that "the Authority should permit decertification petitions to be adjudicated at times other than the open period upon a regional determination that the incumbent union is defunct."[125] But the parties to this case have not made this argument.
