<p class="Body-Text">The Postal Employee Appeal Rights Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100-90, <span class="Italic">codified at</span> 39 USC 1005(a), bestowed on certain nonpreference eligible supervisory and managerial employees of the Postal Service appeal rights to the Board from adverse actions. The Act and the savings clause that set the effective date of the Act are discussed in <span class="Italic">Wolff v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 599 (1988) (Act did not apply because the adverse action was commenced, by proposal, before the statutory effective date). Creating a measure of job protection to defined (not all) Postal Service employees who are not covered by negotiated agreements, 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I) provides a Board adverse action appeal to any individual with a year of current continuous service in the same or similar position and who</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">is in the position of a supervisor or management employee in the Postal Service, or is an employee of the Postal Service engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_251"></span>As a result of the legislation, Postal Service management employees have adverse action appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fisher v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 70 (1995) (not defining "management employees"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hargett v. Summerfield</span>, 137 F. Supp. 876 (D.D.C. 1956) (discussing the transition of postmasters from presidential to civil service appointees), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 243 F.2d 29 (D.C. Cir. 1957). If a postal employee makes a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction because he is a supervisor, manager, or personnel specialist, he should be given a hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Waldau v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 193, 195 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wilson v. USPS</span>, 109 MSPR 60, 62-65 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-11, 2008 MSPB 116 (2008), remanding because the AJ did not provide adequate notice to the appellant of what was required to establish Board jurisdiction over an adverse action appeal by a postal employee lacking preference eligible status, summed up the jurisdictional rules as it stressed the need for fair notice from the AJ of what is needed to meet jurisdictional requirements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation<span class="Italic">. Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). A Postal Service employee may file a Board appeal under 5 U.S.C. ch. 75 only if he is covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8) or 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a). Thus, to appeal an adverse action under chapter 75, a Postal Service employee must be a preference eligible, a management or supervisory employee, or an employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity. <span class="Italic">Gordon-Cureton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6; 6 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant indicated in his appeal that he was not preference eligible and he has not subsequently argued otherwise. The Acknowledgment Order did not put the appellant on notice that the Board might lack jurisdiction over this appeal and that the appellant bears the burden of proof on jurisdiction. In its motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the agency argued that the appellant had no Board appeal rights because he was not preference eligible and his position had no "managerial, supervisory, or programmatic responsibilities" that would entitle him to appeal rights under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a). The agency submitted the appellant's position description to support its assertion. The administrative judge did not issue a show-cause order providing any information on jurisdiction and did not advise the appellant that, if he failed to submit any more evidence and argument, she would dismiss the appeal. The administrative judge then dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Based on the documentary evidence submitted by the agency, she determined, "His position description does not indicate that he performed any supervisory duties, that he engaged in personnel work or [that he] was a management employee." In a footnote, she provided a definition of managerial employee but did not likewise define a supervisor or personnelist engaged in other than purely clerical nonconfidential work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">Burgess v.

The Board has held that an administrative judge's error in this regard may be cured if the agency fully informs the appellant of the jurisdictional issues in its pleadings. <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 6 (2007). Here, the agency's motion to dismiss informed the appellant generally of the issue of whether his position entitled him to Board appeal rights but provided no specific information of what he must allege.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in determining whether the appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him to a hearing, the administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary submissions; however, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive<span class="Italic">. Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994). Here, considering that the appellant had no notice of his burden of proof or of the importance of responding to the agency's motion, he had no meaningful opportunity to rebut the agency's evidence and argument on jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has adopted the definitions of supervisor, management employee, and confidential employee developed by the National Labor Relations Board. A "supervisor" is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]ny individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.</p>

One of his duties is to "provide technical advice, functional guidance, and policy interpretation on all aspects of the Injury Compensation and Light Duty programs administration." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, the appellant asserts on review that, as an EAS-16 Health and Resource Management Specialist, he is not a member of a bargaining unit and has no other right to appeal to a neutral forum. Whether the appellant belongs to a bargaining unit is not determinative. Neither the agency description of his position as a "non-bargaining" position nor the absence of an existing collective bargaining unit is sufficient to establish that he is an employee under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a). Rather, if he is barred by law from joining a collective bargaining unit, then he will be considered a 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a) employee. <span class="Italic">Coursen v</span>. <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 256 F.3d 1353, 1355-57 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the record as currently developed, we find that the appellant has not yet raised a non-frivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction. Nevertheless, because he did not receive proper <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> notice, we find it necessary to remand this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Definition of the classes of Postal employees with Board appeal rights depends, in part, on statements in the legislative history of the Postal Reorganization Act and the Postal Employees Appeal Rights Act of 1987 and, in part, on constructions by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) of what constitutes a manager, supervisor, and confidential employee. NLRB rulings are pertinent because that agency, rather than the Federal Labor Relations Authority, exercises oversight of Postal Service labor relations in unfair labor practice and representation proceedings. <span class="Italic">Anmuth v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 656, 660-61 (1990), construed the jurisdictional grant of 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii) concerning an employee who claimed to be a manager, a Senior Philatelic Marketing Specialist (EAS-23):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In prior decisions involving appellants who claimed "confidential employee" status, and thus a right of appeal to the Board under the Act, the Board ruled that the benefits of the Act are limited to those employees who are not entitled to collective bargaining rights and that reliance on the NLRB's interpretation of a "confidential employee" is proper in determining this matter.... Here, we find that an appellant asserting Board jurisdiction over an otherwise appealable action because of his alleged status as a "management employee" under the Act must show similarly that he is not entitled to collective bargaining rights and that he meets the NLRB's definition of a "management employee."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not find in this appeal nor did the appellant show that his position was not part of a collective bargaining unit. Instead, the administrative judge relied on the precedent of the United States Supreme Court in NLRB cases to decide whether the appellant was a "management employee." He determined that, although the term "management employee" is not defined by statute, the NLRB and the Supreme Court have defined the term to mean those who "formulate and effectuate management policies by expressing and making operative the decisions of their employer." <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Yeshiva University</span>, 444 U.S. 672 (1980); <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co.</span>, 416 U.S. 267 (1974). Management employees "must exercise discretion within, or even independently of, established employer policy and must be aligned with management." <span class="Italic">Yeshiva University</span>, 444 U.S. at 683. Also, they take or recommend "discretionary actions that effectively control or implement employer policy."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the administrative judge correctly concluded that the definition of a "management employee" employed by the NLRB and the Supreme Court is controlling in this appeal....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Anmuth</span> added, 45 MSPR at 662:</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A supervisor is an individual who has the authority, in the interest of the employer, to direct the work of employees through the use of independent judgment. <span class="Italic">Strope v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that an employee's rights are based solely on the position to which he or she has been officially appointed<span class="Italic">. See Wafford v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 34 MSPR 691, 693 (1987). Further, service in an acting capacity while on detail does not entitle an employee to permanently occupy that position or receive the rights of that position<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Body-Text">Yet <span class="Italic">Strope</span> also determined the Board had jurisdiction over appeals from "acting" or "relief" postmasters, 71 MSPR at 435-37:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the statute does not expressly refer to "acting" or "relief" managers, it does not specifically exclude them from coverage either. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). This section was meant to extend Board appeal rights to those groups of Postal employees who are not eligible for representation by a collective bargaining unit, and who therefore do not have access to a third-party review of an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, 133 Cong. Rec. H878-02 (daily ed. Mar. 3, 1987) (statement of Rep. McCloskey). Further, the legislative history indicates that this section specifically was intended to cover <span class="Italic">all</span> Postmasters, including those who serve as the only employee in a one-person post office. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A "manager" under 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii) has been defined as one who represents management's interests by taking or recommending discretionary actions that control or implement policies of the employer. <span class="Italic">Waldau v. MSPB</span>, 19 F.3d 1395, 1399 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Whether a particular employee is a "manager," is not controlled by his or her specific job title, but instead, is based on the employee's actual job responsibilities, authority, and relationship to management. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's employment contract for the position of Postmaster Relief/Leave Replacement (PMR) provides that the incumbent's duties "will involve transacting [P]ostal business with the public, safeguarding Postal property and inventory and other associated duties identified by the Postmaster." ELM section 419.141 provides that the incumbent of the PMR position "[P]erforms as a relief or leave replacement during the absence of a [P]ostmaster in an EAS-15 or below post office." The appellant's unrebutted testimony indicates that, as a PMR, she generally only worked when the Postmaster was absent and that, as such, she essentially worked without supervision and was responsible for the entire post office. The appellant further testified that as a PMR she performed all of the duties of the Postmaster except for preparing and signing quarterly accounting statements. The Postmaster whom she relieved did not contradict the appellant's overall assessment of her duties, but testified that, in addition to not preparing the quarterly reports, the appellant did not order main stock, a duty typically performed by the Postmaster.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the appellant, at the very least, performed all of the Postmaster's duties with the exception of ordering main stock and preparing quarterly accounts. We find no basis for excluding the appellant from coverage as a "manager" under 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii), based solely on the fact that she did not perform those two duties. There simply is no indication that Congress intended to limit appeal rights to employees who ordered main stock and prepared quarterly accounts, especially in light of Congress' plainly manifested intent for section 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii) to cover all Postmasters<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, 133 Cong. Rec. H878-02 (daily ed. Mar. 3, 1987) (statement of Rep. McCloskey).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This holding, we believe, is consistent with the stated purpose of 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)--to provide appeal rights to Postal Service managers and supervisors who are not eligible for coverage under a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, 133 Cong. Rec. H878-02 (daily ed. Mar. 3, 1987) (statement of Rep. McCloskey). To allow the agency to deny appeal rights to employees serving in the position of PMR, by definition a position served by temporary employees not eligible for coverage under a collective bargaining agreement simply because the agency characterizes the position as "acting Postmaster" or as "Postmaster Relief" would defeat that purpose and would elevate form over substance, a result inconsistent with established precedent. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Waldau</span>, 19 F.3d at 1399 (a particular employee's managerial status is controlled by his actual job responsibilities, authority, and relationship to management rather than his specific job title).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Portley v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 92-3118), concluded that personnel in permanent nonsupervisory positions who "act" in supervisory or managerial positions do not acquire Board appeal rights. The permanent, not the acting, position determines the right to appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To qualify as an "employee" under 7511(a)(1)(B), Ms. Portley had to show that she was a "preference eligible." Alternatively, she had to show that she was "in a position of a supervisor or a management employee in the Postal Service, or [was] an employee of the Postal Service engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity." 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Portley admitted that she was not a veteran and thus not a preference eligible employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2108. The only supervisory position which Ms. Portley claimed to have held was that of a 204B supervisor. USPS presented evidence that Ms. Portley was serving in a distribution clerk position, and that a 204B supervisor was a craft employee <span class="Italic">acting</span> as supervisor, not an actual supervisor. The Board, therefore, determined that Ms. Portley was not an "employee" for the purposes of Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Service by a government employee in an acting capacity does not entitle him or her to permanently occupy that position or receive the rights of that position; the employee's rights are based solely on the position to which he or she has been officially appointed. <span class="Italic">Bielec v. United States</span>, 456 F.2d 690, 696 (Ct. Cl. 1972). Ms. Portley never presented any evidence to show that she was officially appointed to a supervisory position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit extensively discussed managerial status, emphasizing both formal (<span class="Italic">de jure</span>) and informal (<span class="Italic">de facto</span>) management responsibilities, <span class="Italic">Waldau v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the question whether the MSPB has jurisdiction to adjudicate a case. Applying our standard of review to this case, we address whether the Board erred in determining that Waldau fails to qualify as a "management employee" within the meaning of section 1005(a)(4)(A), and therefore whether he has a right to appeal the adverse personnel action to the MSPB, by examining the general standards used by the Supreme Court and the NLRB in determining whether an employee qualifies as managerial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sub-chapter 7(II) of Title 29 of the United States Code governs the NLRB's supervision of labor-management relations. For purposes of NLRB jurisdiction, the terms "employee" and "supervisor" are defined in detail in 29 USC 152(3), (11) (1988), respectively. In contrast to "supervisory" employees, who are excluded (in part) from the National Labor Relations Act's (NLRA's) coverage, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 USC 152(3), (11); 164(a) (1988), managerial employees are neither defined in, nor expressly excluded from coverage under, the NLRA.... Management employees, however, have been excluded therefrom by judicial decision.

National Labor Relations Bd.</span>, 751 F.2d 268, 269 (8th Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court itself has more particularly laid out the framework for determining whether an employee qualifies as management:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[N]ormally an employee may be [considered] managerial only if he represents management interests by <span class="Italic">taking or recommending</span> discretionary actions that effectively control or implement employer policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Bd. v. Yeshiva Univ.</span>, 444 U.S. 672, 683, 100 S. Ct. 856, 862, 63 L. Ed.2d 115 (1980) (citations omitted) (emphasis added). In essence then, an employee can qualify as management under NLRB law by demonstrating either that he actually has authority to take discretionary actions--thus being a <span class="Italic">de jure</span> manager--or that he recommends discretionary actions that are implemented by others possessing actual authority to control employer policy--thus being a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> manager.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This distinction between formal or final actual authority to manage and the capacity "effectively to recommend such action" was subsequently noted, albeit in the context of determining "supervisor" status, in <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Bd. v. Res-Care, Inc</span>., 705 F.2d 1461, 1467 (7th Cir. 1983), which held on the facts of that case that a group of licensed nurses were not "supervisors" under the NLRA....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Though the precedent has established "no firm criteria for determining <span id="Page_253"></span>when an employee is...aligned with management," <span class="Italic">Walla Walla</span>, 631 F.2d at 613, at least one guideline is clear: that final signatory authority is not a necessary prerequisite to concluding that an employee qualifies as management, either as a matter of <span class="Italic">de jure</span> or <span class="Italic">de facto</span> status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That final or binding signatory authority is not necessary for a demonstration of managerial status does not, however, establish that evidence of lack of such signatory authority is never relevant to the determination. Indeed, such evidence would weigh heavily against any argument that an employee qualifies as <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">jure</span> management under the first prong of <span class="Italic">Yeshiva University</span> because he allegedly has the requisite authority to take discretionary actions on behalf of management. As for an employee claiming that he is managerial simply because of his <span class="Italic">de facto</span> authority, however, as evidenced by his effective recommendations concerning discretionary actions, the consideration of whether that employee has final signatory authority is irrelevant. In such circumstances, "the relevant consideration is effective recommendation or control rather than final authority." <span class="Italic">Yeshiva Univ.</span>, 444 U.S. at 683 n.17, 100 S. Ct. at 863 n.17. When the issue for determination is an employee's <span class="Italic">de facto</span> management status, any further consideration of the fact that he lacks final signatory authority is logically inappropriate, since recognition of his argument presupposes a lack of signatory authority. Furthermore, the caselaw demonstrates the irrelevance of an absence of actual decisional authority when assessing whether an employee's recommendations align the employee with management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, Waldau contends that the Board erred as a matter of law in counting against the evidence on his management status the fact that he lacked final signatory authority over any of the work he did, including his recommendations subsequently accepted by management. As we understand Waldau's contention, he asserts that the applicable precedent precludes any consideration of his lack of signatory authority. The government also does not distinguish between the matter of <span class="Italic">de jure</span> authority to manage, based upon the authority actually vested in an employee to execute specified management tasks, and <span class="Italic">de facto</span> authority to manage which may be based upon the manner in which management responds to management-related recommendations made by an employee not vested with <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">jure</span> authority. To the government, the absence of actual authority, while not a prerequisite to establish managerial status, is relevant to any determination of that status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree in part with both Waldau and the government. Final signatory authority "has never been...a prerequisite...to managerial status." <span class="Italic">Yeshiva Univ.</span>, 444 U.S. at 685 n.21, 100 S. Ct. at 864 n.21. Therefore, though the absence of such power is indeed relevant to an employee's actual job authority, lack of such power cannot be used in assessing an employee's managerial status based on the employee's effective recommendations. Rather, if the evidence tends to indicate that the employee "represents management interests by...recommending discretionary actions that effectively...implement employer policy," <span class="Italic">Yeshiva Univ.</span>, 444 U.S. at 683, 100 S. Ct. at 862, and sufficiently demonstrates the employee's alignment with management, then that employee's managerial status must be determined without consideration of evidence on the employee's lack of signatory authority.... We thus conclude that the Board erred in explicitly "[diminishing the] persuasiveness of [Waldau's] statements and testimony concerning the [ ] examples of [his] policy decision[making] ...by considering that Waldau lacked signatory authority over any of the decisions on which he allegedly made the policy recommendations that were rendered "effective" by management's acceptance thereof.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although this record contains evidence to support the factual findings on which the legal conclusion that Waldau was not a management employee is based, we on appeal are unable to determine the extent to which Waldau's lack of signatory authority affected the Board's ultimate determination. On this record, we therefore cannot conclude that the Board here would have reached the same decision had no consideration been given to Waldau's lack of final signatory authority, thereby rendering any error harmless.... We therefore vacate the Board's decision concerning Waldau's management status and remand for application of the correct legal standard to the facts of this case in light of this decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board on remand should note that whether Waldau's recommendations could be rejected by actual management is irrelevant to the ultimate issue of whether he qualifies as a management employee under section 1005(a)(4)(A) because of power effectively to recommend. Instead, the focus should be on the history of USPS' actual reactions to Waldau's recommendations...the nature of those recommendations, and whether that history so aligns Waldau with management as to confirm his status as "managerial." The nature of an employee's recommendations is relevant to the determination of status, as are the circumstances in which the recommendations are made. Gratuitous recommendations unrelated to an employee's experience and qualifications obviously have little bearing on status determinations<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Bell Aerospace</span>, 416 U.S. at 290 n.19, 94 S. Ct. at 1769 n.19. Thus, the character of particular recommendations may inform the extent to which an employee is aligned with management.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that she was a management employee by virtue of being on the EAS pay scale. We disagree. Neither the statute nor the case law states that an employee's pay scale is indicative of bargaining unit eligibility. Not all EAS employees are covered under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Anmuth v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 656, 659, 662 (1990) (explaining that an EAS-23 Senior Philatelic Marketing Specialist was not excluded from bargaining unit membership), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 932 F.2d 980 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table); <span class="Italic">Benifield</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. at 51, 54 (determining that an EAS-11 Personnel Assistant was not excluded from bargaining unit membership). The appellant also argues that she is a member of the National Association of Postal Supervisors (NAPS). However, based on the description of NAPS membership that the appellant included with her petition, we find that membership in that organization is not necessarily limited to employees covered under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). Therefore, the appellant's membership in NAPS is not particularly probative of whether she is covered under that provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that a reduction in force (RIF) notice addressed to her and dated January 2, 2013, indicates that she is a management employee. We make no finding on whether this RIF notice is indicative of management status because it pertains to the appellant's former Address Management Systems Specialist position and not to the Human Resources Specialist position at issue in this appeal. The appellant further alleges that her duties included using the agency's Time and Attendance Collection System, and that only managers have access to this system. We find, however, that the appellant has not alleged a factual basis to support her assertion that only managers have access to this system. <span class="Italic">See Urena v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 11 (2009) (noting that facts without support do not constitute nonfrivolous allegations). To the extent that the appellant is arguing that she was a managerial employee because she did not have a supervisor, we find it implausible that she worked without supervision. Moreover, the appellant's allegation is belied by her job description, which states that she is supervised by the manager of the unit to which she is assigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleges that her position falls under the agency's Labor Relations organization and that all labor relations employees are in management-level positions. Again, we find that the appellant has provided no factual basis for the Board to accept her bare assertion that all labor relations employees are managers within the meaning of 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I). Furthermore, it is well established that the position's responsibilities, authority, and relationship to management determine whether it is managerial in nature--not the position title or the office in which it is located. <span class="Italic">See Waldau</span>, 19 F.3d at 1398; <span class="Italic">Strope v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 429, 436-37 (1996). For the reasons explained in the initial decision, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's responsibilities, authority, and relationship to management were not those of a managerial employee under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant argues that she was a nonbargaining unit employee, as evidenced by her having received a nonbargaining salary increase. However, the mere fact that there was no collective bargaining unit for the appellant to join or that she was ineligible for bargaining unit membership for reasons unrelated to 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1202(1)-(2) is insufficient to bring the appeal within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Coursen v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a non-preference eligible, asserts that the administrative <span id="Page_254"></span>judge erred in dismissing his appeal of his September 11, 2010 removal for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that he had not performed 1 year of current continuous service in his EAS-17 Supervisor, Customer Service position as required by 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). Although he concedes that he was not "officially" deemed to be a supervisor prior to his March 27, 2010 promotion from City Carrier, he contends that he met the definition of a "supervisor" because he was assigned to a position as a temporary supervisor for approximately 18 years prior to his promotion. He cites <span class="Italic">Strope v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 429 (1996), as holding that a temporary appointment may satisfy the 1-year requirement. He further contends that he met the statutory requirement because his actual job responsibilities during those years were supervisory. He cites <span class="Italic">Waldau v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 19 F.3d 1395, 1399 (Fed. Cir. 1994), as holding that the determination of whether an employee is a "manager" is not controlled by his job title, but by his actual responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge correctly found that service while on detail is not the same as service pursuant to a temporary appointment, we find that the appellant's 18 years of service in an acting capacity prior to his permanent appointment, by definition, does not constitute a "detail." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wafford v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 691, 693 (1987) (stating that a detail constitutes a temporary assignment to a different position <span class="Italic">for a specified period</span>) (emphasis added). Rather, the appellant's service was akin to a temporary appointment, which may be counted toward the completion of 1 year of service under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Strope</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 438. We therefore remand this appeal for a jurisdictional hearing as to whether the appellant's service as a temporary supervisor constituted employment in the same or similar positions as required by 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii).</p>

Even if the appellant's position classification indicates that she was one of these types of employees as she alleged, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has found that the title or classification of a position is immaterial to whether the incumbent enjoys supervisory, managerial, or confidential status; the question must be answered in terms of the employee's actual duties and responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Carrier v.

For the same reason, the appellant's occasional designation as an "Auditor in Charge" does not establish that she was a supervisor, manager, or confidential employee for purposes of Board jurisdiction. As for the appellant's actual duties and responsibilities, we have reviewed her submissions in that regard, and for the reasons explained in the initial decision, we agree with the administrative judge that they do not include any actual duties or responsibilities that might place the appellant in the category of supervisor, manager, or confidential employee.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Recognizing a degree of inconsistency or confusion in opinions defining postal supervisor or managerial, as opposed to bargaining unit, status, <span class="Italic">Bolton v. MSPB</span>, 154 F.3d 1313, 1315-20 (Fed. Cir. 1998), attempted to lend definition by emphasizing the authority to fire (or recommend discharge of) employees and the authority to direct the work of others, as key, but not exclusive, determinants of supervisory status. <span class="Italic">Bolton</span> also elaborated on prior pronouncements of the Federal Circuit and MSPB concerning managerial status. For supervisory status, an employee must have the authority either to discipline or discharge others (or be able effectively to recommend those actions), or to responsibly direct the actions of others (and be held responsible for those actions), as opposed to providing oversight, guidance, or passing along management's orders. Other indicia of supervisory status, if sufficiently persuasive, could make up for lack of authority to discipline or direct employees. For managerial status, the assigned responsibility of the employee should include formation and effectuation of management policy by expressing and making operative the employer's decisions. Occasional suggestions to management for policy changes do not confer management status on an employee whose duties do not include policy formulation. If the employee seeks to demonstrate managerial or supervisory status by exclusion from a bargaining unit, the evidence of that exclusion should amount to a legal determination, rather than a union's opinion, concerning unit status:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his twenty-one years of employment with the postal service, Bolton held several positions, including Management Trainee, Superintendent Stations and Branch Operations, and Station Manager. In November 1990, Bolton was assigned to the position of Postal Operations Specialist Senior ("POSS"), a Level 18, Step 9 position and part of a specific Engineering Technical Unit (the "ETU")....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of Bolton's specific performance problems in the POSS position are not fully developed in the record, but it appears that he repeatedly refused to follow the instructions of management. On July 10, 1992, Bolton signed a "last chance" settlement agreement to avoid suspension, accepting one final opportunity to perform satisfactorily in the POSS position. Subsequently, on September 23, 1992, he received a notice proposing to reduce him in pay and grade for failure to maintain peaceful relationships with customers, supervisors, peers, and other agency employees. On October 21, 1992, the district manager decided to reduce Bolton to a Part Time Flexible Clerk, Level 5, Step 0, effective October 27, 1992....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The postal service challenged the Board's jurisdiction to consider Bolton's appeal, asserting that Bolton was not an "employee" with the postal service as defined in 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A) (1994), and that, although Bolton was not a member of a collective bargaining unit, he was not ineligible for such membership as a matter of law.... After considering the testimony of...witnesses as well as the documentary evidence presented, the AJ concluded that Bolton had failed to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he was a manager or a supervisor, and therefore dismissed Bolton's appeal as outside the scope of the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bolton, on appeal, argues that the AJ improperly ignored or discredited the evidence he presented in support of his contention that he was either a "supervisor" or a "management employee." He further argues that, by concluding he was neither a supervisor nor a manager, the AJ unlawfully created a class of postal service employees that can neither obtain the protection of membership in a collective bargaining unit nor appeal any adverse personnel actions to the Board. We examine each of these arguments in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The postal service is the only federal entity subject to the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board (the "NLRB"). <span class="Italic">See McCandless v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 996 F.2d 1193, 1198 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Because Congress used the same terms to define the scope of jurisdiction for both the NLRB and the Board with respect to all postal service employees, <span class="Italic">compare</span> 39 USC &#x00A7; 1202 (1994) (the NLRB "shall not include in any [collective] bargaining unit...any management official or supervisor") <span class="Italic">with</span> 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A), the Board and this court have looked to national labor relations law for guidance with respect to what job authority or function will bring a particular postal service employee within the scope of its jurisdiction rather than the NLRB's. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Waldau v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 19 F.3d 1395, 1398 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">McCandless</span>, 996 F.2d at 1201. <span class="Italic">See generally Benifield v. United States Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Serv.</span>, 40 MSPR 50 (1989) (discussing Congress's intent in using identical terms to define both the NLRB's and the Board's jurisdictions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 2 of the National Labor Relations Act defines "supervisor" as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The term "supervisor" means any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 USC &#x00A7; 152(11) (1994). Thus, if an employee may exercise, or "effectively recommend" that someone else exercise, any one of these twelve categories of discretionary authority, that employee may be considered a supervisor under the statute. <span class="Italic">See NLRB v. KDFW-TV, Inc.</span>, 790 F.2d 1273, 1277 (5th Cir. 1986) (noting that the definition of supervisor "is to be read in the disjunctive, with the existence of any one of the statutory powers sufficient to confer supervisory status").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not believe, however, that each of these potential twenty-four activities are equally indicative of supervisory authority for purposes of Board jurisdiction. The Board does not have the same specialized level of expertise as the NLRB does in interpreting and applying the federal labor laws to particular factual circumstances, nor does it have the resources to engage in the extensive, in-depth analysis of the status of each particular postal service employee as a prerequisite to exercising jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Cf. NLRB v. Swift &#x0026; Co.</span>, 292 F.2d 561, 563 (1st Cir. 1961) ("[T]he gradations of authority 'responsibly to direct' the work of others from that of general manager or other top executive to 'straw boss' are so infinite and subtle that of necessity <span class="Italic">a large measure of</span> <span class="Italic">informed discretion is involved in the exercise by the [NLRB]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic"> of its primary</span> <span class="Italic">function</span> to determine those who as a practical matter fall within the statutory definition of a 'supervisor.'" (emphasis added) (footnote omitted)). Some further guidance from this court is therefore necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After examining the existing case law, we conclude that two particular functions are often substantially determinative of whether a postal service employee shall be considered a "supervisor" and therefore subject to Board jurisdiction. First, we conclude that the authority to discharge or discipline another employee, or effectively to recommend that another employee be disciplined or discharged, is usually a critical component of supervisory status. The ability to fire or otherwise discipline a subordinate lies at the heart of a supervisor's power, for it is often the threat of disciplinary action that most effectively encourages satisfactory performance. Thus, where an employee has full authority to discharge or otherwise discipline others, that alone is determinative that the employee is a supervisor. Furthermore, the authority of an employee to recommend <span id="Page_255"></span>effectively that others be discharged or disciplined, such that upper level management accepts such recommendations and implements them as a routine matter, is equally dispositive of supervisory status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second significant indicator of supervisory status is the employee's authority "responsibly to direct" the actions of others. As the Board has previously explained in <span class="Italic">Smith v. United States Postal Service</span>, 54 MSPR 566 (1992), responsible direction requires that "the supervisor is held fully accountable for the performance and work product of the employees he directs." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 570. Where, as a result of employees' failure to complete satisfactorily the tasks they are directed to perform, their supervisor may be discharged or disciplined, such a supervisor has authority responsibly to direct those employees. This type of accountability to upper-level management for the performance of subordinate employees is similarly dispositive of supervisory status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we hold that these two factors--where an employee has authority to discharge or discipline others, or where an employee's own evaluation is based on the performance of his or her subordinates--when present, will dispose of the question whether an employee is a supervisor. Where these factors are not present, however, the Board will have to examine further the other statutory functions to determine if a postal service employee nonetheless is a supervisor. We believe, however, that it would require a particularly powerful finding of authority to exercise one of the other statutory functions to outweigh the employee's lack of authority to discipline or failure to be evaluated according to the performance of others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Waldau v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 19 F.3d 1395 (Fed. Cir. 1994), we noted that, unlike "supervisor," the term "management employee" is not explicitly defined in the relevant statutes. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1398. We therefore adopted the definition of "manager" as developed in Supreme Court labor decisions and NLRB case law. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Thus, managerial employees are those who "formulate and effectuate management policies by expressing and making operative the decisions of their employer." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (internal quotations omitted). We further explained the particular aspects of a postal service employee's job the Board should consider to determine whether that employee is a "manager":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]hether [the employee's] recommendations <span class="Italic">could</span> be rejected by actual management is irrelevant to the ultimate issue of whether he qualifies as a management employee under section 1005(a)(4)(A).... Instead, the focus should be on the history of [the postal service's] actual reactions to [the employee's] recommendations, the nature of those recommendations, and whether that history so aligns [the employee] with management as to confirm his status as "managerial." The nature of an employee's recommendations is relevant to the determination of status, as are the circumstances in which the recommendations are made<span class="Italic">. Gratuitous recommendations unrelated to an employee's</span> <span class="Italic">experience and qualifications obviously have little bearing on status</span> <span class="Italic">determinations. Thus, the character of particular recommendations</span> <span class="Italic">may inform the extent to which an employee is aligned with</span> <span class="Italic">management</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1402 (second emphasis added) (citations omitted). Thus, while an employee's title is not necessarily determinative of status, <span class="Italic">see Smith</span>, 54 MSPR at 570, the employee's authority to effectuate management's policies must be based on his or her actual position; an employee's independent attempts to influence workplace operations are not, in themselves, sufficient to confer managerial status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With this legal background in mind, then, we examine the AJ's findings with respect to Bolton's employment status as a POSS and conclude that these findings are supported by substantial evidence. Bolton conceded he did not have any authority to discharge or discipline other postal service employees himself, but argued that he did have authority to recommend their discipline and discharge. In support of this claim, however, Bolton described only one instance of this alleged authority; he at one time recommended that an employee in another unit be disciplined for failing to secure stamp stock. There was no evidence in the record that management ordinarily expected or accepted such recommendations from Bolton, or that it effectuated Bolton's recommendation in this instance. Indeed, no evidence was presented showing that management had ever fired or disciplined any employee at Bolton's suggestion.... Furthermore, Bolton's example simply demonstrates a "gratuitous" attempt by him to encourage discipline, as discussed in <span class="Italic">Waldau</span>, for he took action merely as a conscientious employee and not based on his position and authority within the postal service. This is hardly indicative that Bolton, as a routine matter, had any authority to recommend effectively that other employees be discharged or disciplined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ also found no indication that Bolton, as a POSS, was held accountable for the performance of other employees, either permanently or temporarily assigned to the ETU. Although Bolton's periodic evaluations were made part of the record, as well as his general and detailed job description and responsibilities, there is no indication that his satisfactory performance was based on the success or failure of others rather than his own ability to meet specified job objectives. In fact, the evaluations mainly addressed Bolton's ability to master and implement various technical skills and procedures.... We agree, therefore, with the AJ's findings that Bolton had no authority to discipline or discharge others and that he was not accountable for the performance of others; certainly, these findings are supported by substantial evidence. Therefore, the AJ's threshold conclusion that Bolton lacked supervisory authority is not contrary to law or otherwise erroneous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The written description for Bolton's POSS position does include, as one responsibility, "[o]versee[ing] and provid[ing] guidance and training to a small- to medium-size group of technicians and clerks." However, the Board has held and we agree that mere oversight and guidance are insufficient to establish supervisory status. <span class="Italic">See Smith</span>, 54 MSPR at 570 ("While the position description states that the incumbent 'oversees and coordinates the activities of [technicians] assigned to the [unit],' it does not show that [the position] falls within the [National Labor Relations Act's] definition of supervisor. Direction of employees alone does not establish supervisory status.")....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that other courts of appeals have recognized that the exercise of any one of the statutory functions must be accompanied by "independent judgment" to qualify an individual as a supervisor. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Monotech v. NLRB</span>, 876 F.2d 514, 517 (5th Cir. 1989) (a supervisor is "anyone who has the authority to use independent judgment in the execution or recommendation of any of the functions listed" in the statute); <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Chicago Metallic Corp.</span>, 794 F.2d 527, 530-31 (9th Cir. 1986) ("The existence of any one of the enumerated powers <span class="Italic">combined with 'independent judgment</span>' suffices to confer supervisory status." (emphasis added)). The fact that Bolton received detailed orders from management and then passed those orders along to others is highly indicative that Bolton was not a supervisor. The AJ specifically found that Bolton's role was merely "to communicate instructions between management and employees without significant discretion or independent judgment." This statement implicitly determines that Bolton did not have discretionary authority or exercise independent judgment, based on substantial evidence in the record, and thus further supports the AJ's conclusion that Bolton was not a supervisor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bolton</span> is somewhat unclear because it refers to the necessity for classifying an employee as within the jurisdiction of either the NLRB (nonsupervisory, nonmanagerial employees) or the MSPB (supervisors and managers). The NLRB is not a USPS counterpart to the MSPB. The NLRB administers USPS labor relations (comparable to the FLRA for other federal agencies). When <span class="Italic">Bolton</span> refers to a postal employee as falling within the "NLRB's jurisdiction," the decision is really referring to coverage of that individual as an "employee" as defined by the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, and as an individual with coverage under a collective bargaining agreement and the grievance and arbitration procedures established by that agreement. Postal workers could more clearly be defined as "employees" under either the NLRA or CSRA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Freeman v. MSPB,</span> 179 Fed. Appx. 54, 55-56 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), determined that a criminal investigator was not a manager with appeal rights to the Board, even though as an investigator the employee was assisting in a management function:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Freeman was removed from his position of Criminal Investigator in the Los Angeles office of the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Postal Service for leaving a threatening message on his supervisor's voicemail. He disagreed with the agency's assessment that the message represented a threat and argued that even if it did, mitigating circumstances such as his depression and recent divorce mandated a less severe action than removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Mr. Freeman attempted to appeal to the Board, the government moved for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. The government argued that, as a non-preference eligible employee of the Postal Service, Mr. Freeman could appeal to the Board only if he were a supervisory or management employee, and he was not. Mr. Freeman argued that his duties as a criminal investigator were supervisory in nature, and that the Board therefore had jurisdiction over his removal. The Board granted the government's motion to dismiss, leading to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties agree that Mr. Freeman is not a preference eligible employee. The Board's jurisdiction over Postal Service employees who are not preference eligible is limited to supervisory or management employees or those engaged in personnel work. 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A); <span class="Italic">Waldau v. M.S.P.B.</span>, 19 F.3d 1395 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Mr. Freeman argues that his duties make him a supervisory or management employee; he does not allege that he was engaged in personnel work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board defined a management employee as "one who represents management's interests by taking or recommending discretionary actions that control or implement policies of the employer," citing <span class="Italic">Strope v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 429, 436 (1996). Mr. Freeman argues that his duties are within this definition, since "the purpose of the Office of the Inspector General is to enforce and influence the policies <span id="Page_256"></span>of management." While that may be correct, the overall mission of an organization does not confer management status on every employee in that organization. Mr. Freeman, as a criminal investigator, identified no activity or authority within the scope of management as defined by the National Labor Relations Act. <span class="Italic">See National Labor Relations Board v. Yeshiva University</span>, 444 U.S. 672, 683 (1980), 100 S. Ct. 856, 63 L. Ed.2d 115 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Freeman argues that he exercises discretion in his investigations and represents management interests when investigating crimes and wrongdoing within the postal system. He also argues that he is entitled to appeal to the Board because he is in fact a supervisor, although he did not raise that argument before the Board. Reviewing Mr. Freeman's description of his duties as a criminal investigator, he does not assert that he supervises other criminal investigators or anyone else in the OIG. Instead, he states that the results of his investigations frequently result in disciplinary action against other employees of the Postal Service and thus should be deemed supervisory action. However, Mr. Freeman concedes, in straightforward terms, that "Petitioner and similarly situated investigators have no independent authority to impose discipline or even suggest the level of discipline appropriate for the circumstances," As noted in <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Bell Aerospace</span>, 416 U.S. 267, 268 n.19 (1974), the employee's actual job responsibilities control whether he is "managerial." <span class="Italic">See Bolton v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 154 F.3d 1313, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">No error has been shown in the ruling that Mr. Freeman's role in gathering data and information upon which supervisory decisions will be made by others does not make him a supervisor. The Board correctly held that his position as a criminal investigator does not qualify as a management or supervisory employee of the Postal Service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. USPS</span>, 123 MSPR 404, 414-15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-20, 2016 MSPB 22 (2016), a postal inspector was not a confidential employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does assert, however, that she is a confidential employee under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). In particular, she asserts that she handled confidential information in the course of investigations, the result of which directly affected agency operations in the area of personnel. She also asserts that she testified in Federal court on numerous occasions.[12] The Board has adopted the definition of the term "confidential employees" set forth by the NLRB, which includes "those employees who: (1) '[A]ssist and act in a confidential capacity to persons who formulate, determine and effectuate management policy in the field of labor relations,' or (2) 'regularly have access to confidential information concerning anticipated changes which may result from collective-bargaining negotiations.'" <span class="Italic">Law v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;On review, the appellant also asserts that she handled sensitive employee personnel information in the course of investigating administrative cases, worked closely with management and human resources to compile sensitive information, and enforced various laws and policies. The Board ordinarily will not consider evidence or argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence. <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980). However, we have considered the appellant's arguments on review because of the notice issues addressed <span class="Italic">supra</span> n.10 and because her new arguments implicate the Board's jurisdiction, an issue that is always before the Board and may be raised by any party or <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by the Board at any time during a Board proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Lovoy v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 571, &#x00B6; 30 (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant may have handled sensitive employee personnel information in the course of administrative investigations, mere access to personnel information is insufficient to establish confidential status. <span class="Italic">See Benifield v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 50, 54 (1989) (finding confidential information for purposes of 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii) refers to information regarding collective bargaining and labor relations, not to employees' personal data); <span class="Italic">see also Hayden v.

Moreover, the appellant's position description does not indicate that her job duties involved assisting or acting in a confidential capacity in the field of labor relations or having access to confidential information concerning the collective bargaining process.[14] Accordingly, we find that the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that she is a confidential employee entitled to appeal an adverse action to the Board under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii), and we dismiss her suspension claim for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
