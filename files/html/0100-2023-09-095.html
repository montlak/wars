<p class="Body-Text">"The Board has found an appeal timely, or waived its time limit, where a party made a good faith attempt to submit timely pleadings to the Board but was thwarted by problems with mail delivery." <span class="Italic">Norrup v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 87 MSPR 444, 447 &#x00B6; 7 (2001). A letter properly addressed, stamped, and mailed is presumed to have been delivered to the addressee. <span class="Italic">Pfaff v. Defense Investigative Serv.</span>, 25 MSPR 633, 636 (1985). The failure of the Board to receive the appeal does not result in a presumption that the appeal was not mailed. The appellant must demonstrate the circumstances of the mailing through the best means available. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDaniel v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 583, 587 (1990) (testimony taken as to the circumstances of mailing an appeal; the Board remanded the case for a merits determination); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Gaydon v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 198, 201 (1994) (to determine the filing date of a PFR, a pleading that is properly mailed to the Board will be treated as filed when mailed, irrespective of whether the Board receives the pleading).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The burden of proof governing appeals lost in the mails was explained in <span class="Italic">Baker-Mitchell v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 22, 25 &#x00B6; 6 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gaydon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 62 MSPR 198, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 36 F.3d 1113 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), the Board considered the situation of a never-received pleading and held that "when a party shows by preponderant evidence that a pleading was properly addressed to the Board with postage prepaid and placed in the Postal Service mail stream, it will be treated as filed on the date it was placed in the Postal Service mail stream, <span id="Page_1006"></span>regardless of whether the Board receives it." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 202; <span class="Italic">see also Duran-Arcelay v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 70 MSPR 13, 15 (1996); <span class="Italic">Freeze v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 65 MSPR 149, 152 (1994). Thus, the question here is whether there is preponderant evidence that the initial appeal was deposited in the mail stream prior to the filing deadline....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A summary of the evidence--referred to by the Board as "direct evidence"--that should be offered by the appellant (and by the agency) when the appellant claims his appeal was lost in the mails is provided by <span class="Italic">Nelson v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 331, 333-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7 (2001), calling for a "timeliness hearing" when the appellant establishes a factual dispute concerning the timeliness of his appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Direct evidence is required to invoke the presumption of delivery and receipt. Direct evidence may be in the form of a document or testimony. <span class="Italic">Foust v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 80 MSPR 477, 480 (1998), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 194 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table). The party invoking the presumption must present specific details concerning the mailing, such as the time of day and place of mailing. <span class="Italic">Freeze v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 65 MSPR 149, 152 (1994). Furthermore, if an appellant can establish a factual dispute as to whether he timely filed his appeal and he requested a hearing, he is entitled to a timeliness hearing. <span class="Italic">Meyer v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 MSPR 667, 673 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of whether the appellant filed an appeal on December 24, 1999, is a factual matter in dispute. The appellant asserts, with more than a bare allegation, that he did. The appellant is correct that the Board's regulations do not require that an appeal be filed by certified mail or similar method. Whether the documentary evidence submitted thus far is sufficient to support his assertion, when he requested a hearing, or whether the agency submitted evidence and argument to refute the appellant's assertion will not preclude the existence of a genuine factual dispute. <span class="Italic">See Hutchison v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 91 F.3d 1458, 1460-61 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Here, the appellant raised a factual issue and requested a hearing. Thus, we find it necessary to remand this matter to the field office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency should present its evidence that he did not mail it. The appellant bears the burden of proof on the issue of the timeliness of an appeal. <span class="Italic">Dancy-Butler v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 80 MSPR 421 &#x00B6; 5 (1998). However, the agency must present whatever evidence it may have regarding the mailing of an appeal in December 1999. <span class="Italic">Button v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 83 MSPR 174 &#x00B6; 11 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The mention in <span class="Italic">Nelson</span> of "direct" evidence is not a restriction on the types of evidence permitted to establish as timely an appeal gone astray. The Board accepts, as evidence of timely mailing, testimony of counsel or the appellant, as well as circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Younan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 41 MSPR 217, 221-22 (1989). Without some evidence concerning the circumstances of mailing the appeal, the Board is not likely to accept the otherwise unsupported allegation that an appeal was sent and not received by the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Herrera v. DOD</span>, 31 MSPR 23, 24 n.* (1986). An individual claiming that an appeal was lost in the mails must provide specific information, based on personal knowledge of those involved in the mailing process, to convince the Board that the appeal was mailed and the mail was lost. The Federal Circuit agreed with the Board that the statements of an attorney were insufficiently specific concerning the circumstances of mailing an appeal, <span class="Italic">Lynch v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 97-3270):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Lynch was removed from her Secretary position with the Army on November 10, 1995. On April 10, 1996, five months later, the Board received a "designation of representative letter" from Ms. Lynch's attorney, but returned the letter because no appeal had yet been filed. The attorney responded, stating that she timely appealed for Ms. Lynch via certified mail on December 11, 1995. She attached copies of two properly addressed envelopes with December 11 metered stamps.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge assigned to the appeal issued an Acknowledgment Order, directing Ms. Lynch to file evidence (including the return receipt cards from the certified mailing) establishing that her appeal was timely or that there was good cause for the delay. Ms. Lynch's attorney answered that she was "unable to locate" the cards, and asserted that the appeal's certificate of service and the copies of the envelopes should be sufficient to establish the mailing of the appeal. She also included an affidavit detailing her "routine practice" with respect to mailing appeals. The agency responded that it had not received a copy of the appeal and that it was "highly unlikely" that neither it nor the Board would have received the envelopes if they were correctly addressed and mailed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that Ms. Lynch had not established that her appeal was mailed on time. She noted that, although the copies of the envelopes showed that the letters were properly addressed with the appropriate postage and the attorney described her "routine practice," the attorney nonetheless did not provide "specific details" concerning the mailing of Ms. Lynch's appeal. Concluding that Ms. Lynch had presented no evidence that she had good cause for delaying her appeal, the administrative judge dismissed her appeal as untimely....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At bottom, this appeal concerns whether the affidavit submitted by Ms. Lynch's attorney establishes that she placed the two envelopes in the mail. The appellant has the burden of proving that her appeal was filed during the established time limit. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)] . If the appellant shows by preponderant evidence that a pleading was properly addressed to the Board with postage prepaid and placed in the Postal Service mail stream, it will be treated as filed on the date it was placed in the mail stream, regardless of whether the Board receives it. <span class="Italic">See Gaydon v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 62 MSPR 198, 202 (1994). The evidence proffered by the appellant must include "specific details concerning such mailing." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish that the appeal had entered the mail stream on December 11, Ms. Lynch's attorney outlined, in her affidavit, her regular practice for processing legal pleadings.[2] She stated that she made it a practice, with regard to all pleadings for which she had signed a certificate of service, to ensure that the pleadings were mailed, by both instructing and checking with support staff, and by checking her firm's mail room before leaving the office for the day. She stated that she was "certain [she] would have" followed her regular practice on December 11. However, she did not state that she had a specific recollection of mailing Ms. Lynch's appeal on December 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Ms. Lynch's attorney also alleged that other evidence shows that the appeal was placed in the mail stream on December 11. For example, the attorney submitted copies of the date-stamped and postmarked envelopes, a bill submitted to Ms. Lynch for postage expense, and firm computer records showing that Ms. Lynch's appeal was revised on December 11 and was the only document mailed by the attorney on that date. To the contrary, these pieces of evidence all tend to indicate that the appeal was prepared for mailing on December 11, but not that it was actually placed in the mail stream.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot fault the Board for deciding that the affidavit of Ms. Lynch's attorney was insufficient to meet her burden of proving that her appeal was placed in the mail stream on December 11. To receive the benefit of the Board's mail-box rule, Ms. Lynch was required to establish that the pleading was actually placed in the Postal Service mail stream. Although the attorney laid out her common practice, she never stated that she placed the appeal in the mail stream. Nor did any staff member who may have mailed the appeal provide an affidavit that the appeal was placed in the mail stream. The Board's holding does not violate any applicable law or regulation, and we cannot say that it was an abuse of discretion. Thus, it was permissible for the Board to conclude that Ms. Lynch had not met her burden to establish the predicate fact of mailing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Lynch cites several Board decisions regarding the proof required to establish that a pleading was placed in the mail stream. Each of these cases is consistent with the Board's ruling here. In <span class="Italic">Taggio v. Department of Transportation</span>, 56 MSPR 31 (1992), the Board held that an appellant met her burden of proving that an appeal was timely filed by submitting an affidavit of her attorney's secretary in which the secretary stated that she personally had deposited the petition for review in one of two mailboxes<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 31. In <span class="Italic">Swinarski v. Department of the Army</span>, 54 MSPR 513 (1992), the appellant submitted two sworn statements. In the first, the appellant averred that he had mailed his appeal in an appropriately addressed envelope before the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 515. In the other statement, an acquaintance of the appellant stated that he drove the appellant to the post office on the day in question, watched as the appellant waited in line and then approached the mail clerk, and heard the appellant report that "It is OK, it is done," upon returning to the car. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. In <span class="Italic">Nicoletti v. Department of Justice</span>, 53 MSPR 610 (1992), a secretary for the appellant's attorney submitted an affidavit averring that she had placed the appellant's submission in a mail box. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 614. In all three of these cases, the unrebutted statements submitted by the appellants showed that the documents were placed in the mail stream. These cases thus provided a guide to indicate what kind of evidentiary submission would be adequate for Ms. Lynch to establish that she had placed her appeal in the mail stream by the appropriate date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other Board cases indicate the type of allegations that do not meet the level of specific detail required by the Board. In <span class="Italic">Freeze v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 65 MSPR 149 (1994), the appellant's attorney averred that he was "informed and believes" that a properly addressed petition for review with postage prepaid was deposited in the mail. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 151. The Board rejected that assertion as "too vague and general to show that the petition was actually mailed before the filing deadline passed." The Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although the [attorney's] sworn statement relates that the petition was addressed to the Board, it gives no specifics concerning the mailing of the petition. Thus, it falls short of the nature and quality of evidence required to establish that a properly addressed petition for review with postage prepaid was timely placed in the mail stream.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 152.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1007"></span>In <span class="Italic">Cruz-Bonilla v. Department of Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 137 (1995), the appellant asserted that a union official prepared his petition for review and that he knew that his petition was filed. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 139-40. The Board found that assertion insufficient, noting that the appellant was not aware of when or how the petition for review was filed and did not provide a statement from the union official. The Board noted: "[T]he appellant has failed to submit an explanation by an individual with personal knowledge of when and how the petition for review was filed." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 140; <span class="Italic">see also Duran-Arcelay v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 70 MSPR 13, 16 (1996) (holding that appellant's mere assertion that he faxed a submission is "too vague and general" and appellant provided no specifics regarding the time or date of the alleged submission and no copy of the submission that was allegedly faxed); <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Department of Treasury</span>, 64 MSPR 242, 245 (1994) (holding that attorney's statement that petition was mailed on a particular date, without specific details concerning such mailing, "falls far short of the nature and quality of evidence generally required" to establish mailing).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision in this case is thus consistent with its own case law. Appellants are pointed to a safe harbor by <span class="Italic">Taggio</span>, <span class="Italic">Swinarski</span>, and <span class="Italic">Nicoletti</span>. At the same time, the other Board decisions indicate that the Board requires a high degree of precision in any statements supporting an appellant's claim that a petition was mailed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It could be asserted that the Board's ruling encourages parties to shade the facts on affidavits by averring facts that are not truly within the affiant's recollection. However, the same could be said of any rule that attaches negative consequences to a particular set of facts and whereby the truth can only be known by one party's recollection of the facts. Whether the rule is positioned at one point or another, the courts must nonetheless rely on the carrot-and-stick provided by honesty and good conscience on the one hand, and a lively fear of perjury charges and their attendant consequences on the other. That is especially true with attorneys, who are officers of the court, are required to know and understand a specific collection of ethical obligations, are charged with the knowledge of where lines are drawn in the law, and may face the permanent loss of their livelihood if caught in the act of perjury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor does the Board's rule close all avenues of relief for the honest attorney who may not have a specific recollection of mailing a particular petition. Such an attorney may receive a waiver from the Board of the filing deadline by exercising due diligence after learning that the Board has not received the petition. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.114(f) (1997). To that end, the attorney may use a certified mail slip to establish that the document arrived at the Board or may look to the absence of a returned slip to inquire at the Board in a timely manner. In addition, the government states that it is the standard practice of the Board to issue an acknowledgment order within a day after an appeal is received. Even assuming that the Board may be delayed in processing appeals from time to time, an appellant who does not receive an acknowledgment order within two or three weeks can call to verify that the petition reached the Board. <span class="Italic">Cf. Ramos v. Department of Navy</span>, 63 MSPR 142, 144-45 (1994) (appellant's failure to inquire about the status of a petition for almost seven months from the time he allegedly mailed it "does not justify waiver of the filing deadline"). An attorney who takes advantage of either of these methods not only may establish reasonable diligence, but is also more likely to discover problems before time wears on, and thus be more likely to have a specific recollection of mailing the petition.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Hulst v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, SF-0752-17-0215-I-1 (NP 1/24/2023), remanded for further analysis and a hearing on a timeliness issue when there was evidence that the appeal was timely mailed but not delivered to the Board's regional office; when remailed, the appeal was late:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant responded and indicated that his union representative sent the appeal to the Board via certified mail on November 8 or 9, 2016, but that the receipt had been misplaced....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant's January 19, 2017 appeal was the only appeal, it was untimely filed by 63 days. However, the appellant alleged, in both his responses to the administrative judge and his petition for review, that his union representative filed his appeal on November 8 or 9, 2016. In support of that claim, the appellant provided a signed statement from his union representative that the appeal was timely filed on November 8 or 9, 2016 and was sent by certified mail to the Board's Western Regional Office's address at 201 Mission Street, Suite 2310, San Francisco, CA, 94105-1831. The appellant also provided certified mail receipts dated November 8, 2016, allegedly documenting that copies of the appeal were also mailed to the agency, as it requested, and the appellant. In response to the administrative judge's order regarding timeliness, the appellant also submitted his own unsworn statement reiterating when and how the appeal was filed in November 2016 and provided the same certified mail receipts. The agency has not rebutted the appellant's argument that his representative sent a copy of the initial appeal to the agency nor shown that it would be prejudiced if the appeal were granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant presents facially credible evidence sufficient to establish a dispute as to material facts regarding the timely filing of his appeal or good cause excusing his late filing, the administrative judge must hold a hearing to resolve the factual dispute. <span class="italic">Stout v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 389 F.3d 1233, 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2004); <span class="italic">Nelson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 5 (2001). The Board has held that evidence that a pleading was sealed, properly addressed to the Board with postage prepaid, and placed in the U.S. Postal Service mail stream gives rise to a presumption that it was filed on the date it was placed in the U.S. Postal Service mail stream, regardless of whether the Board receives it. <span class="italic">Gaydon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 198, 202, <span class="italic">review dismissed</span>, 36 F.3d 1113 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). Direct evidence is required to invoke the presumption of delivery and receipt, which may be in the form of a document or testimony. <span class="italic">Foust v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 477, &#x00B6; 5 (1998), <span class="italic">review dismissed</span>, 194 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table). The party invoking the presumption must present specific details concerning the mailing, such as the time of day and place of the mailing. <span class="italic">Freeze v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 149, 152 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the question of whether the appellant's representative filed an appeal on November 8 or 9, 2016, is a factual matter in dispute. The appellant asserts, with more than a bare allegation, that he did. The documentary evidence submitted thus far establishes the existence of a genuine factual dispute and supports the appellant's assertion that he timely filed his appeal. <span class="italic">See Hutchison v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 91 F.3d 1458, 1460-61 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="italic">see also Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 211, 228 (1995) (holding that while an unsworn statement by an appellant is admissible evidence, the fact that it is unsworn may detract from its probative value), <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 99 F.3d 1160 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table); <span class="italic">Hendricks v. Department of the Navy</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 163, 168 (1995) (finding that while statements of a party's representative in a pleading do not constitute evidence, unchallenged assertions of the party's representations may constitute nonfrivolous allegations raising factual questions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant raised a factual issue and requested a hearing. Thus, we find it necessary to remand this matter to the regional office with the instruction that an evidentiary hearing be held on the timeliness issue. On remand, the appellant may present evidence and argument to show that the November 8, 2016 receipt he provided reflects a mistaken filing of the petition for appeal with the agency, and if it does, he must present evidence and argument to show that he filed the petition with the Board as soon as he learned of the mistake. <span class="italic">See Sanford v. Department of Defense</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 207, 210 (1994). The appellant also may present evidence and argument to support his assertion that he filed his petition for appeal with both the agency and the Board on November 8 or 9, 2016. If the administrative judge finds that the appellant timely filed his appeal, or that good cause exists to waive the filing time limit, the case should proceed on its merits. If, however, the administrative judge finds, after reviewing the evidentiary and testimonial evidence, that the appellant failed to timely file his appeal or failed to demonstrate that good cause exists to waive the filing deadline, then the administrative judge may dismiss the appeal as untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">DiFolco v. VA,</span> PH-0752-10-0547-I-1 (NP 8/9/2011), excused a filing delay of a little more than two weeks when improperly addressed mail did not get through to the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we find that the 17-day filing delay in this case was not minimal, we also find that it was not particularly lengthy. <span class="Italic">See Beck v. General Services Administration</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 489, &#x00B6; 7 (2000) (finding that, although not minimal, a 15-day delay is not particularly lengthy). In addition, we find that the appellant made a good faith attempt to timely submit her appeal to the Northeastern Regional Office despite the fact that she incorrectly addressed the envelope. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Norrup v. Department of the Navy</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 444, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 7 (2001) (good cause shown where the appellant filed a timely but misaddressed submission). Further, we find that the appellant's action of promptly re-filing the appeal after it was returned to her by the United States Postal Service as undeliverable shows that she exercised due diligence under the circumstances. Therefore, based on the above reasons, we find that the appellant has shown good cause under <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 184, for the delay in filing her appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board excused one appeal that was timely filed but mailed to a prior address of a Board office and then returned to sender. The appeal was remailed after the last day permitted for filing the appeal. The Board filing should have been considered complete upon the first and timely mailing. <span class="Italic">Norrup v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 87 MSPR 444, 447 &#x00B6; 7 (2001) (waiving the deadline for an appeal, otherwise timely, returned to the appellant for lack of a sufficient address of the regional office); <span class="Italic">Wiggins v. OPM</span>, 61 MSPR 537, 539 (1994) (appeal was timely filed when it was sent to the former address of the MSPB Atlanta regional office and the submission was returned by the Post Office as undeliverable); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Fayhee v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 41 MSPR 131, 132 (1989) (cross-PFR was accepted although the initial mailing was returned for insufficient postage; that the base post office mailed the pleading with insufficient postage was beyond the agency's control). Earlier regulations calling for filing by certified mail implied <span id="Page_1008"></span>that the risk of delivery and the burden of follow-up was on the appellant if the regulatory procedure was not used. If delay by loss in the mails was to be excused, and certified mail was not used, other evidence of actual mailing or receipt of the appeal was required. <span class="Italic">Sawyer v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 15 MSPR 445, 448 (1983). In 1983 the Board dropped the regulation requiring mailing of appeals by certified mail.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appeal is lost in the mail, counsel and client must promptly act to rectify the matter once the loss is discovered. The Board defaulted the appellant who did not act quickly enough, <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 12 MSPR 171, 172-73 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of any explanation by appellant as to the events that transpired between May 19, 1981, and July 1981, we agree with the presiding official that appellant failed to demonstrate good cause for waiver of the time limitation. Even assuming that appellant's first petition for appeal had been lost in the mail, appellant's attorney allowed two weeks to pass before forwarding the completed forms to appellant for his signature. Appellant's attorney allowed 28 days to pass before inquiring as to whether the appeal had been filed. By this time, appellant had gone on vacation. Moreover, appellant went out of town without first checking with his attorney as to the status of his appeal forms. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that the parties exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence. The actions of appellant and his attorney were not those that reasonably prudent people would take when they know a filing deadline had to be met. Accordingly, we find that appellant did not have a reasonable excuse for the delay, and that the presiding official did not err in refusing to waive the time limit.</p>
