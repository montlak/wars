<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-163"><span class="space">h.</span> Term or Temporary Appointment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If a tenured employee who holds a temporary appointment is discharged and the Board orders her reinstatement, the agency may provide a remedy consistent with the nature of the appointment. <span class="Italic">Murdock-Doughty v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 74 MSPR 244, 248-52 (1997), determined the agency was in compliance when it paid the appellant back pay through the last date of her appointment and then terminated her based on expiration of that appointment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency contended that the appellant was a competitive-service employee serving a 1-year term appointment due to expire on April 20, 1995. The agency therefore asserted that it had demonstrated full compliance with the Board's March 25, 1996 Opinion and Order by canceling the appellant's removal, reinstating her effective April 14, 1995, imposing a 45-day suspension beginning on that same date, and separating her at the end of her term appointment on April 20, 1995. The appellant responded that she was hired to serve a "term appointment not to exceed four years."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether an individual has the right to appeal an adverse action depends on whether he or she is an "employee" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). That section defines "employee," insofar as is relevant here, as "(A) an individual in the competitive service--(i) who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or (ii) who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less[.] "</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsections (i) and (ii) of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) are mutually exclusive<span class="Italic">. Youngs v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 MSPR 551, 556-57 (1997). If the individual held an appointment that required completion of a probationary or trial period, the individual's appeal rights are determined by subsection (i); if the individual's appointment did not require completion of a probationary or trial period, his or her appeal rights are determined by subsection (ii). <span class="Italic">id.</span> Because a competitive-service term appointee is required to serve a 1-year trial period, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 316.304(a), the appeal rights of an individual serving a term appointment are determined by subsection (i) of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)<span class="Italic">. Youngs</span>, slip op. at 8-9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing the appellant's petition for enforcement for lack of jurisdiction, the administrative judge found that the appellant was appointed to two consecutive temporary appointments limited to 1 year or less and that she was still serving in the second of those temporary appointments at the time of her removal. Based on those findings, the administrative judge determined that the appellant was not an "employee" for purposes of Board appeal rights because she had not met the "current continuous service" requirement of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), i.e., that the appellant had not completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less. We find that the administrative judge has misconstrued the record evidence concerning the appellant's appointment status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The SF-50s submitted by the agency indicate that the appellant initially was appointed on April 19, 1993, to a "term" appointment in the competitive service not to exceed April 20, 1994, and was subsequently appointed on April 20, 1994, to a "term" appointment in the competitive service not to exceed April 20, 1995. The 1993 SF-50 indicated that her appointment was "subject to completion of one [sic] year trial period beginning" April 19, 1993, and the 1994 SF-50 indicated that the appellant had completed her trial period. The appellant does not contest this evidence and submits a copy of a March 29, 1993 "Referral for Consideration" form, as further evidence that she was appointed on April 19, 1993, to "a term appointment not to exceed four years."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the undisputed evidence of record indicates that the appellant was appointed to two consecutive appointments, both for periods exceeding 1 year, i.e., the 1993 appointment for a year and 2 days and the 1994 appointment for a year and 1 day. <span class="Italic">Cf. Ward v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 60 MSPR 306, 308 (1994) (an employee completes his 1-year probationary period on the last day of his tour of duty before his anniversary date). The administrative judge therefore erred in finding that the appellant's appointments were limited to 1 year or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also erred in characterizing the appellant's appointments as "temporary" appointments. Because the appellant's appointments were not limited to 1 year or less, they were not "temporary" appointments<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 316.401(c) ("[a]n agency may make a temporary appointment for a specified period not to exceed 1 year"). Rather, as indicated in the appellant's SF-50s, her 1993 and 1994 appointments were "term" appointments<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 316.301 ("[a]n agency may make a term appointment for a period of more than 1 year but not more than 4 years").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a competitive service employee serving under a term appointment for a period not limited to 1 year or less at the time of her removal whose appointment was subject to a 1-year trial or probationary period that she completed, the appellant is an "employee" for purposes of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i). 5 CFR &#x00A7; 316.304(a); <span class="Italic">Youngs</span>, slip op. at 8-9. As we did in the adverse action appeal, we therefore find, based on the undisputed factual evidence in the record, that the appellant, at the time of her removal, was as an "employee" entitled to appeal her removal to the Board<span class="Italic">. See Murdock-Doughty</span>, 70 MSPR at 120-24.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As such, the Board's March 25, 1996 Opinion and Order that mitigated the appellant's removal to a 45-day suspension was an order or decision that was "issued under its jurisdiction," 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.181(a), and the administrative judge thus erred in dismissing the appellant's petition for enforcement of that Opinion and Order for lack of Board jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.181(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree, however, with the administrative judge's alternative finding that the agency was in compliance with the Board's March 25, 1996 Opinion and Order that ordered the agency to reinstate the appellant, to cancel the April 14, 1995 removal action, to impose a 45-day suspension in lieu of the removal, and to issue the appellant a check for the appropriate amount of back pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Murdock-Doughty</span>, 70 MSPR at 124-25. The agency submitted copies of SF-50s indicating that it had canceled the <span id="Page_5015"></span>appellant's removal and reinstated her to her former position effective April 14, 1995, and that it had imposed a 45-day suspension beginning on that same date. As the administrative judge found, this is sufficient proof of the agency's compliance with the Board's March 25, 1996 Opinion and Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge further found, the agency's separation of the appellant on April 21, 1995, upon the expiration of her last term appointment, did not require a finding that the agency was in noncompliance with the Board's order. Compliance generally requires return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>; however, the employee is not entitled to be placed in a better position than he or she would have enjoyed had the adverse action not occurred<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Silvestri v. Department of the Army</span>, 60 MSPR 580, 584 (1994). As discussed above, at the time of her removal, the appellant was serving a term appointment not to exceed April 20, 1995. When that appointment expired, the appellant's employment with the agency ended automatically and the agency was under no obligation to offer the appellant another term appointment<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 316.303; <span class="Italic">see also Berger v. Department of Commerce</span>, 3 MSPR 198, 199-200 (1980) (the separation of a term appointee at the expiration of the term specified at the time of appointment is not an appealable adverse action). Because the appellant's employment with the agency ended while she was still serving her 45-day suspension, the administrative judge also correctly found that she was not entitled to any back pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Donovan v. VA</span>, 70 MSPR 344, 347-48 (1996) (IRA appeal challenging an agency's failure to renew a term appointment: the Board discussed the extension of a temporary appointment beyond the four-year term in order to fulfill interim relief requirements; the Board noted the obligation of the agency to request OPM's approval for the extension).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a whistleblower's appeal, corrective action did not include extension of a term appointment, or the ability of the appellant to serve additional time equal to the difference between the date of her separation and the expiration of the term appointment. As to the appellant's argument that she should have been appointed to one of a number of vacancies that were open after the appellant was separated, the Board determined that the appellant had the responsibility for applying for those jobs and could not prevail on the argument that her applications would have been futile, <span class="Italic">Gharati v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2022 MSPB 16, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-22 (2022) (enforcement petition):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's initial decision on the merits of the appeal ordered the agency "to cancel the reassignment and removal and to retroactively restore the appellant, effective November 30, 2012." Through compliance proceedings, the administrative judge found that the Board's final order required that the appellant be placed in a permanent Latent Print Examiner position. Arriving at this conclusion, the administrative judge stated that "an agency's obligation under a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is not necessarily satisfied by merely rescinding the adverse or personnel action at issue," but that it also is required to fully address the appellant's direct injuries and those that flowed from the agency's unlawful action. CID at 6-7 (citing <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Army</span>, 458 F.3d 1359, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2006)). Although the administrative judge acknowledged that a "<span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> order" cannot operate to place the appellant in a better position than she would have otherwise been in but for the agency's unlawful actions, she nonetheless found that the full extent of the appellant's injuries included the loss of permanent employment with the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. The Board's final order unambiguously sought to retroactively restore the appellant to her position, or as close to her position as possible, as of November 30, 2012. It is undisputed that, at that time, the appellant was serving in a 4-year term appointment with the agency. The first vacancy announcement for a permanent Latent Print Examiner position was not issued until October 2014. Thus, it would have been impossible for the Board's final order, with a retroactivity date of November 30, 2012, to properly encompass an appointment to a vacancy which did not arise until nearly 2 years later and was unrelated to and independent from the appellant's position at the time relevant to the order. Therefore, we find the administrative judge's order in the compliance initial decision to appoint the appellant to a permanent position, retroactive to the date of hire from the first vacancy announcement in 2014, to be incongruent with the initial order, which ordered retroactive restoration to November 30, 2012.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also disagree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's claim of entitlement to a permanent position is analogous to a claim for a promotion as a part of a final order. To obtain a promotion as part of an order granting final relief, an appellant must identify a law mandating the promotion, or clearly establish that she would have been promoted during the relevant period. <span class="Italic">Dow</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 18. Promotion potential in the compliance context presupposes continued employment with the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203 (stating that a promotion occurs while an employee is "continuously employed"). Conversely, the very nature of a term appointment is that it expires by a date certain as a basic condition of employment while the appointment is made. <span class="Italic">Scull v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 7 (2010). Here, the appellant was serving in a term appointment, and she has not pointed to any evidence showing that, in her capacity as a term appointee, she was entitled to an opportunity to earn an appointment to a permanent position. To the contrary, an agency is not obligated to offer an employee a permanent or other term position when her term appointment expires; rather, the appointment simply ends. <span class="Italic">See Murdock-Doughty v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 244, 252 (1997). In a similar situation to that presented here, the Board found that when an appellant held a term appointment at the time of her removal, which the Board mitigated to a 45-day suspension, the agency was in compliance with the Board's order to retroactively reinstate the appellant to the date of the removal and impose the 45-day suspension, even though it separated her on the date that her term appointment expired, which meant that no back pay was due. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 251-52. Thus, the agency in this matter did not act improperly in separating the appellant on the date her term appointment was predetermined to expire, instead of appointing her to another position. Because we find that a promotion and permanent appointment are not analogous under these circumstances, we conclude that the administrative judge's reliance on <span class="Italic">Dow</span> was misplaced. Accordingly, we need not determine whether the appellant "clearly established" that she would have applied and been selected for one of the permanent positions. <span class="Italic">Dow</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we disagree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant's failure to apply for any of the 10 vacancies was not fatal to her claim. Regardless of the likelihood that she would have been selected for any of the vacancies had she chosen to apply, the appellant nonetheless had the alternative recourse to apply for the positions, wait to learn whether she had been selected, and if not, to include the agency's failure to appoint her to the position or positions as a personnel action in another whistleblower reprisal claim before the Office of Special Counsel and, if necessary, before the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(i), (b)(8)(A). The appellant chose not to embark on this path, and she is left with the consequences of that inaction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ultimately, it is the speculative nature of the administrative judge's findings and order that leads us to conclude that the appellant is not entitled to a permanent position as a part of <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief. We will not speculate or presume that, had she chosen to apply for any of the vacancies, she would have been selected. Accordingly, we agree with the agency that the administrative judge should not have ordered it to reconstruct the hiring process for the 10 vacancies at issue, and we reverse the administrative judge's order to place the appellant in a permanent Latent Print Examiner position, retroactive to the date of hire for the first vacancy announcement for a permanent Latent Print Examiner position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="italic">The appellant is not entitled to serve out her 4-year term appointment because it has expired.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for enforcement, the appellant also asserted that she was entitled to serve out the remaining 42 months on her 4-year term appointment. The administrative judge made no findings concerning this claim, and we find it to be meritless. The Board has held that by the express nature of a term appointment, an appellant has no right to continued employment with the agency after the predetermined term has run. <span class="Italic">Berger v. Department of Commerce</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 198, 199 (1980); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.303(b). Here, the initial decision was issued on April 21, 2016, the appellant's term appointment expired on the predetermined date of May 20, 2016, and the initial decision became final on May 26, 2016--6 days after her term appointment expired. Under such circumstances, the appellant was not entitled to be physically restored to her term position. <span class="Italic">See Murdock-Doughty</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 252 (finding that, in a compliance action concerning mitigating a removal to a 45-day suspension, because the appellant's term appointment expired while she was serving the 45-day suspension, she was not entitled to back pay).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, there is no indication in the record that the appellant rejected the agency's calculation and issuance of back pay for the time period covering the 42 months that she did not serve. Thus, to accept the back pay award and be reinstated to the term appointment for the 42 months at issue would be to allow the appellant to benefit twice from the administrative judge's order. To find otherwise would allow the appellant to assume a better position than the one she was in prior to the agency's actions, a practice in which the Board does not engage. <span class="Italic">See Sink v. Department of Energy</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 153, &#x00B6; 19 (2008).</p>
