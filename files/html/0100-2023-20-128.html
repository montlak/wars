<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-124"><span class="space">c.</span> Proof of Scope of Complaint Made to OSC; Post-Complaint Submission</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">"The purpose of the exhaustion requirement is to provide OSC with a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation that may lead to corrective action." <span class="Italic">Kalil v. USDA</span>, 96 MSPR 77, 81 &#x00B6; 8 (2004). If the appellant's submissions to OSC do not assert whistleblowing reprisal, the appellant has not established a jurisdictional prerequisite for an IRA case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. DOD</span>, 103 MSPR 516, 322 &#x00B6; 11, 2006 MSPB 293 (2006) ("His submissions to OSC do not mention whistleblowing, section 2302(b)(8), or reprisal for whistleblowing."). To establish Board jurisdiction, the appellant must prove exhaustion with OSC, not just present nonfrivolous allegations of exhaustion. <span class="Italic">Page v. DHHS</span>, DC-1221-15-0408-W-1 (NP 9/28/2015).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has not explained precisely how the appellant properly demonstrates what allegations were first presented to OSC in an IRA case, although the Board's regulation, 5 CFR 1209.6(a)(6) (2022), permits the appellant to use the OSC-14 [formerly OSC-11] complaint form as an attachment to an IRA appeal to support assertions of the nature of whistleblowing disclosures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who first sought corrective action from the Special Counsel may satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this section by filing with the appeal a copy of <span class="Italic">Part 2: Reprisal For Whistleblowing</span> of the complaint form submitted to the Office of Special Counsel (Form OSC-11, <span class="Italic">Complaint of Possible Prohibited Personnel Practice or Other Prohibited Activity</span>, Rev. 8/00), together with a copy of any continuation sheet with answers to Part 2 questions filed with the Office of Special Counsel, and any supplement to Part 2 of the original complaint filed with the Office of Special Counsel or completed by the Office of Special Counsel and furnished to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One may provide copies of written OSC complaints to the AJ, but it has been stated that "proof of exhaustion need not be in the form of the appellant's complaint to OSC." <span class="Italic">Smart v. Dept. of Army,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20180129086">98 MSPR 566</a>, 573 n.4 (2005); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Kinsey v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 107 MSPR 426, 430 &#x00B6; 12, 2007 MSPB 293 (2007) (specific statements made in the appeal: "appellant may show exhaustion of his OSC <span id="Page_3871"></span>remedy through means other than his OSC complaint"); <span class="Italic">Noble v. MSPB,</span> 139 Fed. Appx. 270, 273 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP) ("[P]roof of exhaustion need not be limited to the complaint filed with OSC."). <span class="Italic">Mudd v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MUDD_DEBRA_K_CH_1221_12_0297_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_932090.pdf">120 MSPR 365</a>, 371 &#x00B6; 12, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/netsearch/viewdocs.aspx?docnumber=932090&version=935828&application=ACROBAT">2013 MSPB 90</a> (2013), enumerated several means of demonstrating proper resort to OSC:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish that she has exhausted her OSC remedy, the appellant must show what specific claims she presented to OSC. <span class="Italic">See Kukoyi v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 404, &#x00B6; 13 (2009). The appellant can demonstrate exhaustion, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, by providing her OSC complaint, any amendments to the complaint, OSC correspondence discussing the claims, and her responses to OSC correspondence discussing the claims. <span class="Italic">Id</span>....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Weinberg v. DOJ</span>, NY-1221-11-0069-W-4 (NP 9/12/2022) ("An appellant may demonstrate exhaustion through his initial OSC complaint, evidence that he amended the original complaint, including but not limited to OSC's determination letter and other letters from OSC referencing any amended allegations, and the appellant's written responses to OSC referencing the amended allegations.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Delgado v. MSPB,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20180129086">880 F.3d 913</a>, 915-22 (7th Cir. 2018), criticized the Board for rigidly formalistic insistence that the appellant provide a copy of the OSC-11 [now OSC-14] form electronically filed with OSC as a condition to Board IRA jurisdiction. The appellant's explanation was that the form could not be reprinted after it was electronically filed. The court's response was that if it wanted a copy of the form the appellant could not reprint, MSPB should have asked OSC for a copy of it. The suggestion that the Board be proactive in obtaining information from its sister agency made good sense. <span class="Italic">Delgado</span> provided the background and resolution of the jurisdictional conundrum:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Delgado filed a whistleblower complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), the federal office charged with investigating allegations that an agency has violated the Whistleblower Protection Act by retaliating against its employee for, as relevant here, disclosing "any violation of law, rule, or regulation." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(a)(1)(A), 2302(b)(8). The OSC declined to investigate. It told Delgado that he had not made a disclosure protected by the statute and that he had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his allegations of retaliation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Delgado then appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board, but the Board dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The Board reasoned that Delgado had not satisfied the requirement that he "seek corrective action before the Special Counsel before seeking corrective action from the Board." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3). According to the Board, Delgado could not prove that he made a "protected disclosure" or gave the OSC enough information to launch an investigation. Delgado has petitioned for judicial review of the dismissal of his appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(a). We find that the OSC and the Board applied unduly stringent and, we believe, arbitrary requirements on Delgado.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Delgado's Formal Whistleblower Complaint</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Delgado then filed a formal complaint with the Office of Special Counsel invoking the Whistleblower Protection Act to seek protection from retaliatory treatment. A critical point in this appeal is that Delgado's original complaint itself is not in the record. Delgado used the OSC's e-Filing System, which instructs whistleblowers to type information into a webform. <span class="Italic">See</span> OSC e-Filing, File a Complaint, <a href="https://osc.gov/pages/file-complaint.aspx">https://osc.gov/pages/file-complaint.aspx</a> (last visited Jan. 26, 2018). The instructions apparently did not then inform the person filing a complaint that he or she would be unable to retrieve a copy of the complaint when it was filed in this manner, nor did they inform the person that a copy of the complaint would be needed to pursue further review before the Merit System Protection Board. (The on-line instructions now advise the complainant to save a copy of everything sent to the OSC because it may be needed in the event of an appeal, but even now they do not say that an appeal will be dismissed unless the complainant can produce a copy.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Delgado asserts that he submitted with his formal complaint a document detailing the substance of the allegations we have recounted above, along with the court order denying Jefferson's motion for acquittal. The OSC complaint process allows for such additional documents and attachments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Delgado's Appeal to the Board</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Delgado appealed that decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board, which hears many appeals brought by federal employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), 1221. With his appeal, Delgado tendered the two letters he received from the OSC, plus a thirteen-page, single-spaced declaration, <span class="Italic">see</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1746, detailing his allegations. He also included a copy of the district court's order denying Jefferson's motion for a judgment of acquittal in the criminal case, which sets out in great detail the conflicts between the testimony of Labno and Delgado and the other agents. Delgado maintains that he submitted all of this same information to the OSC, but he apparently cannot prove that to the satisfaction of the Board without a copy of his original complaint to the OSC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The same day that Delgado filed his appeal, an administrative judge issued an order stating that "the Board might dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction without addressing the merits of the case" and directing Delgado to "file a statement, accompanied by evidence" listing information relevant to his complaint. Yet all of the information demanded by the administrative judge already was included in Delgado's declaration. The order further instructed that, if Delgado did not submit a copy of his original OSC complaint along with that agency's rejection letter (the latter having been tendered already), then his "response must be in the form of an affidavit, sworn statement, or declaration under penalty of perjury."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Demonstrating what seems like considerable patience by that point, Delgado did not simply remind the administrative judge that a declaration with the requested information already was before the Board. Instead, he submitted an additional ten-page response relating again all of the requested information (and all of the factual allegations recited earlier in this opinion). Delgado also asserted that he had submitted the same information to the OSC. But unlike Delgado's initial submission to the Board, his response to the administrative judge was not sworn. Delgado also did not submit a copy of the webform complaint he had filed with the OSC, but he did include the "e-Filing" confirmation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With this detailed information available, the administrative judge then dismissed Delgado's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The judge concluded that Delgado had failed to prove that he exhausted his remedies with the OSC as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3). The judge conceded that it was "evident from the record the appellant asked the OSC to review allegations of reprisal." But, the judge continued, Delgado had not provided a copy of his OSC complaint--the one submitted by webform. Consequently, the judge said: "Nothing in the information provided indicates the appellant gave the OSC a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation which might lead to corrective action." The administrative judge apparently refused to consider the extensive information Delgado had provided. The judge instead faulted him for not including a copy of the webform he completed on the OSC's website. The judge justified this refusal by telling Delgado that the "sufficiency of the appellant's claim to the OSC must be judged by the statements he made to the OSC, not a later characterization of his disclosures to the Board."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Delgado petitioned for review by the full Board, which denied his petition and affirmed the administrative judge's initial decision. Delgado then filed this petition for judicial review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Delgado's petition for review requires us to address three distinct aspects of the finding that he did not properly exhaust remedies before the Office of Special Counsel. The first is whether the Board properly found that Delgado's failure to submit a copy of his original complaint to the OSC was fatal to his appeal to the Board. We conclude that the Board's finding was arbitrary and capricious. The second is whether Delgado's complaint to the OSC sufficiently claimed he made a disclosure protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). We conclude that it did. The third is whether Delgado's complaint to the OSC sufficiently claimed that he had been the victim of unlawful retaliation for his protected disclosure. We find that he did, at least sufficiently to warrant investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Exhaustion Requirement--Complaint Needed?</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Whistleblower Protection Act instructs a whistleblower to "seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before seeking corrective action from the Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3). The Act itself and Board regulations do not provide any substantive explication. But the Board, applying its understanding of Federal Circuit precedents, interprets this rather unremarkable administrative exhaustion statute in a manner unlike any we have encountered in other federal statutory schemes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, in determining whether a whistleblower has exhausted remedies with the OSC, the Board refuses to consider any materials that the complainant cannot <span class="Italic">prove</span> were submitted to the OSC. This is so, the Board insists, because "the test of the sufficiency of an employee's charges of whistleblowing to the OSC is the statement that the employee makes in the complaint requesting corrective action...not the employee's <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> characterization of those statements." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., <span id="Page_3872"></span>7 F.3d 1031, 1036 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">see also,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Kukoyi v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 404, 409 (MSPB 2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That explanation seems reasonable at first. But recall that the OSC instructs federal employees wishing to file a formal complaint to type allegations into a webform on the agency's website. While saving a copy of the form before submission is listed as a "best practice" elsewhere on the site (and perhaps is an obvious step for a lawyer), the agency did not even warn <span class="Italic">pro se</span> whistleblowers that failure to do so would risk dismissal of any appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Board's approach, however, a whistleblower who failed to anticipate this need (or who overlooked the lukewarm suggestion added later to the website) would be in practice unable to appeal an adverse OSC decision. The Board will refuse to consider the allegations of an appellant who, like Delgado, attests to the information submitted to the OSC but lacks a copy of the complaint to corroborate his claim. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Abou-Hussein v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, No. AT-1221-11-0850-W-1 (MSPB Aug. 1, 2013) (dismissing for lack of jurisdiction and declining to consider detailed chronology appellant said he provided OSC because he lacked "evidence to support his bare assertion" that OSC received the document); <span class="Italic">Engler v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 109, 113 (MSPB 1995) (declining to accept appellant's affirmation that "Chronology of Events" attached to appeal was included in OSC complaint).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has issued regulations detailing what must be included in an appeal to invoke a whistleblower's right to a hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1209.6(a)(1), 1201.24(a)(1)-(9). Nowhere do those regulations require a copy of the original complaint submitted to the OSC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the Board is correct in placing on the appellant the burden to prove exhaustion, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.57(c)(1)--exhaustion is an affirmative defense in most other contexts, after all--this approach is not sound. Instructing a whistleblower to file a complaint via a simple webform and then dismissing a later appeal because he failed to print and retain a copy sets an arbitrary trap for unwary federal employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">And even if we assume the complaint itself is essential, we cannot understand why the OSC does not or could not simply forward a copy to the Board from OSC records. We are not aware of other situations in federal administrative law where the contents of the record before an agency (here, the OSC) are determined by what the appealing party submits to the reviewing body rather than by simply obtaining a copy of the agency record from the agency itself. (Compare, for example, the processes for judicial review of decisions by the Commissioner of Social Security or the Board of Immigration Appeals, where the filing of a petition for judicial review prompts the agency to forward the agency record to the reviewing court.) The OSC's record should be far more reliable than even a sworn statement from an appealing party about the contents of that record. No doubt there are other easy solutions to this apparently fatal defect in appeals to the Board. Without a clear legal requirement for a copy of the original complaint, the Board's dismissal for failure to include a copy of the original complaint was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board maintains that its administrative judge properly refused to consider the lengthy declaration Delgado tendered with his appeal, even though in it "he did specifically allege that he disclosed perjury by a co-worker." The Board reasoned that the document "contained no indicia of any kind that it also served as his complaint to OSC." In other words, the Board was unwilling to accept Delgado's sworn assertion that he presented the same substantive allegations to the OSC, since he cannot prove independently that the document contained precisely the same details he submitted to the OSC. And because on appeal Delgado states candidly that he made slight corrections and updates to the original document before submitting it to the Board, the Board insists, "he has effectively conceded that he failed to meet his burden of proof regarding exhaustion."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect, we believe this reasoning takes bureaucratic rigidity to a dysfunctional level. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), Delgado had to prove only that he "sought corrective action," not that he gave the OSC every scrap of information he possessed.</p>

Yet, in the response, Ms. Lehr's counsel failed to apprise the AJ of Ms. Lehr's pending FOIA request or the additional three pages of the OSC complaint omitted from the response, or to otherwise supplement the response with an 'affidavit, sworn statement, or declaration' as was expressly permitted."); <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="Block-Quote1">There remains, however, a further jurisdictional issue that went unaddressed below.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish that he has exhausted his OSC remedy, the appellant must show what specific claims he presented to OSC. <span class="Italic">See Kukoyi v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 404, &#x00B6; 13 (2009).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's jurisdiction order, however, only advised the appellant that disclosures made in the course of one's normal duties were not protected disclosures under the WPA.

On appeal, he also submitted copies of both appraisals. While the appellant did not specifically state that the lowered performance rating resulted from his protected disclosures, the fact that he listed it among the negative actions taken against him by the agency and referred to it as "supplementary information" indicates that he, albeit inartfully, intended that it be considered as part of his whistleblowing complaint.</p>

Contrary to the administrative judge's findings, we conclude that the appellant has sufficiently demonstrated that he provided a copy of his 'rebuttal' and his timeline to OSC and that OSC considered these submissions prior to closing its investigation of his whistleblower complaint on June 29, 2012."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Essex v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant stated in her appeal that she sought corrective action from OSC on August 6, 2008, concerning the action she was appealing, she did not submit a copy of her OSC complaint. The only evidence of exhaustion that was before the administrative judge is the December 16, 2008 closure letter from OSC. While that letter establishes that the appellant filed a complaint with OSC in which she alleged whistleblower reprisal, it contains no information describing either the complained-of personnel action or the alleged protected disclosure on which the purported reprisal was based. Nor did the appellant submit any other correspondence to or from OSC from which it could be determined whether she satisfied the exhaustion requirement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> Sutton v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's May 23, 2013 submission to OSC's CEU, this submission does not satisfy the exhaustion requirement for this appeal. OSC already had closed its file on the appellant's complaint and notified him of his Board appeal rights on March 26, 2013. The close-out letter was the key document triggering the appellant's right to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a). Any subsequent communications with OSC may have triggered a new investigation and begun a new exhaustion process, but they have nothing to do with the exhaustion process that concluded on March 26, 2013.

<p class="Body-Text">An example of amendments, including one close in proximity to the OSC closeout letter, that served to exhaust OSC remedies is <span class="Italic">Rice v. USDA</span>, 97 MSPR 501, 503-04 &#x00B6; 5 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant exhausted his administrative remedy with OSC as to his claim that his position was advertised as a vacancy. She further found, however, that he did not establish that he exhausted his remedy as to other personnel actions taken after he filed his December 19, 2002 OSC complaint because he did not show that any amendments to that complaint were accepted for investigation. With his appeal, he included copies of April 30 and May 19, 2003 letters he sent to OSC. His April 30 letter provides additional information in response to OSC's notice that it had made a preliminary determination to terminate its investigation. That letter includes a statement that the vacancy was announced while he was on detail and that his detail was being extended. The May 19 letter states that he had received a May 16, 2003 letter of reprimand, that he enclosed a copy, and that he "hop[ed] that it will add some merit to my initial complaint." The letter of reprimand described two e-mail messages that the appellant had sent concerning expenditures of funds that allegedly were to be used for specific Homeland Security purposes but that were being used for other purposes. These expenditures were part of the basis of his claim of retaliation for making protected disclosures. On July 18, 2003, OSC informed him that it was terminating its investigation. We find that the appellant brought the extension of his detail and the letter of reprimand to OSC before OSC terminated its investigation, and he has exhausted his remedy with OSC as to them. <span class="Italic">See Schmittling v</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of the Army</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 572 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-27 (2002) (although OSC issued its closure letter before the effective date of the appellant's reassignment, the record as a whole makes clear that OSC had sufficient information upon which to base an investigation).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Proof of exhaustion of OSC remedies need not be in the form of the appellant's complaint to OSC. Information may be submitted to OSC by the appellant through letter or by conversations with OSC staff members, if the content of those conversations is explained in some detail to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johns v.

NASA</span>, 83 MSPR 661, 665 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleges that the administrative judge erred in finding that he did not raise before OSC the issue of whether management believed that he initiated or contributed to the IG audit of the agency's accounting practices. The appellant asserts that he explained the relevance of the audit to OSC, and that OSC had all the facts necessary to carry out an investigation of whether agency management believed that he had initiated contact with the IG.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The overarching purpose of the exhaustion requirement for IRA appeals under the WPA is to provide OSC with sufficient basis to pursue an investigation which may lead to corrective action. <span class="Italic">Cosby v. Department of Justice</span>, 80 MSPR 409, 412 (1998). The statement that the employee makes in his complaint requesting corrective action is the test for determining whether an employee has sufficiently raised a whistleblowing charge before OSC that he has exhausted his administrative remedies. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's original complaint states that the IG complaint confirms that he was correct in his criticism of the agency's accounting methods as dishonest and illegal. Additionally, the appellant alleged that he had a conversation with the OSC official working on his complaint during which he explained the relevance of the IG investigation, offering to provide a copy, and stating that he did not cause the investigation to be initiated. We find that these facts constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that the appellant raised the issue that he was perceived as a whistleblower before OSC, entitling him to a jurisdictional hearing on this issue also.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">No rule or regulation limits the information appellant may submit to the Board to show OSC exhaustion requirements were met, <span class="Italic">Armas v. DOJ</span>, 71 MSPR 244, 250-51 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The acknowledgment order asked the appellant to submit a copy of his complaint to OSC.... Further, the acknowledgment order erroneously led the appellant to believe that it was mandatory for him to file with the administrative judge a copy of his complaint to OSC. Although the appellant's original complaint to OSC might have conclusively proved that the appellant exhausted his remedy before OSC, such conclusive proof is not necessary at this stage of the proceedings, where the appellant need only make a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction to obtain a jurisdictional hearing<span class="Italic">. See Stokes v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 685-86 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Moreover, even if conclusive proof were required, it would not necessarily have to be in the form of the appellant's complaint to OSC. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Casciotta v. Department of the Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 589, 592 (1996) (letter from OSC stating that investigation was warranted, and additional communications regarding the extent and conduct of the investigation, were sufficient to establish that appellant met exhaustion requirement).</p>
