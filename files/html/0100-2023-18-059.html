<h5 class="h5" id="sec11-60"><span class="space">e.</span> Multiple Specifications Supporting a Single Charge</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 102 MSPR 280, 283 &#x00B6; 5, 2006 MSPB 150 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining how charges are to be construed, the Board will examine the structure and language of the proposal notice. <span class="Italic">Tom v. Department of the Interior</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 395, &#x00B6; 17 (2004). In this regard, an adverse action charge usually has two parts: (1) A name or label that generally characterizes the misconduct; and (2) a narrative description of the actions that constitute the misconduct. <span class="Italic">Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 203 (1997). An agency may use a broad label such as "improper misconduct," rather than a more specific label, as long as the <span id="Page_3203"></span>reasons for the proposed action are described in sufficient detail to allow the employee to make an informed reply. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 202-03.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Dept. of Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">supra,</span> determined that the Board could not split a single agency charge into component parts and then sustain only a portion of the original charge, the court did not preclude an agency from splitting its own charge. <span class="Italic">Weaver v. USDA</span>, 55 MSPR 569, 576-77 (1992). The agency may also take a broad charge of "neglect of duty" within a factual context and argue, in support of its case, the ramifications of the charged misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McIntire v. FEMA</span>, 55 MSPR 578, 584 (1992) (neglect of duty charge was not sustained on facts before the Board); <span class="Italic">O'Quinn v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 166, 169-70 (1995) (charges of conduct unbecoming of a Postal employee and threatening a postal manager: "The agency's allegation that the police subsequently arrived and that the appellant was arrested and pled guilty to a charge of battery is not a separate element of the 'threatening' charge but merely an explanation of what transpired after the alleged threat was made.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is but one charge with several specifications, proof of one specification establishes the charge, <span class="Italic">Royster v. DOJ</span>, 58 MSPR 495, 498-99 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When taking an adverse action against one of its employees, the agency bears the burden of proving its charges by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Department of the Army</span>, 56 MSPR 415, 417 (1993). If the charge consists of more than a single element, then each of those elements must also be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Diaz</span>, 56 MSPR at 417. A single charge may not be split into several independent charges representing only a portion of the original. If the agency fails to prove an element of its charge, then the entire charge must fail. Several factual specifications, however, may be set forth in support of a single charge. Proof of one or more, but not all, of the supporting specifications may be sufficient to sustain the charge. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency's notice of proposed removal stated that the removal was "based on the following charge and specification:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Charge: Off Duty Misconduct."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This language was followed by three separate paragraphs, each of which described the appellant's threatening and harassing actions toward a different woman. The final decision letter ordering the removal of the appellant found "the charge" sustained and supported by the evidence, referring only to a single charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge erred in his determination that the agency based its action upon three separate charges. Both the notice of proposed removal and the final decision letter refer only to a single charge. The narrative descriptions of the appellant's alleged misconduct towards the three women relate the factual specifications underlying the charge of off-duty misconduct. The administrative judge found that the agency had proven the specification concerning one of the women. Therefore, we find that the proof of this supporting specification is sufficient to sustain the charge of off-duty misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Diaz</span>, 56 MSPR at 417-420.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency charged the appellant with "[v]iolation of the Department of Treasury's Minimum Standards of Conduct, Part 0.735.43, Indebtedness; tax obligations (willful and repeated failure to file Federal income taxes for tax years 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988)."

Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, both the removal proposal notice and the removal decision notice indicate that the agency intended one charge, i.e., violation of its Minimum Standards of Conduct regulations requiring employees to meet their indebtedness and tax obligations. The language of the allegedly violated regulation, which was cited in the removal proposal notice and quoted in the removal decision notice, states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Department of Treasury's Minimum Standards of Conduct, Part 0.735.43, Indebtedness; tax obligations, states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Employees shall not without good reason fail to maintain good credit and a reputation for prompt settlement of their just financial obligations in a proper and timely manner. They are expected to manage their private financial affairs in a manner which will not cause embarrassment to the Treasury Department. This particularly includes just financial obligations to Federal, State, and local governments for taxes as well as private concerns and individuals....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;In accordance with the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section that employees pay their just financial obligations in a proper and timely manner, employees must timely pay any valid tax due to a Federal, State, or local government agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;In addition, it is expected that employees will file timely and properly all tax returns in keeping with the requirements of law, regulation or ordinance, whether or not a tax is due.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, according to the removal decision notice, the agency's Minimum Standards of Conduct, Part 0.735.43, specifies distinct kinds of prohibited conduct relating to general indebtedness, as well as to tax obligations, including the failure to pay or to timely pay valid taxes under paragraphs (a) and (b), and the failure to timely and properly file tax returns under paragraph (c). The parenthetical explanation following the cited regulation in the removal proposal and removal decision notices, therefore, relates to a specification under the charge of violating the agency's Minimum Standards of Conduct, Part 0.735.43, i.e., "willful and repeated failure to file Federal income taxes for tax years 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988," as proscribed by paragraph (c) of the regulations. Additionally, the agency's allegations in both the removal proposal and removal decision notices that the appellant also failed to pay his taxes for specific tax years constitute a separate specification under paragraphs (a) and (b) of the charge of violating the agency's Minimum Standards of Conduct, Part 0.735.43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the administrative judge's fact findings, and our own review of the record, we find that the agency proved the specification of the appellant's tax indebtedness to the Internal Revenue Service based on his failure to timely pay his tax obligations for the years in question and that proof of that specification is sufficient to prove the agency's charge that the appellant violated its Minimum Standards of Conduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> Minimum Standards of Conduct, Part 0.735.43, paragraphs (a) and (b); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 172.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3204"></span>We further find that the agency proved, in part, the specification that the appellant failed to file his tax returns, inasmuch as the agency proved that the appellant failed to file a Federal income tax return for one of the years alleged in the specification, i.e., tax year 1986, and that this partly sustained specification is also sufficient to sustain the charge of violation of the agency's Minimum Standards of Conduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>., paragraph (c); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 172.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A single charge containing two specifications is capable of being severed if the specifications are independent of one another. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boykin v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 56, 58-59 (1991) (charge of "Failure to Fulfill the Requirements of Your Position" was sustained as to the use of improper language and not sustained as to an allegation concerning the failure to pass a drug test).

USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 494, 497-98 (1991) (alleged sexual remarks constituted conduct unbecoming a Postal Service employee, violated the agency's policy against sexual harassment, and interfered with other employees' work or created a hostile or abusive work environment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Care should be taken in separating charges from the details of evidence or facts supporting the charges, <span class="Italic">Hanner v. Dept. of Army</span>, 55 MSPR 113, 118-19 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge misapplied <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> in the present case, because the record does not support his conclusion that the length of the work disruption was an element of the charge. The first paragraph of the agency's notice of proposed removal, which set forth the charges against the appellant, indicated that the appellant was being removed, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, for "creating disturbances outside [his] assigned work area." The notice further indicates that the forty-minute disruption was a <span class="Italic">result</span> of the charged misconduct, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, creating a disturbance outside his assigned workplace. Thus, although the agency mentioned the length of the work disruption in its detailed narrative description of the events surrounding the incident, as a factor bearing upon the seriousness of the misconduct, it was not an essential element of the charge, and the agency was therefore not required to prove it to establish its charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another decision distinguished charges from factual specifications, despite imprecise formulation of the proposal letter, <span class="Italic">Stein v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 434, 438 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge stated in the initial decision that the agency had levelled five separate charges against the appellant. That statement is incorrect, although it is based on the agency's imprecise use of the word "charge" in its notice of proposed removal. The agency first stated in the proposal letter that the appellant was charged with "failure to maintain the integrity of Postal operations" entrusted to him by manipulating production reports "to falsely increase productivity." It then listed five separate occasions on which the appellant had allegedly manipulated mail volume reports and described each allegation as a "charge."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear from the structure of the proposal letter, however, that the agency's discussion of the "charges" was merely a description of the factual specifications of its overall charge, i.e., that the appellant had failed to maintain the integrity of Postal operations entrusted to him when he falsely increased mail volume and productivity figures.... Proof of only one of the specifications supporting a charge is sufficient to sustain the charge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Thus, if the agency established that the appellant had falsified mail volume on one occasion, then it established its overall charge of failure by the appellant to maintain the integrity of Postal operations entrusted to him. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board sought to synthesize case law distinguishing compound charges and distinct factual averments supporting a single charge, <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Dept. of Army</span>, 56 MSPR 415, 417-20 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When taking an adverse action against one of its employees, the agency bears the burden of proving its charges by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990). If the charge consists of more than a single element, then each of those elements must also be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, however, distinguished between a single charge with several factual specifications and a charge which itself consists of more than one element.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is not permissible for the [Board] to split a single charge of an agency into several independent charges and then sustain one of the newly-formulated charges, which represents only a portion of the original charge. If the agency fails to prove one of the elements of its charge, then the entire charge must fall. To be contrasted is the situation where more than one event or factual specification is set out to support a single charge. In that case, proof of one or more, but not all, of the supporting specifications is sufficient to sustain the charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the first paragraph of the notice of proposed removal prepared by the agency listed four "reasons" for the removal action, one of which was the "[m]isuse or abuse of government property." The second paragraph stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The reasons justifying this action are based on the following facts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;Misuse or abuse of government property: As Training Instructor (Auto Maintenance), your job consisted principally in developing and implementing training plans and materials and in instructing and assisting participants in auto mechanics and the use of tools and equipment. The Auto Craft Shop operations were covered by Standard Operating Procedures which specified specific internal controls. The use of the Auto Craft Shop was/is limited to military personnel and dependents and civilian employees assigned to Oakland Army Base. Your job does not include providing direct car repair services to customers. The following events indicate that you used government time, tools, equipment, and real estate to provide unauthorized services to customers for personal gain contrary to the intent of your position, to Standard Operating Procedures, and to existing rules and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This statement was followed by eight specific instances of alleged misuse or abuse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge sustained three of the eight specifications in their entirety, and four in part. In doing so, she relied generally on her findings that, in connection with each sustained specification, the appellant had used government time and/or facilities for improper purposes or had allowed others to do so. Based upon this, she sustained the charge of misuse or abuse of government property.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on the paragraph quoted above, the appellant argues that the charge contained the following three elements that must be proven if it is to be sustained: (1) The use of government property; (2) to provide unauthorized services; (3) for the purpose of personal gain. Consequently, either because a specification was sustained only in part or because it never included all of the elements, only two of the specifications should have been upheld.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge correctly determined that the charge at issue was misuse or abuse of government property. It is clear from the structure and language of the notice of proposed removal that the agency's discussion of the provision of unauthorized services for the purpose of personal gain was a narrative description of certain of the factual specifications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, when enumerating the reasons supporting the decision to remove the appellant, the agency identified the charge simply as "misuse or abuse of government property." Second, the paragraph quoted above which discussed the alleged elements is prefaced by a statement indicating that the discussion concerns the <span class="Italic">factual basis</span> for the charges leading to removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recent case law has drawn similar distinctions between the actual charges and the factual narratives outlining those charges. In <span class="Italic">Hanner v. Department of the Army</span>, 55 MSPR 113 (1992), the Board found that the appellant had been charged with creating a disturbance outside his assigned work area and that the length of the resulting disruption to the workplace was a consequence of the misconduct rather than an element of the charge. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 118-19. Again, in <span class="Italic">McIntire v. Federal Emergency Management Agency</span>, 55 MSPR 578 (1992), the Board found that the neglect of duty charge centered on the implementation of an unauthorized attendance and leave system, and that the agency's reference to the resulting criminal falsifications of attendance records was simply an explanation of the ramifications of the misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 583-84.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has upheld a charge of unsatisfactory performance of duties although the factual narrative had alleged poor performance in relation to a higher number of items than the agency had eventually proven. <span class="Italic">Smith v. United States Postal Service</span>, 55 MSPR 348 (1992). In <span class="Italic">Boykin v. United States Postal Service</span>, 51 MSPR 56 (1991), the employee was charged with failure to fulfill the position requirements, based on an incident in which his loud and abusive behavior led to the discovery that he was under the influence of drugs. The charge was sustained based on the single specification of loud and abusive behavior, the Board finding that the abusive behavior and the use of drugs were separate specifications within the charge. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 58-59.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, in a case charging an employee with the "[v]iolation of...minimum standards of conduct,...Indebtedness; tax obligations (willful and repeated failure to file Federal income taxes for tax years 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988)," the agency had proven that the appellant had failed to pay his tax obligations for the years in question and had failed to file a tax return in 1986. The Board held that the employee had been charged with the violation of the agency's minimum standards of conduct. <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 56 MSPR 224 (1993). Those standards specified certain types of prohibited actions, including the failure to pay appropriate taxes and the failure to file proper tax returns. Thus, the indebtedness and failure to meet tax obligations <span id="Page_3205"></span>were factual specifications as opposed to elements of the charge, and the parenthetical statement was a brief factual narrative of the second specification. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 230-232.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, when the agency has charged the employee with "insolent, insubordinate, and threatening behavior," based on a single, factual incident, the Board held that each of those elements must be proven to support the entire charge. <span class="Italic">Roseberry v. Veterans Administration</span>, 51 MSPR 172, 175 (1991). In <span class="Italic">Atwood v. Department of the Army</span>, 50 MSPR 289 (1991), the employee was charged with submitting falsified information on documents which were used to determine compensation entitlements under the Workers' Compensation Program. The Board did not sustain the charge, finding that the agency had proven the submission of false information but not the use of the documents to determine entitlement, both of which elements were necessary to the charge. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 291. The employee in <span class="Italic">Wolak v. Department of</span> the Army, 53 MSPR 251 (1992), was charged with providing false statements and impeding an investigation, based on a single factual incident. As above, the Board found that both elements were necessary to uphold the charge. <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 258-59.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, the Board has carefully distinguished between factual recitations supporting a charge whose essential nature does not change and a charge encompassing more than one element, each of which changes the nature of the charge. For example, if the charge in this case had been listed under the reasons for removal as the unauthorized use of government property for the purpose of personal gain rather than the misuse or abuse of government property, the agency would have been required to prove both unauthorized use and a purpose of personal gain as elements of the charge. The appellant was not removed on the basis of such a charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we find that the appellant was charged with the misuse or abuse of government property based on several factual specifications, some of which included the provision of unauthorized services for personal gain. The administrative judge properly sustained the charge based on her findings that the appellant misused or abused government property in seven of the factual specifications.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;It should also be noted that, even if the charge had contained the alleged elements, it could have been sustained based on the two factual specifications not disputed by the appellant. Proof of one of the supporting specifications is sufficient to sustain a charge<span class="Italic">. Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>

United States Marine</span> <span class="Italic">Corps</span>, 37 MSPR 427, 429 (1988). Therefore, the Board will not technically construe the wording or specifications of a charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, an agency is required to prove only the essence of its charge, and need not prove each factual specification in support of its charge. <span class="Italic">See Hicks v.

The agency's proposal notice indicates that the essence of the second charge was that the appellant misused his office by using the agency's computer system to conduct a background check on McClain, whose "identity he obtained through [his] personal relationship" with CI Bennett. The agency informed the appellant that "Bennett's problems with Ms. McClain had nothing to do with official DEA business, therefore, your use of the system in this manner constitutes misuse of office and you are so charged." Although the proposal notice cites Section 2735.16.G.4 of the agency's Personnel Manual, which prohibits the disclosure of privileged, classified, or administratively controlled information, the disclosure of information to McClain cited in the second charge was only a factual specification of the misuse of office charge, which is not part of the agency's burden of proof. <span class="Italic">See Hicks</span>, 62 MSPR at 74. Consequently, the agency need not establish that the information that the appellant disclosed to McClain was either classified or administratively controlled.</p>
