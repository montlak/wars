<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-205"><span class="space">8.</span> Remedy</h4>
<p class="noindent">If an employer conducts an interview or investigation of an employee (concerning the employee's absence from employment), and the requested representation is disallowed, under <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany and Drake</span>, 4 FLRA 397, 407 (1980) (ALJ Decision), the violation of the statutory right is not remedied, or rendered <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, because the ensuing suspension notice is canceled a month later and the matter is reinvestigated with the right to representation. A statutory violation was found, and a posting was ordered. As to the remedy for a violation, the ALJ decided in <span class="Italic">Drake</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is also contended by the General Counsel that a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> is the only remedy which could properly rectify the Respondent's misconduct herein. In this respect, it is urged that the suspension of Drake be revoked, all material in connection therewith be expunged from her files, and a restoration be made of any back pay or leave lost by the employee. General Counsel argues that had proper representation been afforded Drake...she might not have received any discipline for her absences....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While I agree that the law in the public sector has been altered to conform with the doctrine enunciated by the Supreme Court in...<span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>...the protection now afforded employees in the public sector does not, <span class="Italic">ipso</span> <span class="Italic">facto</span>, require the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy. It is noted that in the cited cases, the discharge or disciplinary action taken by management toward the employees resulted, in each instance, from an interview wherein the employees were prevented from obtaining union representation. The employers made no attempt to comply with their obligation and arrange for another interview with the presence of a union representative....&#8197;In the case at bar...[t]he original suspension had been revoked, and the disciplinary action invoked against the employee <span class="Italic">followed</span> the second meeting. Thus, Respondent had complied with the requirement under the statute before finally suspending Drake for five days.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is further maintained by the General Counsel that the second meeting herein was a "sham," and that Respondent's investigation threat was merely a formality since it used the report and information obtained at the meeting...when no union representative was present. The difficulty with this position lies in the fact that union agent Smith, during the investigation on October 15, urged Swanson to use the information gathered at the initial interview....&#8197;In this posture, the union waived any right, in my opinion, to claim that management could not properly rely upon the data secured at the first investigation....</p>
<p class="noindent">As a remedy for the improper conduct of an investigatory interview, based on an assumption that there was a nexus between the information developed <span id="page_1451"></span>during the interview and the imposition of discipline, FLRA directed the employer to rescind a reprimand issued to an employee for the conduct under investigation. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Region VII, Los Angeles and NTEU</span>, 5 FLRA 297, 298 (1981). FLRA directed the employer to cancel a suspension that it issued to an employee who declined to cooperate in an investigation after he was improperly refused representation. The employer did not establish that it would have imposed the penalty on the employee for the conduct that was under investigation. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Metro. Correctional Ctr., New York and AFGE Local 3148</span>, 27 FLRA 874, 881 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA redefined its remedial approach in cases involving denial of representational rights in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Safford and AFGE Local 2313</span>, 35 FLRA 431, 442, 446-48 (1990). There the representative was allowed at an investigatory meeting, but the representative was told to remain silent during the meeting. Although the interference by management with the right of representation was a ULP, FLRA declined to set aside the disciplinary action against the employee: there was "not a sufficient nexus between the unfair labor practice committed...and the reasons for the discipline...." Deciding that it would do the best it could to restore the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> and deter future, similar, violations by the employer, FLRA explained that the employer should repeat the investigatory interview, afford the employee full rights to union representation, and reconsider the disciplinary action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[D]enying an employee who is the subject of an examination the representation rights afforded by section 7114(a)(2)(B) deprives the employee of assistance in articulating any available defenses and thereby diminishes the possibility of avoiding an unjustified personnel action. This, in turn, deprives the employer of the benefit to be gained by preventing unnecessary loss of production time and the "hard feelings" that unjustified disciplinary actions engender among employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In this particular case, the Judge found that it is "totally possible" that, had Union representative White been allowed to take an active part in the interview, no disciplinary action would have been taken against Ms. Brannock....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[B]y depriving the Union of the opportunity to perform its statutory function of assisting a bargaining unit employee, the Agency has devalued the Union and the right to representation. We recognize that requiring a cease and desist order will contribute to restoring the status of the Union and statutory rights in the eyes of the Agency and employees. However, in our view, it will not adequately "recreate the conditions and relationships that would have been had there been no unfair labor practice."...&#8197;Specifically, a remedy limited to a cease and desist order offers meager consolation to the employee who, deprived of the right to union assistance, suffered a 5-day suspension. It offers other employees who were privy to those actions no reassurance that in similar circumstances they will receive meaningful redress if they pursue a denial of their statutory right to representation through unfair labor practice procedures....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, in this case where there has been a denial of representational rights under section 7114(a)(2)(B) and discipline has ensued, we believe that the policies of the Statute will be best effectuated by ordering the Respondent, upon request of the union and the employee, to repeat the investigatory interview and to afford the employee full rights to union representation. After repeating the investigatory interview, the Respondent will reconsider the disciplinary action taken against the employee. If on reconsideration the Respondent concludes that the disciplinary action was unwarranted or that a mitigation of the penalty is warranted, the employee will be made whole for any losses suffered to the extent consistent with the Respondent's decision on reconsideration. The Respondent will notify the employee of the results of the reconsideration, including whatever make-whole actions are to be afforded the employee and, if relevant, afford the employee any grievance or appeal rights that may exist under the parties' negotiated agreement, law or regulation with respect to the Respondent's action in reconsidering the disciplinary action....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In the attached decision, Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) Administrative Law Judge Richard A. Pearson (the Judge) found that the Respondent violated &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B)[1] and 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute)[2] by refusing to allow a Union representative to actively participate in an investigatory interview that involved the potential removal of an employee (the grievant). As relevant here, the Judge directed the Respondent to repeat the interview--if requested by the grievant or the Union--and, after repeating the interview, reconsider the grievant's removal (the interview remedy).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The question before us is whether the interview remedy, which would require the Agency to conduct another interview after the grievant admitted to using marijuana and an arbitrator had already reduced the removal penalty to a fourteen-day suspension, is appropriate in the circumstances of this case. For the reasons discussed below, the answer is no.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant was randomly selected for a urinalysis drug test.&#x2003;Several days later, a medical officer informed the grievant that he tested positive for marijuana, and the grievant admitted that he had used marijuana. The Respondent then began an investigation into the grievant's drug use. Upon the advice of the Union, the grievant requested a urinalysis retest, which confirmed the results of the original test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Then the Respondent set an interview with the grievant to discuss his positive drug test.&#x2003;The grievant requested that a Union representative be present. When the Union representative asked questions during the interview, the Respondent's investigator told the representative to stop. During this interview, the grievant again admitted to having used marijuana.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent removed the grievant from his position.&#x2003;The Union filed a grievance challenging the removal. The Respondent denied the grievance, and the parties proceeded to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Shortly after filing the grievance, the Union filed an unfair-labor-practice (ULP) charge based on the investigator's actions during the interview. The FLRA's General Counsel (GC) then issued a complaint alleging that the Respondent violated &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B)[3] and 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute[4] by refusing to allow the Union representative to participate actively in the interview (the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> violation). The GC sought the interview remedy and a notice posting.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (8).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, Arbitrator William E. Riker (the arbitrator) sustained the grievance and mitigated the grievant's removal to a fourteen-day suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Judge's Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that the Respondent violated the Union's <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> right.[5] Regarding the remedies, as relevant here, the Judge stated that, under Authority case law, when a respondent has committed a <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> violation and imposed discipline, the policies of the Statute are "best effectuated by" ordering an interview remedy.[6] The Judge also explained that the Authority has found that an interview remedy recreates "the conditions and relationships that would have been had there been no ULP," and also deters <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> violations.[7] Consequently, the Judge found that the interview remedy is appropriate and "does not inherently conflict" with the grievance arbitration.[8] To the extent that any conflict might arise between the ULP remedies and remedies awarded in the grievance arbitration, the Judge found that any conflicts could be resolved in ULP-compliance proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute provides that the "exclusive representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be represented at...any examination of an employee in the unit by a representative of the agency in connection with an investigation if (i) the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee; and (ii) the employee requests representation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). This provision is similar to the private-sector Supreme Court decision in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc</span>., 420 U.S. 251 (1975), and therefore it is often called the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> right. As relevant here, a <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> violation occurs when an employer prevents a union representative from actively participating in the examination, so long as the union representative is not preventing the employer from conducting the investigation or compromising the integrity of the investigation. <span class="Italic">See Headquarters, Nat'l Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Admin., Wash., D.C</span>., 50 FLRA 601, 607 (1995).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The interview remedy is not appropriate in the circumstances of this case.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent contends that the interview remedy would require a "duplication of effort and resources" and potentially lead to "conflicting decisions" regarding the appropriateness of the grievant's discipline. In this regard, the Respondent argues that the parties fully litigated the merits of the discipline before the arbitrator, who mitigated the grievant's removal to a fourteen-day suspension. According to the Respondent, <span id="page_1452"></span><span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, BOP, Safford, Arizona</span> (<span class="Italic">Safford</span>),[12] on which the Judge relied to determine an appropriate remedy, is distinguishable from this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;35 FLRA 431.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has broad discretion to frame remedies for ULPs.[14] In determining an appropriate remedy, the Authority considers the totality of the circumstances, rather than a mechanistic formula.[15] As relevant here, the Authority considers whether a remedy "adequately redress[es] the wrong incurred by the [ULP],"[16] specifically whether the requested remedy is "reasonably necessary" and "'recreate[s] the conditions and relationships' with which the [ULP] interfered."[17]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has permitted an interview remedy where, if the union representative had been permitted to participate in the investigatory interview, it is reasonable to conclude that no discipline would have been imposed.[18] For example, in <span class="Italic">Safford</span>, the denial of representation precluded the disciplined employee from explaining her defense during the interview, and the agency official who proposed the discipline conceded that the agency would not have disciplined the employee if it had been aware of her defense.[19] Conversely, where an agency's actions would have been the same whether or not a statutory violation occurred, and the outcome for the employee would not change, federal courts have held that requiring an agency to repeat an interview is "wasteful and unnecessary."[20]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[18]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Safford</span>, 35 FLRA at 442-43, 449 n.4; e.g., <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, Office of Internal Affairs, Wash., D.C</span>., 55 FLRA 388, 395 (1999).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, unlike in <span class="Italic">Safford</span>, there is no dispute that some type of discipline was justified because the grievant admitted to, and tested positive for, marijuana use <span class="Italic">prior to</span> any interview. Thus, the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> violation had nothing to do with, and did not lead to, the grievant's admission. Furthermore, there is no indication here that the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> violation "devalued the Union" or might make employees "less inclined to exercise the[ir statutory] rights," such that a cease-and-desist order is an insufficient remedy.[22] Moreover, there is no reasonable basis for concluding that conducting an interview at this time would reduce the grievant's fourteen-day suspension further. For all of these reasons, we find that the interview remedy mandated by the Judge is "wasteful"[23] and fails to promote "effective and efficient government."[24] Therefore, a cease-and-desist order is a sufficient remedy.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[24]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the above reasons, we find that the Judge erred in ordering the interview remedy, and we set that portion of the decision aside and modify the Judge's order appropriately. Accordingly, we need not resolve the Respondent's remaining arguments concerning that remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">Member Abbott concurred in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 709</span>, arguing that the union should not have been permitted to split the interview objections from the grievance proceedings and instead pursue that issue through a ULP. He also argued for revisitation of the law governing the conduct of investigatory interviews. Member DuBester dissented: "The case is clear: the grievant is entitled to be examined with the benefit of unfettered union representation, and to have his disciplinary action considered on the basis of the information obtained in the new interview, without reference to or reliance on information obtained during the original--and unlawful--interview."</p>
<p class="noindent">When it was unclear from the record that discipline ensued from an improper investigatory interview, FLRA could direct the respondent to show that no discipline occurred or would occur based on the information obtained from that interview and that nothing that could adversely affect the employee was retained in the employee's personnel records as a result of the interview. Alternatively, the employer could be directed under <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span> to conduct the reinterview and reconsideration process, <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Border Patrol, El Paso and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 36 FLRA 41, 52-54 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Safford, Arizona</span>, 35 FLRA 431 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>), we considered in depth what remedy is appropriate where a violation of section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute has occurred. We concluded that, in some circumstances where a denial of representation rights has occurred, a remedy limited to a cease and desist order will not adequately redress the wrong incurred by the unfair labor practice. Accordingly, we determined that where there has been a denial of representation rights under section 7114(a)(2)(B) and discipline has ensued, the policies of the Statute are best effectuated by ordering the respondent, upon request of the union and the employee, to repeat the investigatory interview and to afford the employee full rights to union representation. After repeating the investigatory interview, the respondent will reconsider the disciplinary action taken against the employee. If on reconsideration the respondent concludes that the disciplinary action was unwarranted or that a mitigation of the penalty is warranted, the employee will be made whole for any losses suffered to the extent consistent with the respondent's decision on reconsideration. The respondent will notify the employee of the results of the reconsideration, including whatever make-whole actions are to be afforded the employee and, if relevant, afford the employee any grievance or appeal rights that may exist under the parties' negotiated agreement, law or regulation with respect to the respondent's action in reconsidering the disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 447-48.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the record is silent as to whether discipline of Cruz ensued as a result of the interview with OPR in which he was denied representation rights. The record indicates that Cruz was subsequently subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury and that the U.S. Attorney, on November 30, 1987, advised OPR that he would not pursue the criminal matter any further, would decline prosecution, and the matter would be handled administratively. However, there is no indication in the record as to whether any adverse effects flowed from the investigation that are remediable under our decision in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we will require the following in order to carry out our intention, as stated in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>, "to restore the '<span class="Italic">status quo</span> that would have obtained but for the wrongful act,' <span class="Italic">Rutter-Rex</span>, 396 U.S. at 265, and to promote employee confidence in the rights and procedures established by the Statute." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 447. In determining whether there has been compliance with this decision, the Respondent shall be given an opportunity to show that no discipline to Cruz has occurred or will occur in the future based on information obtained from the unlawful investigative interview and that nothing has been retained in Cruz' personnel records as a result of the interview that could adversely effect him. If the Respondent cannot make this showing, we will order that, upon the request of the Union and Cruz, the Respondent will repeat the investigatory interview and afford Cruz full rights to Union representation. After repeating the investigatory interview, the Respondent will reconsider the disciplinary action taken against Cruz and/or the retention in Cruz' personnel records of information obtained during the April 1987 interview. If, on reconsideration, the Respondent concludes that the disciplinary action was unwarranted or that a mitigation of any penalty imposed is warranted, Cruz will be made whole for any losses suffered to the extent consistent with the Respondent's decision on reconsideration. The Respondent will notify Cruz of the results of the reconsideration, including whatever make-whole actions are to be afforded and, if relevant, afford Cruz any grievance or appeal rights that may exist under the parties' negotiated agreement, law or regulation with respect to the Respondent's action in reconsidering the disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard and Tidewater Virginia FEMTC</span>, 9 FLRA 458, 474 (1982) (ALJ Decision), the ALJ directed rescission of a letter of caution that relied in part on statements obtained during the improper investigatory interview. No remedy was directed as to another employee whose interview was suspect but against whom action was directed prior to the interview. Another remedial order arising from denial of a representation request during an investigation issued in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Internal Affairs and AFGE Council of Prison Locals</span>, 55 FLRA 388, 394-95 (1999), directing a reinterview and national posting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The Appropriate Scope for the Posting of the Notice is Nationwide.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining the scope of a posting requirement, the Authority considers the two purposes served by the posting of a notice. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, Washington, D.C.</span>, 47 FLRA 1254, 1263-64 (1990) <span class="Italic">(OIG, Washington), citing Customs Service, Miami, Florida, </span>37 FLRA at 605 (1990). First, the notice provides evidence to unit employees that the rights guaranteed under the Statute will be vigorously enforced. Second, in many cases, the posting is the only visible indication to those employees that a respondent recognizes and intends to fulfill its obligations under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Department of Housing and</span> <span class="Italic">Urban Development, San Francisco, California</span>, 41 FLRA 480, 483 (1991). There are circumstances where it is appropriate to require that notices be posted in areas other than the particular locations where the violation occurred to further these purposes. <span class="Italic">See Customs Service, Miami, Florida, </span>37 FLRA at 605. The question here, then, is whether a posting beyond the <span id="page_1453"></span>particular locations where the improper denial of representation occurred is appropriate to effectuate the purposes and polices of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the Judge, a broad posting has been ordered where the violation involved "an issue of import" to members of the unit who do not work at the site where the violations occurred. Violation of an employee's section 7114(a)(2)(B) right to representation has been found to be such an "issue of import." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">OIG, Washington, </span>47 FLRA at 1263 (single employee's <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>rights violated). Here, three employees' <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>rights were violated. In addition, an independent section 7116(a)(1) violation was found based on the Respondent's conduct toward a fourth employee who made a similar request. On the basis of this record of multiple violations involving improper responses to several requests for representation, we reject the Respondent's assertion that the violations "were not a blatant disregard for a bargaining unit member's right to request Union representation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the multiple violations, combined with the fact that the investigators' work is not limited to one facility but rather involves assignment throughout the locations of the bargaining unit. In these circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that the Respondent's disregard for <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>rights is of import to unit employees well beyond the facility where the violations occurred. Furthermore, the record does not indicate that the new procedures, assertedly instituted by the Respondent, have been announced to unit employees. A unit-wide posting would indicate to all unit employees that their<span class="Italic"> Weingarten </span>rights will be vigorously enforced, and that the Respondent recognizes and intends to fulfill its obligations under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, in trying to minimize its culpability, the Respondent argues that the evidence does not show it has refused to abide by earlier orders. While factually correct, the argument ignores the multiple violations here, combined with, at best, confusion by not one, but several investigators, about whether there is a policy to deny requests for Union representatives who are attorneys.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Affirmative Relief</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the absence of exceptions, we adopt the Judge's order to remedy the violations involving Bower and Zuckswordi. To remedy the violation concerning the Nickerson interview, we modify the order to include a provision to protect Nickerson from discipline in the future based on any information obtained in the investigative interview conducted when his <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>rights were violated. We also require that if any adverse information has been retained in Nickerson's personnel records from that interview, such information is to be expunged from his records.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Judge indicated that disciplinary action was taken against Nickerson as a result of that interview. We order that the investigative interview of Mr. Nickerson be repeated at the request of the Union and Mr. Nickerson, with appropriate Union representation, and that the disciplinary action previously taken against Mr. Nickerson be reconsidered based on information obtained in the new interview without reference to or reliance on information obtained in the interview of February 8, 1996. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, Safford, </span>35 FLRA at 447-48. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also, OIG Washington, </span>47 FLRA at 1264-65. Finally, our order directs that Mr. Nickerson be made whole for any losses suffered to the extent consistent with the decision by the Respondent on reconsideration, and be afforded grievance and arbitration rights to which he is entitled.</p>
