<p class="Block-Quote1">Waiver of recovery of an overpayment is only granted when the annuitant shows <span class="Italic">both</span> that he is without fault and that recovery would be against equity and good conscience. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b); <span class="Italic">Sawyer v.

The appellant bears the burden of proving by substantial evidence that he is eligible for a waiver. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1407(b); <span class="Italic">Russell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 125, 127 (1995). Where the appellant is not without fault in creating the overpayment, he is not entitled to waiver of recovery of the overpayment.<span class="Italic"> Boring v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6; 4 (1998). However, where an appellant is not entitled to waiver of recovery of an overpayment, he may nevertheless be entitled to have the repayment schedule adjusted on the grounds of financial hardship.<span class="Italic"> Boring,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once the Board finds that there is a debt owed to the retirement fund and that the amount of the debt is correct, it lacks any authority in statute or regulation to unilaterally reduce the amount of the debt. The Board has the statutory authority to order OPM to waive recovery of the entire overpayment if the Board finds that the recipient was "without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b); <span class="Italic">see Dela Casa v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 287, 290 (1994). The Board also has the authority, based on an individual appellant's financial situation, to order OPM to adjust the monthly repayment schedule. <span class="Italic">See Sawyer,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. at 533. The Board has no authority, however, to decide on its own to reduce the amount of the overpayment once OPM has proven that the amount of the overpayment is correct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mitchell v. OPM</span>, 97 MSPR 566, 570-71 &#x00B6; 12 (2004), added as to the source of the erroneous payment that is the subject of the OPM collection effort:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction to review OPM's final decisions on requests that recovery of annuity overpayments be waived. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1304; <span class="Italic">Dubin v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. 437, 439 (1988). Moreover, under Board and judicial precedent, this jurisdiction extends beyond cases in which the Board has jurisdiction to consider the propriety of the overpayment determination itself. That is, the Board has jurisdiction to review OPM's decisions on waiver requests even in cases in which the overpayments allegedly resulted from errors in calculating or deducting benefits that--like the life insurance benefits that led to the overpayment at issue in the present case--are governed by provisions that are not a part of subchapter III of chapter 83 or a part of subchapter VI of chapter 84. <span class="Italic">See Shannon v. U.S. Civil Service Commission,</span> 444 F. Supp. 354, 357-59 (N.D. Cal. 1977) (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b) limits recovery of any amounts incorrectly paid to an annuitant in his retirement check, and not just those amounts that can be traced solely to miscalculation of gross annuity entitlement under subchapter III of chapter 83), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds,</span> 621 F.2d 1030 (9th Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Lee v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 149, 152-54 (1987) (the Board lacked jurisdiction to determine whether the annuitant was liable for health benefits costs that OPM had failed to deduct from his annuity payments, but it reviewed the annuitant's entitlement to waiver of recovery of the resulting alleged overpayment); <span class="Italic">Mitchell,</span> 25 M.S.P.R. at 188-89 (although the Board found that it had no jurisdiction to determine whether an overpayment had resulted from a change in health insurance coverage, it indicated in doing so that the appellant was entitled to a hearing on his request that recovery of the alleged overpayment be waived). The fact that the alleged overpayment at issue in this case resulted from a determination by OPM that may not be reviewed by the Board on appeal therefore does not preclude the Board from reviewing OPM's decision on the appellant's waiver request.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM has the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that an overpayment occurred. <span class="Italic">Owens v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 86, 90 (1990) (there was no evidence that the appellant was eligible for OASI benefits, and therefore there was no proof of an overpayment). OPM must provide all the relevant, material, and credible evidence bearing on the amount and existence of an overpayment. That burden of proof is not met simply based on the absence of an objection from the appellant. The burden of proof does not shift to the appellant until OPM proves the existence and amount of overpayment by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Sansom v. OPM</span>, 62 MSPR 560, 567 (1994). OPM can recover an amount due even if, as determined in submission on appeal, if it is less than what it claimed in the reconsideration decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grasso v. OPM</span>, 74 MSPR 299, 301 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Business records from OPM are acceptable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hansen v. OPM</span>, 35 MSPR 1, 2-4 (1987) (OPM printouts are sufficient to meet its evidentiary burden, although they may technically be hearsay, the AJ must direct the parties to product such evidence, including any necessary testimony from an OPM witness, that will permit an interpretation of the records sufficient to permit an informed judgment on the overpayment dispute). As to OPM documentation in an overpayment dispute, <span class="Italic">Lusk v. OPM,</span> DE-0845-15-0178-B-1 (NP 4/14/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, to assail hearsay evidence, an appellant needs to offer specific inaccuracies or discrepancies, show the material was not routinely made in the ordinary course of business, or establish the material is inherently unreliable, untrustworthy, or noncredible. <span class="Italic">See Wisecup v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 191, 193-94, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 809 F.2d 790 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Table). The appellant asserts that OPM submitted paid and due calculations that were prepared specifically for litigation, contradict one another, and do not show what OPM actually paid to her. However, a master printout and other documents produced by OPM in the ordinary course of business are sufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant was overpaid. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 55 M.S.P.R. 21, 23 (1992). These calculations, which would have been prepared in the ordinary course of business, were corrected to reflect that the appellant was paid for 13 months between April 1, 2010 through April 30, 2011, as opposed to the prior paid and due calculations that showed that she was paid for 1 month during that time. This correction does not demonstrate that the paid and due calculation is otherwise unreliable. Thus, the appellant's general argument that this evidence does not "actually show what has been paid," also does not provide a basis for discrediting the evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, distinguished a case that limited OPM's jurisdiction in appeals by appellants seeking to rectify errors in insurance benefits that are supposed to be paid from their annuities, 97 MSPR at 569-70 &#x00B6; 8-10:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's finding that the Board lacked jurisdiction over this appeal was based on <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 68 (2001). As the initial decision indicates, that case also concerned OPM's failure to deduct from an annuity money allegedly owed as a result of the annuitant's election to receive unreduced life insurance benefits following his retirement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2-3; <span class="Italic">Campbell,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 68, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-5. The Board found that it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">Campbell,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 68, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8347(d)(1) and 8461(e)(1), an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual under subchapter III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 83 and subchapter VI of chapter 84 generally may be appealed to the Board. Because the FEGLI program is not covered under chapter 83 or chapter 84 of title 5, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review OPM's determination that it failed to withhold from an annuity the correct amount of life insurance premiums. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 301 F.3d 1352, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the Board lacked jurisdiction to review OPM's refusal to permit an individual to purchase additional life insurance); <span class="Italic">cf. Mitchell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 25 M.S.P.R. 186, 189 (1984) (the Board has no jurisdiction to review OPM's determination that an overpayment occurred as a result of a health plan enrollment decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>--the decision on which the administrative judge relied in dismissing this appeal--the annuitant attempted to challenge OPM's conclusion that he owed a certain amount as a result of a delay in implementing his election to receive unreduced life insurance coverage. <span class="Italic">See Campbell,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 68, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4. Because the Board has no authority to review such a conclusion, the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 12. The present appeal differs from <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> and the other cases cited above, however, in an important respect. In this appeal, as noted above, the appellant seeks Board review of OPM's refusal to waive recovery of the alleged overpayment. That is, the appellant in this case has argued that OPM's initial failure to deduct the proper amount from his annuity payments led him to continue his unreduced life insurance coverage longer than he otherwise would have continued it and that OPM therefore should not recover the alleged overpayment from him. He also argued below, as noted above, that recovery would cause him hardship.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McIntosh v. OPM</span>, 104 MSPR 544, 2007 MSPB 29 (2007) (Board had jurisdiction over a request for waiver of OPM's failure to correctly withhold life insurance premiums from the annuity of appellant); <span class="Italic">McMakin v. OPM</span>, 32 MSPR 294, 299 (1987) ("OPM has the authority to correct legally erroneous annuity payments even if the fault is OPM's. <span class="Italic">E.g., Gray v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 559, 561 (1986). OPM, further, cannot be estopped from enforcing the substantive requirements for a retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">E.g., Graef v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 676, 678 (1984).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4408"></span>As to the burden of proof of criteria for a waiver of an overpayment, under <span class="Italic">Dela Casa v. OPM</span>, 60 MSPR 287, 290 (1994), the standard for the appellant to meet is substantial evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We nonetheless reopen the appeal because the administrative judge applied the wrong standard of proof. As mentioned above, he stated in his initial decision that the appellant failed to show by preponderant evidence that she was without fault in creating the overpayment. She was only required to make such a showing by the less rigorous measure of substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 21, 24(1992) relying on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1407(b)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(1) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(p)] (substantial evidence is a lower standard of proof than preponderance of the evidence; it is "[t]he degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering the record as a whole, might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, even though other reasonable persons might disagree"). Nevertheless, as we explain below, the administrative judge's finding that the appellant was not without fault in creating the overpayment is fully supported by the record, even when evaluated in light of the appropriate standard of proof.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may remand overpayment appeals so that AJs may obtain more specific financial information necessary to determine the accuracy of OPM's calculations and, in the process, the Board may direct further remand to OPM for consideration of waiver of overpayments or adjustments of repayment schedules if those matters were not earlier considered by OPM but are raised in the course of the Board appeal from the basic overpayment determination. A remand resulted in <span class="Italic">Lusk v. OPM</span>, DE-0845-15-0178-I-1 (NP 9/11/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM bears the burden of proving the existence and amount of an annuity overpayment by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Vojas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 10 (2011); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.307(a). Where the Board cannot determine on the record before it whether the annuitant received an overpayment in the amount asserted, but where OPM's evidence, if clarified through additional explanatory material, could establish the existence and amount of the overpayment, the Board may remand the appeal to provide OPM the opportunity to clarify its evidence. <span class="Italic">See Cohron v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 466, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 22-23 (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM failed to explain below that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8452(d)(1), its calculation of the appellant's new annuity rate was based upon her earned annuity rate. On petition for review, OPM asserts that, in calculating the appellant's earned annuity rate, it relied on an average salary of $49,648, service of 20 years and 9 months, and a .98 part-time proration factor. However, based upon our review of the appellant's individual retirement record, we cannot easily discern how OPM calculated these figures. This is particularly true because the appellant's work history included part-time employment, leave without pay, and receipt of Office of Workers' Compensation Programs benefits. Thus, even if we consider OPM's explanations offered for the first time on review, we cannot determine whether OPM has proven an amount certain that the appellant received in overpayment. We therefore remand the appeal for additional clarification by OPM. <span class="Italic">See Cohron</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 466, &#x00B6; 23. On remand, the administrative judge should direct OPM to submit additional evidence and argument regarding how it calculated the overpayment and the appellant should be afforded an opportunity to present additional evidence and argument in response to any submission by OPM. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The administrative judge shall convene another hearing if requested by the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant now raises the issue of waiver of any overpayment and the adjustment of any repayment schedule, the Board does not have jurisdiction over these issues because OPM did not issue a final reconsideration decision regarding them. <span class="Italic">See Godbout v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 466 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (finding that, because OPM did not discuss the issue of waiver of the overpayment in its reconsideration decision, the Board could not reach the issue). Therefore, if the administrative judge finds that OPM has proven an amount certain in overpayment, he should remand the appeal to OPM for issuance of a reconsideration decision regarding the issue of waiver of the overpayment, and, if applicable, the adjustment of a repayment schedule.</p>
