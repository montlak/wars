<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-78"><span class="space">g.</span> Equitable Tolling</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 1209.5 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Equitable tolling; extension of filing deadline</span>. The appellant's deadline for filing an individual right of action appeal with the Board after receiving written notification from the Special Counsel that it is terminating its investigation of his or her allegations is subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling, which permits the Board to extend the deadline where the appellant, despite having diligently pursued his or her rights, was unable to make a timely filing. Examples include cases involving deception or in which the appellant filed a defective pleading during the statutory period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulation was added in late 2012, with the comment [77 FR 62374 (Oct. 12, 2012] that it was mean to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">eliminate the distinction between IRA appeals and otherwise appealable actions in light of the change made to <span class="blue">5 CFR 1209.2</span>, and to revise the language regarding equitable tolling consistent with the changes made in sections <span class="blue">5 CFR 1208.21</span> and .22. [USERRA and VEOA]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The limitations of equitable tolling in an IRA case were noted in <span class="Italic">Post v. DOJ</span>, CH-1221-15-0699-W-1 (NP 5/12/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the implementing provisions of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a), the filing period for an IRA appeal is statutory--not regulatory. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A); <span class="Italic">Heimberger v. Department of Commerce</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 9 (2014). Unlike the Board's regulatory time limits for appeals filed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, the statutory time limit for filing an IRA appeal cannot be waived for good cause shown because there is no statutory mechanism for doing so. <span class="Italic">Heimberger</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 9. However, the filing deadline might be subject to equitable tolling, under which the filing period is suspended for equitable reasons, such as when the complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the deadline to pass or where he filed a defective pleading during the statutory period. <span class="Italic">Wood</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 593 (citing <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990)). Equitable tolling is a rare remedy that is to be applied in unusual circumstances and generally requires a showing that the litigant has been pursuing his rights diligently and some extraordinary circumstances stood in his way. <span class="Italic">Heimberger</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 10. Equitable tolling does not extend to mere "excusable neglect." <span class="Italic">Wood</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 593 (quoting <span class="Italic">Irwin</span>, 498 U.S. at 96).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as noted above, the appellant, through his attorney, urges the Board to apply equitable tolling to excuse his untimely filing because his attorney miscalculated the filing deadline and misread the date of the OSC close-out letter due to deteriorating vision, and the appellant reasonably relied on his experienced attorney to timely file the appeal. These circumstances, while unfortunate, do not constitute the type of extraordinary circumstances that warrant tolling a statutory deadline. <span class="Italic">See Irwin</span>, 498 U.S. at 96; <span class="Italic">Heimberger</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12; <span class="Italic">Pacilli v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 526, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 404 F. App'x 466 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Therefore, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's IRA appeal was untimely filed and that he has not alleged any circumstances that would warrant the application of equitable tolling to excuse his untimeliness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we generally agree with the administrative judge's analysis of this case, we wish to clarify the legal basis for the dismissal. The initial decision states at one point that the appeal is dismissed because the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal. However, time prescriptions are not jurisdictional. <span class="Italic">Heimberger</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 13. The correct disposition for this case is dismissal as untimely filed and, because the appeal is dismissed on timeliness grounds, we do not reach the jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The decisions that follow generally predate the regulatory revision permitting equitable tolling. Before the change, the doctrine of equitable tolling was not established for IRA appeals to MSPB, <span class="Italic">Burnett v. MSPB</span>, 513 Fed. Appx. 960, 962-63 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board correctly found that the time limit for filing an IRA appeal cannot be waived for good cause. <span class="Italic">Wood v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 587, 592 (1992) (stating that because the WPA set a statutory time limit without providing for extensions of time, an "IRA appeal cannot be waived for good cause shown under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c)"). The WPA did not specify any circumstances in which the time limit will be waived, and therefore, such a waiver provision may not be read into the statute. <span class="Italic">See Speker v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 45 M.S.P.R. 380, 385 (M.S.P.B. 1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 928 F.2d 410 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Wood</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 591-93. Accordingly, Ms. Burnett's numerous submissions purporting to show "good cause" do not help her in attaining a waiver of the statutory time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also adopted the administrative judge's findings that Ms. Burnett failed to show that (a) she received the March 23, 2011 OSC notification more than five days after its issuance, (b) the agency engaged in affirmative conduct that affected the timeliness of her appeal, or (c) she failed to receive any notice from the OSC--any of which showings would have sufficed as reason for further consideration of whether her appeal should not be dismissed. We agree. The record is devoid of any factual allegation by Ms. Burnett that she is entitled to leniency on the timeliness issue based on these grounds.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ryan v. Dept. of Commerce,</span> DC-1221-10-0239-W-1 (NP 10/19/2010), explained as to equitable tolling and other reasons, including a continuing violation theory, unsuccessfully offered by the appellant to excuse a late Board filing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant reasserts on review that the agency engaged in conduct that induced her into failing to timely file her appeal and, thus, that the administrative judge erred in finding that the doctrine of equitable tolling is unwarranted under the circumstances of this case. As the administrative judge correctly found, neither the Board nor its reviewing court have decided whether the doctrine of equitable tolling is applicable to the issue of the timeliness of an individual right of action (IRA) appeal. <span class="Italic">See Montez v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 230, 233 (1992). If the Board were to decide that equitable tolling could excuse an untimely filed IRA appeal, the appellant would have to prove either that she had actively pursued her Board appeal rights by filing a defective pleading during the statutory filing time period, or that she was induced or tricked by the agency's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass. <span class="Italic">See Montez</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. at 233. However, the doctrine does not apply to mere "excusable neglect." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The administrative judge found that the doctrine of equitable tolling would not excuse the appellant's untimely filing because the appellant had initiated the settlement negotiation process and the uncontested evidence failed to support an assertion that the agency had engaged in misconduct that had induced her not to timely file her appeal. We find that the uncontested record evidence supports that finding. Thus, we need not reach the issue of whether the doctrine could be invoked to excuse an untimely filed IRA appeal because the uncontested record evidence would not bring the appellant's appeal within its limits. <span class="Italic">See Montez</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. at 233.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also reasserts on review that "ongoing health issues stemming from the stress and psychological trauma of her treatment at the [agency] made it extremely difficult for Appellant to work on filing her appeal to the MSPB during that period." This claim is legally unavailing. As the administrative judge already correctly explained in the initial decision, the Board has found that the statutory filing time limit for IRA appeals is not subject to waiver for good cause under the Board's standard set forth in its regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). <span class="Italic">See Goode v. Department of the Navy</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 122, &#x00B6; 4 (2002); <span class="Italic">see also Greene v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 183 F. App'x 943, 944 (2006) (non-precedential table opinion) ("The Board has correctly stated its law, namely that the 65-day time limit for filing of an IRA appeal to the Board cannot be waived."). Further, even if equitable tolling were applicable to this case, her alleged medical condition would not be a sufficient basis for applying that doctrine. <span class="Italic">See Greene</span>, 183 F. App'x at 944-45.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that her appeal is timely filed under the doctrine of continuing violations because she filed her appeal within 65 days of <span id="Page_3778"></span>alleged acts evidencing whistleblower reprisal that occurred after the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) issued its May 29, 2009 closure letter. However, the time limit for filing an IRA appeal with the Board is based on the date OSC issued notice to the appellant that it was closing its investigation into her complaint of whistleblower reprisal, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A)(i)-(ii); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a)(1), and not on the time the alleged acts of reprisal occurred. Therefore, the continuing violation theory is inapplicable in this context. Thus, we find that the administrative judge correctly concluded that the appellant's continuing violations theory does not cure her failure to file a timely appeal after receipt of OSC's May 29, 2009 closure letter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stefanick v. Dept. of State,</span> DC-1221-14-0959-W-1 (NP 7/31/2015) ("For the reasons cited in the initial decision, the appellant's difficulty in obtaining information from the agency pursuant to a FOIA request is not an extraordinary circumstance establishing grounds for equitable tolling of the time limit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Heimberger v. Department of Commerce</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 10 (2014).... Finally, the appellant's due process and fraud arguments are immaterial to the timeliness issue and, even if proven, would not establish a basis for equitable tolling because of her failure to diligently pursue a Board appeal based on the clear notice in OSC's closure letter. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Heimberger</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 10.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wood v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 54 MSPR 587, 591-93 (1992), declined to accept a doctrine of equitable tolling or equitable estoppel and explained that once OSC provides notice to an employee that it has terminated its investigation, the statute provides that the employee must file an IRA appeal with the Board within the regulatory time limit of 65 days, regardless of the duration of OSC's investigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Except in a case in which an employee has the right to appeal directly to the Board, an employee must seek corrective action with OSC before filing an IRA appeal with the Board. 5 USC 1214(a)(3). Such an appeal is timely if "no more than 60 days have elapsed since notification was provided [by OSC] to such employee...that [its] investigation was terminated...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The phrase "notification was provided" could be subject to more than one interpretation. It could refer to the date OSC issued its termination notice, the date it mailed this notice to the employee, or to the date the employee received the notice. Although the statutory language may be ambiguous, the Board's construction of it in its implementing regulation is very clear:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under [5 USC 1214(a)(3)], an appeal must be filed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1) No later than 65 days after the date of issuance of the Office of Special Counsel's written notification to the appellant that it was terminating its investigation of the appellant's allegations....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 CFR 1209.5(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed in this case that the appellant's IRA appeal was not filed within 65 days after the issuance of OSC's termination notice on October 11, 1991. It was therefore untimely under 5 USC 1214(a)(3). The remaining question is whether the Board has the authority to waive this time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board's regulations governing IRA appeals do not directly address whether the time limit for filing an IRA appeal may be waived, they do provide that, "Except as expressly provided in this part, the Board will apply subparts A, B, C, E, F, and G of 5 CFR part 1201 to appeals...governed by this part." 5 CFR 1209.3. One of the regulations in subpart B of part 1201 provides that "[I]f a party does not submit an appeal within the time set by statute, regulation, or order of a judge, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is shown." 5 CFR 1201.22(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite this regulation, the administrative judge found, relying on our decision in <span class="Italic">Speker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 45 MSPR 380 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 928 F.2d 410 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table), that the time for filing an IRA appeal could not be waived for good cause shown. We there stated that a filing deadline prescribed by statute or administrative regulation can be waived only where: (1) The statute or regulation itself specifies circumstances in which the time limit will be waived; (2) an agency's affirmative misconduct precludes it from enforcing an otherwise applicable rule under the doctrine of equitable estoppel;[9] and (3) an agency's failure to provide a mandatory notice of election rights warrants the waiver of the time limit for making the election. 45 MSPR at 385.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Subsequent to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Speker</span>, the Supreme Court held that the doctrine of equitable estoppel could not be applied to require the Federal government to grant monetary benefits to an individual who did not meet the statutory requirements for such benefits. <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 110 S. Ct. 2465, 2467, 2476, 110 L. Ed.2d 387 (1990). We accordingly modified <span class="Italic">Speker</span> to the extent that it was in conflict with <span class="Italic">Richmond</span>. <span class="Italic">Fox v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 50 MSPR 602, 606 n.4 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We concur with the administrative judge that the first basis for waiver cited in <span class="Italic">Speker</span> has no applicability to an IRA appeal. The Whistleblower Protection Act not only created the right to file an IRA appeal, it also set a statutory deadline for the filing of such an appeal, without making any provision for the acceptance of late filings. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1214(a)(3). IRA appeals are thus unlike adverse action appeals, where the time limit for filing an appeal is governed exclusively by the Board's administrative regulation, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR 1201.22(b), or petitions for review of initial decisions, where the statute itself provides for extension of the time limit "for good cause shown." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7701(e)(1). We therefore conclude that the time limit for filing an IRA appeal cannot be waived for good cause shown under 5 CFR 1201.22(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We similarly find that neither of the other bases for waiver cited in <span class="Italic">Speker</span> is applicable to this case. The appellant has alleged no facts that would support an equitable estoppel against the government.[10] Nor does he claim that OSC failed to provide notice that it was terminating its investigation of his allegations of reprisal for whistleblowing activities, as required by 5 USC 1214(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;The rule announced by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> against applying equitable estoppel against the Federal Government applies only to claims for monetary benefits<span class="Italic">. See</span> 496 U.S. at 414-17, 432-34, 110 S. Ct., at 2467, 2476. We have no occasion to address whether <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> applies to a performance appraisal or the termination of a term appointment, the matters challenged in the IRA appeal. We note that, although neither matter is a direct claim for a specific monetary benefit, the relief sought would include backpay and other monetary benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that, subsequent to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Speker</span>, the Supreme Court held that there is a rebuttable presumption that the doctrine of equitable tolling can be invoked in certain circumstances to excuse an untimely filed lawsuit against the Federal government. <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Veterans Administration</span>, 498 U.S. 89, 111 S. Ct. 453, 457, 112 L. Ed.2d 435 (1990). Such circumstances include situations where a claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period, or where the complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., 111 S. Ct. at 458. The doctrine does not extend to mere "excusable neglect," however. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant here has alleged no facts that would bring him within the doctrine of equitable tolling. We therefore need not, and do not, decide whether the doctrine of equitable tolling may be invoked in appropriate circumstances to excuse an untimely filed IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Montez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 230, 232-33 (1992), reiterated the Board's disinclination to waive the time for an IRA appeal through equitable tolling:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Subsequent to the initial decision in this case...the Board ruled that it has no legal authority to waive the time limit for filing an IRA appeal for good cause shown. <span class="Italic">Wood v. Department of Air Force</span>, 54 MSPR 587 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In Wood, the Board noted the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Veterans Administration</span>, 111 S. Ct. 453, 457 (1990), which held that there is a rebuttable presumption that the doctrine of equitable tolling can be invoked in certain circumstances to excuse an untimely lawsuit against the Federal government.... Such circumstances include situations where a claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period, or where the complainant has been induced into allowing the filing deadline to pass.... The doctrine does not extend to mere "excusable neglect," however. Here, we need not reach the issue of whether the doctrine could be invoked to excuse an untimely IRA appeal because the appellant has not alleged facts which, if true, would bring the appellant within its limits....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">For the first time on review, the appellant contends that in light of events in his personal life, he exercised "DUE DILIGENCE in it's [sic] truest context given the history was pursued." Additionally, he cites <span class="Italic">Holland v. Florida</span>, 130 S. Ct. 2549, 2560 (2010), in which the Supreme Court found that the statutory deadline for filing a habeas corpus petition under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2244(d), may be equitably tolled. The Supreme Court issued <span class="Italic">Holland</span> on June 14, 2010, which pre-dates the appellant's October 5, 2010 appeal form. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Holland</span>, 130 S. Ct. 2549. Because he has not shown that these arguments are based on new and material evidence that was unavailable prior to the close of the record below, despite his due diligence, the Board need not consider them for the first time on review. <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980). In any event, <span class="Italic">Holland</span> does not address the applicability of equitable tolling in untimely IRA appeals. <span class="Italic">See Holland</span>, 130 S. Ct. at 2559-65.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant merely disagrees with the administrative judge's finding that he failed to allege circumstances warranting equitable tolling. Based upon our review of the record evidence and the applicable law, we discern no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that equitable tolling applies in untimely filed IRA appeals, none of the limited circumstances are evidence in this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Irwin v.

Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 11 (2007). To the extent that the appellant challenges the adequacy of the administrative judge's timeliness notice, we find that the timeliness show cause order adequately apprised the appellant of the timeliness standard, including that the statutory time limit cannot be waived for good cause shown, and the limited circumstances warranting equitable tolling.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On facts predating the 2012 regulation, <span class="Italic">Heimberger v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HEIMBERGER_DEBRA_A_CH_1221_13_0007_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1003060.pdf">121 MSPR 10</a>, 14-15&#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12, 2014 MSPB 18 (2014), found no basis for equitable tolling based on a somewhat ambiguous closeout letter from OSC concerning the ability to obtain OSC reconsideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the implementing provisions of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a), the filing period for an IRA appeal is statutory--not regulatory. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A); <span class="Italic">see Wood v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 587, 591 &#x0026; n.7 (1992). Unlike the Board's regulatory time limits for appeals filed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, the statutory time limit for filing an IRA appeal cannot be waived for good cause shown because there is no statutory mechanism for doing so. <span class="Italic">Pacilli v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the filing deadline might be subject to equitable tolling, under which the filing period is suspended for equitable reasons, such as when the complainant has been induced or tricked by her adversary's misconduct into allowing the deadline to pass.[2] <span class="Italic">Wood</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 592; <span class="Italic">see Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990); <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Department of the Army</span>, 479 F.3d 830, 839 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Equitable tolling is a rare remedy that is to be applied in unusual circumstances and generally requires a showing that the litigant has been pursuing her rights diligently and some extraordinary circumstances stood in her way. <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Kato</span>, 549 U.S. 384, 396 (2007); <span class="Italic">Pace v. DiGuglielmo</span>, 544 U.S. 408, 418 (2005). For the following reasons, we find no basis to apply the doctrine in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Although the Board has discussed the matter several times, it never has actually decided whether the filing period in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A) is in fact subject to equitable tolling. We likewise find no basis to resolve the issue in the context of this appeal because the appellant has not alleged facts that would bring her situation within that doctrine. <span class="Italic">See Raiszadeh v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 94, &#x00B6; 6 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we have considered the appellant's argument that her untimely filing should be excused because it was based on previously unavailable evidence. The discovery of previously unavailable evidence may constitute good cause to waive the Board's regulatory filing deadlines. <span class="Italic">See Owen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 449, &#x00B6; 6 (2000). However, we find that the discovery of new evidence does not generally constitute the type of extraordinary circumstance that warrants tolling a statutory deadline, especially where, as here, there is no indication that the evidence was previously unavailable because the agency improperly concealed it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we have considered the language in OSC's April 7, 2011 close-out letter. The language that OSC used is not a model of clarity. The letter at once notified the appellant of her Board appeal rights and the time limit for pursuing them, and invited her to seek reconsideration directly from OSC. Thus, the close-out letter appears to have given the appellant two options for further action, but it did not inform her of the consequences of electing one versus the other. We can see how a reasonable person might have been affirmatively mislead by this language into seeking reconsideration from OSC while her time period for filing with the Board, unbeknownst to her, continued to run. These circumstances would constitute a least an arguable basis for equitable tolling. But we find that that is not what happened here. Rather than diligently pursuing her rights as instructed by OSC, the appellant apparently resigned herself to the close-out decision for over a year until she decided to start pursuing the matter again because of events that developed in a different forum. Because the appellant did not diligently pursue her whistleblower claim during the period to be tolled, and because it does not appear that the potentially misleading language in OSC's close-out letter was causally related to the appellant's untimely filing, we find that she has not shown that she pursued her rights diligently but was frustrated by extraordinary circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Novartis AG v. Lee</span>, 740 F.3d 593, 600 (Fed. Cir. 2014). For these reasons, we find that the appellant has not shown a sufficient basis to toll the filing deadline and that the appeal must be dismissed as untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf. Hare v. NCUA</span>, PH-3443-14-0638-C-1 (NP 5/10/2022) ("In certain instances, the Board considers whether to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling to a statutory deadline under which the filing period is suspended for equitable reasons. For instance, the Board has considered equitable tolling in individual right of action (IRA) appeals and Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA) appeals to determine whether a case should be considered timely filed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Heimberger v. Department of Commerce</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12 (2014) (considering the doctrine of equitable tolling and finding that the appellant did not show a sufficient basis to toll the filing deadline of her IRA appeal pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A)).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit determined that there was no basis for applying equitable tolling, and in <span class="Italic">Reutershan v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3493), the appellant was unable to persuade the court that the filing period should be extended to include the period it took OSC to consider a request for reconsideration of an unfavorable closeout of his WPA complaint:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Waiver for Good Cause</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reutershan does not contest that his IRA appeal to the Board was postmarked 82 days after the issuance of OSC's notice of termination and, therefore, is untimely filed under both the statute and regulation. However, he contends the time limit should be waived for good cause because he reasonably assumed that the 65 day regulatory time limit for filing an appeal to the Board did not begin to run until OSC issued a further decision following its August 19, 1993 letter agreeing to consider whether to reopen its investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless of whether Reutershan's assumption as to when the time limit began to run was reasonable, the Board may not waive the time limit for good cause. Decisions of the Board have made clear that neither the statute nor the regulations grant it this authority or specify circumstances in which the time limit may be waived. <span class="Italic">Wood v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 54 MSPR 587, 593 (1992); <span class="Italic">Montez v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 230, 232-33 (1992); <span class="Italic">Pashun v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 54 MSPR 594, 596, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 985 F.2d 585 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that waiver of the time limit cannot be considered under the relevant statute. To allow such a waiver would impermissibly amend the statute. Reutershan's late filing with the Board is analogous to appeals brought before this court from Board decisions in which the 30-day statutory period for appeal is a jurisdictional requirement and therefore cannot be waived. <span class="Italic">Monzo v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 735 F.2d 1335, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 1984). If Congress wished to authorize a waiver for IRA appeals filed under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221, it plainly could have, and knew it could have included a waiver provision, as it did in fact do in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B) for other types of appeals to the Board. That it did not for IRA filings is therefore conclusive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Equitable Tolling</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reutershan also asserts that the doctrine of equitable tolling can and should be applied in this case. Neither the Board nor this court has yet determined whether equitable tolling applies in IRA appeals. <span class="Italic">See Montez</span>, 55 MSPR at 233. However, in the context of a lawsuit in district court, the Supreme Court has held that "the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants should also apply to suits against the United States. Congress, of course, may provide otherwise if it wishes to do so." <span class="Italic">Irwin v. VA</span>, 498 U.S. 89, 95-96 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Catawba Indian</span> <span class="Italic">Tribe of South Carolina v. United States</span>, 982 F.2d 1564, 1571 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 113 S. Ct. 2995 (1993) ("Even if there is no express tolling provision applicable, <span class="Italic">courts</span> may when circumstances require invoke the concept of tolling as an equitable matter." (emphasis added)). We need not decide whether equitable tolling is permissible in IRA appeals or any other appeals to the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the <span class="Italic">Irwin</span> Court emphasized, even where available, equitable tolling is extended only sparingly:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We have allowed equitable tolling in situations where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading <span class="Italic">during</span> <span class="Italic">the</span> <span class="Italic">statutory</span> <span class="Italic">period</span>, or where the complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass. We have generally been much less forgiving in receiving late filings where the claimant failed to exercise due diligence in preserving his legal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">498 U.S. at 96 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reutershan argues that equitable tolling should apply because he was reasonably misled by the OSC's August 19, 1993 letter to believe that the time limit for filing an appeal to the Board did not begin to run until OSC issued a further decision regarding whether it would reopen its investigation into his case. The Board did not abuse its discretion in concluding that equitable tolling would be inappropriate in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the July 23, 1993 letter which informed Reutershan that OSC terminated the investigation of his case stated, "You may file a request for corrective action with the Board within 65 days after the date of this letter." Reutershan was thus clearly informed that the time for filing began to run as of July 23, 1993. Second, the August 19, 1993 letter informed Reutershan that there is no formal appeals process within OSC. The letter says nothing to suggest that the time period for appealing to the Board <span id="Page_3780"></span>had been tolled. It did not amend the July 23 letter. Further, the August 19 letter did not tell him the OSC investigation was being reopened, but only that OSC would treat his letter as "a request for reconsideration of the decision of Office of Special Counsel to close the above-captioned file." A reasonable interpretation was that the file remained closed, pending further notice at an unspecified time. This conclusion is fortified by the further statement in the letter that he would later be notified of the OSC decision "whether the file should be reopened."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reutershan simply argues he was not informed that the 65 day period would <span class="Italic">not</span> be tolled. That is not enough. Furthermore, whether or not the letters were truly confusing about the applicable time limit for filing, Reutershan could easily have contacted OSC to clarify any uncertainty he had, making his case one of mere neglect and inappropriate for equitable tolling. Accordingly, we <span class="Italic">affirm.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stefanick v. Dept. of State,</span> DC-1221-14-0959-W-1 (NP 7/31/2015) ("[t]he appellant's difficulty in obtaining information from the agency pursuant to a FOIA request is not an extraordinary circumstance establishing grounds for equitable tolling of the time limit. S<span class="Italic">ee</span> <span class="Italic">Heimberger v. Department of Commerce</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 10 (2014)."); <span class="Italic">Carey v. VA</span>, DA-1221-13-0391-W-1 (NP 8/14/2014) ("We find that the appellant's unexplained assertion that her unspecified service-connected disability caused her to miss the filing deadline does not warrant the application of this extraordinary doctrine.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Greene v. MSPB,</span> 183 Fed. Appx. 943, 944-45 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), also declined to waive the time limit for a late appeal in an IRA case; although there was at least the suggestion of the possibility of equitable tolling, the suggestion did not make the transition to waiver:<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has correctly stated its law, namely that the 65-day time limit for filing of an IRA appeal to the Board cannot be waived. On that ground, there is no error in the Board's final judgment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the 65-day time limit were subject to equitable tolling under <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89 (1990), a matter that has not been decided by the Board and need not be decided in this appeal, the facts of this case would not qualify Ms. Greene for relief under the doctrine of equitable tolling. This is so because the Supreme Court has emphasized that equitable tolling is not available where the facts fail to show some effort by the appellant to meet the filing deadline (by, for example, filing a defective pleading, or seeking relief from the time limit before it expires, stating reasons for inability to meet the deadline), or some act by the appellant's adversary inducing or tricking the appellant into missing the deadline. No such allegations are made in this case. Consequently, even if equitable tolling were applicable to this case, on the facts, Ms. Greene would have no entitlement to file her appeal out of time.<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Swartz v. MSPB</span>, 319 Fed. Appx. 894, 896-97 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), did not outright reject the use of equitable tolling in an IRA case, but the doctrine, if applied, is applied in limited circumstances:<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we agree with the government that Swartz's untimely filing is not excused by equitable tolling. In <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 498 U.S. 89 (1990), the Supreme Court created a "rebuttable presumption" that equitable tolling applies in suits against the United States. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 95-96. However, the Court stated that equitable tolling has been allowed in cases in which the claimant has pursued his appeal but has "filed a defective pleading," or where the claimant "has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 96. Neither of those justifications for equitable tolling is evident in the present case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Swartz did not file a timely, yet defective, pleading, nor did he file a timely pleading in the wrong court. He did file suits in district court, but those suits, had they been filed at the Board, would still have been untimely. Thus, it cannot be said that Swartz filed a timely, yet defective, pleading in this case. <span class="Italic">Cf. Burnett v. N.Y. Cent. R.R. Co.</span>, 308 U.S. 424 (1965) (plaintiff timely filed complaint in wrong court).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Swartz also claims that OSC's failure to notify him of his appeal rights justifies invoking equitable tolling. Again, we disagree. Nothing in OSC's correspondence with Swartz can be construed as a misrepresentation, and there is no statutory requirement that OSC notify claimants of their appeal rights. Thus, OSC's failure to inform Swartz of his appeal rights after notification of the end of its investigation does not constitute the type of misconduct that would make equitable tolling appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Duran v. DOJ</span>, DE-1221-14-0010-W-1 (NP 5/6/2014) ("To the extent that the appellant alleges that her July 26, 2013 letter to OSC constituted a defective pleading within the statutory time period, we disagree. The appellant's July 26, 2013 letter was merely a response to OSC's July 10, 2013 preliminary determination letter and did not indicate her intention to file an IRA appeal or otherwise challenge OSC's July 24, 2013 close-out letter, which she had not yet received. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 43, &#x00B6; 18 n.5 (2012) (a defective pleading may be one that does not satisfy the criteria for the pleading, but that nevertheless manifests an intention to do so).").
