<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-20"><span class="space">f.</span> Allegation of Discrimination</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">For a short time the Board was required to adjudicate a discrimination claim even if it lacked jurisdiction over the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 906 F.2d 689 (Fed. Cir. 1990). The panel decision in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> was vacated; the Federal Circuit <span class="Italic">en banc</span> determined that the Board is not required to decide an EEO allegation unless there is an action within its appellate jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The Board observed in <span class="Italic">Price v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 107, 110 (1991), that it may still make an initial determination on a claim of prohibited discrimination if that claim is asserted as the sole basis of an involuntary action and Board jurisdiction. But if the Board lacks jurisdiction over an appellant's constructive adverse action appeal, it lacks jurisdiction to review an appellant's discrimination or reprisal claims pertaining to the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carlisle v. DOD</span>, 93 MSPR 280, 284 &#x00B6; 9 (2003) (declining to consider a claim of disability discrimination when the appellant's period of leave was voluntary). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-13-013.html#sec6-14">Jurisdictional Showing</a>" for consideration of <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, also discussed in <a href="0100-2023-19-001.html#sec12-1">Chapter 12</a>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vazquez v. MSPB</span>, 296 Fed. Appx. 20 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP), noted in its discussion of discrimination or similar claims in constructive adverse action appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has no jurisdiction to consider discrimination, perjury, procedural misconduct, whistleblowing or reprisal allegations unaccompanied by an appealable adverse action over which the Board has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1342-43; <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1245-46 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">see also, Mintzmyer v. Dep't. of Interior</span>, 84 F.3d 419, 423 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (a district court's finding that alleged discrimination did not result in a constructive discharge barred litigating whether an alleged reprisal for whistleblowing constituted constructive discharge). To the extent that Mr. Vazquez's references <span id="Page_1914"></span>to reprisal constitute an effort to prosecute an individual right of action appeal for whistleblowing reprisal, he has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, as the AJ pointed out.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vasquez</span> and the decisions it relied on addressed collateral claims of discrimination; it did not directly address the assertion that discrimination caused, and was not a byproduct of, an involuntary adverse action. <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1245-46 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (Judges Skelton and Newman dissenting), involved an employee who resigned after receiving and replying to a proposed removal but before a decision was made on the proposal. In the ensuing appeal Cruz raised, among other contentions, an allegation of Title VII reprisal, but, after hearing, the Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. On review, the court affirmed the Board's conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction. The court determined that the reprisal charge was invalid because the agency had ample basis for proposing the removal of Mr. Cruz. The court merged analysis of the reprisal claim with the analysis of the strength of the agency evidence supporting the removal proposal and concluded not that Cruz's claim failed on the merits--and should have been denied on that basis, with notice of further appeal rights to EEOC or to court--but that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal for want of sufficient evidence of involuntariness:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It must be remembered that the asserted act of reprisal here is the Navy's bringing of the charges. The sole issue here is the Board's jurisdiction, and that issue resolves into whether Cruz' resignation was voluntary or involuntary because obtained by coercion, deception or the like. All evidence of involuntariness must be considered, but the reprisal assertion, if the Board had independent jurisdiction over it, would be subsumed by the findings of no coercion, or deception, or other improper agency act. Though we obviously do not here decide whether reprisal may or may not have been among the motives of Cruz' supervisors, we cannot hold that the bringing of numerous, valid, serious and sustainable charges of conduct that destroys the efficiency of the service constitutes coercion to resign. To so hold would be contrary to precedent and to common sense.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Cruz' primary assertion in his appeal here is that the Board should have decided his reprisal claim and notified him of a right to appeal that decision to the EEOC or a district court because the agency's January 29, 1988 letter was in reprisal for filing his 1987 EEOC complaint. But that mere assertion does not provide a basis for Board jurisdiction in this voluntary resignation case. First, a petitioner's mere assertion cannot create jurisdiction. Second, as above indicated, bringing charges, for whatever reason, is not in itself an agency action appealable to the Board. Nor are discriminatory acts in themselves agency actions appealable to the Board. A statute, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 2302(b), makes reprisal a prohibited personnel practice, but that statute is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Wren v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor would a source of jurisdiction be created by accepting, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, Cruz' label for his reprisal assertion: "Title VII claim of discrimination." The Board has not been granted jurisdiction over Title VII claims<span class="Italic"> per se</span>, i.e., over "pure" or "naked" Title VII claims unaccompanied by an appealable action over which the Board does have jurisdiction. Cruz on this appeal attempts to convert his attempted appeal under Title 5, U.S.C. to a suit for discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. As above indicated, when discrimination is asserted in an appeal from a removal or other appealable adverse agency action over which the Board has jurisdiction, the case is a "mixed case" and the Board must decide the merits of the appealable action and whether it was a discriminatory act. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7702. In such cases, the Board routinely notifies appellants of a right to EEOC review. Where, as here, it has been found that there never was an appealable adverse agency action, the case is not a "mixed case," Sec. 7702 is not involved, and the Board correctly determined that it was without jurisdiction to consider Cruz' claim of procedural error or his reprisal assertion, or any other claim beyond the Board's jurisdiction. That holding and our affirmance break no new ground. <span class="Italic">See Manning v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 742 F.2d 1424 (Fed.

Ms. Mintzmyer retired, amended her EEO complaint, and appealed the retirement to the Board as constructively adverse. The court's discussion dealt with the application of collateral estoppel to some court litigation that the appellant pursued relating to her employment claims. Deciding that collateral estoppel was properly applied by the Board, the jurisdictional dismissal by the Board was affirmed by the court with almost no analysis of the allegations constructive adverse action appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1143912.html">437 F.3d 1322</a>, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (dissent by Judges Dyk and Newman), involving a demotion claimed by Ms. Garcia to be constructively adverse because the agency did not properly accommodate her disability in the job she held prior to the job she assumed through a geographical reassignment and downgrading. The court examined <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> and decisions postdating <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> that analyzed Board threshold jurisdictional requirements. The court reaffirmed the approach of <span class="Italic">Cruz,</span> but added clarification. The court recognized that evidence of discrimination may lend support to the question of whether an action was involuntary. If the evidence does not demonstrate involuntariness, the case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. If the evidence, including proof of discrimination or reprisal, demonstrates that the action was involuntary, the Board has jurisdiction over the constructive adverse action case and it has both the jurisdiction to decide claims under the EEO laws and the obligation to provide notice of further appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Furthermore, in mixed constructive adverse action cases, there are additional differences between the jurisdictional issues and the merits of the discrimination claim. As stated by the administrative judge in this case,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">evidence of discrimination goes to the ultimate question of coercion, i.e., whether under all of the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency, that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to request a reduction in grade. Once the Board's jurisdiction has been established in a constructive demotion appeal, issues of discrimination and reprisal may be adjudicated under the standards applicable for proof of discrimination and/or retaliation under Title VII as the case is then a mixed case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span>, slip op. at 3 (citing <span class="Italic">Markon v. Dep't of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 578 (1996)). Thus, in a mixed constructive adverse action case, jurisdiction is determined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 and the legal standards applicable to establishing involuntariness. Discrimination issues may be considered insofar as they illuminate involuntariness. In contrast, the merits of the discrimination claim are determined by the applicable anti-discrimination statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In these cases, undoubtedly, facts relevant to jurisdiction may also be relevant when deciding the merits. We fail to see, however, how this circumstance makes the current approach illogical. As a practical matter, there need not be any duplicative effort. If a fact determined for jurisdiction is later relevant for the merits determination, there is no reason why that previous finding cannot easily be applied to the merits determination. <span class="Italic">See also Markon</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 580 (noting that "if the appellant establishes that she has been constructively discharged, much of the same evidence of discrimination or retaliation relied upon to establish coercion may also be relevant to proof of discrimination and retaliation under Title VII and/or the WPA"). Importantly, as noted, in mixed cases the discrimination claim itself is adjudicated using the elements, burdens, and defenses specific to the underlying discrimination statute.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's views concerning the place of discrimination allegations in constructive adverse action appeals were summarized in <span class="Italic">Markon v. Dept. of State</span>, 71 MSPR 574, 578-80 (1996), cited in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, essentially permitting consideration of EEO allegations to show the involuntariness of an action, but not imposing upon constructive adverse action litigation the standards of proof governing Title VII hostile environment discrimination and reprisal cases. <span class="Italic">Markon</span>, an appeal from a constructive retirement, determined that the analysis is "whether under all of the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency, that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to" resign or retire:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]hen allegations of discrimination and reprisal are alleged in connection with a determination of voluntariness, it is well settled that such allegations may only be addressed insofar as they relate to the issue of voluntariness. That is, evidence of discrimination may be considered only in terms of the standard for voluntariness in a particular situation--not whether such evidence meets the test for proof of discrimination or reprisal established under Title VII. Thus, evidence of discrimination <span id="Page_1915"></span>or EEO retaliation goes to the ultimate question of coercion--whether under all of the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency, that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign [or retire]." ...<span class="Italic">Burke</span>, 53 MSPR at 438-39.

The court noted that 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b), involving prohibited personnel practices, including discrimination, "is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">See Cruz,</span> 934 F.2d at 1245 (citing <span class="Italic">Wren v.

Nor has the Board been granted jurisdiction over Title VII discrimination claims, "<span class="Italic">per se</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The court did not overrule <span class="Italic">Durden v. Department of the Navy,</span> 18 MSPR 373 (1983). That case involved an appellant who alleged that he was forced to retire on disability when the agency threatened him with removal for inability to perform. The EEOC had found that the appellant was discriminated against on the basis of handicap; the Board found that no arguable basis for discharge existed, that the appellant's retirement was involuntary, and that he had thus been constructively discharged. The Board gave the appellant mixed judicial review rights, noting that although it was not the usual mixed case where the issue of discrimination is raised in connection with an otherwise appealable action, discrimination must be analyzed in order to determine whether the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal<span class="Italic">. See Durden,</span> 18 MSPR at 374 &#x0026; n.1. Among other things, the court in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> distinguished <span class="Italic">Durden</span> because the Board had said "it was a narrow exception since handicap discrimination was the sole reason for the threatened discharge." <span class="Italic">See Cruz,</span> 934 F.2d at 1247. We note, however, that the Board has since overruled <span class="Italic">Durden</span> to the extent that it is incompatible with <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>; that is, to the extent that <span class="Italic">Durden</span> suggested that actions not within the Board's jurisdiction may nevertheless be treated as mixed cases for appeal rights purposes<span class="Italic">. See Price v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 50 MSPR 107, 110 (1991), involving an alleged involuntary retirement over which the Board declined jurisdiction. The Board opined, however, that under <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, it "may still make an initial determination on a claim of prohibited discrimination where, unlike here, that claim is asserted as the sole cause of an involuntary action." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Because <span class="Italic">Durden</span> involved a unique circumstance, we need not reach the issue of the narrow exception to <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>. However, our sequential analysis of the discrimination issue, that evidence of discrimination may be considered only for the purpose of determining jurisdiction and for Title VII purposes only if the Board has jurisdiction, might well dictate a different analysis in <span class="Italic">Durden,</span> if not a different result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has followed the <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> analysis in many cases involving an allegation of discrimination and/or reprisal in connection with jurisdiction over a constructive discharge and has found that allegations of discrimination and reprisal must initially be considered only as relevant to the test for coercion and, thus, as relevant to the question of the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Swift v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 61 MSPR 29, 32 (1994) ("where an employee's working conditions are rendered so intolerable by alleged discrimination or harassment that he is 'forced' into resignation, there has been a constructive discharge and the employee's resignation is involuntary...the ultimate question to be decided in this regard is whether working conditions were so difficult that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign.")

<p class="Block-Quote1">Once it is established that the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal because there has been a constructive discharge, issues of discrimination and reprisal may be adjudicated under the standards applicable for proof of discrimination and/or retaliation under Title VII as the case is then a mixed case. <span class="Italic">See Cartwright v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the fact that the agency in the instant case, while adjudicating the appellant's formal complaint of age discrimination, found that evidence of age discrimination supported a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of such discrimination, is, in-and-of-itself, not relevant to the appellant's burden of proof on the voluntariness issue. Rather, for the reasons described above, the administrative judge must consider any evidence of discrimination, retaliation for EEO activities, and retaliation for whistleblowing, in light of the coercion test for involuntariness. The administrative judge must consider any such evidence of discrimination and retaliation, together with all other evidence concerning incidents of harassment, or allegations of unfavorable treatment, or any other allegations regarding coercion. Only if a constructive discharge is established based upon consideration of all such evidence, need she reach the issue of discrimination and/or retaliation under Title VII or the Whistleblower Protection Act. Accordingly, we decline to overrule <span class="Italic">Burke</span> and other similar cases, as the appellant urges us to do.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, an appellant claims that the agency intentionally made working conditions so intolerable that he was driven to an involuntary resignation, the Board will determine whether, under all the circumstances, the agency made working conditions so difficult that a reasonable person in the appellant's position would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In making such a determination, evidence of discrimination or retaliation may only be considered insofar as it relates to the issue of voluntariness. <span class="Italic">Markon v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained in the initial decision, the appellant failed to establish by preponderant evidence that he was forced to resign because of intolerable working conditions. The appellant contends that his decision to resign was based on a series of retaliatory and harassing actions by the agency beginning in October 2003. The "last straw" appears to have been his receipt, on February 1, 2005, of the decision on his first-step grievance of his "unsatisfactory" performance rating for 2004. The appellant submitted his letter of resignation two days later on February 3, 2005. Although the appellant was clearly dissatisfied with his performance rating and the first-step official's decision on his grievance, we find no reason to disturb the administrative judge's explained finding that a reasonable person would not have felt compelled to resign under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 32 (2000) ("An employee is not guaranteed a working environment free of stress.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board lacks jurisdiction to review voluntary resignations. It may evaluate a resignation only if the employee can show that her resignation was actually involuntary. The employee must show that (1) the agency effectively imposed the terms of her resignation, (2) the employee had no realistic alternative, and (3) the resignation resulted from the agency's improper acts. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 437 F.3d 1322, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">see also Staats v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed.

The test for voluntariness is objective, under the totality of the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1329. Resignations are presumed voluntary, and the employee must overcome this presumption by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gruspe argues that the Board incorrectly weighed the evidence in deciding that her resignation was voluntary. She contends that the administrative judge failed to consider evidence of discrimination, and <span id="Page_1916"></span>"in no case considered whether the supervisors [sic] conduct exhibited toward Gruspe was similar in nature to conduct exhibited toward other employees." Additionally, Gruspe claims that the administrative judge failed to discuss the fact that she submitted an Equal Employment Opportunity report against Joe on January 7, 2004, which might have motivated Joe to retaliate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board may review "mixed case" claims of discrimination combined with improper separation, it must have jurisdiction over the non-discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1324-25.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board properly considered Gruspe's arguments in the context of her resignation. In her appeal to the Board, Gruspe did not present evidence of discrimination on the basis of race, national origin, or other protected categories. Rather, in her prehearing statement to the Board, she alleged discrimination in the way her supervisor, Joe, treated her as compared to her co-workers. Gruspe alleges, for example, that Joe "excessively monitored" her more than her colleagues. However, the administrative judge found no discriminatory treatment, crediting testimony from co-workers that they remembered no such excessive monitoring. Gruspe contends that the administrative judge did not consider her report of January 7, 2004. Although the administrative judge did not specifically discuss that report, he did consider the circumstances noted in the report, and discussed Gruspe's meetings with an Equal Employment Counselor and a February 19, 2004 mediation session with Gruspe, Joe, and the Counselor....</p>

In that decision, the Board found that the holdings in <span class="Italic">Dick</span> and <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span> that are described above could not be reconciled with the holding in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>; it noted that <span class="Italic">en banc</span> holdings were the controlling law of the Federal Circuit unless and until they were overruled by the court sitting <span class="Italic">en banc</span>; it noted further that <span class="Italic">Cruz</span> was an <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision, while <span class="Italic">Dick</span> and <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span> were not; and it concluded, therefore, that it was bound by the holding in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>. <span class="Italic">Lloyd</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. at 523-25; <span class="Italic">Bartels v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 280 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Lloyd</span> and <span class="Italic">Bartels</span>, we find that the appellant's claim that his retirement was involuntary--whether that claim constitutes a nonfrivolous claim of jurisdiction or not--is insufficient to confer on the Board jurisdiction to adjudicate the appellant's appeal. Because the appellant has not established by preponderant evidence that his retirement was in fact involuntary, he has not established that the Board has appellate jurisdiction over his separation; and, in the absence of such jurisdiction, the Board lacks the authority to determine whether the evidence of discrimination and reprisal that has been presented here is sufficient to prove that the agency discriminated against, or took reprisal against, the appellant in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. <span class="Italic">See Cruz</span>, 934 F.2d at 1248. The administrative judge's findings that the appellant failed to substantiate his claims of discrimination and reprisal are therefore VACATED.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The administrative judge did not err in considering evidence concerning those claims to the extent that the evidence related to the question of whether the appellant's separation was voluntary. <span class="Italic">See Markon v. Department of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 578 (1996) (when an appellant raises allegations of discrimination and reprisal in connection with a claim that the personnel action at issue in the appellant's appeal was involuntary, evidence concerning the allegations of discrimination and reprisal may be considered insofar as they relate to the issue of voluntariness).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant is found to have been constructively removed by reason of misleading advice concerning entitlement, or loss of entitlement, to retirement benefits, the Board adjudicates an associated disability discrimination claim, <span class="Italic">Aldridge v. USDA</span>, 111 MSPR 670, 680-81 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-23, 2009 MSPB 146 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an appellant raises allegations of discrimination in an appeal of an alleged involuntary retirement or resignation, the evidence on discrimination goes first to the question of whether the action was voluntary and thus whether there is Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Neice v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 211, &#x00B6; 8 (2007); <span class="Italic">Markon v. Department of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 578 (1996). Once it has been determined that the retirement or resignation was involuntary and the Board has jurisdiction in the appeal, the Board will adjudicate the discrimination on the merits under the substantive standards of antidiscrimination law. <span class="Italic">See Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1341; <span class="Italic">Neice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 211, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Markon,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. at 580.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial appeal, the appellant alleged disability discrimination, i.e., failure of the agency to accommodate her brain surgery and her allergies. In her prehearing submission on remand, the appellant also appeared to raise chronic depression and chronic fatigue as disabling conditions. <span class="Italic">See Nugent v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 444, 447-48 (1993) (an appellant may raise a claim or defense that was not included in the appeal at any time before the end of the conference held to define the issues in the case), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 36 F.3d 1107 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.24(b). The appellant did not present any evidence at the hearing regarding disability discrimination, and the AJ did not address it in the RID.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant has established that her retirement was involuntary, tantamount to a removal, and the Board thus has jurisdiction over her appeal, her disability discrimination claim must be addressed, even though she is entitled to reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Schibik v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 591, &#x00B6; 11 (2005); <span class="Italic">Totten v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 255, 257 (1995); <span class="Italic">Polite v. Department of the Navy</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 653, 657 (1991). Thus, this case must be remanded for a hearing on, and adjudication of, the appellant's allegation of disability discrimination.</p>
