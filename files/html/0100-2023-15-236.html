<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-235"><span class="space">c.</span> Pre-Employment Medical Inquiry</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Over the dissent of Chairman McPhie, <span class="Italic">Evans v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/EVANS_THOMAS_S_AT_0752_05_0844_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_DISSENT_303416.pdf">107 MSPR 484</a>, 485-93 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-23, 2007 MSPB 297 (2007), determined that an employee could not be fired for falsely responding to a pre-employment medical inquiry that violated EEOC guidance implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In February 2002, while applying for employment as a federal air marshal, the appellant completed a standard form 93 (SF-93), on which he was asked to list any "current medication" he was taking. The appellant listed only one medication, Prilosec. After filling out the form, he underwent a medical evaluation, including a drug test, and he later was offered and accepted appointment to a federal air marshal position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a condition of his employment, the appellant was subject to additional, random drug tests. On May 15, 2004, the agency administered such a test to the appellant and other employees. On the day of the test, or perhaps a day later, the appellant advised his immediate supervisor that he had been taking medication for a medical condition and that his drug test might indicate the presence of that medication. The appellant's supervisor was advised a few days later that the appellant in fact had tested positive for amphetamines; and the appellant subsequently disclosed that he had been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) during the 1990s, and had been taking Adderall, a drug containing amphetamines, for that condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency subsequently charged the appellant with making intentional and material false statements on his SF-93, a pre-employment form, when he failed to list Adderall as a drug he was currently taking. After considering oral and written responses to the proposal, it removed the appellant on that charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on petition for review, as he did below, that the agency violated regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) by asking him to list his medications before offering him a job and that his response to that request, even if false, cannot be used to discipline him. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d)(2) and (3), an employer "shall not conduct a medical examination or make inquiries of a job applicant as to whether such applicant is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of such disability" unless the employer has made an offer of employment to the applicant. The offer of employment may be conditioned on the results of a medical examination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d)(3). A medical examination or inquiry that falls within the scope of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12212(d) and that precedes any offer of employment, however, violates 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a), (d)(1). The EEOC has promulgated regulations implementing these statutory provisions. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.13, 1630.14. It also has issued guidance on this subject. <span class="Italic">See</span> Enforcement Guidance: Preemployment Disability-Related Questions and Medical Examinations, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Oct. 10, 1995) ("1995 Guidance"); EEOC Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities, EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (Mar. 25, 1997) ("1997 Guidance"); Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), EEOC Notice No. 915.002 (July 27, 2000) ("2000 Guidance").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency does not allege, and the record does not show, that the agency extended any job offer--conditional or otherwise--to the appellant before he completed the SF-93. The administrative judge found, however, that the appellant had failed to present a persuasive argument that the agency had discriminated against him on the basis of disability. He referred to the appellant's reliance on the EEOC's 1995 guidance; he found that the guidance appeared to be inconsistent; he found further that it did not provide that a pre-job-offer inquiry about medications constituted discrimination <span class="Italic">per se</span>; and he stated that the guidance was "just a notice, not a law, rule or regulation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have indicated above, disability-related inquiries are the subject not only of EEOC enforcement guidance, but also of statutory and regulatory provisions. Moreover, the Board defers to the EEOC with respect to issues of substantive discrimination law. <span class="Italic">Morales v. Department of Justice,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 482, 484 (1998). Dismissing EEOC guidelines interpreting discrimination law as "just a notice" therefore is inappropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its guidance, the EEOC has emphasized that the inquiries that may be made prior to a job offer are more limited than those that may be made at later stages of hiring and employment. 2000 Guidance, General Principles, &#x00A7; B. It has explained further that, before the restrictions were imposed, information about applicants' physical or mental conditions "was often used to exclude applicants with disabilities before their ability to perform the job was even evaluated"; that applicants who were rejected after being asked about their medical conditions did not necessarily know whether they were "rejected because of disability, or because of insufficient skills or experience or a bad report from a reference"; and that Congress acted to remedy this problem by "establish[ing] a process...to isolate an employer's consideration of an applicant's non-medical qualifications from any consideration of the applicant's medical condition." 1995 Guidance, Background. With this purpose in mind, the EEOC has advised employers, in the 1995 guidance to which the administrative judge referred in his initial decision, that they may not, prior to making a job offer, ask questions that are likely to elicit information about a disability. 1995 Guidance, The Pre-Offer Stage, What is a Disability-Related Question? This guidance is consistent both with <span id="Page_2763"></span>the legislative purposes described above and with the language of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d) and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.13, 1630.14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have noted above that the administrative judge characterized the EEOC's 1995 guidance as apparently inconsistent. Specifically, he stated that the guidance indicated that questions likely to elicit information about a disability were impermissible, that the same guidance indicated earlier that a question was "not disability-related" if there were "many possible answers...and only some of those answers would contain disability-related information"; and that "asking what medications someone is currently taking can lead to answers that both identify and do not identify a disability. He then noted that the appellant responded to the part of the SF-93 at issue here by stating that he took Prilosec, and he stated that "that answer did not identify a disability."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no basis for finding that the guidelines are inconsistent in any respect material to this case. When read as a whole, they clearly instruct employers that a question may be disability-related, and therefore not permitted at the pre-offer stage, even if it is possible for an applicant to provide an answer to the question that is not disability-related. The sentence immediately preceding the "many possible answers" statement on which the administrative judge relied, for example, states that the prohibition on "questions that are likely to elicit information about a disability...means that an employer cannot ask questions that are closely related to a disability." 1995 Guidance, The Pre-Offer Stage, What is a Disability-Related Question? More important, the questions and answers that immediately follow the sentence to which the administrative judge referred leave no doubt that requests that applicants list all their "current medications" are not permitted at the pre-offer stage. Specifically, the guidelines provide that "questions like, 'What medications are you currently taking?'...certainly elicit information about whether an applicant has a disability." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The EEOC's 1997 guidelines provide further support for the proposition that, to the extent an employer's request for information about medications used includes psychiatric medications (such as the medication the appellant in this case was charged with failing to disclose), the request may not be made prior to a job offer. Those guidelines provide that "[q]uestions on job applications about psychiatric disability or mental or emotional illness or about treatment are likely to elicit information about a psychiatric disability and therefore are prohibited before an offer of employment is made." 1997 Guidance, Disclosure of Disability, &#x00A7; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that requests that applicants disclose their medications has been found, in court and by the EEOC, to violate statutory and regulatory prohibitions on disability discrimination when those requests are made prior to a job offer meeting the requirements of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(d) and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14. <span class="Italic">See Leonel v. American Airlines, Inc.,</span> 400 F.3d 702, 705-08 (9th Cir. 2005) (the employer violated the ADA by requiring applicants to list all medications they were taking, and by subjecting them to medical examination, before making a "real" job offer, i.e., an offer not subject to nonmedical conditions); <span class="Italic">Serpa v. Potter,</span> Appeal No. 01993715, 2002 WL 1999167, (EEOC Aug. 21, 2002) (the employer violated the statutory prohibition on disability discrimination when it asked him, prior to a job offer, to list his prescription medications).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found in his initial decision that "business necessity" justified the agency's medical inquiry. He noted that the position for which the appellant applied had medical qualification requirements, and he found that requiring the agency to postpone its medical inquiry until after it had made an offer of employment would be unreasonable and burdensome, would waste time, and would "slow the process." Although 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(d) provides a "business necessity" exception to certain limits on disability-related inquiries, that exception does not apply at the pre-job-offer stage. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4)(A) (describing "business necessity" consideration as applicable to "employee[s]"); <span class="Italic">Dereyna v. Danzig,</span> Appeal No. 01980077, 2001 WL 65201, (EEOC Jan. 19, 2001) ("[i]t is clear that an employer may only ask disability-related questions that are consistent with business necessity after conditional offer of employment has been extended."); 2000 Guidance, Job-Related and Consistent with Business Necessity, &#x00A7; A5 (describing "business necessity" requirement as applicable to employees).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, in connection with the finding mentioned above, that the administrative judge's reasoning could be considered relevant to the issue of whether a job offer was "real," i.e., sufficient to permit the agency to make a disability-related inquiry even if the agency had not yet obtained and evaluated all nonmedical information relevant to a final hiring decision. The EEOC has stated in its 1995 guidance that a "job offer is real if the employer has evaluated all relevant non-medical information <span class="Italic">which it reasonably could have obtained and analyzed prior to giving the offer."</span> <span class="Italic">See</span> 1995 Guidance, The Post-Offer Stage (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also Downs v. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority,</span> 13 F. Supp.2d 130, 137-38 (D. Mass. 1998) (citing guidance);<span class="Italic"> Hoskins v. Chertoff,</span> Appeal No. 0120042087, 2007 WL 556795, (EEOC Feb. 15, 2007). As we have noted above, however, the agency in this case does not argue that it had made any job offer to the appellant at the time it asked him to complete and submit the SF-93. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hoskins,</span> (finding that the case must be remanded for consideration of the agency's implied claim that it had extended a job offer prior to the inquiry at issue). Moreover, even if it had made such an argument, we do not believe that a need to avoid wasting time and "slow[ing] the process" would be sufficient to show that the agency could not reasonably have obtained and analyzed all relevant nonmedical information before making its medical inquiry. Arguments regarding the need to speed up the hiring process and avoid wasting time have been found insufficient under such circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Leonel,</span> 400 F.3d at 710; <span class="Italic">see also Kelly v. Evans,</span> Appeal No. 01A30554, 2004 WL 1144659, (EEOC May 11, 2004) (violation found despite evidence that pre-offer inquiry was made "in an effort to speed up the hiring process").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we find that the agency in this case violated 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(d) and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.13(a) when it asked the appellant to disclose the medications he was taking prior to extending a job offer to him.[3] This violation constitutes discrimination based on disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We see no need to determine whether the appellant is a "qualified individual with a disability," as that term is defined for ADA purposes. As the EEOC indicated in its 2000 guidelines, some courts have held that an individual must show that he meets this definition in order to bring a claim alleging a violation of prohibitions on disability-related inquiries. 2000 Guidelines, General Principles, Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees n.15. Other courts, however, have held that there is no such requirement. <span class="Italic">See id. and cases cited therein;</span> <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. City of New Albany</span>, 293 F.3d 998, 2007 (7th Cir. 2002) (citing eighth, ninth, and tenth circuit cases). After considering both of these views, the EEOC has taken the "position that the plain language of the [ADA] explicitly protects individuals with and without disabilities from improper disability-related inquiries and medical examinations." 2000 Guidelines, General Principles, Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees n.15. We defer to this interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Morales</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 484.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Effect of Part 1630 Violation</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In<span class="Italic"> Downs,</span> 13 F. Supp.2d at 140-41, a federal district court in Massachusetts held that an employee's falsified answers to inquiries prohibited under part 1630 could not serve as a basis for subsequently removing the employee. That court reasoned that an employer "ought not be able to base adverse employment decisions on...answers...to which it was not entitled in the first place" and that the employee's false responses "were triggered by [the employer's] own improper actions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 140. It also rejected the argument that the employee could have answered honestly and then challenged any adverse decision that resulted from the answer. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 141. In rejecting that argument, the court stated that, with many stages of the hiring process remaining at the time of the inquiry, "it would have been difficult to attack a negative decision as having been based on the medical questions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Downs</span> court also indicated that its holding was consistent with the reasoning in other decisions, including<span class="Italic"> Kraft v. Police Commissioner of Boston,</span> 410 Mass. 155, 157, 571 N.E.2d 380 (1991), and <span class="Italic">Huisenga v. Opus Corp.,</span> 494 N.W.2d 469, 473-74 (Minn. 1992). <span class="Italic">Downs,</span> 13 F. Supp.2d at 140-41. In <span class="Italic">Kraft,</span> the court overturned the removal of a police officer for providing false answers to questions seeking information about prior hospitalizations, and in <span class="Italic">Huisenga,</span> the court held that an employer could not avoid its workers' compensation obligations by relying on an employee's false answers to impermissible questions about past injuries and workers' compensation complaints. <span class="Italic">Huisenga,</span> 494 N.W.2d at 473-74; <span class="Italic">Kraft,</span> 410 Mass. at 157; <span class="Italic">see Downs,</span> 13 F. Supp.2d at 140.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that in <span class="Italic">Leonel,</span> 400 F.3d 702, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit addressed a somewhat similar issue, i.e., the issue of whether an employer could refuse to hire applicants based on their false responses to inquiries about their medical conditions, when the inquiries were made before the employer had extended job offers meeting the requirements of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d) and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.13 and 1630.14. The court held that the employer was not entitled to "penalize" the employees in this manner and that the existence of a dispute about facts material to the propriety of the inquiry precluded summary dismissal of the applicants' claims against the employer. <span class="Italic">Leonel,</span> 400 F.3d at 709-11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Holdings of the courts that issued the decisions cited above do not constitute precedent binding on the Board. <span class="Italic">See Fairall v. Veterans Administration,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 39 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987). We find them persuasive, however. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Not only do they specifically address matters the same as or very similar to those at issue here, but the reasoning in the decisions is consistent with the purpose of the part 1630 provisions the agency here violated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The stigmas associated with various medical conditions--especially mental or brain-function issues, such as those present here--are a matter of common knowledge. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.64 (the Board may take official notice of matters of common knowledge). As the<span class="Italic"> Downs</span> court indicated, preemployment inquiries such as those conducted by the <span id="Page_2764"></span>agency in this case not only violate the ADA and 29 C.F.R. part 1630, but they also "set up a situation that is likely to 'trap' a disabled applicant into making false statements that a non-disabled applicant has no incentive to make." <span class="Italic">Downs,</span> 13 F. Supp.2d at 140-41. Moreover, the EEOC guidelines cited above recognize that, in the absence of the ADA's restrictions on preemployment inquiries, applicants who are rejected after disclosing medical conditions may not be able either to determine the extent to which the rejections were based on their conditions or to prove that those actions constituted improper discrimination. ADA violations such as those at issue in this case therefore frustrate Congress's intent in enacting the ADA by undermining the enforceability of that act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court decisions on which the dissent relies do not require a different result. Neither <span class="Italic">LaChance v. Erickson,</span> 522 U.S. 262, 265-68 (1998), nor <span class="Italic">Bryson v. United States</span>, 396 U.S. 64, 65-66 (1969), involve the ADA or otherwise address an issue concerning disability discrimination. Indeed, <span class="Italic">Bryson,</span> on which <span class="Italic">Erickson</span> was predicated, was decided long before the ADA was enacted into law. To permit the general principles of these cases to negate the specific statutory mandates and prohibitions of the ADA would effectively thwart the important policies underlying the ADA that Congress sought to promote. <span class="Italic">See</span> H. Rep. No. 101-485(II) at 22-23 (1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 304 ("The purpose of the ADA is to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate to end discrimination against individuals with disabilities...."); <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Steeltek, Inc.,</span> 160 F.3d 591, 594 (10th Cir. 1998) (The legislative history of the ADA indicates that Congress wished to curtail all questioning that would serve to identify and exclude persons with disabilities from consideration for employment by drafting "a prohibition on pre-offer medical examinations or inquiries[.] ").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we hold that an agency's question, prohibited to the extent that it would elicit disability-related information from the applicant on a pre-offer-of-employment form, cannot form the basis of a charge of falsification. For that reason, the agency could not establish a charge of falsification here.[4] Thus, we find that the agency charge cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, whose holdings are binding on us, <span class="Italic">see Fairall,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. at 39, does not appear to have addressed this issue; and the EEOC also does not appear to have issued any decisions addressing whether an agency question violating 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d), 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.13, and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14 can ever form the basis of a charge of falsification.</p>

Even if vertigo is not always a disqualifying medical condition, the agency's ability to properly evaluate an applicant's fitness based on accurate information about the applicant's physical and medical condition certainly impacts the efficiency of the service."</p>
