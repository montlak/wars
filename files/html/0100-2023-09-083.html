<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-82"><span class="space">g.</span> Constructive Adverse Action; Notice if Agency Learns of Employee's Protest</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The usual adverse action, such as removal or suspension, is accompanied by a notice of Board appeal rights. An action that is normally considered voluntary, e.g., resignation or retirement, does not ordinarily produce a notice of appeal rights, although the employee may appeal that action if it is involuntary, i.e., if it is a constructive adverse action [discussed in Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-012.html#sec6-13">Constructive Adverse Action</a>"] . Frequently, the timing of an appeal becomes an issue in the appeal of a constructive adverse action because the appeal is lodged after the 30 days allowed from the action's effective date. The question becomes what circumstances will excuse a delayed appeal. The answer is complicated; the law is unclear. The easiest case occurs when the agency learns from the employee that the employee considers the action adverse. Then the agency should then issue a notice of appeal rights, including the time for initiating the appeal. Easy cases are easy. More complex analysis is required when the employee resigns or retires, with no knowledge by the agency that something is amiss--and later appeals a constructive removal--months, sometimes years, after separation. [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-022.html#sec6-23">Involuntary Downgrading</a>," for timing of appeals from constructive downgrades involving reassignments and subsequent upward reclassification of positions.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"There may be good cause for an untimely filing of an appeal of an involuntary action, such as a demotion, if the agency had a duty--but neglected--to inform the appellant of his appeal rights because, at the time of the employee's decision to request and/or accept the action, the agency knew or should have known that the appellant considered the action to be involuntary." <span class="Italic">Valdez v. Dept. of Army</span>, 52 MSPR 432, 434 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Archerda v. DOD</span>, SF-4324-12-0055-B-1 (NP 3/31/2014) ("Where an employee places the agency on notice that he considers an action to be involuntary, and the agency fails to provide the required notice of appeal rights, the failure to do so constitutes good cause for a late filing of a petition for appeal. <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 65, 68 (1995)."); <span class="Italic">Harper v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 632, 637 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2001) (employer was on notice of the involuntary nature of the resignation when the employee stated on her resignation form that she was resigning because of a PTSD resulting from an inadequate agency response to the discovery of a loaded semiautomatic weapon in the work unit that included the appellant's disgruntled subordinate).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a nonprobationary employee requests an action (e.g., resignation or downgrading) appearing to be voluntary, but the government knew or should have known that the employee considered the action to be involuntary, then the government need not acquiesce in the employee's view, but must at least inform him or her of the administrative rights attaching to an involuntary action. Without that advice, delay in an appeal will be excused. <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. VA</span>, 3 MSPR 137, 139, 3 MSPB 246 (1980); <span class="Italic">Chiarelli v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 2 MSPR 554, 555-56, 3 MSPB 75 (1980) (citing <span class="Italic">McCormack v. United States</span>, 204 Ct. Cl. 371 (1974): "We hold that upon learning that appellant considered her request for a downgrade to be involuntary, the agency should have informed her that involuntary reductions in grade are appealable and that there is a limited time in which to exercise that right."). Once the agency is on notice of the employee's claim of a coerced resignation--for example, the day after the employee submitted a resignation, he contacted a manager in an attempt to rescind it, claiming that it was submitted under duress while he was intoxicated and emotionally upset--the agency has the obligation to provide the appellant with notice of his appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Michaels v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 205, 208 (1990). Apparently, the notice of appeal rights may be by oral advice from an agency official to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dameron v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 16 MSPR 370, 371 (1983) (alleged involuntary resignation). [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-012.html#sec6-13">Constructive Adverse Action</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once an agency knows that an employee challenges an action as adverse, e.g., a resignation, the agency may be charged with providing notice of appeal rights.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Generally, an appellant may establish good cause for an untimely filing of an involuntary resignation or retirement appeal if, at the time of the employee's resignation or retirement, the agency knew or should have known of facts indicating that the action was involuntary but did not inform the appellant of her appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Shelton v. Department of the Army</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 126, &#x00B6; 7 (2005).

<p class="Body-Text">The agency's failure to provide proper notice of appeal rights need not be in bad faith to justify an extension of the period for appeal. If the agency believes that the downgrading of an employee is appealable through OPM and not through RIF procedures to MSPB, the employee is still misled, regardless of the intent of the agency, if his appeal truly lies with the Board and if he receives no notice of that appeal right from the agency. <span class="Italic">Yuni v. MSPB</span>, 784 F.2d 381 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Under <span class="Italic">Yuni</span>, if the employee informed the agency that he believes his case to be appealable--a situation that may arise with a resignation or seemingly voluntary downgrading--it became the agency's responsibility to inform him of appeal rights. The court quoted <span class="Italic">McCormack v. United States</span>, 204 Ct. Cl. 371, 380 (1974):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have said that the Government is not clairvoyant and may not be required to read the plaintiff's mind. However, the Government cannot, after receiving a letter wherein the state of the plaintiff's mind is made abundantly clear, do nothing to inform the plaintiff of the proper appeal procedures and then defend on the grounds of plaintiff's failure to make a timely appeal....&#8197;After the plaintiff made it sufficiently clear to the Government that he deemed his resignation to be other than voluntary, the Government was required to state in detail the various procedures available to the plaintiff to contest the allegedly adverse action and the remedies available. The Government cannot claim to be in the dark when the plaintiff's letters constitute something less than a legal brief to the point. So long as the Government is on notice that plaintiff views himself the subject of an adverse action the Government can no longer claim surprise with respect to an allegation of involuntariness.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition, the appellant contends that the administrative judge erred in finding that she "retroactively" attached the memorandum to her SF-52 stating that she was "compelled to leave this position" because she attached the memo to the SF-52 before it went forward. She asserts that her memo was effective notice to the agency that she believed that her retirement was involuntary and that the alleged involuntariness of her retirement was an issue in her EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, an appellant may establish good cause for an untimely filing of an involuntary resignation or retirement appeal if, at the time of the employee's resignation or retirement, the agency knew or should have known of facts indicating that the action was involuntary but did not inform the appellant of his appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ragland v. Department of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 58 &#x00B6; 5 (1999); <span class="Italic">see also Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 669 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (an agency's failure to notify an employee of his appeal rights under circumstances requiring it to do so will generally justify a waiver of the filing deadline). An appellant who should have been advised of his appeal rights, but was not, is not required to show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights; rather, the question is whether the appellant was diligent in filing an appeal after he learned he could do so. <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 583, 588 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record does not show when the appellant's memorandum stating that she was compelled to leave the position because of a perverse work environment was associated with her SF-52. If, as the appellant asserts, it traveled with the SF-52 from December 5, 1997, the date it was written, until the date that the agency effected her retirement, agency officials who processed the appellant's retirement were on notice that the appellant considered her retirement involuntary. Under such circumstances, the fact that the appellant's supervisor did not see the memorandum until months after the appellant retired is immaterial to whether the agency should have afforded the appellant Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The basis of the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's memorandum did not obligate the agency to notify her of her Board appeal rights appears to be that the agency was not so obligated either because the appellant attached the memorandum to the SF-52 "retroactively" or because her supervisor did not see it until months after the appellant retired. Nothing in the record contradicts the appellant's assertion that her memorandum was attached to the SF-52 on the date that she wrote it, December 5, 1997. Further, <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 111 F.3d 118 (Fed. Cir. 1997), which the administrative judge cites in the initial decision, apparently to support the finding that notification to the appellant's supervisor that the appellant believed her retirement was involuntary was necessary to trigger the agency's obligation to provide the appellant with notice of her appeal rights to the Board, is distinguishable from this case. In <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span>, the court found that an employee made a nonfrivolous allegation that he notified the agency that he believed that his retirement was involuntary by his assertion that he told his supervisor of his belief before he retired. However, in <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span>, there is no indication that a written memorandum accompanied the employee's SF-52 in addition to his statement to his supervisor. Thus, <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span> stands for the proposition that an employee may notify the agency that he believes that his retirement is involuntary by informing his supervisor of his belief but not that he must inform his supervisor in order to obligate the agency to give the employee notice of his Board appeal rights. The court's holding in <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span> would not preclude a finding that the appellant's memorandum constituted an effective means to obligate the agency to give her notice of Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, contrary to the administrative judge's finding, the record does not show that the appellant was aware of her Board appeal rights years before she filed her appeal. The administrative judge appears to find that the appellant knew or should have known of her Board appeal rights because the position from which she retired obliged her to give advice on employee appeals, she was asked during the course of the processing of her EEO complaint whether she had filed a Board appeal, and she was represented by counsel during the early months of the processing of her EEO complaint. However, none of these circumstances was sufficient to put the appellant on notice of Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing contradicts the appellant's assertion that, despite her position description, she did not advise employees about the Board appellate process. Thus, the appellant's position description does not establish that she knew before she retired that involuntary retirements could be appealed to the Board, nor that she knew when, where, and how she could appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notice from a source other than the agency of a general appeal right to the Board does not excuse an agency's failure to inform an employee of his appeal rights where the notice does not inform the employee of the time limit for filing an appeal to the Board and lacks other information on where and how to file such an appeal. <span class="Italic">Gingrich</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 588. Arguably, reference to Board appeal procedures during the processing of the appellant's EEO complaint could be viewed as coming from the agency because the EEO complaint process remained within the agency through the date of the final agency decision. The notice of a possible appeal right to the Board that the appellant received during the processing of her EEO complaint stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You may pursue a discrimination complaint under the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) appeal procedure. This procedure is available to you only if the alleged discriminatory action can be appealed to the MSPB.... If you are subject to a personnel action that is appealable to the MSPB, you will be notified in writing of your right to appeal to the MSPB. The time limit to appeal to the MSPB is <span class="Italic">30 calendar days</span> after the effective date of the personnel action which you believe discriminated against you.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This notice, however, was insufficient as notice of Board appeal rights because it lacked information on where and how to file a Board appeal. In addition, the notice specifically advised the appellant that she would be notified in writing if she was subject to a personnel action appealable to the Board, but the record does not indicate that the agency provided such notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, one cannot infer that the appellant should have known of her Board appeal rights through the attorney who represented her in the early months of the processing of her EEO complaint. There is no evidence that the attorney actually informed the appellant regarding the possibility of filing a Board appeal. Moreover, there is no indication that the attorney discussed Board appeal rights with the appellant. The appellant's attorney reasonably could have believed that such discussion was unnecessary because the appellant had filed a mixed case EEO complaint (a complaint that alleges discrimination in a matter appealable to the Board) and would receive appropriate Board appeal rights later in the EEO process when the agency issued a FAD. The appellant's attorney represented her at the time that she contacted an EEO counselor. The EEO counselor summarized the appellant's complaint as including an allegation that the agency was forcing her to retire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also indicated that this attorney represented her at the time that she filed her formal EEO complaint. Although the appellant did not use the words involuntary retirement in her complaint, she alleged actions by the agency that were misleading and thus could have resulted in an involuntary action. <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1574&#8209;75 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (a retirement action is involuntary if the agency made misleading statements upon which the employee reasonably relied to his detriment). In her complaint, she alleged that the announcement for a GS-12 Labor Relations Specialist position "came out" at the time that her VSIP was approved and that she did not see it until after she had accepted the VSIP. This, coupled with the appellant's statement to her EEO counselor that she was forced out of her GS-11 position so that someone else could be brought in as a GS-12, appears to constitute an allegation that she retired because the agency misled her into believing that no GS-12 position would ever be available to her and that, based on this misleading information, she had irrevocably committed to a retirement date before the issuance of the vacancy announcement. Given the appellant's allegations, her representative reasonably could have believed that she would receive mixed case appeal rights in the agency's FAD. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(d)(3) (at the time that the agency issues its FAD on a mixed case complaint, the agency shall advise the complainant of the right to appeal the matter to the MSPB (not EEOC)); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(c)(ii) (where an agency questions the Board's jurisdiction of the matter, it must hold the mixed case complaint in abeyance until the Board's administrative judge rules on the jurisdictional issue, notify the complainant that it is doing so, and instruct her to bring the discrimination issue to the attention of the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under all of these circumstances, we find that the timeliness issue in this case is inextricably intertwined with the jurisdictional issue. The appellant was not informed of and apparently was unaware of her Board appeal rights as she diligently pursued her allegations that the agency forced or misled her into retirement. The appellant was involved continually in the processing of her EEO complaint from the effective date of her retirement until February 2003, and, after she received a decision on her EEO complaint, she sought the assistance of OSC. Within weeks of the date on which OSC dismissed the appellant's complaint, she filed this appeal. A finding of Board jurisdiction, either because the appellant established that agency actions created intolerable working conditions that compelled her to leave her position or that the agency misled her into leaving her position, would most likely result in a finding that the agency knew or should have known of facts indicating that the action was involuntary, which in turn would establish good cause for the filing delay. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Lomax v. Department of Defense,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 553, 561 (1998). Under such circumstances, the administrative judge should address the <span id="Page_976"></span>Board's jurisdiction over this appeal before he addresses its timeliness. <span class="Italic">See Romine v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 68, 72 (1994) (where timeliness and jurisdiction are "inextricably intertwined," an appeal cannot be disposed of on timeliness grounds without addressing jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Five months of arguable delay in the filing of an appeal from a constructively adverse grade reduction was excused, partly because of ambiguous information from the agency about appeal rights, <span class="Italic">O'Farrell v. DOD</span>, DE-0752-12-0443-I-1 (NP 4/1/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we acknowledge that the appellant is an attorney, there is no indication that he is knowledgeable about federal employment law. Where, as here, the agency is obligated to provide an employee with Board appeal rights and does not do so, an appellant need only show that he acted diligently in pursuing his appeal rights once he discovered them. <span class="Italic">Powell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 580, &#x00B6; 11 (2010). The earliest time at which it can be argued that the appellant knew he had appeal rights is February 24, 2012, when he received a copy of the <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> decision. Therefore, his appeal was at most 5 months late, not 27 months. Finally, he need not demonstrate any circumstances beyond his control, but only that he acted diligently in pursuing his appeal rights once he knew of them. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did attempt to find out if his situation was covered by <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, but was told that his supervisors, also attorneys, were awaiting "Departmental guidance." One supervisor even advised the appellant that the agency's efforts to "have [his] situation remedied" would not affect his right to file an "<span class="Italic">Arrington</span> type suit" if he was dissatisfied with the agency's efforts because "the decision reasoned that an employee didn't have actual notice until a 50 was issued with the appropriate appeal language. That hasn't happened yet, and won't happen until a new 50 is issued...."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee claims that the agency should have notified him of appeal rights because of the agency's notice that the employee considered a retirement or resignation to be involuntary, it is the employee's burden to show when and how the agency was notified of his protest to the personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Persons v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 428, 432-33 (1997). An agency may not know that an employee considers an action to be involuntary when the employee signed a statement that she "willingly" made the choice to resign, that she was not subject to any pressure, and that she understood that her decision to resign was irrevocable. The Board then considers the length of delay in filing an appeal and how and when the employee first learned of the right to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 28, 32 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the law just discussed, and the law discussed below, seems quite clear that an employee's time for filing an appeal in a constructive adverse action runs from the time an agency learns of the employee's protest of the action and then advises the employee of her appeal rights, there is one decision, <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. MSPB</span>, 111 F.3d 118, 120 (Fed. Cir. 1997), that seemed to reach the baffling conclusion that the timing of an agency's knowledge of the employee's protest of an action is immaterial if the appeal period has already run from the date of the allegedly constructive or involuntary adverse action. In <span class="Italic">Carpenter</span>, the appellants retired as a result of the postal reorganization and, two years later, appealed the retirements as involuntary. The appellants maintained that during unemployment compensation hearings, they placed postal representatives on notice that they regarded their retirements as involuntary and that the Postal Service should then have advised them of their right to appeal to the Board. The Board rejected the appellants' contention, as then did the court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he petitioners focus on the unemployment hearings, at which the Postal Service was represented. The petitioners concede, however, that the unemployment hearings all took place more than 20 days after their retirements. By that time, each petitioner's right to appeal from his retirement had already expired....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the petitioners' appeals were already out-of-time, the Postal Service's failure to advise the petitioners of their appeal rights following the unemployment hearings...did not cause the petitioners to file their appeals late. Thus, even if statements made by or on behalf of the petitioners at the unemployment hearings...were sufficient to constitute assertions that their retirements were involuntary, we hold that the Board did not abuse its discretion in ruling that those statements failed to establish good cause for the petitioners' delay in filing their appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 989 F.2d at 1170.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Carpenter</span> notwithstanding, the responsibility of the agency to provide notice occurs when it learns that an employee considers an otherwise voluntary action to be involuntary. There is no presumption, however, that every resignation, retirement, or voluntary downgrading is coerced and necessitates notice of appeal rights. The agency is not required to provide adverse action rights because an employee might prefer not to accept a downgrading in lieu of a more severe adverse action, <span class="Italic">Gaudette v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 832 F.2d 1256, 1258-59 (Fed. Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]n employee [need not] be counseled with respect to appeal rights on involuntary demotions in situations where the agency offers the employee the choice of a voluntary downgrade which, if accepted, would avert a possible removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That the employee would prefer to stay in the position from which he or she faces possible removal and dislikes taking a pay cut does not make their decision to accept the offer of a lower-grade position legally involuntary. Thus, those facts do not give rise to the duty of notice which the employees here seek to impose on the agency. Further it defies logic to say that a voluntary action by an employee is somehow made involuntary because of an agency's failure to advise of appeal rights or to counsel the employee on what constitutes involuntariness in a legal sense.</p>
