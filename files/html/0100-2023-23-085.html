<p class="Body-Text">December 22, 1987, amendments to the Back Pay Act provide for interest on back pay awards, with exceptions. The amendment is at &#x00A7; 623 of Pub. L. 100-202. The short version of the amendment is at 5 USC 5596(b)(2):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)(A)&#x2003;An amount payable under paragraph (1)(A)(i) of this subsection shall be payable with interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;Such interest--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;shall be computed for the period beginning on the effective date of the withdrawal or reduction involved and ending on a date not more than 30 days before the date on which payment is made;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;shall be computed at the rate or rates in effect under section 6621(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 during the period described in clause (i); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(iii)&#x2003;shall be compounded daily.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statutory authorization for interest applies only to a final decision issued on or after December 22, 1987. <span class="Italic">Lavelle v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 531, 532 (1990); <span class="Italic">Kopp v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 434, 438 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4880"></span>The computation of interest is normally based on adjusted back pay after required deductions for taxes and retirement have been made. <span class="Italic">Rivera-Silva v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 426, 429 &#x00B6; 9 (1999). Interest on back pay is applicable to monetary awards, but not to leave or other benefits. <span class="Italic">Rivas v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 584, 586 (1997); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Bullock v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 361, 373 n.11 (1998) (although no interest was payable for annual leave recredited upon restoration, "[b]ecause the appellant would have been paid for his sick leave as he used it during this period [of incapacitation], it was proper for the agency to pay interest on this amount").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the Back Pay Act, interest is paid at the overpayment rate in the Internal Revenue Code, 26 USC 6621(a)(1). <span class="Italic">Bilbraut v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 74 MSPR 1, 3 (1997); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Chacon v. USDA</span>, 115 MSPR 313, 316 &#x00B6; 7, 2010 MSPB 239 (2010) (referencing the statutory rate and requiring, during compliance proceedings, the agency to produce, following appellant's challenge to the computations, "evidence that it has correctly computed the interest owed to the appellant on all portions of his back pay and provide an explanation of how such interest was calculated."); <span class="Italic">Raymond v. Dept. of Army</span>, 102 MSPR 665, 667-69 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 6, 2006 MSPB 224 (2006) (referencing &#x00A7; 6621 and the <span class="Italic">Quarterly IRS Interest Rates Used in Calculating Interest on Overdue Accounts and Refunds on Customs Duties</span>, 71 Fed. Reg. 7056 (Feb. 10, 2006)). If the case falls within the interest provisions of the Back Pay Act, no exceptions allow the agency to avoid the obligation. <span class="Italic">Stone v. DHHS</span>, 39 MSPR 650, 654 (1989) (obligation not excused by OPM's requests for reconsideration and for a partial stay).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The obligation to pay interest follows any back pay award under the Statute, including pay awarded as a result of back pay recomputations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v.

<p class="Body-Text">If an agency rescinds an action and an appeal is dismissed as moot for lack of a justiciable controversy, the Board will not require payment of interest on the back pay received by the appellant because the Back Pay Act requires an administrative decision by an appropriate authority that the individual was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In its response to the show-cause order, the agency states that it has not paid the appellant any interest on his back pay. The agency defends its decision not to pay interest on the back pay by arguing that it is not required by the Back Pay Act, codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b), to do so because the removal action was not found to be unjustified or unwarranted by any appropriate authority. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Back Pay Act is a waiver of sovereign immunity which allows the Board "to make employees whole for any losses they suffer as a result of an unwarranted or unjustified action." <span class="Italic">Mattern v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 291 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2002). As the Supreme Court of the United States held in <span class="Italic">Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187, 116 S.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The only statutory basis for the payment of interest on back pay is, as the agency points out, the Back Pay Act as codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b). Subsections 5596(b)(1) and (b)(2)(A) state unambiguously that an employee is entitled to back pay and interest on back pay only where an "administrative decision" is issued by an "appropriate authority under law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, no administration decision was issued finding that the agency subjected the appellant to an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. Rather, the agency rescinded its removal action before the Board could find whether the action was unjustified or unwarranted. Thus, by its plain terms, the Back Pay Act does not apply to this situation. <span class="Italic">See Gray v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 771 F.2d 1504, 1513 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (the Back Pay Act, as a waiver of sovereign immunity is applicable only "in carefully limited circumstances" set out in the statute itself). Since the statutory waiver of sovereign immunity to provide interest on back pay must be strictly construed, the Board has no authority under the statute to order the agency to award the appellant interest on the back pay which it has already given him. Absent such authority, the Board must dismiss this appeal as moot. <span class="Italic">Accord, e.g., Buckhannon v.

DOJ</span>, 80 MSPR 326, 327 (1998). But if the appellant is responsible for the delay in the agency's payment of back pay, the agency will not be responsible for paying interest for the period caused by the appellant's delay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boyd v. VA</span>, 93 MSPR 386, 389-90 &#x00B6; 7 (2003). But interest is not available for retirement benefits withheld or reduced by OPM and then restored by the Board. Those payments are not considered to be back pay, <span class="Italic">Wallace v. OPM</span>, 283 F.3d 1360, 1362-64 (Fed. Cir. 2002):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with OPM that the Back Pay Act does not authorize payment of interest on back payments of retirement benefits. The Act provides relief in the form of back pay only to "employees" who have suffered from an "unjustified or unwarranted personnel action as follows....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An employee who has been affected by an "unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" is further entitled to interest on the pay that would have been received had the personnel action not occurred. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 5596(b)(2)(A) ("An amount payable under paragraph (1)(A)(i) of this subsection shall be payable with interest."). However, Wallace is not an employee as defined by the applicable statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An "employee" is defined as "an individual who is...engaged in the performance of a Federal function under authority of law or an Executive act." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2105(a)(l)-(2) (2000). Because the Act waives the government's sovereign immunity only with respect to covered employees, we must strictly construe the meaning of the term "employee" in favor of the sovereign. <span class="Italic">See Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187, 192, 116 S. Ct. 2092, 135 L. Ed.2d 486 (1996) ("[A] waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign." (citations omitted)). We therefore interpret the Act as applying only to payments made to individuals on account of unjustified or unwarranted personnel actions that occurred while those persons were "employees," i.e., individuals engaged in the performance of a federal function. Wallace was not such a person when he was retired. Even if OPM's determination in 1997 that Wallace had been overpaid annuity benefits were considered to have been an unjustified personnel action, it was made after Wallace's separation from service. Wallace, as a retired employee, is accordingly not an "employee" covered by the Act, and thus is not entitled to interest on retirement benefits under &#x00A7; 5596(b)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we view the statutory language as clear, to the extent that it may be ambiguous, we will defer to OPM's interpretation of the Act unless it is "procedurally defective, arbitrary or capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to the statute." <span class="Italic">See United States v. Mead Corp.</span>, 533 U.S. 218, 227, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed.2d 292 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984)). OPM, pursuant to its express authority to prescribe regulations for the Act under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(c), has similarly interpreted the Act as excluding retirement benefits in the current regulation 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803, which is an amendment of the 1999 version of that regulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Pay, allowances, and differentials means pay, leave, and other monetary employment benefits to which an employee is entitled by statute or regulation and which are payable by the employing agency to an employee during periods of Federal employment.... <span class="Italic">Monetary benefits payable to separated or retired employees based upon a separation from service, such as retirement <span id="Page_4881"></span>benefits,</span> severance payments, and lump-sum payments for annual leave, <span class="Italic">are not covered.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803 (2001) (emphases added). Thus, OPM has interpreted the Act to be limited to employees who have suffered from an adverse personnel, action during a period of federal employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with Wallace that OPM's amendment to the 1999 regulation excluding retirement benefits contravened Congress's broad remedial purposes for the Act. The 1999 regulation defined "[p]ay, allowances, and differentials" as "monetary and employment benefits to which an employee is entitled by statute or regulation by virtue of the performance of a Federal function." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like the current regulation, the 1999 regulation tied back pay awards to periods of active employment, i.e., "performance of a Federal function." Indeed, in its final rulemaking, OPM explained that the amendment reflected its interpretation of the Act as only applying to payments in connection with periods of active employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Regarding the exclusion of post-separation benefits, the proposed definition reflects OPM's interpretation of the back pay law</span>.... We believe the term "employee" clearly refers to an individual currently employed by a Federal agency, consistent with the definition in 5 U.S.C. 2105. (This would include both an individual who was actually employed or who was deemed to be employed based on a retroactive reinstatement.) Furthermore, the terms "personnel action" and "pay, allowances, and differentials" are commonly used in connection with individuals in an <span class="Italic">active employment</span> <span class="Italic">status.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Miscellaneous Changes in Compensation Regulations, 64 Fed. Reg. 69,164, 69,169-170 (Dec. 10, 1999) (codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803) (emphases added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, although OPM's definition of the term "employee" also includes "former employees," it does so only for the limited class of former employees who claim entitlement to payment in connection with an unjustified personnel action that occurred during a period of active employment: "Employee means an employee of an agency. When the term employee is used to describe an individual who is making a back pay claim, it also may mean a former employee." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803 (2001). OPM explained the Act's limited coverage of former employees as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is true that the existing back pay regulations define the term <span class="Italic">employee</span> to mean an "employee or former employee of an agency." However, OPM understands the reference to a "former employee" as merely making clear that an individual separated from Federal service may file a claim for and receive back pay <span class="Italic">for periods of actual or deemed employment</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">64 Fed. Reg. at 69,170 (emphases added). OPM interprets the Act as excluding the claims of former employees such as Wallace whose claims for pay were not in connection with a period of active employment; we conclude that that interpretation is not procedurally defective, arbitrary or capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to the statute. The payments to Wallace were therefore not covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i) and did not trigger the interest provision in &#x00A7; 5596(b)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we reject Wallace's argument that the Act should be construed to authorize payment of interest on back retirement benefits because such authorization is necessary for payment of the underlying benefits. Wallace did not obtain his back retirement benefits under the Back Pay Act. As OPM correctly asserts, the Board ordered OPM to restore Wallace's back retirement pay pursuant to the Board's enforcement authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), not the Back Pay Act. As we have explained, the Act's interest provision only applies to claims for pay in connection with an unjustified personnel action made during a period of active employment. The Act did not serve as the basis for the Board's authority to order payment of Wallace's back retirement benefits, nor does it authorize payments for interest on those benefits.</p>

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 426 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, however, the agency contends that it is not subject to the Back Pay Act. In its argument, the agency notes that the application of the Act to the executive branch is limited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(a)(1) to "an Executive agency," which for purposes of title 5 is defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105 to mean "an Executive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment." The agency points out that the Department of the Army is neither an independent establishment as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 104, nor a Government corporation as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 103, nor one of the Executive departments listed in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101. Rather, the agency notes, it is listed as a military department in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 102 and, as such, the agency argues, it is outside the coverage of the Back Pay Act. The agency's argument must be rejected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency does not deny that the Department of the Army is a component of the Department of Defense, which is an Executive department. This relationship is clearly stated in the National Security Act Amendments of 1949, Pub. L. No. 81-216, that created the Department of Defense as an executive department and redesignated the former executive departments of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force as military departments "within the Department of Defense." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00A7; 4. The 1949 Act states that it was the intent of Congress, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, to provide for the establishment of integrated policies and procedures for governmental functions related to national security; "to provide three military departments, separately administered, for the operation and administration of the Army, the Navy...and the Air Force"; and to provide for their coordination and unified direction under the control of the Secretary of Defense, but not to merge them. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00A7; 2. It further states that "[t]he Departments of the Army, Navy and Air Force shall be separately administered by their respective Secretaries under the direction, authority, and control of the Secretary of Defense." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00A7; 5. Notably, it explicitly excludes from the appointment authority of the Secretary of Defense the appointment of the civilian personnel of the military departments. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00A7; 6(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 1949 Act was discussed by the Board in <span class="Italic">Francis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 545, 549-51 (1992). The issue in that case was whether the military departments should be treated as one agency for purposes of the requirement in 5 C.F.R. Part 315, Subpart H, that the one-year probationary period in the competitive service must be served in a single agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b)(1). The Board concluded from the language of the Act and its legislative history that Congress intended to allow the independent appointing authority and other personnel functions of the military departments to continue and so to continue their administration as separate agencies for purposes of applying Part 315. 53 M.S.P.R. at 551. Thus, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Francis</span> that the appellant's period of service at the Department of the Army could not be credited toward completion of her probationary period at the Department of the Navy because the two military departments were different agencies for purposes of Part 315. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Addressing a "virtually identical case" in <span class="Italic">Pervez v. Department of the Navy</span>, 193 F.3d 1371, 1373-74 (Fed. Cir. 1999), the Federal Circuit stated its agreement with the Board's conclusion in <span class="Italic">Francis</span> that the military departments were intended to continue functioning independently with respect to personnel matters, and it found that their separate treatment for these purposes was not inconsistent with the fact that these departments are also part of the Department of Defense. The Court rejected the appellant's argument there that she was an employee of the Department of Defense, finding that, because of the continuing independent appointment authority of the military departments, she was for purposes of Part 315 an employee first of the Department of the Army and then of the Department of the Navy and that therefore she had not completed one year's service in the same agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1374.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that <span class="Italic">Francis</span> and <span class="Italic">Pervez</span> require the Board to find that the Department of the Army is separate from the Department of Defense, is not an Executive agency and is therefore not covered by the Back Pay Act. As such, the agency argues that the Board cannot order the agency to pay the appellant interest on his back pay award pursuant to the Back Pay Act's provisions. The Board finds that the agency's argument is flawed and is not supported by these decisions or by the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 which they construe. The decisions properly recognize that the 1949 Act intended to preserve the military departments' separate personnel systems and their administration free from direct control by the Secretary of Defense. There is nothing in the 1949 Act, however, that supports the agency's inference that Congress intended to make these military departments independent of the civil service laws generally applicable to executive agencies or to deprive their employees of their rights under those laws.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4882"></span>[1]&#x2003;We note that the agency's argument for excluding application of the Back Pay Act to the military departments would logically require a finding that these departments are not subject to the Merit System Principles in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301 or the Prohibited Personnel Practices in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302 since both statutes apply to "an Executive agency" without mentioning the military departments. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(a)(1), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2). This is an argument we are not prepared to accept.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The military departments' independence from the Department of Defense and from each other in discretionary matters of hiring and personnel management underlies the rulings of the Board and the court finding that their employees are not employees of the Department of Defense for purposes of the OPM regulations concerning completion of probationary periods. OPM's regulation guarantees the employing agency a year to assess the performance of new employees, a discretionary managerial function, and its application is therefore directly related to the independence granted to the agency with respect to personnel matters.[2] The focus of the 1949 Act was on the preservation of the military departments' independent decision-making in hiring and management of employees, not on exempting them from the civil service laws. The issue here involves remedies to which an employee is legally entitled under those laws when an unjustified personnel action is corrected by an appropriate authority, and the agency's independent managerial discretion with respect to personnel matters is not implicated. Thus, we find that, as components of the Department of Defense, the military departments and their employees are part of an executive agency to which the Back Pay Act applies and are therefore subject to its provisions.[3] Accordingly, we find that, in order to be in compliance, the agency must pay the appellant interest on his back pay pursuant to the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Similarly, <span class="Italic">Foreman v. Department of the Army,</span> 241 F.3d 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2001), on which the agency also relies, involved a discretionary personnel matter, a provision of a settlement agreement between the Department of the Army and one of its employees that imposed an obligation on the Department of Defense. The court held that the provision could not be enforced by the Board because a subordinate entity, the Army, had no authority to bind the Department of Defense, which was not a party to the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span> at 1351-52. The decision did not address whether a statute applicable to executive agencies was applicable to the Department of the Army and so has no bearing on the issue in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;This conclusion is consistent with the Board's ruling in <span class="Italic">Grady</span> that the Department of the Army was covered by the Back Pay Act and must compute interest on back pay using the method set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(2)(B). 58 M.S.P.R. at 613.

DOJ</span>, 70 MSPR 554, 556 (1996) (agency must adequately explain through its worksheets how interest was computed); <span class="Italic">Gannon v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 660, 666 n.3 (1995) ("The agency's calculations reflect that for certain pay periods, the agency determined that the interest due the appellant was a negative amount. With its evidence of compliance with this Opinion and Order, the agency should submit an explanation of these calculations.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Litigation over interest surfaced in <span class="Italic">Grady v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 610, 612-13 (1993), explaining how the Board reconciled arguably conflicting calculations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Interest on a back-pay award must be calculated using the interest rate in effect under section 6621(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code and compounded daily. 5 USC 5596(b)(2)(B) (1988). In the Recommendation, the administrative judge found that the agency's submissions reflected that the agency computed the interest under a simple interest method rather than compounding daily. Accordingly, the administrative judge ordered the agency to pay interest to the appellant in accordance with the terms of section 5596(b)(2)(B). In response, the agency argues that it calculated the amount of interest by using a computer program provided by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), and it showed the daily interest rates used.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submitted an interest rate schedule prepared by the Internal Revenue Service which shows the penalty interest rates set forth under the Internal Revenue Code for the relevant period. The appellant also submitted an interest calculation based on that rate schedule. We find that the appellant's calculation is not in accordance with section 5596(b)(2)(B). The appellant employed the underpayment rate shown on the schedule. However, the underpayment rate, calculated under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, is not the correct rate under the Back Pay Act. Rather, the overpayment rate, calculated under section 6621(a)(1), is the correct rate. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 5596(b)(2)(B). Further, the appellant's calculation is not compounded daily. Rather, it appears that the appellant employed a simple interest method, applying the annual rate set forth in the IRS schedule. Further, the appellant sought the annual rate of interest for periods substantially less than a year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the appellant's submission, the agency asserts that it calculated the interest on the back pay award using interest rates provided by DFAS, which it argues is the correct source for its interest rates, not the Internal Revenue Service. The agency, however, provides no legal support for its apparent assertion that it is not covered by the Back Pay Act. We find that the Department of the Army is covered by the Back Pay Act and must calculate interest on back pay awards under the method set forth in section 5596(b)(2)(B), applying the interest rate set forth in section 6621(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 5596(a)(1) (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency has computed the interest on the appellant's back pay award as required by the Back Pay Act. The agency submitted the daily interest rates it used to compute the interest on the appellant's back pay award. These daily rates correspond to the annual rates set forth in the rate schedule submitted by the appellant. Thus, the record reflects that the agency computed the interest applying the interest rate set forth in section 6621(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, compounded daily. Accordingly, we find the agency in compliance with the Board's Order in this regard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For another review of interest computations, refer to <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 417, 423 (1994). If an individual owes money after reinstatement because of a debt to the retirement system, interest on back pay is calculated on the wages due the employee prior to the retirement offset. If the offset results in a debt that is later forgiven by waiver, no interest is due on the amount of debt forgiven or any reimbursement resulting from the waiver; that amount is not considered to be back pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Connell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 235, 239-40 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnston v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/JOHNSTON_MARY_ANN_NY_1221_00_0220_X_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249394.pdf">100 MSPR 196</a>, 201 &#x00B6; 16 (2005), noted application of interest calculations to back pay diminished by interim earnings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its latest submission, the agency calculated the amount of interest on back pay due the appellant as $24,439.23. The agency had previously calculated the amount of interest as $23,875.61, but modified that figure to include the period of interim relief. The agency also adjusted the ratio between the amount of total back pay due before deductions and the appellant's replacement earnings. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805. This ratio is applied to the interest due for each pay period of back pay to account for the appellant's replacement earnings and is calculated by dividing replacement earnings by the total amount of back pay. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.806(b)(1)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Parikh v. VA</span>, CH-1221-08-0352-X-1 (NP 9/13/2013), addressed the effect of outside earnings on interest entitlement, as well as the period for interest calculation--to include the entire back pay period:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, the appellant questions the agency's computation of the adjusted gross back pay amount of $258,257.98, asserting that the agency failed to explain how it calculated this amount. The agency explained its calculations in its November 16, 2012 submission. The agency's calculations are mathematically correct, and, as the appellant has not raised a specific challenge to them, we find that the agency correctly calculated the adjusted gross back pay amount on which interest is to be paid. In addition, this amount accounts for the disputed single day of back pay from pay period 21 of 2007, as discussed above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant, however, that the agency incorrectly <span id="Page_4883"></span>calculated the interest payable on the $258,257.98 in adjusted gross back pay. The agency explained that it calculated the interest by determining the total amount of adjusted gross back pay, starting its calculations from the last day of the back pay period, and running its interest calculations in reverse until it reached the date on which the complete adjusted gross back pay would have been paid. Thus, rather than running the interest calculations over the entire back pay period--October 19, 2007 to March 26, 2011--the agency calculated the interest only from October 30, 2009 to March 26, 2011. This is plainly inaccurate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) back pay regulations provide that interest "begins to accrue on the date or dates (usually one or more pay dates) on which the employee would have received the pay, allowances, and differentials if the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action had not occurred" and ends "at a time selected by the agency that is no more than 30 days before the date of the back pay interest payment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.806(a)(1) &#x0026; (a)(2). In other words, the agency must calculate interest from the first pay date of the back pay period until no more than 30 days before the interest payment is made. Thus, the agency was required to calculate the interest from the first pay date following October 19, 2007.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency claims that its method simply accounts for the appellant's outside earnings. But, as the appellant points out, this too is incorrect. OPM's regulations set forth the proper methodology for taking into account outside earnings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Divide the employee's earnings from other employment during the period covered by the corrective action, as described in &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(1) of this part, by the total amount of back pay prior to any deductions;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Multiply the ratio obtained in paragraph (b)(1) of this section by the amount of pay, allowances, and differentials due for each date described in paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.806(b). On its website, OPM describes this method as applying an "outside earnings factor" and notes that it is to be applied over the entire back pay period--not less than half the back pay period, as the agency did. Because the agency failed to calculate the appellant's back pay interest in accordance with these regulations, we find it noncompliant on this issue and order it to recalculate the interest due the appellant using the proper methodology.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...the agency must pay interest on the FEHB premiums improperly withheld from his back pay because this withholding improperly reduced the amount of back pay he otherwise would have earned. <span class="Italic">See Tubesing v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 423 (2012) (noting agency paid interest on FEHB premiums improperly withheld from appellant's back pay); <span class="Italic">Bernard v.

<p class="Body-Text">Through 1987, the Board did not have the authority to award interest on back pay under either the Back Pay Act or the Veterans Preference Act, nor could interest be awarded as a sanction. <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 32 MSPR 488, 494 (1987); <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 112, 118 (1986); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. VA</span>, 28 MSPR 664, 668 (1985). The prohibition against interest awards included employees in the Postal Service as well as those in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">Dancer v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 235, 239 (1988). Interest could be assessed against the federal government only under an express statutory or contractual authority. <span class="Italic">Frazier v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 86-661).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board confirmed the authority of labor arbitrators to deny interest when some charges are sustained and a penalty is mitigated, explaining in <span class="Italic">Oates v. Dept. of Labor</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/OATES_JOHN_V_CB_7121_06_0021_V_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248526.pdf">105 MSPR 10</a>, 17-19 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-20, 2007 MSPB 46 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the arbitrator committed legal error under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, in not awarding him interest for all back pay awarded. The arbitrator found that the appellant should receive back pay for the days of disciplinary suspension he had already served beyond the 13-day period, "which he would not have been deprived of but for [the agency's] invalid designation of AWOL during this period." The arbitrator concluded, "However, I do not find that interest on back-pay is warranted in the circumstances of this case."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Back Pay Act provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee of an agency who, on the basis of a timely appeal or an administrative determination (including a decision relating to an unfair labor practice or a grievance) is found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement, to have been affected by <span class="Italic">an unjustified or unwarranted</span> personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee--(A) is entitled, on correction of the personnel action, to receive for the period for which the personnel action was in effect--(i) an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any amounts earned by the employee through other employment during that period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added). The Act further provides that "[a]n amount payable under paragraph (1)(A)(i) of this subsection shall be payable with interest." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the arbitrator was not required to award the appellant interest on the back pay. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that, unlike here, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i) requires back pay to be awarded as a matter of law where a removal or suspension action is <span class="Italic">reversed</span>, precisely because that action was "unjustified or unwarranted," but does not require a back pay award where the employee engaged in misconduct, and, therefore, the arbitrator only <span class="Italic">mitigated</span> the penalty, as he did here. <span class="Italic">See Ollett v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 253 F.3d 692, 694 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2718 v. Department of Justice, Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Service</span>, 768 F.2d 348, 350-51 (Fed. Cir. 1985). We find nothing that precludes an arbitrator from awarding back pay, even though he only mitigated the penalty, pursuant to his broad discretion in fashioning a just award that takes account of the parties' mutual interests and conduct. <span class="Italic">Cf. American Federation of Government Employees</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 2718</span>, 768 F.2d at 351 (finding that the arbitrator could deny back pay as part of a mitigated penalty). Nonetheless, because the Back Pay Act does not cover this situation, the arbitrator was not required to award the appellant interest under the Act on the back pay that he awarded the appellant. <span class="Italic">Cf. James v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 504, 507-08 (1994) (finding that the appellant was not entitled to receive interest on her back pay award in a non-Title VII case involving the Postal Service because the Postal Service is not subject to the Back Pay Act and Postal Service regulations do not require it to pay interest in this type of case).</p>
