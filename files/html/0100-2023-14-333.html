<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-334"><span class="space">11.</span> Department of Veterans Affairs Positions</h4>
<p class="noindent">The VA employs professional, nonprofessional, and "hybrid" employees, and the statutory appointment and promotion criteria governing the several classes of employees result in different approaches toward negotiability of proposals affecting those employees. The statutory obligations of the VA to bargain over proposals concerning promotions has changed over time.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA initially determined negotiable proposals governing procedures for promotions administered to VA "hybrid" employees by Professional Standards Boards in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC, Newington</span>, 44 FLRA 356 (1992), although FLRA reversed itself in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC, Newington</span>, 49 FLRA 622 (1994), <span class="Italic">post,</span> following a court remand, <span class="Italic">VA v. FLRA</span>, 9 F.3d 123, 125, 132 (D.C. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">post</span>. The FLRA decision also summarized the distinctions among the various classifications of VA employees, 44 FLRA at 360-65:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he proposals in this case affect "hybrid" employees appointed pursuant to section 7401(3) of title 38. The Agency argues that 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(1) and 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7403(c) preclude bargaining over the proposals in this case because those statutory provisions provide the Secretary with the exclusive authority to prescribe promotion procedures for "hybrid" employees. The Agency further argues that section 7403(f)(3) of title 38 does not permit matters relating to the promotions of "hybrid" employees to be resolved under the provisions of title 5. For the following reasons, we reject the Agency's arguments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7403(f)(1) of title 38 provides, in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Secretary may--(A) use the authority in subsection (a) to establish the qualifications for and...to appoint individuals to positions listed in section 7401(3) of this title, and (B) use the authority provided in subsection (c) for the promotion and advancement of Department employees serving in such positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7403(c) provides, in part, that "[p]romotions...shall be made only after examination given in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to employees appointed under section 7401(3) (that is, "hybrid" employees), section 7403(f)(3) of title 38 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Notwithstanding any other provision of this title or other law, all matters relating to adverse actions, disciplinary actions, and grievance procedures involving individuals appointed to such positions...shall be resolved under the provisions of title 5 as though such individuals had been appointed under that title.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_875"></span>Because section 7403(f)(3) states that it is to apply "[n]otwithstanding any other provision of this title[,]" we find that section 7403(f)(3) of title 38 takes precedence over the provisions of section 7403(f)(1) with respect to matters relating to adverse actions, disciplinary actions, and grievance procedures involving individuals appointed under section 7401(3).... Accordingly, matters relating to adverse actions, disciplinary actions, and grievance procedures involving individuals appointed under section 7401(3) of title 38 must be resolved under the provisions of title 5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We must consider whether the proposals in this case relate to adverse actions, disciplinary actions, or grievance procedures involving "hybrid" employees within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3). There is no assertion in this case that the proposals relate to adverse actions or disciplinary actions involving "hybrid" employees.... [I]t appears from the record, and it is acknowledged by the Agency, that the Union's proposals are intended to establish the right of "hybrid" employees to grieve promotion procedures used by PSB's in career ladder promotion actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons stated below, we find that, consistent with <span class="Italic">VAMC, Newington</span> and the pertinent legislative history to title 38, a matter relates to grievance procedures involving "hybrid" employees under 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) if that matter is within or pertains to the scope of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We found in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Newington</span> that if promotions of "hybrid" employees are covered by a negotiated grievance procedure, then 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106(g)(3) (now 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3)) takes precedence over the provisions of title 38 relating to the promotion of "hybrid" employees and requires that matters involving promotions of "hybrid" employees instead be resolved under the provisions of title 5 of the U.S. Code. <span class="Italic">See VAMC, Newington</span>, 37 FLRA at 115-17. In essence, we found that under that provision of title 38, a matter "relates to" grievance procedures involving "hybrid" employees if that matter is within the scope of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4104(3) (now 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7401(3)) indicates that a broad interpretation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106(g)(3) (now 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3)) is consistent with the purposes for which the category of "hybrid" employees was first created. In creating the category of "hybrid" employees in the Department of Medicine and Surgery (DM&#x0026;S) in 1983, the House and the Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Committees note that it is not the intent of the provisions of this legislation relating to the three DM&#x0026;S occupations involved to diminish or impair in any way the rights and protections guaranteed the employees in those occupations under the express provisions of chapter 71 of the title 5, United States Code, relating to federal labor management relations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Explanatory Statement of House Bill, Senate Amendment, and Compromise Agreement, <span class="Italic">reprinted</span> in 1983 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 1459, 1468.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, during a 1987 hearing conducted by the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the Committee noted concerns from witnesses representing the American Federation of Government Employees and the National Federation of Federal Employees that "employees in occupations in the hybrid category were not being accorded protection[s] that were available to title 5 employees in grievance and disciplinary matters." S. Rep. No. 215, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 144 (1987). According to the Committee report, title 38 would be amended to "reaffirm the Committee and the Congress' original intent with reference to the employees in the occupations in the hybrid category[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 145. The Committee report further stated that pursuant to the amendment, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106(g)(3), "these individuals will have the full panoply of rights available to title 5 employees for the resolution of grievance and disciplinary matters including, for those in recognized bargaining units, access to negotiated grievance procedures involving outside arbitration." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4104(3) and 4106(g)(3) (now 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7401(3) and 7403(f)(3)) clearly indicates that Congress did not intend to deny "hybrid" employees the collective bargaining rights and protections enjoyed by employees appointed pursuant to title 5. Rather, even though "hybrid" employees were appointed and paid pursuant to title 38, they were to "have the full panoply of rights available to title 5 employees for the resolution of grievance and disciplinary matters...." S. Rep. No. 215, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 145 (1987). In order to have the "full panoply of rights available to title 5 employees for the resolution of grievance" matters, "hybrid" employees must be permitted to resolve matters pertaining to the scope of the grievance procedure under the provisions of title 5. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, proposals addressing matters that are within or pertain to the scope of the grievance procedure are matters relating to the grievance procedures involving "hybrid" employees within the meaning of 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This interpretation of 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3), based on both <span class="Italic">VAMC Newington</span> and the pertinent legislative history of title 38, is consistent with the 1991 amendments to title 38. In those amendments, Congress provided in relevant part that, "[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided in this title," the authority of the Secretary to prescribe regulations concerning the hours and conditions of employment and leaves of absence of employees appointed under 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7401(1) is:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">subject to the right of Federal employees to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by them in accordance with chapter 71 of title 5 (relating to labor-management relations).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7422(a). As a result of the 1991 amendments to title 38, doctors, nurses, and other professional medical title 38 employees appointed under 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7401(1) were guaranteed collective bargaining rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To interpret "all matters relating to...grievance procedures" involving "hybrid" employees in 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) to mean something less than matters within or pertaining to the scope of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure would create an anomalous distinction between "hybrid" employees and title 38 professional medical employees. Specifically, "hybrid" employees, who, as reflected in the legislative history, are to be covered by title 38 for limited matters and are not to have their rights under title 5 diminished in any way, would have fewer title 5 collective bargaining rights than professional medical employees appointed pursuant to 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7401(1), who are generally covered by title 38. Accordingly, consistent with <span class="Italic">VAMC, Newington</span> and the pertinent legislative history to title 38, we will interpret 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) to mean that a matter relates to grievance procedures involving "hybrid" employees if that matter is within or pertains to the scope of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposals at issue...are procedures for PSB's to follow in determining career ladder promotion actions and would allow grievances under the parties' agreement concerning the procedures used in making such promotion determinations. We find that because the proposals address matters that may be grieved under the parties' agreement, the proposals are matters relating to the grievance procedures involving "hybrid" employees. Accordingly, under section 7403(f)(3) of title 38, the negotiability of the proposals must "be resolved under the provisions of title 5" without regard to any other provisions of title 38. 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3). <span class="Italic">See VAMC, Newington</span>. Therefore, we reject the Agency's argument that section 7403(c) and section 7403(f)(1) of title 38 preclude the Agency from negotiating over the proposals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the Agency's argument that <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Association </span>[851 F.2d 1486 (D.C. Cir. 1988)] precludes bargaining in this case because the employees in this case are "professional employees appointed under title 38, who, by the very nature of their appointments are intended to fall under the exclusive personnel system prescribed by the Secretary." In <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Association</span>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4108(a), the Veterans Administration had no duty to bargain over the conditions of employment of those professional medical employees identified in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4108(a); that is, physicians, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, nurses, physician assistants, and expanded-function dental auxiliaries. These are employees appointed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4104(1) (now 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7401(1)). However, "hybrid" employees are employees appointed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4104(3) (now 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7401(3)). <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Association</span> applied only to professional, medical employees appointed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4104(1) and not to "hybrid" employees appointed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4104(3). As <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Association</span> did not apply to "hybrid" employees, we reject the Agency's argument. Further, we note that the effect of <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Association</span> on the employees to whom the decision did apply has been changed by the 1991 amendments to title 38. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7421 and 7422(a). As we noted above, the authority of the Secretary to prescribe by regulation the conditions of employment of employees appointed under section 7401(1) is subject to the right of Federal employees to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7422(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, we conclude that the proposals in this case address promotion procedures of "hybrid" employees appointed under 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7401(3) and concern matters relating to the grievance procedures involving such "hybrid" employees. Accordingly, consistent with 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3), the negotiability of the proposals is determined under title 5, without regard to any other provisions of title 38. Therefore, we conclude that title 38 does not preclude the Agency from negotiating over the proposals.</p>
<p class="noindent">On judicial review of <span class="Italic">VAMC Newington</span>, the D.C. Circuit went to some trouble, as it remanded the case to FLRA, to trace the evolution of the statutory distinctions between hybrid and nonhybrid VA employees and to explain the strict limits on the negotiability of proposals involving promotion of hybrid employees. In <span class="Italic">VA v. FLRA</span>, 9 F.3d 123, 125, 132 (D.C. Cir. 1993), the court explained its conclusion that "the Secretary need not negotiate about the criteria for promotions, including the procedures for determining promotions[,] <span id="page_876"></span>[h]owever, any promotion in violation of the Secretary's specified promotion criteria--whether procedural or substantive--may be grievable under applicable grievance procedures":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing the FLRA's determination that the Union's proposals are negotiable under &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3), we examine more generally chapter 74 of title 38, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7401-7474, governing VHA personnel administration, and its relation to chapter 71 of title 5, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-7135, governing collective bargaining rights of civil service employees generally. While we analyze the interlocking provisions of title 38, our interpretive approach is ultimately quite simple: we seek to give meaning to &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3)'s express limitation of negotiability to "matters relating to adverse actions, disciplinary actions, and grievance procedures." Because we agree with the VA that proposals relating to peer review promotion procedures rather than grievance procedures are nonnegotiable under &#x00A7; 7403, we remand to the FLRA for a determination of the negotiability of the Union's proposals in light of the interpretation of &#x00A7; 7403 set forth in this opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I. STATUTORY BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Department of Medicine and Surgery, now the Veterans Health Administration, was created in 1946 "to provide a complete medical and hospital service for the medical care and treatment of veterans." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7301(b). <span class="Italic">See</span> Veterans' Administration, Department of Medicine and Surgery, Pub. L. No. 79-293, 59 Stat. 675 (1946). Because at that time Congress was concerned that the civil service system was insufficiently flexible to accommodate the swift hiring necessary to satisfy the medical needs of returning World War II veterans, it created an independent personnel system for the VHA under title 38. Pub. L. No. 79-293, 2-15, 59 Stat. at 675-79 (codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7401-7474). <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 858 (1945), reprinted in 1945 U.S. CODE CONG. SERV. 956 S. Rep. No. 215, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 145 (1987). The Secretary (then Administrator) of Veterans Affairs was authorized to "prescribe by regulation the hours and conditions of employment" of these employees without regard to "any law, Executive order, or regulation." Pub. L. No. 79-293, 7(b), 59 Stat. at 677 (codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7421(a)). The specified personnel employed under this independent system are consequently referred to as "nonhybrid" employees because their employment is almost exclusively governed by title 38.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;"Nonhybrid" employees are currently (i) physicians, (ii) dentists, (iii) podiatrists, (iv) optometrists, (v) nurses, (vi) physician assistants, and (vii) expanded-function dental auxiliaries. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(a)(2). Since 1946 the <span class="Italic">retirement</span> of all VHA employees has been subject to the title 5 retirement provision governing civil service employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 79-293, 9, 59 Stat. at 678 (codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7426).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1978 Congress passed the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified at chapter 71 of title 5, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-7135), providing for collective bargaining rights of civil service employees generally, and establishing the FLRA in order to "carry[ ] out the purpose of...chapter [71 of title 5]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105. Soon thereafter Congress amended title 38, adding &#x00A7; 4119 (now &#x00A7; 7425), to reemphasize that "where title 5 is 'inconsistent with' title 38, the latter governs." <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees v. FLRA</span>, 850 F.2d 782, 786 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (quoting 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4119 (Supp. IV 1980) (recodified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7425)). <span class="Italic">See</span> Veterans Administration Health-Care Amendments of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-330, &#x00A7; 116(a)(1), 94 Stat. 1030, 1039 (1980). Nonhybrid VHA employees were not to enjoy the collective bargaining rights conferred upon civil service employees under title 5. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 786-87; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 851 F.2d 1486, 1491-92 (D.C. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to these "nonhybrid" title 38 employees, Congress in 1983 created a new category of "hybrid" VHA employees who are subject to both title 38 and title 5. <span class="Italic">See</span> Veterans' Health Care Amendments of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-160, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 201, 203(a), 97 Stat. 993, 1000 (codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7401(3), 7403(f)(1) &#x0026; (f)(2)). In creating the category of "hybrid" personnel Congress sought to improve the VHA's ability to recruit and retain certain kinds of health care workers apart from the "nonhybrid" employees governed exclusively by the title 38 personnel system.[6] In 1988 Congress further amended the VHA personnel provisions expressly to provide greater collective bargaining rights for these hybrid employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-322, &#x00A7; 221, 102 Stat. 487, 531 (codified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3)). In 1991 Congress conferred, for the first time, certain collective bargaining rights upon nonhybrid employees as well. <span class="Italic">See</span> Department of Veterans Affairs Health-Care Personnel Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-40, &#x00A7; 202, 105 Stat. 187, 200-01 (codified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422). This case involves only the collective bargaining rights of hybrid employees as expressly set forth in &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;All other VHA health care personnel, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, who are neither "hybrid" nor "nonhybrid," are employed under the regular civil service system of title 5. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span> S. REP. No. 215, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 141-45 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA and the VA do not dispute that under &#x00A7; 7403, the Secretary need not bargain over the substantive criteria governing appointment, promotion and advancement of hybrid employees, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, time-in-grade requirements or qualifications. Nor do they dispute that the Secretary must bargain over the mechanics of grievance procedures (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the filing, processing, or resolving of grievances) even when the grievance procedures include the resolution of promotion-related grievances. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Newington, CT</span>, 37 F.L.R.A. 111 (1990) (arbitration of promotion-related grievance permissible under title 38). The parties do disagree, however, about whether promotion procedures themselves are negotiable, and more generally about the scope of the Secretary's obligation under &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) to bargain over "all matters relating to...grievance procedures." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note preliminarily that we owe no deference to the FLRA's statutory interpretation where it has endeavored to "reconcile its organic statute [<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, chapter 71 of title 5--the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act] with a[nother] statute [<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, title 38] not within its area of expertise." <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span>, 851 F.2d at 1488 (citations omitted). <span class="Italic">Accord</span> <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. FLRA</span>, 699 F.2d 1280, 1286 n.29 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Consequently, our review of the FLRA's interpretation of the scope of &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) is <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Professional Airways Sys. Specialists, MEBA v. FLRA</span>, 809 F.2d 855, 857-58 &#x0026; n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (FLRA's refusal to award back pay subject to <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review where decision rested on interpretation of its organic statute and another general statute). In our interpretive exercise, we turn first to the language of the VHA personnel provisions. Because we find the text clear we allude to the sparse legislative history only as necessary to evaluate arguments raised by the parties invoking its use.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we explain below, under the VHA personnel provisions of title 38, the power of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to prescribe regulations governing the promotion and advancement of hybrid employees derives from his power over nonhybrid employees. Therefore, we begin by briefly discussing the Secretary's powers over the promotion of nonhybrid employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Nonhybrid Employees</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Until 1991 the Secretary had no obligation to negotiate any conditions of employment for nonhybrid employees.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4106, 4108(a) (1988) (amended and recodified as 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7403, 7421); <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span>, 851 F.2d 1486. Former &#x00A7; 4106(c) provided that the Secretary had the power to "prescribe[ ]" regulations for the promotion of nonhybrid employees, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106(c) (1988), and former &#x00A7; 4108(a) underscored that the Secretary's power to "prescribe[ ]" under &#x00A7; 4106(c) existed "[n]otwithstanding any law, Executive order, or regulation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 4108(a). In 1988, a panel of this court held that under &#x00A7; 4108(a) the conditions of employment of nonhybrid employees were nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span>, 851 F.2d at 1492.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1991, Congress amended and recodified the VHA personnel provisions adding &#x00A7; 7422. Subsection (a) of that provision creates a baseline of negotiability of all working conditions for nonhybrid employees. Subsection (b), however, leaves nonnegotiable any matter concerning "(1) professional conduct or competence, (2) peer review, or (3) the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation under...title [38]." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(b). It also leaves nonnegotiable grievance procedures relating to these three nonnegotiable subject matters. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Subsection (d) leaves with the Secretary final authority over the decision of whether any specific matter concerns or arises out of these nonnegotiable subject areas. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 7422(d). Therefore, peer review procedures for the promotion of <span class="Italic">non</span>-hybrid employees remain nonnegotiable after the passage of &#x00A7; 7422.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Hybrid Employees</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7403 establishes both the Secretary's exclusive power to prescribe regulations for the promotion of hybrid employees generally and explicitly excepts from this power certain negotiable matters. Section 7403(f)(1) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Secretary may--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;use the authority provided in subsection (c) for the promotion and advancement of Department employees serving in such [hybrid] positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(1). As discussed earlier, subsection (c) of &#x00A7; 7403, relating to <span class="Italic">non</span>hybrid employees, provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Promotions [of nonhybrid employees]...shall be made only after examination given in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. Advancement within grade may be made in increments of the minimum rate of basic pay of the grade in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 7403(c) (former &#x00A7; 4106(c)). Through this mechanism of incorporation, then, &#x00A7; 7403(f)(1)(B) essentially grants the Secretary the <span id="page_877"></span>corresponding power to "prescribe[ ]" regulations for the promotion and advancement of hybrid employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>., at &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7403(c), 7403(f)(1)(B). However, this power over the promotion of hybrid employees is limited by &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) which provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Notwithstanding any other provision of title [38] or other law, all matters relating to adverse actions, disciplinary actions, and grievance procedures involving individuals appointed to [hybrid]...positions...shall be resolved under the provisions of title 5 as though such individuals had been appointed under that title.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3). Our task, therefore, is to reconcile &#x00A7; 7403(f)(1)(B) and &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3). Since the parties agree that the Union's proposals relate to neither adverse actions nor disciplinary actions, we focus on the negotiability of matters relating to "grievance procedures." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1-109</span>, at 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the FLRA's negotiability proceeding, it held the Union's entire array of twelve proposals negotiable under 7403(f)(3) as "matters <span class="Italic">within</span> or pertaining to the scope of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 9 (emphasis added). The FLRA reasoned:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We find that because the proposals address matters that may be grieved under the parties' agreement, the proposals are matters relating to the grievance procedures involving 'hybrid' employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. Put otherwise, the FLRA maintains that procedures relating to the way in which promotions are administered are negotiable as "matters relating to...grievance procedures," because the violation of these promotion procedures will give rise to grievances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 9-10. The FLRA would seem to equate "matters relating to...grievance procedures" with matters <span class="Italic">subject</span> to grievance procedures. We strongly disagree with this reading of &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) in general, and, in particular, do not read &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) to require negotiation of promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Baseline of Nonnegotiability: Hybrid Promotions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We held in <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span> that the Secretary's core power under &#x00A7; 4108(a) (now &#x00A7; 7421(a)) to "prescribe[ ]" regulations for employment conditions of <span class="Italic">non</span>-hybrid employees rendered such regulations nonnegotiable. We reasoned that "by directing the [Secretary] to prescribe regulations--rather than simply issue or promulgate them--Congress intended that the [Secretary] determine the content of those regulations." <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span>, 851 F.2d at 1489. Moreover, we said that &#x00A7; 4108 "underscores the exclusive nature of the [Secretary]'s authority by exempting its exercise from 'any law, Executive order or regulation.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We concluded finally that "[t]he purpose of this language is clear: when the [Secretary] prescribes regulations concerning conditions of employment, he is to be unhampered by the range of federal personnel statutes and regulations that might otherwise constrain his authority." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Nonhybrid employees' conditions of employment were nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Promotion policies are conditions of employment, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14), <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 3884 v. FLRA</span>, 930 F.2d 1315, 1325 (8th Cir. 1991), and &#x00A7; 4108 is "an integral part of an independent personnel system that Congress has placed under the direct control of the [Secretary]," <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span>, 851 F.2d at 1489. Therefore, prior to the 1991 amendments, former &#x00A7; 4106(c) granting the Secretary authority over nonhybrid promotions similarly made nonnegotiable the regulation of nonhybrid promotions. With the addition of &#x00A7; 7422 conferring collective bargaining rights on nonhybrids in 1991, however, Congress limited the Secretary's power to "prescribe [ ]" nonhybrid conditions of employment generally. But in the same amendment Congress excepted from the new collective bargaining mandate his plenary power to prescribe regulations in three areas: (1) professional conduct or competence, (2) peer review, and (3) the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(a) &#x0026; (b). Thus, even after the 1991 amendments, the Secretary can still prescribe, without negotiating, regulations governing, for example, peer review procedures with respect to <span class="Italic">non</span>-hybrid employees. Insofar, then, as the Secretary's power over hybrids follows along from his power over <span class="Italic">non</span>-hybrids, he would retain the absolute right to prescribe the regulations for <span class="Italic">hybrid</span> promotions involving (1) professional conduct or competence, (2) peer review, or (3) the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a result of this analysis, we find that regulations "for the promotion and advancement" of hybrid employees are generally nonnegotiable. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(1)(B). From this baseline of nonnegotiability, then, &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) carves out one further exception: "[n]otwithstanding any other provision of...title [38]," it says "all matters relating to...grievance procedures" are negotiable and should be resolved "under the provisions of title 5." <span class="Italic">Id</span> at &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3). Accordingly, the central goal of our statutory exercise is to give appropriate effect to &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3)'s exception to the nonnegotiability baseline, while still preserving for &#x00A7; 7403 a meaningful scope for its clear nonnegotiability mandate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Menasche</span>, 348 U.S. 528, 538-39, 75 S. Ct. 513, 520, 99 L. Ed. 615 (1955) (applying principle of statutory construction "to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute" (internal quotes and citation omitted)); <span class="Italic">Michigan Citizens for an Indep. Press v. Thornburgh</span>, 868 F.2d 1285, 1293 (D.C. Cir. 1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd by an equally divided court</span>, 493 U.S. 38, 110 S. Ct. 398, 107 L. Ed.2d 277 (1989) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (holding that agency's construction impermissibly "resulted in 'an effective repeal' of part of the statute, and thereby frustrated the intent of Congress" (quoting <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Council of Locals No. 214 v. FLRA</span>, 798 F.2d 1525, 1529 (D.C. Cir. 1986))). We turn, then, to the question of whether peer review procedures for the promotion of hybrid employees are "matters relating to...grievance procedures" within &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3)'s exception to the general nonnegotiability of promotion regulations."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Negotiability of Grievance Procedures Under &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3)'s Exception to the Baseline of Nonnegotiability</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to discern the proper interpretation of "grievance procedures" appropriate for resolution by negotiation under title 5, we turn to title 5 itself and its definition of what "grievance procedures" include. Section 7121 of title 5 provides in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x00A7; 7121. Grievance procedures</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, any collective bargaining agreement shall provide procedures for the settlement of grievances, including questions of arbitrability....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Any collective bargaining agreement may exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedures which are provided for in the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121. Reading 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) in conjunction with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121, we discern three issues concerning hybrid employees which are subject to negotiation. First, as both parties agree, the procedures for the filing and processing of a grievance are negotiable. Second, questions about the binding arbitration of grievances that are "not satisfactorily settled under the negotiated grievance procedure" are negotiable as well. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(b)(3)(C). Finally, the scope of the grievance procedures may also be negotiated, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, which potential grievances shall be "exclude[d]...from the application of the grievance procedures." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(2). The necessity of including all three aspects of the grievance procedures within the duty to negotiate satisfactorily explains the expansive language of 7403(f)(3); not only are grievance procedures, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the procedures for the filing of a grievance to be negotiated, but "all matters relating to...grievance procedures" are negotiable, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the scope of grievance procedures and questions concerning the binding arbitration of grievances not satisfactorily resolved through grievance procedures. This reading of &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) accounts for its expansive phrasing while still maintaining the congressionally mandated division between negotiable and nonnegotiable matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The FLRA's Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's far-reaching interpretation of &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3)'s negotiability, on the other hand, extends to any procedure the violation of which could give rise to a grievance. Such an interpretation, we fear, would effectively deny the Secretary any sphere of nonnegotiability in matters relating to the promotion of hybrid employees. While the FLRA disavows any intent to hold substantive promotion criteria negotiable, the inevitable reach of its interpretation would cover the negotiability of <span class="Italic">all</span> promotion criteria. By the sweeping logic of the FLRA's definition of negotiability, any matter, including any substantive promotion criterion, could become negotiable, because it is a matter that if violated "may be grieved." We reject this interpretation because it would effectively repeal <span class="Italic">in toto</span> the Secretary's authority to prescribe regulations for the promotion of hybrid employees under &#x00A7; 7403(f)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA implies that its expansive definition of negotiability would be tempered by requiring negotiable proposals to leave reserved management powers undisturbed in "important respects." The proposals at hand, it argues, are negotiable precisely because they properly preserve the Secretary's power to promote hybrid employees in "important respects." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. But while preserving management rights in "important respects" may be a proper standard to determine negotiability under title 5, it is not suitable as the sole criterion for determining whether a proposal relates to grievance procedures under title 38. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Defense v. FLRA</span>, 659 F.2d 1140, 1153, 1159 (D.C. Cir. 1981) <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 455 U.S. 945, 102 S. Ct. 1443, 71 L. Ed.2d 658 (1982) (upholding FLRA's requirement that negotiable proposals under title 5 not prevent management from "acting at all," or, in the alternative, not "directly interfere" with management's reserved powers).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7403(f)(3) provides that only grievance procedures and matters relating thereto shall be governed by title 5. If a proposal does not relate to grievance procedures, it cannot be treated as a grievance procedure simply on the basis that it preserves management powers in important respects. There is no general right under &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) to bargain over any proposal that leaves management rights significantly undisturbed. Nor does &#x00A7; 7121 of title 5, relating to grievance procedures under title 5, imply such a right. The FLRA would have this court incorporate into title 38 a <span class="Italic">different</span> provision of title 5, namely &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2), which <span id="page_878"></span>provides that title 5 employees retain the right to negotiate "<span class="Italic">procedures</span> which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any [reserved management] authority." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) (emphasis added). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of Defense</span>, 659 F.2d at 1146. In part because of the difficulty of distinguishing under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) between proposals that are procedural from those that are substantive in nature, the FLRA has developed various tests of negotiability under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) that require the significant preservation of reserved management rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of Defense</span>, 659 F.2d at 1151-52 &#x0026; n.64. But the basic fact remains that title 5 rights of <span class="Italic">title 5 employees</span> are more expansive than those of hybrid title 38 title 5 employees in this respect. Hybrid employees have no general right to negotiate procedures governing management's exercise of its reserved rights. Title 38 precludes any wholesale transfer of general rights under title 5 to negotiate procedures governing management's exercise of authority to the hybrid context. In the absence of a specific reference incorporating general title 5 rights into title 38, an extension of title 5 negotiability over and above those involving grievance procedures to the hybrid context would be in direct violation of title 38, <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7425, and unwarranted by the language of title 5 itself, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our textual interpretation is further supported by a proper reading of the legislative history cited by the FLRA.&#x2003;The FLRA contends that when creating the special category of hybrid employees in 1983, Congress did not intend to curtail their collective bargaining rights under title 5. <span class="Italic">See</span> Explanatory Statement of House Bill, Senate Amendment, and Compromise Agreement, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1983 U.S. CODE CONG. &#x0026; ADMIN. NEWS 1459, 1468 (1983). It maintains that the report of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs in 1987 reaffirmed Congress' intention to preserve these rights in their entirety and explained that &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) (then &#x00A7; 4106(g)) was added to accomplish that purpose. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. REP. NO. 215, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 145 (1987). We disagree with the FLRA's reading. Congress itself recognized that soon after creation of the hybrid category in 1983, confusion arose with respect to collective bargaining rights of hybrid employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 144-45. When Congress got around to the task of clearing up the confusion by adding &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3), it specifically expressed a limited intent to invest hybrid employees with collective bargaining rights under title 5 only for the "resolution of grievance and disciplinary matters." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 145. That same limitation on bargaining rights is expressly reflected in the language of &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) itself. In other words, &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) preserves not <span class="Italic">all</span> title 5 collective bargaining rights for hybrid employees, but only some--namely those relating to grievance procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We similarly reject the FLRA's contention that our interpretation of title 38 leaves hybrid employees with fewer collective bargaining rights than nonhybrid employees. Contrary to the FLRA's assertion, hybrid employees continue to retain greater collective bargaining rights than nonhybrid employees with respect to peer review procedures such as are involved here. Under title 38, hybrid and nonhybrid employees alike are not permitted to bargain over peer review procedures relating to promotions. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(1)(B) (hybrid) <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at &#x00A7; 7422(b) (nonhybrid). Nonhybrid employees may also not bargain over grievance procedures relating to peer review mechanisms; hybrid employees, on the other hand, are explicitly permitted to do so. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) (hybrid) <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at &#x00A7; 7422(b) (nonhybrid).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the FLRA erroneously determined that promotion procedures for hybrid VHA employees are negotiable, and reject the FLRA's reasoning that any "matter[ ] that may be grieved" is negotiable under &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1-109</span>, at 9. Under &#x00A7; 7403(f)(1)(B) the Secretary has the power to "prescribe[ ]" regulations for the "promotion and advancement" of hybrid employees. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(1)(B) (incorporating by reference Secretary's power under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(c)). Therefore, the Secretary need not negotiate about the criteria for promotions, including the procedures for determining promotions. However, any promotion in violation of the Secretary's specified promotion criteria--whether procedural or substantive--may be grievable under applicable grievance procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, "[n]otwithstanding any other provision of...title [38] or other law," hybrid employees retain the right to resolve "all matters relating to...grievance procedures...under the provisions of title 5." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3). In other words, hybrid employees may negotiate all matters relating to grievance procedures. We interpret the phrase "all matters relating to...grievance procedures" to mean all matters relating to procedures for the settlement of grievances. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7463, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121. This interpretation emphatically does not include as negotiable all matters that may become the subject of grievance procedures. It includes as negotiable (i) the procedures for filing, processing, and resolving grievances, (ii) the scope of the grievance procedures, i.e., selecting from among potential grievances those that may be resolved under the grievance procedures, and (iii) questions of arbitrability of grievances that are not satisfactorily resolved through the applicable grievance procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the FLRA is charged with deciding issues of negotiability in the first instance we will not determine the negotiability of the Union's specific proposals under &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Information Agency v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 165, 169 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (FLRA has expertise to determine negotiability in the first instance). Accordingly, we remand the case to the FLRA for a proper determination of the proposals' negotiability in conformity with the statutory interpretations set out in this opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">VAMC, Jackson and NFFE Local 589</span>, 49 FLRA 171, 175 (1994), FLRA announced it would follow the conclusion reached by the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">VA </span>v. <span class="Italic">FLRA.</span> Then in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC, Newington</span>, 49 FLRA 622, 624-26 (1994), FLRA accepted the D.C. Circuit reasoning and declared the <span class="Italic">Newington</span> proposals nonnegotiable. The FLRA's 1994 <span class="Italic">Newington</span> decision summarized the court's decision and its impact on FLRA's remand decision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs v. FLRA</span>, the court rejected the Authority's interpretation of title 38, U.S. Code. The court noted that section 7403(f)(1)(B) of title 38 grants the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the power to prescribe regulations for the promotion and advancement of "hybrid" employees and concluded that such regulations "are generally nonnegotiable." <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs v. FLRA</span>, 9 F.3d at 129. The court found, however, that the Secretary's power over the promotion of "hybrid" employees is limited by section 7403(f)(3) of title 38. The court found that to resolve this case, it was necessary to determine whether proposals involving "procedures for the promotion of hybrid employees are 'matters relating to...grievance procedures' within &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3)'s exception to the general nonnegotiability of promotion regulations<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general matter, the court found that section 7403(f)(3) "preserves not <span class="Italic">all</span> title 5 collective bargaining rights for hybrid employees, but only some--namely those relating to grievance procedures" and that, therefore, "[h]ybrid employees have no general right to negotiate procedures governing management's exercise of its reserved rights<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 131, 132 (emphasis in original). In particular, the court found that the following three issues were subject to negotiation under that section: (1) "the procedures for the filing and processing of a grievance"; (2) "questions about the binding arbitration of grievances that are 'not satisfactorily settled under the negotiated grievance procedure'"; and (3) "the scope of the grievance procedures[,]...i.e., which potential grievances shall be exclude[d]...from the application of the grievance procedures." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 130 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(2) and (b)(3)(C)). The court further found that, although the Secretary "need not negotiate about the criteria for promotions, including the procedures for determining promotions[,]...any promotion in violation of the Secretary's specified promotion criteria--whether procedural or substantive--may be grievable under applicable grievance procedures<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 132.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court remanded this case to the Authority to determine the negotiability of the proposals consistent with the interpretation of title 38 set forth in the court's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 589</span>, 49 FLRA 171, 175 (1994), the Authority stated that "[w]e have decided to adhere to and will henceforth follow the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs v. FLRA."</span> Consistent with <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs v. FLRA</span>, we find that the proposals in this case are nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We found in 44 FLRA 356 that the proposals constituted procedures for PSB's to follow in determining promotion actions for "hybrid" employees. We further found, and the court agreed, that "hybrid" employees may not bargain over proposals relating to promotion procedures unless the proposals constitute a "matter[ ] relating to...grievance procedures" within the meaning of section 7403(f)(3) of title 38. Pursuant to the court's decision, proposals constitute a "matter[ ] relating to...grievance procedures" only if they concern: (1) "the procedures for the filing and processing of a grievance"; (2) "questions about the binding arbitration of grievances that are 'not satisfactorily settled under the negotiated grievance procedure'"; or (3) "the scope of the grievance procedures[,]...i.e., which potential grievances shall be excluded...from the application of the grievance procedures." <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs v. FLRA</span>, 9 F.3d at 130.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">None of the twelve proposals purport to concern any of the matters noted above by the court.&#x2003;The proposals provide specific procedures for PSB's to follow in determining promotion actions for "hybrid" employees and do not concern procedures for filing and processing a grievance, questions about binding arbitration of grievances, or which grievances shall be excluded from the application of the grievance procedures. Therefore, we conclude that the proposals in this case do not concern "matters relating to...grievance procedures" within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we note that the court found that, although the Secretary "need not negotiate about the criteria for promotions, including the procedures for determining promotions[,]...any promotion in violation of the Secretary's specified promotion criteria--whether procedural or substantive--may be grievable under applicable grievance procedures<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 132. The record shows that in 1985 the Agency promulgated <span id="page_879"></span>regulations concerning promotion procedures for "hybrid" employees. There is no assertion or indication that the proposals seek to enforce those regulations under applicable grievance procedures. On the contrary, the proposals seek to establish promotion procedures for the Agency to use apart from those established by the regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, as the proposals do not concern "matters relating to...grievance procedures" within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) and do not seek to enforce the Agency's specified promotion criteria under applicable grievance procedures, we find, consistent with <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs v. FLRA</span>, that they are nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Earlier cases provide some, but not controlling, guidance on promotion-related proposals involving VA. Concerning promotion proposals for an agency-wide bargaining unit, under <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of VA Locals and VA</span>, 29 FLRA 515, 525 (1987) (Proposal 4):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that where an agency has discretion over a matter affecting conditions of employment, the agency is obligated under the Statute to exercise that discretion through bargaining unless the governing law or regulation specifically limit the exercise of discretion to the agency.... Contrary to the Agency's claim, we find that promotion procedures for the employees in this case are not specifically provided for in 38 U.S.C. Chapter 75 so as to be excluded from the definition of conditions of employment under section 7103(a)(14)(C). Rather, the sections cited by the Agency, specifically, sections 4106, 4108, and 4115, all provide the Agency with discretion to regulate appointment and promotion...conditions of employment...and administration of the Department of Medicine and Surgery.... Thus, unless the proposal is otherwise nonnegotiable, the Agency must bargain on it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, since we determined in <span class="Italic">VAMC Ft. Lyons</span> that the Agency's personnel regulations are not "legislative regulations" which have the force and effect of law, such regulations will not bar negotiation of this proposal unless the Agency establishes that a compelling need exists for any of such regulations....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">New York State Nurses Ass'n and VA Bronx Med. Ctr.</span>, 30 FLRA 706 (1987), declared negotiable a number of proposals concerning appointment of nursing personnel. The proposals were negotiable because Title 38 did not specifically provide for the manner of the appointments, leaving appointment procedures within the discretion of the VA. Among the provisions determined to be negotiable were those requiring: the agency make appointments in writing and furnish the terms of those appointments in writing to new employees; the agency appoint graduate nurse technicians on a temporary basis for no more than one year (with reference to 38 USC 4114(a)(3)(A)); the agency consider graduate nurse technicians for conversion to permanent full-time appointments within a reasonable period of time after the nurse technicians obtain a full unrestricted license. Nonnegotiable were proposals that registered nurses be appointed on a temporary basis for a year and a day pending action by the Nurse Professional Standards Board (because the appointment period exceeded that allowed by statute) and that the Nurse Professional Standards Board consider nurses for permanent appointment and determine the appropriate grade level of employees (because by calling on the Board to perform that function the proposal required the agency to assign work to particular individuals). Concerning negotiations at the local level, to the extent that VA promotions are within the discretion of Professional Standards Boards, proposals are negotiable that the agency consider requests of employees to discuss Board decisions denying those promotions. <span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses Ass'n and VAMC, N. Chicago</span>, 27 FLRA 714 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of VA Locals and VA</span>, 29 FLRA 515, 525-26 (1987) (Proposal 4, article 19A, section 2), readily approved as negotiable broad promises for promotions that are nondiscriminatory, consistent with law, selection guidelines, and the negotiated agreement. Also negotiable were proposals that promotion criteria be fairly and equitably applied to ensure that best qualified candidates are recognized and provided opportunity to develop their potential. Disapproved was Proposal 19, section 3 (A)(1) that to be eligible for promotion the employee must have a satisfactory current proficiency rating and have served the required time in grade. The proposal conflicted with provisions of Title 38 allowing appointments to be made only after qualifications have been satisfactorily established and promotions to be made only after examination. These statutory provisions, FLRA concluded, reserved to management the right to determine qualifications, skills, knowledge and abilities needed to perform the positions. A negotiable proposal allowed employees to review materials in the files of the Professional Standards Board relating to their competitive status for promotions; the proposal did not observe statutory restrictions concerning disclosure of personal information. Also nonnegotiable was a proposal for a union representative on the Professional Standards Board; the agency's freedom to engage in internal deliberations over selections would be impaired or abrogated by the proposal. A proposal that management advise an employee 90 days before the employee completes a time-in-grade requirement of the employee's eligibility status for a promotion would have been negotiable had the proposal not identified the particular management official (the appropriate service chief) who was to provide notice to the employee. A requirement was negotiable that an employee be notified in writing, with reasons, within a specified time after a Professional Standards Board promotional decision. It imposed no limitation on management's right to deliberate or act. It was a procedure for management to inform the employee of its decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal that all candidates for General Schedule positions meet OPM minimum qualification requirements was not negotiable. By law the Veterans Administration may establish requirements under Title 38 for certain medical positions without regard to OPM requirements. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 933 and VAMC</span>, 20 FLRA 689, 689-90 (1985).</p>
