<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-80"><span class="space">3.</span> Obligation to Return Employee to Work and Pay; Undue Disruption</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 7701(b):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)(A)&#x2003;If an employee or applicant for employment is the prevailing party in an appeal under this subsection, the employee or applicant shall be granted the relief provided in the decision effective upon the making of the decision, and remaining in effect pending the outcome of any petition for review under subsection (e), unless--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)(I)the relief granted in the decision provides that such employee or applicant shall return or be present at the place of employment during the period pending the outcome of any petition for review under subsection (e); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(II)&#x2003;the employing agency, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B), determines that the return or presence of such employee or applicant is unduly disruptive to the work environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(B)&#x2003;If an agency makes a determination under subparagraph (A)(ii)(II) that prevents the return or presence of an employee at the place of employment, such employee shall receive pay, compensation, and all other benefits as terms and conditions of employment during the period pending the outcome of any petition for review under subsection (e).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If interim relief, including an order returning the employee to work, is ordered by an AJ, the agency that pursues a petition for review has the choice of returning the employee to work with pay, or paying the employee and not returning him to work with an undue disruption determination. The undue disruption determination, although seemingly arbitrary to the appellant, is not subject to Board review. In late 1994, the Federal Circuit, at the behest of OPM, overruled the Board's cases determining that the Board could determine whether the agency exercised bad faith by refusing to return the employee to the job or by placing the employee in a different position during the period of interim relief, <span class="Italic">King v. Jerome</span>, 42 F.3d 1371, 1373-76 (Fed. Cir. 1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board's initial decision ordered SBA to grant "interim relief to [Jerome] in accordance with Section 6 of Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A)." Section 7701(b)(2) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;If an employee or applicant for employment is the prevailing party in an appeal under this subsection, the employee or applicant shall be granted the relief provided in the decision effective upon the making of the decision, and remaining in effect pending the outcome of any petition for review under subsection (e), unless--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;the deciding official determines that the granting of such relief is not appropriate; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)(I)the relief granted in the decision provides that such employee or applicant shall return or be present at the place of employment during the period pending the outcome of any petition for review under subsection (e); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(II)&#x2003;the employing agency, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B), determines that the return or presence of such employee or applicant is unduly disruptive to the work environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;If an agency makes a determination under subparagraph (A)(ii)(II) that prevents the return or presence of an employee at the place of employment, such employee shall receive pay, compensation, and all other benefits as terms and conditions of employment during the period pending the outcome of any petition for review under subsection (e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is a systematic process for giving an employee interim relief after a favorable initial decision by an administrative judge, which commonly includes, as here, an order that the agency return the employee to duty. This relief takes effect immediately unless the administrative judge determines that returning the employee is not appropriate, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A)(i), or the agency determines that returning the employee would be unduly disruptive to the workplace, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii). The statute thus gives the agency discretion to determine whether returning the employee would be unduly disruptive regardless of whether the administrative judge believes that returning the employee is appropriate. The agency, however, does not have unfettered discretion. If it determines that returning the employee would be unduly disruptive, it must give him the same "pay, compensation, and all other benefits as terms and conditions of employment during the period pending the outcome of [the] petition for review." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither section 7701 nor any other statute explicitly provides for any review of an agency's determination that returning an employee would be unduly disruptive. Beginning with <span class="Italic">Ginocchi v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 62 (1992), however, the board concluded that Congress had left a gap in section 7701 because it did not provide for review of that determination. The board decided, therefore, that it must review undue disruption determinations to prevent detailing, assigning, or restricting the duties of an employee in bad faith during the interim relief period. In <span class="Italic">Ginocchi</span>, the board sought "[t]o guard against the possibility of an employee's having to suffer the assignment of inappropriate duties as the result of an agency's abuse of the authority to determine that the employee's 'return' would be unduly disruptive, but his 'presence' would not be." 53 MSPR at 70. The board also said that "if the agency's decision is discriminatory, demeaning, or inherently unsafe, such action will be held to be in bad faith, and its petition for review will be dismissed." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The only law, rule or regulation cited as a basis for this review was the board's general power to enforce its orders under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) (1988 &#x0026; Supp. V 1993), which gives it authority to "order any Federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision issued by the board under [its adjudicatory authority] and enforce compliance with any such order."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its bad faith review process, the board argues here that "review of agency undue disruption determinations is the most effective and efficient means of ensuring that agencies do not take retaliatory actions against employees in the guise of providing interim relief." Similarly, it says that "[i]t would be absurd to require the time and expense of an additional administrative action to protect an employee from abuse in the interim relief process when the board can effectively protect the employee at little or no marginal cost."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin our analysis of the board's power to review an agency's undue disruption determination from the foundation that the board has no plenary jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. Cowan v. United States</span>, 710 F.2d 803, 805 (Fed. Cir. 1983). We construe its jurisdiction narrowly, it includes only those actions specifically granted by some law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Van Werry v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 995 F. 2d 1048, 1050 (Fed. Cir. 1993). If we believe the board's interpretation of section 7701(b)(2) is "contrary to the intent of Congress, as divined from the statute and its legislative history," we owe the board's statutory interpretation no deference. <span class="Italic">Muwwakkil v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 18 F.3d 921, 925 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With this in mind, it is apparent there is no justification for the board to conduct a bad faith review in light of the precise statutory language and framework set out by Congress in section 7701(b)(2). The board cannot use section 1204(a)'s very general grant of authority to create a power of review where the statutory scheme indisputably contemplates no such power. By the language of the statute, Congress intended the agency to determine the effect of returning an employee to the workplace and gave it discretion when it determined that returning him would cause undue disruption. Congress did not provide for any review of this decision. Rather, to protect the employee, it provided that if the agency did not return him to work, it must still give him all pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment he would have received, absent his suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This interpretation of the language and framework of section 7701(b)(2) is supported by the limited legislative history pertaining to the interim relief provision, which was added by amendment to section 7701 by section 6 of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 33. The Senate Report specifically noted that the interim relief provision is "a change to current law in that under current law, employees are not granted any relief ordered by a regional office of the Board until they win at the full Board." S. Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 35 (1988). It highlighted two specific exceptions: "Relief will not be granted if the deciding Board official determines that granting such relief would not be appropriate; in addition, an employee need not be returned to the workplace if the employing agency determines that returning that employee to the workplace would be unduly disruptive. If the employing agency determines that an employee should not be returned to the workplace, the employee will nevertheless receive the pay and benefits s/he would receive if s/he were working." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency complies with the interim relief provision when it makes a determination that returning the employee would cause undue disruption and provides the employee with the same pay, compensation, and other benefits of his previous position during the pendency of the agency's petition for review. The board may review this process, but the scope of review is limited to determining whether the agency actually made an undue disruption determination and whether the employee has received appropriate pay and benefits. <span class="Italic">See DeLaughter v. USPS</span>, 3 F.3d 1522 (Fed. Cir. 1993).[**]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[**] Board regulations also require that the agency notify the employee and the board that an undue disruption determination has been made, and require dismissal of an agency's petition for review where the agency does not submit evidence that such notice has been provided. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115(b) (2), (b)(4). No one has disputed SBA's compliance with these notice and "proof of notice" requirements. For this reason, and because the question apparently was not raised properly by SBA below, OPM has taken no position on whether the board's dismissal regulation exceeds its statutory authority under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2), and we do not address that issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1984), on which the board relies, is not to the contrary. The board there ordered the agency to restore Kerr to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> as part of a final order, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 731, but held that it could not review the substance of the agency's compliance with the order beyond determining whether the agency had formally reinstated Kerr at his pay grade, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 732. This court reversed, holding that the board could review the substance of the agency's actions, beyond the formal reinstatement of Kerr, to determine whether Kerr was in fact returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante.</span> <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 732-34.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, here the board was reviewing compliance with statutory guidelines governing interim relief, not compliance with an order. The administrative judge had no authority to issue a final order; he entered only an order for interim relief pending the agency's appeal to the full board. Thus, rather than falling under the broad general powers of the board to enforce orders made within its adjudicatory jurisdiction under section 1204(a)(2), the board and the agency were bound by the overriding statutory guidelines found in section 7701(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board argues that absent a bad faith review of an undue disruption determination, an agency could, in the guise of providing interim relief, transfer employees for retaliatory purposes without fear of review. But the injurious personnel practices contemplated by the board are already prohibited by 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302 (1988 &#x0026; Supp. V 1993). If Jerome believed that the agency had committed a prohibited personnel practice, such as transferring him in retaliation for filing an appeal, he had access to the Office of Special Counsel<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214 and 2302(b)(9). The Special Counsel can investigate allegations of prohibited personnel practices, secure corrective action, and bring action against employees who commit such acts. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1215. And if Jerome had evidence that SBA engaged in discrimination, he could go to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board argues that these remedies do not give the employee as effective and efficient relief as its review does. It argues that "review of agency undue disruption determinations is the most effective and efficient means of ensuring that agencies do not take retaliatory actions against employees in the guise of providing interim relief," and that it would be "absurd to require the time and expense of an additional administrative action to protect an employee from abuse in the interim relief process when the Board can effectively protect the employee at little or no marginal cost." The answer to this argument is that the board does not have the authority to determine the most efficient and effective means to prevent agency retaliation--it has only as much authority as <span id="Page_1667"></span>Congress chooses to give it. <span class="Italic">Cowan</span>, 710 F.2d at 805; <span class="Italic">Van Werry</span>, 995 F.2d at 1050. Congress did not grant it the authority to review an agency's determination made under section 7701(b)(2), and it is not for the board to supplant the remedies Congress expressly provided or create new remedies which it believes Congress overlooked. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439 (1988); <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, 909 F.2d 1452 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It does not appear that the employee can avoid the limitations on review of an undue disruption determination in an IRA case by seeking a stay of an interim detail. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">In re Carson</span>, 1999 WL 969894 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (denying a petition for mandamus from the Board's denial of a stay following the grant of corrective action, interim relief, and a detail of the appellant during period of interim relief).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">King v. Jerome</span> focused on the Board's analysis that an agency could either keep an employee out of the workplace or return the employee to the workplace, subject to a review for "bad faith" in the implementation of the terms of return. The issue was the Board's review authority over the terms of return. Left open in <span class="Italic">King v. Jerome</span> was whether the interim relief statute only left the employer two choices: either return the employee to the old job or bar the employee from the workplace while maintaining his pay. In <span class="Italic">Nadolski v. MSPB</span>, 105 F.3d 642, 645 (Fed. Cir. 1997), the Federal Circuit agreed that the employer had the two options, but decided the employer could also return the employee to the workplace with a different position or modified duties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The process under section 7701(b)(2) entitles employees to interim relief after a favorable initial decision by an administrative judge ordering an agency to return an employee to duty. Nadolski contends that this section enables an agency to provide relief through only two options: it can return him to his former position or it can place him on administrative leave with pay, compensation, and all other benefits. Because the Postal Service gave Nadolski a different duty assignment, he believes that it failed to comply with the statutory requirements triggered by the administrative judge's order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nadolski's construction of section 7701(b)(2)(B) is untenable. The text--"such employee shall receive pay, compensation, and all other benefits as terms and conditions of employment"--does not prevent an agency from imposing additional terms or conditions on this employment, such as a change of station or change in duties. That was the case in <span class="Italic">Jerome</span>, where the agency made an undue disruption determination and the petitioner was transferred from Dallas to Chicago. It is unlikely that Congress intended this interpretation because it is unduly limiting and expensive. Nadolski's interpretation leaves the agency with two options, recreating an unnecessary position or paying administrative leave, both of which prevent the agency from using the employee effectively during the interim relief period.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board interprets <span class="Italic">Jerome</span> to mean that "the interim relief statute [permits] agencies to detail, assign and even transfer employees to different commuting areas as interim relief, if such agencies have made a determination that it would be unduly disruptive to effect the relief ordered by the administrative judge, and appropriate pay, compensation and benefits are provided." <span class="Italic">Costin v.

<p class="Body-Text">Interim relief is not complete relief, <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Educ</span>., AT-0752-20-0541-I-1 (NP 2/21/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant appears to acknowledge that the agency reinstated him to his position as a GS-14 Contract Specialist, but argues that the agency only "partially complied" with the administrative judge's interim relief order for the following reasons: (1) it continued to deny him the right to take certain courses for his DAWIA certification; (2) failed to convert his DAWIA certification to a FAC-C Level III certification, insisting that he needed to take additional courses and provide course records; (3) refused to approve the transfer of his training record data to a new database; (4) included incorrect information on his promotion SF-50; and (5) placed him on an Individual Performance Plan.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, to the extent the appellant is seeking to enforce the interim relief provisions of the initial decision, the Board's regulations do not allow for a petition for enforcement of an interim relief order, so the appellant's petition for enforcement is denied and we instead consider his pleading as a challenge to the agency's certification of compliance. <span class="Italic">Elder v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 12, &#x00B6; 20 (2016); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.116(b). To that end, the appellant's argument that the agency is not in compliance with the administrative judge's interim relief order is without merit. The scope of the Board's review of the interim relief process is limited to determining whether the agency actually made an undue disruption determination and whether the employee has received appropriate pay and benefits. <span class="Italic">King v. Jerome</span>, 42 F.3d 1371, 1374-75 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Powers v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 6 (2000). With respect to the appellant's claim that his SF-50 includes incorrect information, he has not specified which information he believes is incorrect. Nevertheless, we have reviewed the provided SF-50 and conclude that the information contained in it is accurate and provides no reason to conclude that the agency is not in compliance with the administrative judge's interim relief order. Regarding the appellant's remaining allegations, none of his claims concern the pay and benefits of his position so they also do not provide a basis for concluding that the agency has not complied with the interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of interim relief is not to make the appellant whole at the interim relief stage of the proceedings, but rather, to provide the limited relief of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A) during the pendency of the petition for review process. <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 78, &#x00B6; 25 (2005). Accordingly, under the circumstances, we find no basis upon which to dismiss the agency's petition for review for failure to comply with the administrative judge's interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency believes that interim relief is not appropriate, for example, if there is a lack of work for an appellant who is returned to the job, the agency should present its position to the AJ. The agency may then assert on PFR that the AJ erroneously ordered interim relief. <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 275, 277 (1991). The agency may not withhold interim pay because the agency believes the appellant is not capable of working--at least not if the appellant's ability to work was the issue the agency lost during the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Doyle v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Abbott v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has found that an agency may only avoid returning an employee to duty under an interim relief order by making a determination under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii) that the employee's presence would be unduly disruptive. <span class="Italic">See DeLaughter v. USPS</span>, 3 F.3d 1522, 1524 (Fed. Cir. 1993).

However, an appellant may waive his right to receive interim relief. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 340, 349-50 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Dennis</span>, we cited <span class="Italic">Doyle v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 240, 242 (1993), for the proposition that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">where an agency neither returns an appellant to duty nor provides him with "pay, compensation, and all other benefits" to which he is entitled under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2), but instead directs him to submit medical information showing that he is ready, willing and able to work, the agency has not complied with the interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Dennis</span>, 62 MSPR at 465. We further found that the employee's request to be placed on LWOP did not constitute an informed waiver of interim relief as the appellant had not moved for such a waiver, and his request was filed in response to the agency's letter directing him to either return to work or apply for appropriate leave. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 466.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the agency similarly conditioned its compliance with the Board's order of interim relief on receipt of "appropriate medical clearance," arguing that its subsequent placement of the appellants on LWOP was necessitated by evidence from their own health care <span id="Page_1668"></span>providers that they were medically unable to return to work. As in <span class="Italic">Dennis</span>, however, the appellants here only provided this evidence in response to the agency's own instructions. Accordingly, we find that the agency ignored the statutory requirements set forth in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A) by interposing conditions on the appellants' return to duty, and therefore failed to comply with the Board's order of interim relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its brief, OPM argues that our holding in <span class="Italic">Dennis</span> exceeds the statutory intent of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A) by creating an entitlement to pay beyond that authorized by the Back Pay Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A). We find, however, that OPM's reference to the terms of the Back Pay Act, and to cases which have applied them, have no bearing here. The issue is not the scope of back pay the employee may receive should he ultimately prevail before the Board, but rather his entitlement to be returned to duty, with attendant pay and benefits, during the pendency of his appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DeLaughter</span>, 3 F.3d at 1524. <span class="Italic">See also Smith</span>, 59 MSPR at 350 (intent of interim relief is to protect the appellant from hardship during the pendency of his appeal if he prevails in the initial decision). To the extent that OPM attempts to analogize between the terms of the Back Pay Act, which limit an appellant's ultimate remedy to the "pay, allowances or differentials...the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred" (5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)), and the operation of the interim relief provisions, it has failed to explain how such a rationale relieves the Board of its obligation to follow the holding of the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM further asserts that application of the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Dennis</span> will work hardships upon the agency, forcing it, for example, to return an incarcerated employee to pay status, or to refuse an employee's request for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, 29 USC &#x00A7; 2601 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> Contrary to such contentions, however, neither our decision in <span class="Italic">Dennis</span> nor our finding here requires an employer to provide employees with pay, compensation, and all other benefits from the date of the initial decision regardless of whether they are willing to return to work. Rather, as previously stated, both holdings prohibit an agency from making an employee's interim return to duty and pay status conditional upon a medical fitness determination. Accordingly, an agency remains free to withhold pay, or otherwise discipline employees who do not report for work having been directed to do so, or, alternatively, to grant leave to employees who freely request it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a decision citing <span class="Italic">Abbott,</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. VA</span>, 2023 MSPB 9, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2023), one charge was AWOL, and although the AWOL charge was largely sustained, the AJ mitigated removal to a suspension. The agency filed a PFR. The appellant challenged the PFR for lack of proper interim relief in the form of pay to the appellant during the pendency of the agency PFR. The Board rejected the agency's defense that interim relief in the form of interim pay was not required because the appellant could not work:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are two elements to interim relief. The first is returning the appellant to the workplace while the petition for review is pending unless the agency determines that the return or presence of the appellant would be unduly disruptive. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A)(ii). The second element is providing the appellant with pay and benefits while the petition for review is pending; the agency must provide pay and benefits even if it does not return the appellant to the workplace. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(B). When an appellant alleges noncompliance with an interim relief order, the Board's authority is restricted to reviewing whether an undue disruption determination was made when required, and whether the appellant is receiving appropriate pay and benefits. <span class="Italic">Batten v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the appellant's petition regarding interim relief, the agency submitted evidence showing that it had cancelled the appellant's removal and placed him on leave without pay. The agency argues that its action was appropriate because the appellant was unable to work. We need not determine whether the agency's actions constitute a valid undue disruption determination because it is undisputed that the agency did not provide the appellant with pay and benefits upon filing the petition for review. An undue disruption determination does not relieve the agency of its obligation to pay the appellant and provide benefits during the interim relief period. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(B); <span class="Italic">DeLaughter v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 F.3d 1522, 1524 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The appellant's ability to work could affect his entitlement to back pay,[4] but it has no impact on the agency's statutory obligation to provide pay during the interim relief period. <span class="Italic">See Abbott v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 124, 129 (1995) (finding an agency not in compliance with an interim relief order when it conditioned the appellants' return to duty and pay on the submission of medical evidence); <span class="Italic">Doyle v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 240, 242 (same). We therefore conclude that the agency has not complied with the interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The agency argues in its submission regarding interim relief that the appellant is not entitled to back pay. However, back pay is not part of the agency's interim relief obligation because interim relief is effective upon the issuance of the initial decision. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A), (C).

<p class="Body-Text">The genesis of the "bad faith" review standard as to return of the appellant to duties during interim relief was in early 1992, when the Board considered the significant question of what circumstances allow an agency either to decline to return an employee to a position, while providing interim relief, or to return the employee to a position, while restricting the employee in his duties. <span class="Italic">Ginocchi v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 62, 68-71 (1992), imposing a standard of "bad faith review" that would be set aside by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">King v. Jerome, supra</span>, declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the context of interim relief, the Board will not look behind an agency determination that returning an employee to the position he encumbered will be unduly disruptive to the work environment. The statute and the regulation providing for interim relief commit this determination to the agency and provide only that the appellant may seek the remedy of dismissal of the agency petition for review if the agency does not show that the appellant, either present or absent from the position in issue, is receiving the benefits to which he is entitled.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Board's regulations do not provide for a motion for compliance with an order of interim relief, and the Board will not entertain such a motion. Rather, an appellant's remedy, if he believes that the agency has not afforded him the interim relief ordered, is to move that the Board dismiss the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the WPA provides that the employee who prevails below shall be granted the relief provided in the initial decision unless:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)(I)the relief...provides that such employee shall <span class="Italic">return or be present</span> at the place of employment...; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(II)&#x2003;the...agency...determines that the return or presence of such employee...is unduly disruptive to the work environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added). It is an elementary rule of statutory construction that effect must be given, if possible, to every word, clause, and sentence of a statute so that no provision will be superfluous, inoperative, or insignificant.... The provisions of the WPA afford agencies the authority to determine whether the "return <span class="Italic">or</span> presence" of the employee is unduly disruptive. Interpreting this phrase so as to give meaning to each word, the Board first concludes that the phrase means something different than either the term "return" or the term "present/presence" used alone. The Board concludes that the word "return" means a return to the former position and duties, while "presence" means something broader, a return to the former position with altered or restricted duties, or an assignment to a different position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under this interpretation of the phrase "return or presence," an agency may determine that an employee's "return" would be unduly disruptive, but that his "presence" would not be. This interpretation permits the agency to detail or assign the employee to a position other than the former position, or to return the employee to the former position but with restricted duties, with the same pay and benefits as he would have received in the former position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The intent of the statutory interim relief provision is to benefit both the agency and the appellant by limiting the waste of human and financial resources....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To read the interim relief provision restrictively, i.e., that the agency's only <span id="Page_1669"></span>alternative, once it determines that the appellant's return to the duties ordered in the initial decision, would be unduly disruptive is to put the appellant in a non-work status with the appropriate pay and benefits while the agency's petition for review is pending, severely restricts the benefit to the government from the interim relief provision. Under that interpretation of the statute, an agency could exercise its discretion to make an undue disruption determination only by giving up any benefit from the employee's performance of useful service. The legislative history of the interim relief provision does not suggest Congressional intent to so circumscribe an agency's exercise of its discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Senate Report notes that a few weeks or months between a regional office decision and a full Board decision may be too long for an employee denied his or her job or performing unwanted duties.... To guard against the possibility of an employee's having to suffer the assignment of inappropriate duties as the result of an agency's abuse of the authority to determine that the employee's "return" would be unduly disruptive, but his "presence" would not be, the Board will hold the agency's decision to detail, assign, or restrict the duties of an employee for whom interim relief has been ordered subject to a "bad faith" standard of review. Thus, for example, if the agency's decision is discriminatory, demeaning, or inherently unsafe, such action will be held to be in bad faith, and its petition for review will be dismissed. The appellant has the ultimate burden of persuasion on the bad faith issue. The burden of production, however, shifts. If the appellant makes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of bad faith by presenting evidence and argument which, if true, shows bad faith on the part of the agency, then the burden of going forward shifts to the agency to rebut the showing under all the circumstances of the case.</p>
