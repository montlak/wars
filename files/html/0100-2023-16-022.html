<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-21"><span class="space">5.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Wilson</span></span> and <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Jackson</span></span>; Negative or "Backwards" Standard</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The objectivity issue was judicially joined in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DHHS</span>, 770 F.2d 1048, 1050-52 (Fed. Cir. 1985), consolidated with <span class="Italic">Jackson v. EPA</span> (also reported at 770 F.2d 1048). Both appeals involved demotion for unacceptable performance. Together, the decisions set benchmarks defining objectivity in performance standards. The court reviewed the history of the performance sections of the Reform Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the Reform Act generally and of Chapter 43 in particular reveals a conscious desire on the part of Congress to reject the previous system by which the Government evaluated its employees, and to create a new scheme resting on a different foundation. The old system, most recently promulgated in the Performance Rating Act of 1950...provided for summary evaluation of employees' performance under three ratings: satisfactory, unsatisfactory or outstanding. This system ultimately proved ineffective as a management device because (1) it was too subjective to differentiate adequately between competent and incompetent employees, and correspondingly (2) it injected into the appraisal system an element of subjectivity over which any employee could contest the Government's action in lengthy administrative and judicial proceedings....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2892"></span>[C]ongress intended in the Reform Act to initiate and continue a system that would assure that competent employees would be retained and unsatisfactory employees removed from their positions, while keeping to a minimum the need for protracted administrative and judicial intervention resulting from inadequate standards and appraisals....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board recognizes, as it should, that the "objectivity" requirement in the statute promotes the purposes of the Reform Act by informing employees and their supervisors, as precisely as feasible, of the level of proficiency necessary to achieve a given rating. This objective appraisal system serves to deter the arbitrary personnel actions and protracted appeals which Congress found to be so frequent under the earlier, subjective standard system....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We wholly agree with the Board's formulation, as set forth in <span class="Italic">Siegelman</span> and other Board decisions, that under the statute's objectivity requirement performance standards must be reasonable, sufficient in the circumstances to permit accurate measurements of the employee's performance, and adequate to inform the employees of what is necessary to achieve a satisfactory or acceptable rating. If the performance standards satisfy this test, then they further the congressional purpose. Employees will be spared arbitrary ratings and adverse personnel actions grounded purely on subjective impressions. Supervisors will feel freer to propose personnel actions against unsatisfactory employees--based on such objective standards--confident that they will have made a verifiable decision, and the employee will not be retained because the evaluation process itself was arbitrary or because the agency is reluctant to defend inevitable and protracted appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners do not reject the Board's general interpretation of the objectivity requirement. However, they urge further that, to reach these goals, the Government must provide its employees with precise quantitative or numerical standards. They contend that only such mathematical or percentage standards can completely remove subjective judgment from the employee evaluation process, as Congress intended. We cannot agree that this refinement is mandatory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory terms "accurate evaluation," "objective criteria," and "to the maximum extent feasible"--taken together with Congress' stated objective (in the legislative history) to obtain performance standards that were "adequately defined"--all suggest that Congress desired standards sufficiently specific that compliance <span class="Italic">vel non</span> with those standards could be verified in the particular instance by others than the official appraisers of the employee's performance. A parallel of putting the same Congressional objectives is that a standard should be sufficiently precise and specific as to invoke a general consensus as to its meaning and content. But the legislative language does not suggest any necessary requirement for numerical measurement, and it is not at all difficult to think of many positions in which such strictly quantitative criteria would be unrevealing, bizarre, or counter-productive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, Congress clearly expressed its intention to allow the agencies "great flexibility to choose or develop their own systems. Agencies should determine what type of performance appraisal methods best suited their needs...." This strong emphasis on "great flexibility" for the agencies runs directly counter to the rigidity of an obligation for numerical or quantitative standards. Of course, the agency must always live up to the statutory demand that the standard allow for reasonably accurate measurement of performance and protect employees against arbitrary treatment....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court went on to apply the law as it described it to Ms. Wilson, an operations supervisor responsible for 14 employees of an SSA district office. The critical element at issue was that she direct work activity by issuing orders and instructions on what, how, and by whom action should be taken. At the minimally acceptable level, the performance standard designated the necessary performance to be: "controls, and directs activities of subordinate staff to insure adequate service to the public by appropriate management principles. Assignments and instructions to staff are hastily made and sometimes misunderstood. Direction of work activities is occasionally effective in achieving objectives." On the basis of the standard, the Board determined that Mrs. Wilson was properly demoted for failing to cure backlogs and failing to review certain SSA claims. The AJ noted that although the standard was "almost no standard at all," it did require Mrs. Wilson to "insure adequate public service" by the employees in her charge, a standard sufficient in the adjudicator's view to sustain the demotion. The court disagreed, 770 F.2d at 1053-54:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We rule, however, that the standard the Board sustained cannot be upheld as within the requirements of the Civil Service Reform Act. Rather, it is almost a parody of a proper standard. First, the standard permitted Wilson to issue instructions which are "sometimes misunderstood." Nothing indicates how Wilson or her supervisors were to interpret "sometimes" in this context. In the normal course of human interchange, instructions are sometimes misunderstood. This is to be expected for even the clearest and most efficient manager. When the phrase appears in a standard defining minimally acceptable performance, we assume it must mean even less than this normal, unavoidable, inevitable, occasional miscommunication. The standard as stated is, however, so vague and inexact that it is impossible to apply in a verifiable fashion or to discover the level of proficiency which the SSA actually intended by the phrase. It is exactly the type of standard that left Wilson open to arbitrary appraisal in contravention of the Reform Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The same criticism applies to that portion of the standard that requires that Wilson's direction of her subordinates' work be "occasionally effective." The word "occasionally" indicates less than a majority of times, but we cannot be certain or even reasonably sure how much less in this or any instance. Moreover, the SSA placed itself in the awkward position of having to prove a negative; in order to show that petitioner was not occasionally effective, it must, because of the imprecision of "occasionally," prove that she was never effective....[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Similarly, the word "hastily"...is so amorphous in this context as to forestall any general consensus, either as to what it means or as to whether there has been compliance with it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board sustained this performance standard because it also required Wilson to "insure adequate service to the public." We cannot agree that this phrase standing alone satisfies the statutory requirement of objectivity. Every government employee must, of course, serve the public as the duties of his or her position dictate. We assume that failure to serve the public in a meaningful way itself constitutes unsatisfactory performance. This type of performance standard, however, is fatally similar to the pre-Reform Act summary adjectival rating of "satisfactory." It does not specify what duties the employee must perform in order to receive a satisfactory rating....&#8197;In addition, if that portion of the standard has any acceptable meaning, it is in direct conflict with the linked requirements that the employee's instructions and assignments can be "hastily made," or "sometimes misunderstood," and only "occasionally effective." The latter kind of performance can hardly "insure adequate service to the public." The result is that neither the separate parts of the standard, nor the standard as a whole, provide adequate guidance to Wilson and her supervisors--nor could the existence of the standard's components be verified or found to exist apart from the appraiser's own subjective evaluation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude in Wilson's appeal that the SSA abused its discretion, by violating the Reform Act, when it promulgated the performance standard setting forth the minimally acceptable level of proficiency expected of Wilson in the critical element concerning the management of her subordinates. The converse is that the performance standard on the basis of which the SSA demoted Wilson did not properly inform her of what was required to achieve an acceptable performance rating. That standard was not valid because it failed to comply with the statutory mandate. Accordingly, the agency's decision to demote Wilson, based on that invalid standard, cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The standards in the <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> case that were expressed in terms of minimally satisfactory performance were, essentially, measures of unacceptable performance. The court considered the standards impermissibly vague because they could not be applied in a verifiable fashion and because they did not indicate the level of proficiency that the agency actually intended the employee to achieve<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Duggan v. DHHS</span>, 33 MSPR 568, 571 (1987) (same result as to similar standards for an employee development specialist).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The teaching of <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> was reiterated in 1988 by <span class="Italic">Eibel v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 857 F.2d 1439, 1440 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The GS-11 Engineer's performance standards were:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5.&#x2003;CRITICAL ELEMENT: ENERGY AWARENESS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Highly Satisfactory Standard</span>: Coordinate and develop agenda for annual Energy Awareness Week. Initiate and write twelve or more energy conservation articles for the Marine Corps Development and Education Command base newspaper, without assistance, to be approved by the supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Marginal Standard</span>: No agenda for annual Energy Awareness Week is developed. No more than six energy conservation articles for the Marine Corps Development and Education Command base newspaper. Major assistance is required at least 50% of the time to complete articles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">6.&#x2003;CRITICAL ELEMENT: COMMUNICATE WRITTEN AND ORALLY</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Highly Satisfactory Standard</span>: Ability to communicate both orally and in written correspondence with military personnel, engineers, planners, technicians, and public officials without any difficulty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Marginal Standard</span>: Requires assistance at least 50% of the time when communicating in written and oral correspondence with military personnel, engineers, planners, technicians, and public officials.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court noted that the AJ sustained action under the fifth critical element because the supervisor explained the standard more clearly in various letters of caution or instructions to the appellant. The court set the removal aside, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1441-44:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2893"></span>The government concedes that the standards for marginal performance of critical elements five and six cannot be read literally. With respect to "Energy Awareness," for example, read literally, marginal performance is achieved if no agenda is developed for Energy Awareness Week and "no more than" six articles on energy conservation are written. Because Mr. Eibel did not write six articles, he literally met the specified standard for marginal performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While admitting that the standards are "backwards" standards, reading more like unacceptable than acceptable performance standards, the government asserts that the standard should be upheld in view of Lt. Burns' explanation to Mr. Eibel with respect to what was required for a satisfactory rating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we note that the standards here are not written in the terminology of Chapter 43 or the implementing regulations, 5 CFR 432 (1986), which speak of "acceptable" and "unacceptable" performance. Nowhere in the subject standards do these terms appear. Therefore, the terms that were used must be converted into Chapter 43 terms, which presents the probability of varying interpretations. Here, the standards used the terms Marginal and Highly Satisfactory. Whether "acceptable" performance is achieved at the marginal level or somewhere in between is debatable....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event the standards here, even if "marginal" is equated with "acceptable," are directly comparable to the standard held invalid in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>....&#8197;Here, as well, the standards are not merely backwards, but also subject to various interpretations and subjective evaluation. As an example, per Lt. Burns, Mr. Eibel prepared a sufficient number of conservation articles during the period of his evaluation. However, Lt. Burns read into the standard a requirement that the articles had to receive Lt. Burns' approval for <span class="Italic">publication</span> without editing. Neither Mr. Eibel nor Lt. Burns are professional journalists. Nor was the base newspaper subject to Lt. Burns' directive. Thus, Lt. Burns' opinion that the articles were not ready for publication is a meaningless, subjective evaluation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, even if the standard under critical element six were to be rewritten to state that the employee "does not require assistance more than 50% of the time in written <span class="Italic">and</span> oral correspondence," the standard would be at least ambiguous. It would literally require failure in <span class="Italic">both</span> written and oral communications. Yet here, Mr. Eibel was rated unsatisfactory even though his oral communications skills were found acceptable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the government's argument, the performance standards in this case do not fall within the rulings of this court that some standards, which inherently require a degree of subjective judgment by the supervisor, may be "fleshed out" and "clarified" during counseling. The standards here, in contrast, would have to be totally rewritten, not supplemented, to inform an employee of what is necessary to achieve an acceptable rating....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CSRA has now been in the statute books since 1978. This court was aware of the monumental task each agency or department faced in drafting meaningful performance standards for thousands of positions, coupled with the inexperience of those charged with implementing the new system. Our approval of initial standards should not be taken to mean that those standards would not later be disapproved. As experience is gained in writing standards which are understandable and appropriate to various types of positions, the court expects the agencies to revise and update original performance standards....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Removal or demotion by an agency under Chapter 43 is subject to a more limited review by the board than actions under Chapter 75 of Title 5....&#8197;Under Chapter 43, employees will be protected from arbitrary treatment only if agencies establish objective performance standards that are "reasonable, sufficient in the circumstances to permit accurate measurements of the employee's performance, and adequate to inform the employees of what is necessary to achieve a satisfactory or acceptable rating." <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>. Such standards are the foundation for any performance-based action under Chapter 43.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Eibel</span>, the Board considered another "backwards" standards case in <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. DHHS</span>, 49 MSPR 644 (1991), involving the attempted removal of a GS-13 Veterinary Medical Officer. The marginal level of performance was:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...distinctly one level below performance rated fully successful. Marginally successful performance is performance that does not meet one or more of the requirements in the primary, fully successful standard or meets one of those requirements only through unusually close supervision and assistance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board noted in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 49 MSPR at 649:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...This standard includes in its description of a marginally successful employee an employee who fails to meet one or more requirements of the fully successful standard. Taken literally, therefore, if the appellant failed to meet any of the requirements of the fully successful standard, he was performing at the minimally successful level.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> went on to describe other problems with a minimal-level performance standard that incorporated bits and pieces of the requirements of a standard written at the fully successful performance level. As to the agency's efforts to cure the problem through a statement of expectations in a performance improvement plan, 49 MSPR at 650-51:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When he placed the appellant on his PIP, the appellant's supervisor provided him with a statement of the problems he had had with the appellant's performance, and with an outline for the appellant to use in each study on which he worked during his performance improvement period. These documents, however, were insufficient to inform the appellant of the minimum level of performance he had to achieve to avoid removal. The supervisor's statement of the problems with the appellant's performance identified unacceptable performance, not minimally acceptable performance. The additional guidance that the performance improvement plan provided described fully successful performance. The combination was inadequate to help the appellant know specifically what he was required to do to meet the minimally successful level of performance because it does not give definition to the minimum performance necessary to remain employed in his position. As a practical matter, the agency failed to distinguish between minimally acceptable and unacceptable performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the minimally successful standards used by the agency, despite the agency's efforts to clarify them, are invalid and cannot be the basis of a removal action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">More "backward" standards destroyed an agency's case in <span class="Italic">Burnett v. DHHS</span>, 51 MSPR 615, 617 (1991). The standards, for a GS-5 Secretary at the minimally satisfactory level, were:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Quantity: Material is returned more than twice for correction or reparations due to lack of following instructions or standard procedures and/or spelling, grammar, punctuation errors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Timeliness: Material provided to staff is consistently late.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Burnett</span> commented, 51 MSPR at 617-18:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]hey described unacceptable, not acceptable performance, and thus failed to inform the appellant what she had to do to attain acceptable performance. Indeed, the appellant met the standards, if they are read literally, because according to the agency's own evidence material was returned to her more than twice and she provided material to staff consistently late. Because the standards are "backwards," they would have to be entirely rewritten, not just fleshed out and clarified during counseling, to inform the appellant what she needed to do to achieve an acceptable rating....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the court pointed out in <span class="Italic">Eibel</span>, 857 F.2d at 1441, 1443-44, performance standards are the central focus of the Chapter 43 appraisal system. Agencies are expected to become more adept at writing appropriate standards and to review their standards and update them to conform to the requirements of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978....&#8197;The agency should have developed appropriate standards for the appellant by the time this case arose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Absent valid standards, the Board cannot consider the charged performance deficiencies....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1992 the Federal Circuit was still concerned with "backwards" standards, <span class="Italic">Cordioli v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 91-3531):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor can the AJ cure the deficiencies of the standards by "extrapolating" to the unacceptable level. There is no evidence that Mr. Cordioli could have made the same inferences as the AJ. In any event, we are not aware of any authority that directs Mr. Cordioli to guess at performance standards lest he suffers the pain of removal. To the contrary, the agency is bound by the statute to communicate to its employees, to the extent feasible, performance standards that allow accurate objective evaluation of performance....&#8197;Absent this statutory predicate, the agency had no basis to remove Mr. Cordioli. Being "backwards" and impermissibly vague, Mr. Cordioli's performance standards were not in accordance with law. Accordingly, we reverse the Board's decision upholding Navy's removal of Mr. Cordioli.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What then are "backwards" standards? In brief, we are told in <span class="Italic">Romero v. EEOC</span>, 55 MSPR 527, 534 n.5 (1992), that a "backwards" standard is one written at the minimally satisfactory level describing unacceptable performance in terms of what an employee should not do, but not stating what is necessary to obtain an acceptable performance. The Board provided another example of a backwards standard at the minimally successful level in <span class="Italic">Stone v. DHHS</span>, 35 MSPR 603, 604-05 (1987), <span class="Italic">reaff'd on reconsideration</span>, <span class="Italic">Stone v. DHHS</span>, 38 MSPR 634 (1988). The appellant was employed by the National Institute of Mental Health as a GS-13 Research Chemist responsible for planning and conducting research in physical biochemistry and cell biology. Her critical element was "independently and/or in collaboration with others, plan and conduct high quality research and produce results which advance the field in knowledge, theory, technique, or product." The performance standards implementing the element were described in the Board's first decision in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 35 MSPR at 605:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Met</span>: The scientist must perform high quality research, employing rigorous and acceptable methods of planning, experimentation, data <span id="Page_2894"></span>collection, analysis and reporting. The scientist must demonstrate progress in one or more of these elements....&#8197;Results are expected to generate advances in knowledge, theory, techniques, or product....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Partially Met</span>: Performance falls somewhat short of the requirements listed in "Met." For example the quality of research, when judged by peers or review groups, may not be fully acceptable; research may be inappropriate in terms of the criteria stated in "Met"; results may be trivial; little progress can be demonstrated; or peer recognition is lacking.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Stone was removed after she was put on an improvement period following notice that her performance fell short of the "partially met" standard. The Board determined the hierarchical arrangement of standards was invalid, for they were essentially vague and defined unacceptable performance as minimally acceptable performance, as in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DHHS</span>, 770 F.2d 1048 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Under <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 35 MSPR at 606-07:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A standard which defines the minimally acceptable level of performance as "somewhat short" of performance that would meet the standard is impermissibly vague since it could not be applied in a verifiable fashion and does not indicate the level of proficiency that the agency actually intended....&#8197;Moreover, the examples listed within the standard do not further define in a meaningful fashion the minimally acceptable level of performance. In fact, the examples further render the standard vague since they present the same problem identified in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, namely, they appear to define unacceptable performance rather than minimally acceptable performance. For, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant's performance were proven to be unacceptable, that performance would meet the "partially met" [performance] standard because of the way the standard was written.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the agency can give content to performance standards by informing the employee of specific work requirements through written and oral instructions...the agency may not take a performance action based on an invalid standard....&#8197;We find, therefore, that the "partially met" performance standard for this critical element is invalid because it is impermissibly vague and appears to define unacceptable performance as minimally acceptable performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After the <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> decision from the Federal Circuit in 1985, some agencies continue to have problems with backwards standards. <span class="Italic">Jackson-Francis v. OGE</span>, 103 MSPR 183, 186-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11, 2006 MSPB 255 (2006), presents a more recent example of their inefficacious use:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To remove an employee for unacceptable performance under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43, the agency must prove, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant's performance standards are valid. <span class="Italic">Diprizio v. Department of Transportation</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 73, &#x00B6; 7 (2001). Absent valid performance standards, the Board cannot consider charged performance deficiencies. <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. Department of Justice</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 692, 695 (1991). Performance standards are not valid if they do not set forth the minimum level of performance that an employee must achieve to avoid removal for unacceptable performance under chapter 43. <span class="Italic">Eibel v. Department of the Navy</span>, 857 F.2d 1439, 1441-44 (Fed. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, because the agency could not remove the appellant under chapter 43 if she reached a "minimally successful" level of performance, we must examine whether that performance standard is valid. The "minimally successful" performance standard for the critical element "Develops Courses for Ethics Officials and Government Employees" states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Does not identify training needs of the targeted audiences. Fails to use principles of course design to develop performance-based training. Fails to develop training designed to enable ethics officials to determine whether ethics violations occurred and employees to determine if they violated any of the ethics prohibitions. Does not develop a project plan to monitor and track course development to ensure that projects are completed on time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this performance standard is an invalid "backwards" standard because, although it is written at the "minimally successful" level, it fails to inform the appellant of what is necessary to obtain an acceptable level of performance, and instead describes what she should not do. <span class="Italic">See Eibel</span>, 857 F.2d. at 1443-44; <span class="Italic">Romero v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 527, 534 n.5 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 22 F.3d 1104 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). Because the "minimally successful" standard does not define the minimal performance necessary for the appellant to remain employed in her position, the agency failed to distinguish between minimally acceptable and unacceptable performance as a practical matter. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 644, 650-51 (1991). The "minimally successful" performance standard would have to be entirely rewritten, not just fleshed out and clarified during counseling, to inform the appellant of what she needed to do to avoid removal under chapter 43. <span class="Italic">See Burnett v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 615, 617-18 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Eibel</span>, 857 F.2d at 1443).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, because the agency's "minimally successful" performance standard for the one critical element at issue in this case is not valid, the Board cannot consider the charged performance deficiencies. <span class="Italic">See Burnett</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 618. Accordingly, the agency's removal action must be reversed. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Juxtaposed with the Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> decision, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was that of Sidney Jackson. The <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> decision was consolidated with the <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> opinion, in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, 770 F.2d 1048 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Mr. Jackson was an EPA scientist whose job included writing reports of workshop meetings attended by state and local officials who issued environmental permits under agency regulations. Jackson's critical element was to do the following: "Concisely define information needed for developing comprehensive reports. Establish format for obtaining and presenting information. Identify all available information resources and coordinate information development with other program offices. Verify accuracy of information presented. As example, write, edit, and publish technical newsletter on relevant Agency and state permit assistance activities." The implementing performance standard required that "[d]raft reports are completed in a timely manner, address all relevant issues, and require minimum revisions. Information developed and reported is coordinated with other relevant program offices. Recognize, report and recommend solutions to potential problems." It was charged that Jackson's reports were often late and required extensive revisions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court sustained the performance standards, commenting in Jackson's case, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1055-56:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The performance standard relating to Jackson's preparation of reports requires that they be completed in a timely manner, that they address all relevant issues, and that they require minimum revisions. These are sufficiently objective and precise in the sense that most people will understand what they mean and what they require--and Jackson could adequately determine (in the words of the presiding official) "whether the standard [was] attained and exceeded." Jackson correctly notes that this standard allows for some subjective judgment on the part of his evaluators. This is particularly true of the portion prohibiting more than minimal revisions. But we cannot conclude, as does Jackson, that this is <span class="Italic">per se</span> a fatal flaw in the standard. Jackson's position required that he write reports as a professional: to argue that he should be judged in a purely mechanical way, as by the number of pages he wrote (or the bare number of errors committed, as if all errors were equal), is absurd. As the Board has recognized, some tasks may be rated only with a certain modicum of subjective judgment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Siegelman</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at p. 29 ("[W]ork at appellant's level is not susceptible to the kind of mechanical judgment-free rating which she argues is required"). Congress recognized that these situations would exist when it provided in 5 USC 4302(b)(1) that the objectivity requirement must be met only "to the maximum extent feasible." The challenged standard as a whole strikes us as within the statute, adequately gauged and informative to Jackson, and readily attainable.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;It does not destroy the standard that some EPA employees testified at the Board hearing that they could have drawn up even more precise a standard. Congress did not mandate the most exact standard conceivable but left discretion to the agency so long as it created an "objective" and "adequate" standard to the maximum extent <span class="Italic">feasible</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, EPA did not base its action solely on the performance standard. The standard provided the initial impetus for placing Jackson on an individual development plan. At that point, EPA instructed him on precisely how he could achieve a satisfactory rating. The standard was thus fleshed out and implemented in detail....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The performance standard reasonably informed Jackson of what, how and when he was to write. When he failed to meet EPA's expectations, he was informed of the specific areas in which he needed improvement and of the specific tasks by which he could satisfy EPA's concerns. Jackson then knew very precisely the level of proficiency he would have to achieve to retain his position. When he failed to complete those tasks in a satisfactory manner, EPA could properly take action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What progress has been made concerning performance standards and critical elements? Although a report by OPM, "Issue Analysis: Effectiveness of the Performance Appraisal System for Non-Merit Pay Employees," issued in October of 1985, was generally favorable about agency implementation of Chapter 43, the rapporteur commented, at pp. 7-8:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We estimate that about 55 percent of performance plans in use, Government-wide, are deficient in some respect--either the elements or standards or both are deficient....&#8197;The biggest weakness of both elements and standards was lack of clarity; both tended to be expressed as vague generalities, and this was particularly true of standards. When elements are vague, telling whether the work expectations have been achieved is anyone's guess. When performance standards are vague, determining <span class="Italic">how</span> <span class="Italic">well</span> these expectations were achieved is equally subjective. Given this situation, a performance rating can not be tied to anything tangible. Since supervisors, no doubt, find it easier to praise employees than to criticize them, poor performance plans may open the door to inflated ratings. And inflated ratings are a concern because (1) the truly superior employees are lumped in with everyone else and (2) poor performance is not dealt with.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2895"></span>OPM's critique suggests that employees benefit from vague standards, but those whose appeals are lodged with the Board may disagree. Poor standards do not allow reasonable measurement of work. Given the deference that the Board pays to agency standards and the limited amount of evidence needed to support an adverse performance action, employees need standards that provide clear measures both to ensure acknowledgment of their achievements and to avoid unreasonable performance-based actions. The OPM report implied as much in later discussion, at p. 13:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of those few employees who got negative personnel actions (about 1%), we rated about 69 percent of their elements and 68 percent of their standards "Less than Satisfactory," compared to 37 and 42 percent for the employees who received positive actions. Poor performance plans, of course, do not cause negative personnel actions or poor performance. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that poor plans do not give poor or marginal performers the help they need to improve.</p>
