<h6 class="h6" id="sec8-23"><span class="space">iv.</span> Significance of Past Practice and Bargaining History</h6>
<p class="noindent">Past practice is implicated in the "covered by" doctrine in two ways: the practice itself may have become an element of the agreement or the pattern of dealings between the parties, and then a change arguably may be "covered by" the past practice; or the past practice may explain a contract provision to provide the context for evaluation of a "covered by" argument. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, OASAM and AFGE Local 2139</span>, 65 FLRA 677, 680-81 (2011), briefly alluded to the role of past practice under the "covered by" doctrine:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that, absent a reopener clause, parties are not permitted to demand mid-term bargaining over matters that are covered by an agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Labor, Wash., D.C.</span>, 60 FLRA 68, 72 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 47 FLRA 1004, 1013 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA I</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A subject for negotiation is covered by a collective bargaining agreement if the matter is expressly contained in the agreement.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See SSA I</span>, 47 FLRA at 1018. If the agreement does not expressly contain the matter, then the Authority will determine whether the subject is inseparably bound up with, and thus plainly an aspect of, a subject covered by the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Consideration of the parties' bargaining history is an "integral component" of determining whether the matter is inseparably bound up with, and thus plainly an aspect of, the subject covered by the agreement. <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv., Customs Mgt. Ctr., Miami, Fla.</span>, 56 FLRA 809, 814 (2000). Moreover, in ULP cases that turn on the meaning of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, the Authority has held that, where a judge's interpretation of the meaning of the parties' agreement is challenged, it will determine whether the judge's interpretation is supported by the record and by the standards and principles applied by arbitrators and the federal courts. <span class="Italic">IRS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 47 FLRA 1091, 1110-11 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the Respondent is correct that a past practice is incorporated into the parties' agreement, Exceptions at 13 (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2128</span>, 58 FLRA 519, 523 (2003)), because we find that the Judge correctly determined that using the DLMS to resolve parking issues does not constitute a past practice, the Respondent's argument does not support its "covered by" defense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent also argues that the DLMS has been incorporated into the parties' agreement through Article 2, Section 1, which incorporates existing policies and regulations into the parties' agreement. The Judge found that the generalized language of Article 2, Section 1 is insufficient to incorporate the DLMS into the parties' agreement. We find that the Judge's decision is supported by the record. Article 2, Section 1 clearly refers to "the administration of <span class="Italic">all matters covered by this Agreement</span>...." Because, as discussed above, we reject the Respondent's argument that use of the DLMS to resolve parking issues constituted a past practice and no other provision in the parties' agreement covers this issue, Article 2, Section 1 does not apply to the instant matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we reject the Respondent's argument that the DLMS has been incorporated into the parties' agreement such that the matter was "covered by" the parties' agreement and deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">Bargaining history and practice under an agreement is probative of the scope of the agreement and negotiations leading to it, as in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Veterans Canteen Serv., Denver and AFGE Local 2241</span>, 52 FLRA 16, 23-26 (1996), involving a dispute over whether the "covered by" doctrine excused bargaining when management desired to install surveillance cameras in a cafeteria to monitor cashiers:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">SSA,</span> the Authority established a three prong approach for determining whether it should sustain a respondent's assertion that it has no duty to bargain based on the terms of an existing negotiated agreement. The Authority stated that, under the first prong, it looks to the express language of the provision of the agreement to determine whether it reasonably encompasses the subject in dispute. 47 FLRA at 1018. In this connection, an exact congruence of the language is not required. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Authority stated that, under the second prong, it determines whether the subject in dispute is "'inseparably bound up with and...thus [is] plainly an aspect of...a subject expressly covered by the contract.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">C &#x0026; S Industries, Inc.,</span> 158 NLRB 454, 459 (1966)) (citation omitted). In other words, the Authority determines whether the subject in dispute is "so commonly considered to be an aspect of" a subject set forth in a provision of a contract that negotiations over that subject are presumed foreclosed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Authority stated that the third prong applies in cases where it is difficult to determine whether the subject matter sought to be bargained is an aspect of matters already negotiated. In such cases, the Authority will give controlling weight to the parties' intent. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Navy Resale Activity,</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Station, Charleston, South Carolina,</span> 49 FLRA 994, 1002 (1994). In making these determinations, the Authority will, "examine all record evidence[,]" including the parties' bargaining history and prior agreements, to determine whether "the parties reasonably should have contemplated that the agreement would foreclose further bargaining in such instances." <span class="Italic">SSA,</span> 47 FLRA at 1019.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Examining the record evidence in this case, we conclude that it supports the Judge's finding that the matter in dispute is covered by the parties' agreement. In particular, both the parties' bargaining history and the practice under that agreement persuades us that the parties agreed that the Respondents could undertake under-cover investigations without providing advance notice to employees or the Union and without bargaining with the Union before undertaking such investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to bargaining history, the record demonstrates that under-cover investigations were discussed several times in the course of bargaining and that, after those discussions, proposals were tailored to accommodate the Respondents' concerns by permitting the Respondents to undertake such investigations without observing any contractual requirements. In commencing bargaining, the Union stated that it wanted "[m]anagement to advise [an] employee of his rights to representation prior to conducting an investigation. Subsequently, the Union offered eight proposals on the subject of investigations, which provided, among other things, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">management agrees to investigate any alleged misconduct in the following manner:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Employees shall be notified immediately when they are to be the subject of any investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Exhibit 6 further indicates that, during the discussion about the foregoing proposal, management took the position that employees would not be given advance notice of any investigations, to which the Union responded that there was:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">no intent to cover "under cover" situations with the language of [section 1]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the parties resumed bargaining, the proposals had been reformulated to eliminate advance notice to employees and dissemination of information before completion of an investigation as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Supervisors, employees and union representatives will not, except as specifically authorized, disclose any information about an investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">From Exhibit 6, we are persuaded, in agreement with the Judge, that the parties discussed under-cover investigations and bargained over the Union's proposal for advance notification of employees prior to the initiation of such investigations. The Union made concessions on the issue of whether all investigations were to be covered by certain proposals and explicitly clarified that advance notification, as proposed, would not be required in "under-cover" situations. Further, after management stated its concern about dissemination of information prior to the completion of an investigation, the proposals were re-formulated to eliminate unauthorized disclosure of "any information about an investigation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel offered no testimonial or documentary evidence contradicting or refuting Exhibit 6.&#x2003;Moreover, we find no other support for the General Counsel's bare assertion that the Union's intent, with regard to the above-mentioned discussions and proposals, was to reserve bargaining over these matters for local negotiations. In this connection, we find that the General Counsel's reliance on the dissenting opinion in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, 375th Combat Support Group, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois,</span> 49 FLRA 1444, 1455-57 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>), to support its claim that there was no reliable bargaining history evidence, is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Scott AFB,</span> no written bargaining history was submitted as evidence. Here, by contrast, Exhibit 6 was uncontradicted and unrefuted by any evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the parties' practice, we note that resolution of the complaint in this case involves a determination as to what the parties agreed to in negotiations for their master agreement. That is, the case involves "an interpretation of the contract at issue." <span class="Italic">NLRB v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 8 F.3d 832, 837 (D.C. Cir. 1993). As such, evidence of the practice under the agreement is probative. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United Steelworkers v. Warrior &#x0026; Gulf Navigation Co.,</span> 363 U.S. 574, 582 (1960) ("[T]he practices of the industry and the shop [are] equally a part of the collective bargaining agreement although not expressed in it."). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> Frank Elkouri &#x0026; Edna A. Elkouri, <span class="Italic">How Arbitration Works</span> 454 (4th ed. 1985) ("[c]ustom and past practice are used very frequently to establish the intent of contract provisions which are so ambiguous or so general as to be capable of different interpretations[.]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge concluded that the parties' "intent" in negotiating the master agreement was demonstrated by:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the long practice of the agency's use of covert cameras in conducting investigations for...twelve years under the Master Agreement...with notice of the investigation required, and/or given, only at the time the employee is questioned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1246"></span>We agree with the Judge.&#x2003;In particular, it is undisputed that covert surveillance has been undertaken in at least 19 separate Canteen Service locations since agreement was reached on the Master Agreement in 1982. It is also undisputed that this covert surveillance was undertaken without collective bargaining. The fact that this amount of covert surveillance has taken place without requests for bargaining supports our conclusion that, consistent with the bargaining history discussed above, the parties agreed that under-cover investigations were not to be constrained by advance notice or bargaining. Further, the General Counsel's reliance on the fact that the past practice cited by the Judge involved Veterans Affairs facilities other than the one in this case is unavailing. The collective bargaining agreement involved in this case is a national--not a local--agreement. As such, the practice at locations throughout the bargaining unit is relevant in determining the meaning of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Addressing the General Counsel's remaining arguments, the Judge stated that "the Master Agreement expressly covers the matter in dispute[.]" However, it is clear from the decision as a whole that the Judge's conclusion was based on the parties' bargaining history and past practice, and not on the express wording of Article 12. Further, we find no support for the General Counsel's claim that the Judge precluded bargaining over "all 'use of surveillance cameras.'" As discussed above, the complaint is limited to the Respondent's bargaining obligation regarding its installation and use of covert surveillance cameras in the course of an investigation and the Judge limited his decision to that subject. In addition, the General Counsel has offered no arguments or evidence to show that the Judge erred in finding that Article 23 did not apply in this case because it pertained only to technological changes in the performance of work. We also find that the Judge properly distinguished <span class="Italic">VA,</span> <span class="Italic">Nashville</span> from this case. As the Judge found, that case did not involve a claim that the subject was covered by the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that the Judge properly applied <span class="Italic">SSA</span> in finding that the subject matter of the installation and use of covert surveillance cameras in the course of an investigation is covered by Article 12 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Accordingly, we conclude that the Respondents had no obligation to provide notice and engage in impact and implementation bargaining when they installed the surveillance cameras for the investigative period involved in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VAMC, Denver</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU Chap. 143</span>, 55 FLRA 43, 46-47 (1998), considering bargaining history and determining that there was no waiver over bargaining about a switch from tape recording to video recording of employee interviews during investigations into allegations of employee misconduct:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge properly applied Authority precedent in reaching his conclusion that the matter in question is not "covered by" the parties' agreement. In <span class="Italic">VAMC, Denver,</span> the Authority restated its three-pronged test for determining whether a particular change in conditions of employment is "covered by" the existing collective bargaining agreement between the parties. First, the Authority looks to the "express language" of the agreement to ascertain whether it reasonably encompasses the subject in dispute. <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>47 FLRA at 1018. Next, the Authority looks to whether the subject in dispute is "inseparably bound up with...a subject expressly covered by the contract<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">C &#x0026; S Industries, Inc.</span>, 158 NLRB 454, 459 (1966)). If neither of these steps leads to the conclusion that further negotiations on the subject are foreclosed, the Authority proceeds to the third step of the analysis, which is to examine the parties' intent. <span class="Italic">Navy Resale Activity, Naval Station,</span> <span class="Italic">Charleston, South Carolina, </span>49 FLRA 994, 1002 (1994). In applying this three-pronged test, the Authority will examine all the record evidence, including the parties' bargaining history, to determine whether the parties knew or should have known that the agreement would preclude further negotiations regarding the disputed subject matter. <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>47 FLRA at 1019. <span class="Italic">See also,</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Washington, D.C., </span>51 FLRA 1274,1277 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Judge's conclusion that the express language of the parties' agreement does not address videotaping because "video" is not mentioned and the term "tape recording" covered only audio taping when the parties negotiated the provision in 1980. Moreover, we conclude that in the circumstances of this case, videotaping is not inseparably bound up with and plainly an aspect of audio tape recording. The technology and purposes of the two are different; the Agency had just acquired but had not used videotape equipment to record employee interviews even at the point that the parties re-negotiated their agreement in 1990; and, while not conclusive, the parties finally negotiated and tentatively agreed upon the use of videotape equipment for the first time in 1995.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the third prong of the <span class="Italic">VAMC, Denver </span>test, we have reviewed the Judge's findings concerning the parties' bargaining history and conclude, as did the Judge, that the parties did not contemplate videotaping when the provision relating to tape recording was added to the Agreement. The Judge's reliance upon a dictionary from the 1970's suggests that he wished to ascertain the meaning of the phrase "tape-recording" at the time that the parties introduced this language into their Agreement. For eleven years following the inclusion of the term "tape-recording," the Respondent did not possess video recording equipment; thus, that provision of the Agreement referred solely to audio recording. Moreover, although the Respondent did have video recording capability when the Agreement was renegotiated in 1991, there was no amendment to the Agreement indicating that the parties had changed the meaning of the reference to tape-recording. The Judge's factual finding in this regard is supported by a preponderance of the record evidence. <span class="Italic">See Air Force Materiel Command,</span> <span class="Italic">Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Robins Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Base, Georgia, </span>53 FLRA 1092, 1093 (1998) (Authority looks to whether "the Judge's factual findings and the record as a whole" support the Judge's conclusions). Our review of the record supports the Judge's determination. For this reason, we adopt the Judge's finding that the disputed matter was not "covered by" the Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 56 FLRA 906, 911-12 (2000), analyzed contract language and bargaining history as it explained the "covered by" doctrine applied to a request for impact bargaining concerning relocation of several employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has recently clarified its test to determine whether a matter subject to bargaining is "covered by" the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service, Customs Management Center, Miami, Florida,</span> 56 FLRA No. 136 (September 29, 1999). As such, the Authority will first determine whether the matter is expressly encompassed within an agreement provision, thus continuing analysis consistent with our recent prong I analysis. If the agreement provision does not expressly encompass the matter, the Authority moves to the next part of the analysis, prong II, to determine whether the matter sought to be bargained is inseparably bound up with, and thus plainly an aspect of a subject covered by the contract. The analysis, under prong II, will, as deemed necessary, include consideration of the parties' bargaining history or intent. As we explained in 56 FLRA No. 136 the "intent" portion of the examination of the record evidence is no longer a separate, independent criterion. Rather, it is an integral component of that part of the "covered by" analysis to determine whether the matter sought to be bargained is inseparably bound up with and thus is plainly an aspect of a subject covered by the contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In analyzing this matter under prong I, the ALJ specifically found that the local move in question was not a reassignment because it did not include either a change in POD or a change in position. This interpretation comports with NC-V's plain wording, including the definition of reassignment. Moreover, in interpreting this agreement the ALJ determined that the definition of the term reassignment was identically worded in the previous national agreement, and that under the previous agreement using this same definition, local moves were negotiated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, the ALJ's interpretation of Article 15 is supported by both the provision's plain wording and the parties' practice of negotiating local moves under identical language in their previous national agreement.[4] Accordingly, the Respondent's assertion that this matter is expressly contained in Article 15 lacks support. The Authority has previously held that "basic principles of contract interpretation presume that the parties understood the import of their agreement and that they had the intention which its terms manifest." <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 55 FLRA 374, 377 (1999). Therefore, the ALJ did not err by concluding that the type of move which took place here was not expressly addressed in the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The Authority has previously stated that in cases where the judge's interpretation of the meaning of the parties' collective bargaining agreement is challenged, the Authority will determine whether the judge's interpretation is supported by the record and by the standards and principles of interpreting collective bargaining agreements applied by arbitrators and the Federal courts. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Energy, Western Area</span> <span class="Italic">Power Administration, Golden, Colorado, </span>56 FLRA at 9, 12 n.7 (2000) (applied to "covered by" defense along with defense of "contract interpretation") citing <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service,</span> <span class="Italic">Washington, D.C., </span>47 FLRA 1091, 1111 (1993) (which only applied to the defense of contract interpretation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the second prong, Respondent argues that the ALJ should have found that local moves were inseparably bound up in Article 15, based on <span class="Italic">Scott, </span>49 FLRA at 1452-53.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, two employees were reassigned within the agency's commissary under a reduction-in-force (RIF) provision that required the Agency to attempt to avoid or minimize the effects of a RIF through a number of means including reassignment. The union asserted that the agency committed a ULP because it refused to negotiate the impact and implementation of the reassignments. Upon review, the Authority found that because the parties had specifically agreed that reassignments such as this may take place while failing to indicate in the contract language that these reassignments would face impact and implementation bargaining, the matter sought to be negotiated by the union was inseparably bound up with the parties' agreement. <span id="Page_1247"></span>Moreover, the Authority determined that under the circumstances the parties contemplated or should have contemplated that the provision would be interpreted as foreclosing further impact and implementation bargaining over these reassignments. As noted by the GC, the contract language in <span class="Italic">Scott </span>dealt precisely with the subject matter the union was attempting to negotiate. In contrast, in the instant case, Article 15 is limited to reassignments, which do not include the type of move that occurred here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, under our precedent, the subject matter in dispute must be more than "tangentially" related in order to satisfy prong II. <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore, </span>47 FLRA at 1019. The Authority stated that, "If the subject matter in dispute is only tangentially related to the provisions of the agreement and, on examination, we conclude that it was not a subject that should have been contemplated as within the intended scope of the provision, we will not find that it is covered by that provision<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. Upon review of this record, the Respondent has not shown that local moves, which are not reassignments, are "so commonly considered to be an aspect [of Article 15]...that the negotiations are presumed to have foreclosed further bargaining over the matter<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1018. This conclusion is supported by the previous practices of the parties under NC-IV in which they negotiated similar moves under the identical definition of reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, to the extent the parties' intent and bargaining history bear on the outcome in this matter, the ALJ acknowledged that "[t]here is no question that the Respondent sought, in negotiating NC-V, flexibility to move employee[s] and effectuate reorganizations," and that Article 15 was changed to allow the Respondent greater flexibility. However, the ALJ also observed that despite the Respondent's contentions, local negotiations over a similar local move took place under NC-V in Ogden, Utah. The ALJ further found the testimony of the Union negotiator credible. That testimony established that the negotiations concerning NC-V never dealt specifically with moves that did not involve either a change in POD or a change in an employee's position. Finally, the ALJ's decision is based squarely on the plain wording of Article 15. Accordingly, the bargaining history offered by the Respondent as proof that the parties intended Article 15 to cover local moves is unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent">Courts are not so readily inclined to consider bargaining history as a component of the "covered by" analysis.
