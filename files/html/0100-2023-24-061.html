<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-59"><span class="space">f.</span> Retroactivity</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Of retroactivity of statutes, <span class="Italic">Doyon v. United States</span>, 58 F.4th 1235, 1245 (Fed. Cir. 2023), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"A statute does not operate 'retrospectively' merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute's enactment." <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film Prods</span>., 511 U.S. 244, 265, 269 (1994). To determine whether a "statute should be applied to a case that originated before the statute was passed"--i.e., whether applying the statute would have improper "retroactive effect"--the question is "whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment." <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Peake</span>, 511 F.3d 1147, 1152-53 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (citing <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 269-70).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We typically examine three factors to determine whether a statute would have retroactive effect: "(1) whether it would impair rights possessed by a party when he acted, (2) whether it would increase a party's liability for past conduct, or (3) whether it would impose new duties with respect to already completed transactions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1153....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a decision interpreting a statute reducing the burden of proof in disciplinary cases against VA employees, the Federal Circuit declined to allow retroactive application of the legislation, <span class="Italic">Sayers v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200331098">954 F.3d 1370</a>, 1380-82 (Fed. Cir. 2020):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having addressed the disputed interpretation of &#x00A7; 714, we conclude that it cannot be applied to remove Dr. Sayers for the alleged misconduct without giving the statute impermissible retroactive effect. Generally, statutes apply only prospectively unless Congress expresses a "clear intent" that a provision should apply retroactively. <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film Prods</span>., 511 U.S. 244, 272-73 (1994). This default rule has certain exceptions, for example, if a statute amends only procedural rules. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 275. "The first step in the impermissible-retroactive-effect determination is to ascertain whether Congress has directed with the requisite clarity that the law be applied retrospectively." <span class="Italic">I.N.S. v. St. Cyr</span>, 533 U.S. 289, 291 (2001). Section 714 itself is silent on retroactivity. The VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act does not reveal any intent that &#x00A7; 714 apply retroactively. In fact, the Act's only references to when any of its provisions become effective relate to clawing back disciplined employees' bonuses or relocation expenses; these provisions become effective only prospectively. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 115-41, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 204-205, 131 Stat. 862, 875-77. The statute plainly lacks an "'unambiguous directive' or 'express command' that the statute is to be applied retroactively." <span class="Italic">Martin v. Hadix</span>, 527 U.S. 343, 354 (1999) (quoting <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 263, 280).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"If there is no congressional directive on the temporal reach of a statute, we determine whether the application of the statute to the conduct at issue would result in a retroactive effect." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 352. "If so, then... we presume that the statute does not apply to that conduct." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Supreme Court describes "retroactive effect" as "whether [a statute] would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed." <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 280. In other words, we make a "commonsense, functional judgment about 'whether the new [statute] attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment,'" making this judgment "informed and guided by 'familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations.'" <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 527 U.S. at 357-58 (quoting <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 270). If the statute attaches new legal consequences to events before its enactment (and is otherwise silent about its retroactivity), the statute must not apply to those prior events.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> recognized that "[t]he largest category of cases in which we have applied the presumption against statutory retroactivity has involved new provisions affecting contractual or property rights." 511 U.S. at 271. Dr. Sayers had a property right in his continued employment, <span class="Italic">see Stone v. F.D.I.C</span>., 179 F.3d 1368, 1374-75 (Fed. Cir. 1999), so &#x00A7; 714 falls within that category. By requiring the Board to apply the substantial evidence standard in reviewing the removal decision, instead of the preponderance standard normally required for misconduct removals under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c), and by preventing any mitigation of a penalty that substantial evidence supports, &#x00A7; 714 affects employees' substantive rights to relief from improper removal. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B) (setting forth the evidentiary standard for Board appeals of adverse actions not under chapter 43 to require "support[&#8197;] by a preponderance of the evidence"), <span class="Italic">with</span> &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(A)-(B) (applying the substantial evidence standard for Board appeals of &#x00A7; 714 adverse actions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a statute "change[s] standards of proof and persuasion in a way favorable to a State, the statute goes beyond 'mere' procedure to affect substantive entitlement to relief." <span class="Italic">Lindh v. Murphy</span>, 521 U.S. 320, 327 (1997); <span class="Italic">see also United States v. $814,254.76 in U.S. Currency, Contents of Valley Nat. Bank Account No. 1500-8339</span>, 51 F.3d 207, 212 (9th Cir. 1995) (holding a statute that "effectively permits the Government to achieve the identical results available under the criminal forfeiture statute, but with a lower standard of proof" to have impermissible retroactive effect if applied retrospectively). And the Supreme Court has held the loss of "reasonable reliance on the continued availability of discretionary relief" akin to penalty mitigation to have an impermissible retroactive effect. <span class="Italic">St. Cyr</span>, 533 U.S. at 324-25 ("There is a clear difference, for the purposes of retroactivity analysis, between facing possible [removal] and facing certain [removal]."). The imposition of a penalty supported only by substantial evidence, instead of preponderant evidence, with no possibility of mitigation for an error in judgment by the VA, rises to the level of substantive impact. Under &#x00A7; 714, Dr. Sayers can be held responsible for alleged misconduct even if his culpability for that misconduct goes against the weight of the evidence. He can be divested of his property right in continued employment even if that consequence goes against the weight of the evidence. He then loses any possibility of the Board giving him discretionary relief from the penalty imposed for that adverse action, even if he presents compelling reasons for such mitigation. Those changes in proof, persuasion, and the availability of discretionary penalty mitigation from the prior chapter 75 standard to the current &#x00A7; 714 procedure unquestionably diminish Dr. Sayers's property right in continued employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This retroactive effect occurs despite the VA's protestation that it did not propose Dr. Sayers's removal until after the passage of &#x00A7; 714. Section 714's impermissible retroactive effect on Dr. Sayers's substantive employment right is not eliminated by the prospective application of &#x00A7; 714's <span class="Italic">procedures</span>. Dr. Sayers had a right to the substantive civil service protections from improper or unjustified removal in effect at the time of his alleged misconduct. These protections were a condition of his employment, and they remained terms of his employment until Congress altered those conditions with the passage of &#x00A7; 714--at which point, Dr. Sayers had the chance to reconsider whether he would accept those terms to govern his employment going forward.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor can we agree with the VA's assertion that finding &#x00A7; 714 impermissibly retroactive gives Dr. Sayers "a vested right to engage in poor performance and misconduct yet retain his job." Such an argument overlooks that the VA always had the ability to remove Dr. Sayers for misconduct or poor performance. Likewise, the VA's arguments ignore that allegations of defective performance or misconduct may sometimes be incorrect or pretextual, and that the system of civil service protections exists in part to prevent the loss of employment due to such faulty allegations. Dr. Sayers is entitled to the legal protections in place during the period in which the alleged misconduct occurred because Congress did not provide a clear statement that it intended to modify retroactively VA employees' rights to those protections.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A few decisions from the Board include discussion of court cases analyzing retroactive of legislative changes affecting current appeals. Of retroactivity of legislative changes, <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 66 MSPR 68, 94-95 (1994), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 72 MSPR 369, 371 (1996), described how jurisdictional and procedural changes will likely be retroactive, while changes affecting the rights and obligations of parties will generally not be retroactive. At issue in <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> was the retroactivity of statutory amendments permitting the Board to mitigate penalties imposed by agencies in the course of adverse actions against SES members:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">... In 1991, however, Congress enacted the Senior Executive Service Improvement Act, Pub. L. 102-175, 105 Stat. 1222, which, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, amended 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b) to expressly provide the Board with such authority. The legislative history indicates that the explicit purpose of this provision was to "correct [the] anomaly" created by <span class="Italic">Berube</span> and authorize the Board to mitigate penalties in SES cases.... &#8197;The enacted bill did not contain a saving clause or any provision addressing whether the Act was intended to apply to cases pending at the Board when the Act became law. Nor does the legislative history address this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is a general presumption against retroactive application of a statute because such application may upset settled expectations and impose legal burdens or liabilities after the fact. <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film Products</span>, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 1496-97, 128 L. Ed.2d 229 (1994). In <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, the Supreme Court held that this presumption applied to certain provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (the compensatory and punitive damages provisions, as well as the related provision for a jury trial), and that these provisions therefore did not apply to cases that were pending when the Act was passed. The Court concluded that these provisions of the 1991 Act should not be applied retroactively because Congress had not spoken to the Act's retroactivity and the provisions would substantially increase the liability of employers for past conduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1505-08. <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> recognized, however, that retroactive application of statutes is proper in many situations, even absent specific legislative authorization<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1501. Statutes that "speak to the power of the court rather than to the rights or obligations of the parties," such as jurisdictional statutes, are routinely applied retroactively. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1502 (citation omitted). Statutes governing rules of procedure are also generally applied retroactively because they regulate secondary rather than primary conduct. <span class="Italic">E.g., Ex parte Collett</span>, 337 U.S. 55, 71, 69 S.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory provision at issue here, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(3), is similar to the type of provision that courts have applied retroactively. It speaks to the Board's adjudicatory powers rather than to the rights and obligations of the parties. <span class="Italic">See Republic Nat. Bank of Miami v. United States</span>, 113 S. Ct. 554, 556-57, 121 L. Ed.2d 474 (1992) (applying jurisdictional statute retroactively).

<p class="Body-Text">Addressing the retroactive effect of certain portions of the WPEA and applying <span class="Italic">Landgraf,</span> <span class="Italic">Day v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DAY_THOMAS_F_DC_1221_12_0528_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_CONCURRING_AND_DISSENTING_OPINION_836324.pdf">119 MSPR 589</a>, 593-96 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12, 2013 MSPB 49 (2013) (Member Robbins concurring in part and dissenting in part), concluded that, while Congress did not expressly provide that the terms of the WPEA would apply retroactively, the provisions at issue clarified rather than effected substantive changes to the existing law and could properly be applied to appeals pending before the WPEA's enactment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Congress Did Not Expressly Provide That the Terms of the WPEA Would Apply Retroactively to Conduct Occurring Before Its Enactment</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly found, the proper analytical framework for determining whether a new statute should be given retroactive effect was set forth by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>. <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> concerned the possible retroactive application of section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which provided the right to a jury trial and the right to recover compensatory and punitive damages for violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 247. At the outset of its discussion of that issue, the Court noted the tension between two established canons of statutory interpretation, i.e., the presumption against statutory retroactivity and the principle that courts should apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 263-64. In resolving that tension in the case before it, the Court identified the following process for determining whether to apply a new statute to pending cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When a case implicates a federal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the statute contains no such express command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed. If the statute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 280. While recognizing that, in many cases, "retroactive application of a new statute would vindicate its purpose more fully," the Court deemed that consideration insufficient to rebut the presumption against retroactivity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 285-86.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Congress intends for statutory language to apply retroactively, it is capable of doing so very clearly. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Presidio Components, Inc. v. American Technical Ceramics Corp</span>., 702 F.3d 1351, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (giving retroactive effect to amendments enacted in 2011 in light of express statutory language applying the amendments to "all cases, without exception, that are pending on, or commenced on or after, the date of the enactment of this Act"). Here, Congress did not expressly define the temporal reach of section 101 of the WPEA. Rather, it provided that, with the exception of provisions not at issue in this appeal, the WPEA would become effective 30 days after its enactment. WPEA &#x00A7; 202. "A statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date." <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 257. If anything, the fact that the effective date was 30 days after enactment suggests that retroactivity was not intended. <span class="Italic">See AT&#x0026;T Corp. v. Hulteen</span>, 556 U.S. 701, 713 (2009) (citing the fact that the relevant provisions of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act took effect 180 days after enactment as evidence that those provisions were not intended to have retroactive effect).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recognizing that Congress did not provide that the WPEA be retroactively applied--despite clear discussion in the legislative history for the Act to be applied to pending cases [4] --we must determine, under <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, whether the WPEA impairs the parties' respective rights, increases a party's liability for past conduct, or imposes new duties with respect to past transactions. As discussed below, we find that section 101 does not have an impermissible retroactive effect under <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> because it does not alter the parties' respective liabilities as Congress initially contemplated in enacting the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The committee report accompanying the Senate bill that was eventually approved by both houses of Congress and signed into law by the President states in relevant part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The Committee expects and intends that the Act's provisions shall be applied in OSC, MSPB, and judicial proceedings initiated by or on behalf of a whistleblower and pending on or after that effective date. Such application is expected and appropriate because the legislation generally corrects erroneous decisions by the MSPB and the courts; removes and compensates for burdens that were wrongfully imposed on individual whistleblowers exercising their rights in the public interest; and improves the rules of administrative and judicial procedure and jurisdiction applicable to the vindication of whistleblowers' rights.</p>

Martin Gas Sales</span>, 979 F.2d 887, 890 (1st Cir. 1992).

United States</span>, 397 F.3d 1358, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (categorizing rules or applications of rules as "clarifications" or "changes" provides little insight into whether a retroactive effect under <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> would result in a particular case).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We decline to strictly follow <span class="Italic">Princess Cruises</span> with regard to retroactivity and clarification because it appears to be a minority approach among the courts of appeal. We have discretion to make <span id="Page_5240"></span>this determination because the WPEA has changed the rights to judicial review of whistleblowers to include other courts of appeal for a 2-year period. <span class="Italic">See</span> WPEA &#x00A7; 108. Therefore, we must determine the issue of retroactivity with the view that the appellant ultimately may seek review of this decision before any appropriate court of appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether a new law clarifies existing law, "[t]here is no bright-line test." <span class="Italic">Levy</span>, 544 F.3d at 506 (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v.

In this regard, we note that subsequent legislation declaring the intent of an earlier statute is entitled to great weight. <span class="Italic">See Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 395 U.S. 367, 380-81 (1969). In addition, other factors relevant in determining whether legislative enactment clarifies rather than effects a substantive change in existing law are the presence of ambiguity in the preceding statute and the extent to which the new law resolves the ambiguity and comports with both the prior statute and any prior administrative interpretation. <span class="Italic">Levy</span>, 544 F.3d at 507.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the statutory language of the WPEA does not contain any express language indicating congressional intent that the Act apply retroactively, it does explicitly provide that the purpose of the WPEA was to clarify the WPA. The preamble states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">An Act</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">To amend chapter 23 of title 5, United States Code, <span class="Italic">to clarify the disclosures of information protected from prohibited personnel practices</span>, require a statement in non-disclosure policies, forms and agreements that such policies, forms, and agreements conform with certain disclosure protections, provide certain authority for the Special Counsel, and other purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">WPEA pmbl. (emphasis added). Furthermore, the pertinent provision in this appeal is section 101 of the statute, which is entitled: "Sec. 101. CLARIFICATION OF DISCLOSURES COVERED." WPEA &#x00A7; 101. As such, there can be no doubt that Congress clearly intended to enact the WPEA as a "clarification" of the term "disclosure" in the WPA. Moreover, we find this language to be sufficiently clear as to rebut the agency's argument that, because the WPEA includes a delayed effective date, Congress could not have intended that the Act be applied to pending cases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Day</span> that, although the Whistleblower Protection Act is ambiguous as to the definition of a "disclosure," the WPEA resolved that ambiguity and the resolution is consistent with the text of the WPA, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DAY_THOMAS_F_DC_1221_12_0528_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_CONCURRING_AND_DISSENTING_OPINION_836324.pdf">119 MSPR 589</a>, 599-602 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-26, 2013 MSPB 49:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The WPEA's Resolution of the Ambiguity Is Consistent With the Board's Interpretation of the WPA</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that section 101 of the WPEA broadens the definition of protected disclosures, creates new rights and liabilities for the parties, and is a substantive change in the law. Thus, the agency asserts that it creates a new class of whistleblowers and "shifts the ground under which all parties have been operating." The agency further argues that a new law is not automatically deemed to be clarifying simply because Congress enacted it to correct erroneous court decisions. (citing <span class="Italic">Lytes v. DC Water &#x0026; Sewer Authority</span>, 572 F.3d 936, 939, 941-42 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), which was designed to "reinstate a broad scope of protection" under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and to "reject" the holdings of two Supreme Court decisions interpreting the ADA, was subject to the presumption against retroactivity because it broadened the class of employees entitled to reasonable accommodation (quoting ADAAA &#x00A7; 2(b)(1), Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553, 3554)).[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;We find that the holding in <span class="Italic">Lytes</span> is not applicable to this case because, when Congress enacted the ADAAA, it sought to re-define legal issues that had been resolved by several Supreme Court decisions. It is well-recognized that decisions by the Supreme Court on a legal issue must be deemed the final word on the matter. Thus, whenever Congress seeks to overturn the Supreme Court's construction of a statute, the principle of clarification will not be applicable because amending law is attempting to alter settled law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not explicitly argued in its brief, the agency's arguments are predicated upon the principle that the presumption against retroactivity exists to protect settled expectations of law and that, while clarification may be applied to resolve an ambiguity in existing law, it may not alter settled law. <span class="Italic">See Cookeville Regional Medical Center</span>, 531 F.3d at 847-49. The issues are, therefore, whether the restricted definition of "disclosure" adopted in <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> had the force of settled law and whether the WPEA's clarification of what constitutes a "disclosure" is consistent with the Board's interpretation of the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While this is a close issue, we find that section 101 of the WPEA is not a substantive change in the law, and it does not otherwise alter settled law. Prior to the enactment of the WPEA, the Federal Circuit was the sole reviewing court for IRA appeals under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1221, 7703. As a result, the Board was obligated to consider the <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> decision to be controlling under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">stare decisis</span>. <span class="Italic">See LaBerge v. Department of the Navy</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 585, 590-91 (2002) (Slavet, concurring). In her concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">LaBerge</span>, Member Slavet stated that, while she recognized that <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> commanded a different result, in her view, both the language and the purpose of the WPA warranted finding that the appellant's disclosures were protected under the statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 591.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, as noted above, the Board has on numerous occasions distinguished its jurisprudence from the Federal Circuit's constricted reading of the WPA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stiles</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 263, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11; <span class="Italic">Askew</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 674, &#x00B6; 22.

Department of Transportation</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (2012) (<span class="Italic">Huffman</span> exclusion of disclosures made through "normal duty channels" was narrowed by finding that the appellant's disclosures to her fourth- or fifth-level supervisor may have been protected if they were reported in a manner that did not follow the typical customs and practices for reporting information in the workplace); <span class="Italic">Cassidy v. Department of Justice</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 74, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2012) (<span class="Italic">Huffman</span> exclusion of disclosures made within "normal course of duties" questioned when the alleged disclosures were complaints made to an official in another federal agency); <span class="Italic">Ontivero v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency contends that it reasonably relied upon <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, we cannot conclude that that decision's narrow definition of "disclosure" had the force of settled law. Rather, the Board's case law shows that rigid application of <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> has been scrutinized and rejected by the Board, often based upon facts and circumstances that would not have been readily apparent to agency management when it allegedly took a retaliatory action against the employee. Therefore, we view it as unlikely that an agency would have acted differently if it had known that it would need to defend its actions based upon the broader definition of "disclosure" followed by the court in <span class="Italic">Marano</span> and <span class="Italic">Watson</span> and adopted in section 101 of the WPEA. In addition, given the Board's decisions distinguishing and narrowing <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, the agency cannot show that the application of the Board's broader definition of "disclosure" was unforeseeable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More importantly, the WPEA's clarification of "disclosure" is consistent with the Board's interpretation of the term. <span class="Italic">See Garrett v. Department of Defense</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 666, 671 (1994) (finding that the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) does not exclude disclosures made by employees as part of the performance of their duties).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It should be noted that the Supreme Court has stated that <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference requires a federal court to defer to an agency's construction of a statute, even if it differs from what the court believes is the best interpretation of the statute, if the statute is within the agency's jurisdiction to administer, and the agency's construction of the statute is reasonable. <span class="Italic">See National Cable &#x0026; Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Service</span>, 545 U.S. 967, 980 (2005). The Court further held that "a court's interpretation of a statute trumps an agency's under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">stare decisis</span>... only if the relevant court decision held the statute unambiguous." 544 U.S. at 984 (citation omitted); <span class="Italic">see City of Arlington v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 133 S. Ct. 1863, 185 L. Ed. 2d 941, 957-58 (2013) (an agency's interpretation of its jurisdiction under a statute is entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference). In addition, the Court has held that it is within an agency's discretion to determine whether it will announce its interpretation of a statute that it implements through either rulemaking or adjudication. <span class="Italic">See National Labor Relations Board v. Bell Aerospace Co., Division of Textron, Inc</span>., 416 U.S. 267, 294 (1974) (affording deference to the agency's interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act through adjudication rather formal rulemaking). Therefore, we hold that section 101 of the WPEA did not alter a matter of settled expectation and that we may apply the principle of clarification to adopt in pending cases the WPEA's refinement of the term "disclosure."</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">I concur with the majority opinion insofar as it finds that Congress did not expressly provide that the terms of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA) would apply retroactively to conduct occurring before its enactment. I respectfully dissent from the majority's determination that applying section 101 of the WPEA to pending cases does not have an impermissible retroactive effect under <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film Products</span>, 511 U.S. 244 (1994), because it does not alter the parties' respective liabilities as Congress initially contemplated in enacting the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA).

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The "Clarification Doctrine" Cannot Properly Be Applied in This Case Because It Has Been Rejected by the Board's Reviewing Court</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority's determination that the provisions of section 101 of the WPEA, governing which disclosures are protected, may be applied to cases pending when the WPEA became effective is premised on two separate legal conclusions: (1) that the clarification doctrine discussed in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the majority opinion applies to this case, i.e., the WPEA merely clarified what had been ambiguous and unsettled law as to the meaning of the WPA prior to the enactment of the WPEA, and, when legislation clarifies existing law, its application to preenactment conduct does not raise retroactivity concerns; and (2) that the Board is not required to follow as binding precedent the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Princess Cruises, Inc. v. United States</span>, 397 F.3d 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Even if I were prepared to accept the first proposition, I cannot accept the second.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Princess Cruises</span>, the Federal Circuit unambiguously and unreservedly rejected the clarification doctrine on which the majority relies:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We find the binary analysis--change or clarification--advanced by the government largely unhelpful. Merely categorizing rules or applications of rules as "clarifications" or "changes" provides little insight into whether a retroactive effect would result in a particular case. As noted by the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, a clarification, in fact, "changes the legal landscape," because "a precise interpretation is not the same as a range of possible interpretations." <span class="Italic">Health Ins. Ass'n of Am., Inc. v. Shalala</span>, 23 F.3d 412, 423-24 (D.C. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">McCoy</span>, 270 F.3d at 509 (noting that the <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> factors must be applied because "almost every new statute results in some perceptible effect or impact on countless past or pre-existing choices, decisions, and interests of the actors and subjects in the newly-regulated field").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Further, the bright-line, binary test espoused by the government conflicts with the court's obligation to weigh the various factors described in <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>. Indeed, <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> explicitly requires the court to consider "the <span class="Italic">nature and extent</span> of the change in the law," not merely whether a change has occurred. 511 U.S. at 270, (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">397 F.3d at 1363.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the majority acknowledges that the Federal Circuit has rejected the clarification doctrine, it "decline[s] " to follow <span class="Italic">Princess Cruises</span> on the ground that it "appears to be a minority approach among the courts of appeal" that is not binding legal authority for the Board because the "WPEA has changed the rights to judicial review of whistleblowers to include other courts of appeal for a 2-year period." Majority Opinion &#x00B6; 11 n.5. Even if I were to agree that Federal Circuit precedent is not binding authority for the Board as to the proper interpretation of the WPA as amended, the fact remains that the clarification doctrine is a legal doctrine of general applicability that is not in any respect tied to federal whistleblower law. The <span class="Italic">Princess Cruises</span> decision had nothing to do with such law; it dealt with the retroactivity of a change governing payments to the federal government related to port use. It has long been established that decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit are controlling authority for the Board, whereas other circuit courts' decisions are persuasive but not controlling authority. E.g., <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6; 12 (2009); <span class="Italic">Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 39, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Even if the WPEA created an exception to the binding character of Federal Circuit precedent, the exception would apply only to the proper construction of the WPA as amended. The clarification doctrine and the law governing whether statutes will be applied retroactively are general principles of law, not interpretations of federal whistleblower law. Accordingly, I conclude that the Federal Circuit's rejection of the clarification doctrine is fully binding on the Board, regardless of whether that court's position is a majority or a minority position among the federal circuit courts of appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if I were persuaded that the clarification doctrine is a reasonable one and that the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Princess Cruises</span> did not preclude the Board from adopting it, I believe the Supreme Court itself has rejected it. In <span class="Italic">Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc.</span>, 511 U.S. 298 (1994), issued the same day as <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, the Supreme Court addressed the possible retroactivity of a provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The Court assumed that the provision at issue in <span class="Italic">Rivers</span> "reflect[ed] Congressional disapproval" of a prior Court decision interpreting 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981 and that most members of Congress believed that the Court's prior decision represented a misinterpretation of section 1981. <span class="Italic">Rivers</span>, 511 U.S. at 306-07. Nevertheless, the Court determined that the new statutory language "create[d] liabilities that had no legal existence before the Act was passed" and thus did not apply to preenactment conduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 313. [*] Similarly, in the present case, even if we assume that Congress passed the relevant provisions of the WPEA in response to decisions that it believed had misinterpreted the WPA, the WPEA still creates liability where none existed under the WPA as that statute has been interpreted. Accordingly, I would find that section 101 of the WPEA would be retroactive if applied to pending cases and is therefore subject to the judicial presumption against retroactivity. <span class="Italic">See Lytes v. DC Water &#x0026; Sewer Authority</span>, 572 F.3d 936, 939, 941-42 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (finding that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Amendments Act of 2008, which was designed to "reinstate a broad scope of protection" under the ADA and to reject the holdings of two Supreme Court decisions interpreting the ADA, was subject to the presumption against retroactivity because it broadened the class of employees entitled to reasonable accommodation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;Legislative titles merely describing statutes or specific provisions therein as "clarifications" are not material to this analysis. The relevant factor is the actual impact of the provision at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the above reasons, I do not believe that the clarification doctrine can be properly invoked in this instance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Refer to <span class="Italic">Hooker v. VA</span>, 120 MSPR 629, 638-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15, 2014 MSPB 15 (2014), interpreting the WPEA IRA coverage of (b)(9)(B) and concluding that the WPEA amendment incorporating that section, in part, into (b)(8) was not applicable to cases pending on the effective date of the WPEA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Greiner</span>, CB-1216-08-0025-R-1 (NP 5/28/2013), declined to extend retroactivity to changes in the Hatch Act:</p>

The statute does not expressly provide that the amendment to &#x00A7; 1502(a)(3) will apply retroactively, and our review of the legislative history reveals no evidence of any such congressional intent. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 112-211 (2012); 158 Cong. Rec. H7320 (daily ed. Dec. 19, 2012). An examination of the statute's "effective date" provision gives further indication that Congress did not intend the amendment to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1502(a)(3) to be retroactive. Specifically, &#x00A7; 5(a) of the Act states that it will generally take effect 30 days after its enactment, but &#x00A7; 5(b) makes an exception for the amendment to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7326, prescribing limited retroactivity for that provision and that provision alone. It therefore appears that Congress deliberately treated the amendments to &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1502(a)(3) and 7326 differently, and we find that the absence of retroactivity language for the 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1502(a)(3) amendment was intentional.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Concerning the retroactivity of regulations, according to <span class="Italic">Love v. OPM</span>, 46 MSPR 641, 646-47 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether to give retroactive effect to an administrative regulation, an important consideration is whether the regulation is legislative or interpretative in nature. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit explained this distinction as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Strictly speaking, the question of retroactivity can arise only with respect to rules that are at least in part legislative in character. That is to say, to the extent a regulation merely interprets a statute, it in theory merely elucidates a meaning that has resided in the statute since its enactment. If an interpretative regulation merely clarifies what the language of the statute was intended to convey, it is ultimately misleading to term it retroactive. "It is no more retroactive in its operation than is a judicial determination construing and applying a statute to a case in hand."</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In promulgating section 831.1704(e), OPM appeared to indicate that it was merely clarifying a statutory prohibition, not enacting substantive rules:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">These regulations merely implement the statutory requirements. [Two] commenters suggested that it could be appropriate for the court to consider the termination of the marriage separate from the property division.

<p class="Block-Quote1">50 Fed. Reg. 48629 (Dec. 2, 1988) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative/interpretative distinction has been criticized, however, because few administrative rules are exclusively legislative or interpretative in nature. In <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 562 F.2d at 985 n.30, the court stated that, for purposes of determining retroactivity, the emphasis should instead be on whether the new regulation is consistent with prior law or policy. <span class="Italic">See also Heckler v.

The record in this case indicates that, even prior to promulgating the regulation at issue here, OPM interpreted 5 USC &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) as prohibiting the type of bifurcated divorce proceeding involved in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.1704(e), as promulgated effective January 3, 1989, is primarily interpretative in nature, and because it represents OPM's consistent interpretation of the requirements of 5 USC &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4), we find that it is applicable to the present appeal.... <span class="Italic">.</span> </p>
