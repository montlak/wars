<section>
<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-53"><span class="space">A.</span> PARTICULARIZED NEED</h3>
<p class="noindent">The statute, 5 USC 7114(b) does not establish a particularized need test:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;The duty of an agency and an exclusive representative to negotiate in good faith under subsection (a) of this section shall include the obligation--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(4)&#x2003;in the case of an agency, to furnish to the exclusive representative involved, or its authorized representative, upon request and, to the extent not prohibited by law, data--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;which is normally maintained by the agency in the regular course of business;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;which is reasonably available and necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;which does not constitute guidance, advice, counsel, or training provided for management officials or supervisors, relating to collective bargaining[.]</p>
<p class="noindent">The requirement of a "particularized need" was injected into the statute by <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, <a href="http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/952/523/367741/">952 F.2d 523</a>, 532 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (joined with a case involving the Park Service), establishing a general requirement concerning information requests, while limiting the exemption under 5 USC 7114(b)(4)(C) to only covered material relating to collective bargaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We uphold the FLRA's construction of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C). In suggesting that the subsection exempts all information relating to guidance, advice, counsel or training, petitioners render meaningless the phrase "relating to collective bargaining" in &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C). The plain terms of the statute indicate that Congress did not intend a blanket exemption for all such information. Even if the statute is arguably ambiguous, however, the FLRA's interpretation is reasonable and thus entitled to deference</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Information on "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training" for management officials that is not covered by the FLRA's construction of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) must be disclosed under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) if the information is "necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining." However, in construing subsection (b)(4)(B), the FLRA erred in failing to recognize that "necessary" is not the same as "relevant." Agencies have an important interest in deliberating over employee actions; thus, this interest cannot be ignored in the application of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B). In any case in which information is sought under subsection (b)(4)(B), there must be a particularized showing of need for information on "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training" provided for management officials if such information is not otherwise exempt under subsection (b)(4)(C). Because the FLRA failed to give full consideration to the limiting language of subsection (b)(4)(B), we remand for further consideration of this point.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand from the D.C. Circuit, FLRA adopted the <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span> decision. The case before FLRA dealt with disciplinary recommendations. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Park Serv., Nat'l Capital Region, Park Police and Police Ass'n of DC</span>, 48 FLRA 1151 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">To demonstrate a particularized need, the union must explain to management what information it desires and how that information may reasonably relate to an objective within the union's charter under statute or its collective bargaining responsibilities, including contract enforcement. There are no magic words. What can be described through FLRA's decisions are situations leading to a determination that a particularized need has or has not been established. Because the "particularized need" test lacks a clear definition capable of straightforward bureaucratic interpretation and application, there are many disputes over the interpretation and application of particularized need showings. However summarizing, <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU Chap. 66</span>, 50 FLRA 661, 665-71 (1995) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>), <span class="Italic">post</span>, provided a checklist:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;a union requesting information under that section must establish a particularized need for the information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs the requested information, including the uses by the union for the information and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute;</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that a union establishes a particularized need where the union states that it needs information: (1) to assess whether to file a grievance;[36] (2) in connection with a pending grievance;[37] (3) to determine how to support and pursue a grievance;[38] or (4) to assess whether to arbitrate or settle a pending grievance.[39] The Authority has emphasized that such information is necessary because arbitration can function properly only when the grievance procedures leading to it are able to sift out unmeritorious grievances.[40]</p>

reviewed and affirmed prior analysis from the D.C. Circuit, but the
decision emphasized that FLRA (and the parties) must consider the agency's interests in not disclosing requested information:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is the latest in a series of attempts by federal employee unions to gain access to agency crediting plans.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. United States Customs Serv</span>., 802 F.2d 525, 531 (D.C. Cir. 1986), the union attempted to obtain Customs Service crediting plans under the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552 (1988). This Court held that the crediting plans were exempt from disclosure because they "related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency." <span id="Page_294"></span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(2) (1988). The Court explained that "advance knowledge of the plans by applicants would allow and induce at least some of them to embellish--or perhaps even fabricate--their backgrounds to suit the appropriate crediting plan." 802 F.2d at 529. The Eleventh Circuit reached the same result in <span class="Italic">Kaganove v. EPA</span>, 856 F.2d 884, 886-90 (7th Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 488 U.S. 1011, 109 S. Ct. 798, 102 L. Ed.2d 789 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the proceedings we now review, federal employee unions seek access to crediting plans under the FSLMRS, which requires a federal agency to disclose information "necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B). The issue before us is the meaning and application of this necessity requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA held that the unions needed access to the crediting plans in order to determine whether a disappointed employee has a grievable grievance against the agency.&#x2003;In assessing the unions' need, the FLRA applied a broad standard, focusing upon the relevance of the information sought. <span class="Italic">See Allenwood</span>, 40 F.L.R.A. No. 42, at 10. Under this standard a union satisfies the necessity requirement of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) if the data sought "would be useful to the Union in the investigation and/or presentation of a potential grievance." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Serv., Border Patrol, El Paso, Texas</span>, 37 F.L.R.A. 1310, 1320 (1990) (emphasis added). The FLRA urges that its application of the broad standard is appropriate because crediting plans are the "Rosetta stone," without which "[a] union could not hope to make an intelligent decision as to whether a selection action was properly conducted by management."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's interpretation of "necessity" is inconsistent with this Court's decisions in two cases decided since the FLRA rulings in these cases. In <span class="Italic">Department of Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 956 F.2d 1223, 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), and <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 523, 532 (D.C. Cir. 1992), we made clear that &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) requires a union to demonstrate a "particularized need" for information it seeks. In evaluating whether a union has satisfied this standard, the Authority must consider 1) the union's particularized need for the requested information sought, <span class="Italic">see NLRB</span>, 952 F.2d at 532 (the particularized need standard may well be met "where the union has a grievable complaint covering the information" (emphasis in original)); <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, 956 F.2d at 1225 (same), and 2) the countervailing anti-disclosure interests of the agency, <span class="Italic">see NLRB</span>, 952 F.2d at 531 ("[a] Statute that requires 'necessity' implicitly recognizes countervailing interests, because a 'need,' by definition, is an interest of particular strength and urgency."); <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, 956 F.2d at 1224 ("The Authority should have considered countervailing interests against disclosure, and because it did not do so we remand for reconsideration.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA argues first, that the "particularized need" analysis should not be applied to the crediting plans here at issue; and second, that even under the "particularized need" test, the Authority correctly ordered disclosure of the crediting plans. We find both of these arguments to be without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The argument that the "particularized need" test should not apply here relies on the proposition that "Authority analysis of union need for data in the grievance setting has generally focused only on whether the data would be useful to the union in grievance investigation or presentation." The FLRA urges that "considerations such as the employers' countervailing interests against disclosure need not be considered in resolving these cases." This argument is a non-starter. We rejected this theory, advanced under the rubric of a relevance test, in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA attempts to distinguish the information sought in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span> as "predecisional, deliberative management memos...and employee disciplinary records," whereas the information contained in the crediting plans are "objective, non-personal data." From this the FLRA concludes that "[t]he unions' data requests in these cases therefore should not be judged by the stringent standards set by this Court's 'particularized need' analysis in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and [<span class="Italic">Air Force</span>]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This argument avails the Authority nothing. The FSLMRS does not distinguish between "predecisional, deliberative" data and "objective, non-personal data." The necessity requirement stipulated in section 7114(b)(4)(B) is unitary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's second response to <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span> is a half-hearted insistence that even under a "particularized need" analysis, the Authority correctly ordered disclosure of the crediting plans. The FLRA argues it balanced the agencies' interests in nondisclosure against the unions' need for the crediting plans and reminds us that it is entitled to deference in balancing the competing interests at issue. <span class="Italic">See Beth Israel Hosp. v. NLRB</span>, 437 U.S. 483, 501, 98 S. Ct. 2463, 2473, 57 L. Ed.2d 370 (1978) (striking the balance between conflicting legitimate interests under the national labor laws is "'often a difficult and delicate responsibility, which the Congress committed primarily to the National Labor Relations Board, subject to limited judicial review'") (quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local Union No. 449</span>, 353 U.S. 87, 96, 77 S. Ct. 643, 648, 1 L. Ed.2d 676 (1957)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While mindful of the deference we owe federal agencies in applying statutes they administer, <span class="Italic">see Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984), we are constrained to conclude that the FLRA's decisions do not pass muster under the necessity requirement of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B), as clarified by this Court in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>. In each of these cases, the FLRA entirely failed to consider whether the union had a particularized need, comparable to the potentially grievable complaints considered in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>. In <span class="Italic">Allenwood</span>, the Authority merely stated that "the [agency's] assertion that the grievance was nongrievable did not relieve [it] of its obligation to furnish" the information. 40 F.L.R.A. No. 42, at 10. The reasoning of the ALJs in the two HUD cases, which the Authority adopted without analysis, is similarly spare.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These conclusory assertions plainly do not satisfy the requirement that the FLRA weigh the particularized need of the union for the information against the agency's interest in withholding it before ordering disclosure of a crediting plan. <span class="Italic">See NLRB</span>, 952 F.2d at 531-32. On other occasions, the Authority itself has recognized that under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) "a union's mere assertion that it needs data to process a grievance does not automatically oblige the agency to supply such data." <span class="Italic">See United States Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n, Washington, D.C</span>., 20 F.L.R.A. 357, 357-58 (1985). While it is true that &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) does not require a union actually to file a grievance before it seeks information pursuant to the FSLMRS, <span class="Italic">see American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1345 v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 1360, 1364 (D.C. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span> make clear that a union is required to articulate some particularized need for the information sought.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This conclusion is neither novel nor unique to the federal context.&#x2003;Even in the private sector-where disclosure is governed by the less stringent relevance standard-a union is not entitled to information absent "some initial, but not overwhelming, demonstration by the union that some violation is or has been taking place." <span class="Italic">San Diego Newspaper Guild, Local No. 95 v. NLRB</span>, 548 F.2d 863, 869 (9th Cir. 1977); <span class="Italic">see also Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB</span>, 440 U.S. 301, 314, 99 S. Ct. 1123, 1131, 59 L. Ed.2d 333 (1979) ("A union's bare assertion that it needs information to process a grievance does not automatically oblige the employer to supply all the information in the manner requested"); <span class="Italic">NLRB v. George Koch Sons, Inc.</span>, 950 F.2d 1324, 1332 (7th Cir. 1991) (collecting courts of appeals decisions that require a union to establish a reasonable basis for suspecting that information sought will aid the union in performing its representational duties).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA also impermissibly minimized or disregarded the important anti-disclosure interests of the agencies. In <span class="Italic">Allenwood</span>, the FLRA dismissed the agency's concerns by noting that the selection process had been completed and that the union had not indicated that it would use the crediting plan for any purpose other than to process the possible grievance. <span class="Italic">Allenwood</span>, 40 F.L.R.A. No. 42, at 10, J.A. at 13. In the two HUD cases, the Authority simply adopted thinly reasoned findings of its ALJs, which dismissed the agencies' countervailing interests solely on the fact that the selection process had terminated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Allenwood</span> the FLRA appeared to suggest that the union would not allow the crediting plan to leak out, <span class="Italic">see</span> 40 F.L.R.A. No. 42, at 10, but the union certainly made no guarantees in that case, and neither the ALJs nor the Authority said anything about this matter in either of the other two cases under review. Contrary to respondents' wish, the possibility of union misuse of the information must be of concern to the FLRA. <span class="Italic">See Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB</span>, 440 U.S. 301, 315, 99 S. Ct. 1123, 1131, 59 L. Ed.2d 333 (1979) (holding that NLRB abused its discretion in requiring employer to release to union certain employee aptitude tests used to screen job applicants, in part because the "remedy selected by the Board does not adequately protect the security of the tests"). In response to earlier attempts to gain access to crediting plans under FOIA, this and other courts have explicitly recognized agencies' interests in the confidentiality of crediting plans. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union v. United States Customs Serv</span>., 802 F.2d 525, 531 (D.C. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see also Kaganove v. EPA</span>, 856 F.2d 884, 886-90 (7th Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 488 U.S. 1011, 109 S. Ct. 798, 102 L. Ed.2d 789 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA maintains that the agencies' legitimate concerns about the harm of disclosure in the FOIA cases are simply not present in these cases because the personnel decisions at issue are complete. This argument is not only inadequate, but disingenuous. As the agencies point out, crediting plans are often re-used. In any event, if a union was successful in its unfair labor practice complaint, another job search to fill the job at issue would be required, presumably utilizing the same crediting plan, the contents of which would be known to the union. Thus, the mere fact that the challenged selection process has been completed does not eliminate or reduce agencies' interest in maintaining the confidentiality of their crediting plans.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(b)(4)(B), as explained in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, requires the FLRA to determine whether a union has demonstrated a particularized need for the information sought. This mandates an inquiry into whether the union has a particularized need for the information, and whether the union's need is outweighed by the agency's countervailing interest in <span id="Page_295"></span>keeping the crediting plans confidential. In these cases the FLRA applied a less demanding test, based solely upon the usefulness or relevance of the requested information to the union, and failed adequately to assess either the particularized need for access to the crediting plans or the countervailing agency interest. Thus, we grant the petitions for review and remand these cases so the FLRA can ascertain the necessity of the requested crediting plans in accordance with the Statute, as construed in <span class="Italic">Air Force</span> and <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Accepting the reasoning of the D.C. Circuit decisions, <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU Chap. 66</span>, 50 FLRA 661, 669-71 (1995) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>), explained the analysis FLRA would follow: an unfair labor practice will be found if a union has established a particularized need for the requested information and either: (1) the agency has not established a countervailing interest; or (2) the agency has established that interest but it does not outweigh the union's demonstration of particularized need:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We hold that, in determining whether and how requested information must be disclosed under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, we will consider both parties' interests consistent with the aforementioned judicial decisions construing section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute and private sector labor law. Specifically, a union requesting information under that section must establish a particularized need for the information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs the requested information, including the uses to which the union will put the information and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute.[11] The requirement that a union establish such need will not be satisfied merely by showing that requested information is or would be relevant or useful to a union.[12] Instead, a union must establish that requested information is "required in order for the union adequately to represent its members." <span class="Italic">Justice v. FLRA</span>, 991 F.2d at 290.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11] To avoid further confusion, see note 8, we use the term "particularized need" here, consistent with its use in <span class="Italic">VA v. FLRA</span> and <span class="Italic">Allenwood Prison Camp v. FLRA</span>, to describe the union's showing rather than a heightened level of need required for certain documents.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12] We note that, under Executive Order 11491, an agency was required to provide a union with requested information that was "necessary and relevant." E.g., <span class="Italic">Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service</span>, 7 A/SLMR 800 (1977). The Statute does not contain a reference to relevance. <span class="Italic">See also Justice v. FLRA</span>, 991 F.2d at 290 ("There is a significant qualitative and quantitative difference between information that is relevant and information that is necessary. Information that is only relevant may be useful, but it does not fall under the category of necessary."); <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d at 531 (Section 7114(b)(4) "entitles the union to 'necessary,' not to 'relevant' information, i.e., something less than what full 'discovery' might require.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union is responsible for articulating and explaining its interests in disclosure of the information.&#x2003;Satisfying this burden requires more than a conclusory or bare assertion. Among other things, a request for information must be sufficient to permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether information must be disclosed under the Statute.[13]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13] However, a request need not be so specific as, for example, to require a union to reveal its strategies or compromise the identity of potential grievants who wish anonymity. <span class="Italic">See, for example, NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d at 530 ("Necessarily, the bargainers are not obliged to reveal their strategies[.]"); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. FLRA</span>, 811 F.2d 769, 774 (2d Cir. 1987) (court acknowledged that protecting the identity of potential grievants is a justifiable union consideration). Moreover, the degree of specificity required of a union must take into account the fact that, in many cases, including the one now before us, a union will not be aware of the contents of a requested document.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Park Service</span>, the Authority accepted the D.C. Circuit's view, <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d at 532, that an agency has presumptive anti-disclosure interests in intramanagement guidance documents. <span class="Italic">National Park Service</span>, 48 FLRA at 1160. We agree with the General Counsel that this presumption should not extend to other types of documents because we find no statutory basis for doing so. An agency denying a request for information under section 7114(b)(4) must assert and establish any countervailing anti-disclosure interests. Like a union, an agency may not satisfy its burden by making conclusory or bare assertions; its burden extends beyond simply saying "no."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that applying a standard which requires parties to articulate and exchange their respective interests in disclosing information serves several important purposes.&#x2003;It "facilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes..." and, thereby, effectuates the purposes and policies of the Statute. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1)(C). It also facilitates the exchange of information, with the result that both parties' abilities to effectively and timely discharge their collective bargaining responsibilities under the Statute are enhanced. In addition, it permits the parties to consider and, as appropriate, accommodate their respective interests and attempt to reach agreement on the extent to which requested information is disclosed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where parties are unable to agree on whether or to what extent requested information must be provided, an unfair labor practice will be found if a union has established a particularized need, as defined herein, for the requested information and either: (1) the agency has not established a countervailing interest; or (2) the agency has established such an interest but it does not outweigh the union's demonstration of particularized need. We expect the parties to consider, as we will in determining whether and/or how disclosure is required, alternative forms or means of disclosure that may satisfy both a union's information needs and an agency's interests in information. <span class="Italic">Cf. Detroit Edison</span>, 440 U.S. at 301 (Court concluded that employer's "willingness to disclose" requested information in manner other than that requested by the union "satisfied its statutory obligations."). Moreover, we emphasize that considering the agency's countervailing interests in this way is not intended to impose an insurmountable burden on a party requesting information.[14]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14] In <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, the court held that documents "that are strictly 'intramanagement' normally will not be discoverable" under section 7114(b)(4). 952 F.2d at 533 n.6. However, the court set forth two examples of instances where a union could establish that even management guidance, advice, counsel, or training was necessary, within the meaning of the Statute. In particular, the court held that a union may establish such necessity "where the union has a grievable complaint covering the information[&#8197;]" and/or where "the disputed document creates a grievable action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 532, 533 (emphasis omitted). The court noted that documents encompassed by the examples would not be "strictly 'intramanagement'...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 533 n.7. In <span class="Italic">National Park Service</span>, 48 FLRA at 1165 n.13, the Authority found it unnecessary to address what bases other than the two examples offered by the court might support a finding that intramanagement guidance documents are necessary.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, an agency must furnish information to a union, upon request and "to the extent not prohibited by law," if, as relevant here, the requested information is "necessary for full and proper <span id="Page_296"></span>discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining[.]"[8] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4). To demonstrate that requested information is "necessary" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4), a union must establish a particularized need for the information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs the requested information, including the uses to which the union will put the information, and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute. <span class="Italic">IRS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 50 FLRA 661, 669 (1995) (Member Talkin concurring) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>).

<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The requested information also must be: (1) normally maintained by the agency in the regular course of business; (2) reasonably available; and (3) not guidance, advice, counsel, or training provided for management officials or supervisors, relating to collective bargaining. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4). These requirements are not in dispute here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency is responsible for establishing any countervailing, anti-disclosure interests and must do so in more than a conclusory way. <span class="Italic">E.g., SSA, </span>64 FLRA 293, 295-96 (2009). Such interests must be raised at or near the time of the union's request. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 296.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that unions established a particularized need for requested information when the unions needed the information: (1) to assess whether to file a grievance, <span class="Italic">U.S. DOT, FAA, New England Region, Bradley Air Traffic Control Tower, Windsor Locks, Conn., </span>51 FLRA 1054, 1068 (1996); (2) in connection with a pending grievance,<span class="Italic"> U.S. Dep't of the Army, Army Corps of Eng'rs, Portland Dist., Portland, Or.,</span> 60 FLRA 413, 415 (2004); (3) to determine how to support and pursue a grievance,<span class="Italic"> IRS, </span>50 FLRA at 672; and (4) to assess whether to arbitrate or settle a pending grievance, <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Ill., </span>51 FLRA 675, 682-83 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom., Dep't of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Ill. v. FLRA, </span>104 F.3d 1396 (D.C. Cir. 1997). The Authority has found that the need for information to assess whether to arbitrate a pending grievance was "evident" because of the financial commitment a union must make when it decides to arbitrate a grievance. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 683. The Authority also has emphasized that such information is necessary because arbitration can function properly only when the grievance procedures leading to it are able to sift out unmeritorious grievances. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 683 n.5 (citing <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Acme Indus.</span>, 385 U.S. 432, 438 (1967)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with these considerations, the Authority found that a union established a particularized need for requested information when it explained why it needed the information (to ascertain whether there was disparate treatment of an employee), how it would be used (to determine the appropriateness of a penalty), and the connection between the uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute (to represent an employee in a grievance). <span class="Italic">IRS, Austin Dist. Office, Austin, Tex.</span>, 51 FLRA 1166, 1178-79 (1996) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Austin</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Authority specifically has rejected a respondent's claim that a union failed to "articulate its need with requisite specificity" when the union's information request: (1) referenced a specific agency action; and (2) specified that the information was needed to assess whether the respondent violated established policies and whether to file a grievance, even though it did not explain fully how the information would enable it to determine whether to file a grievance. <span class="Italic">Health Care Fin. Admin., </span>56 FLRA 503, 506-07 (2000) (<span class="Italic">HCFA</span>). In addition, the Authority has held that a union's citation of specific CBA provisions served to notify the agency that the requested information was necessary for the union to administer and enforce the CBA and articulated with specificity why the information was needed, including how the information would be used, and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Library of Congress, </span>63 FLRA 515, 519 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Judge made the following factual findings to which no party excepts. The Union's information request was filed in conjunction with the filing of a grievance on behalf of the grievant, and the request referenced a specific agency action and cited specific provisions of the CBA. In particular, the grievance alleged that: (1) the Respondent's placement of the grievant on home leave violated Article 6, Section (b)(2) and (3) of the CBA by treating the grievant unfairly and inequitably and by retaliating against him for his union activities; and (2) the Respondent violated Article 30, Section (d)(2) by failing to timely notify the grievant of the Respondent's decision not to take disciplinary action against the grievant. As to all of the requested information, the Union articulated a need to assess the Respondent's treatment of the grievant and to assess whether to arbitrate the grievance, and--if it chose to do so--to support the grievance at arbitration. The Union explained that the information was necessary for it to fulfill its representational duties because it would permit the Union to determine the Respondent's reasons for placing the grievant under investigation and then on home duty, and to assess whether the Respondent followed its policies in doing so. The Union further explained that the information was necessary for it to fulfill its representational duties because it would permit the Union to assess its allegations in the pending grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge's unexcepted factual findings and the precedent set forth above support a conclusion that the Respondent has not demonstrated that the Judge erred when he found that the Union had established a particularized need for all of the requested information. The factual findings support the Judge's determinations that the Union explained why it needed the information (to assess whether the Respondent acted properly in placing the grievant on home leave), how it would use the information (to assess its pending grievance alleging violations of specific provisions of the CBA), and the connection between the uses and its representational responsibilities under the Statute (to represent the grievant at arbitration of the grievance if arbitration is determined to be warranted). These determinations, and the precedent set forth above, support the Judge's conclusions that the Union established particularized need for all the requested information. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., IRS, Austin</span>, 51 FLRA at 1178. Accordingly, we deny the Respondent's exception to the Judge's finding of particularized need. As such, it is unnecessary to resolve the Respondent's claim that there can be no statutory violation where a union established a particularized need for only some, but not all, of its requested information.</p>
<p class="noindent">The particularized need, framed in the context of review of exceptions to an arbitrator's award, was again explored in <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA 972, 978-80 (2010), determining to be insufficient the need posited by the union seeking information to assist it in negotiations, to permit it to evaluate or prepare for grievance or similar proceedings, and to assist the union in understanding an employee survey that management was about to undertake:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A union requesting information under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute must establish a particularized need for information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs the requested information, including the uses to which the union will put the information and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See IRS, Wash., D.C. &#x0026; IRS, Kan. City Serv. Ctr., Kan. City, Mo.</span>, 50 FLRA 661, 669 (1995) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>) (Member Talking concurring). The requirement that a union establish such need will not be satisfied merely by showing that requested information is or would be relevant or useful to a union. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>Instead, a union must establish that requested information is required in order for the union adequately to represent its members. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 669-70. The Union is responsible for articulating and explaining its interests in disclosure of the information. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 670. Satisfying this burden requires more than a conclusory or bare assertion. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>Among other things, a request for information must be sufficient to permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether information must be disclosed under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Determining whether requested information is "necessary" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) of the Statute is a "question[&#8197;] of law, not [a] question[&#8197;] of fact." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Energy, W. Area Power Admin., Golden, Colo.</span>, 27 FLRA 823, 829 (1987). Consequently, where an arbitrator finds that a union established particularized need for requested information, the Authority will assess whether, in making that finding, the arbitrator "erred, as a matter of law," and set aside the award if the arbitrator did so. <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 60 FLRA 576, 581 (2005) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring &#x0026; then-Member Pope dissenting as to finding of no particularized need). Consistent with these principles, we assess whether the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law in finding that the Union established particularized need for the requested information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its information request, the Union stated, without elaboration, that it needed the requested information to assist in preparing for negotiations concerning the survey, as well as for "related enforcement actions[.]" Subsequently, in its grievance, the Union alleged, without elaboration, that the Agency "has denied us information...to enable us to understand what is happening in connection with the [s]urvey process, to prepare this grievance and to help us prepare for negotiations." Thus, in essence, the Union asserted that it needed the information for three purposes: (1) to prepare for negotiations; (2) for "related enforcement actions[,]" including preparing the grievance; and (3) to enable the Union to understand the survey process. The Union also argues that, during the hearing, one of its witnesses articulated additional purposes for which the Union needed the information. These issues are addressed separately below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">i. Information for Negotiations</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to negotiations, the Authority has recognized that preparing proposals for collective bargaining is a central union representational responsibility under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Air Force, Wash., D.C.</span>, 52 FLRA 1000, 1009 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Air Force D.C.</span>) (Member Wasserman concurring). However, the Authority has held that "an assertion that requested information is necessary to 'assist in developing proposals for...negotiations,'" is a conclusory or bare assertion that is insufficient to establish particularized need. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In addition, the Authority has held <span id="Page_297"></span>that where a union asserts that it needs information in order to draft bargaining proposals concerning a certain matter, and that matter is outside the duty to bargain, the union does not demonstrate that the information is necessary within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See GSA</span>, 29 FLRA 197, 200 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's statement that it needed the requested information "to help" it "prepare for...negotiations" over the survey is general and does not explain why the Union needed the particular information that it requested and the uses to which it would have put that information with respect to preparing for negotiations. In addition, as discussed previously, the Arbitrator found that the Union was not entitled to bargain over the survey, and the Union has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator erred in this regard. For these reasons, consistent with the foregoing precedent, we find that the Union did not establish a particularized need for the requested data in order to prepare for negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">ii.&#x2003;Information For "Related Enforcement Actions"/Preparing the Grievance</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that a statement that information was needed to "determine whether any employee or [u]nion rights have been violated and[,] if they have[&#8197;]" been violated, to "take appropriate remedial action through [the] negotiated grievance procedures[&#8197;]" was insufficient to establish particularized need for that information. <span class="Italic">See Air Force D.C.</span>, 52 FLRA at 1008. Similarly, a statement that requested information was necessary to monitor compliance with the parties' national agreement, and necessary to pursue possible grievances and equal-employment-opportunity complaints, was insufficient where it did not explain why the union requested the particular information that it requested and the particular uses to which the union would put it if the information were disclosed. <span class="Italic">See HHS, NY</span>, 52 FLRA at 1147-48 (Member Wasserman dissenting in part).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union did not initially specify the "related enforcement actions" for which it allegedly needed the lengthy list of requested information. However, when the Union subsequently filed the national grievance, it alleged that it needed the information in order to "prepare" the grievance. Nevertheless, neither the original information request nor the grievance explained why the Union needed the particular items that it was seeking or the particular uses to which the Union would put those items in processing the grievance. We note, in this connection, that the grievance involved the Agency's actions concerning the 2006 survey, and many of the requested items involved data from 2005; the Union did not explain how those items related to the grievance concerning the 2006 survey. In view of the general nature of the Union's statements and the scope of its request, we find that the Union did not demonstrate a particularized need for the requested data in connection with "related enforcement actions" or preparing the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">iii.&#x2003;Understanding the Survey Process</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the Union asserted, without elaboration, that it wanted the information in order to understand the survey process. The Union did not explain how it would use the information in this regard, or how any use of the information related to any representational activities. Also as discussed above, the Union did not demonstrate a particularized need for the information in connection with either negotiations or the processing of the grievance. Given the Union's unexplained statement and the lack of any demonstrated need for the information in connection with the Union's representational roles, we find that the Union did not establish particularized need for the information in order to understand the survey process.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA 972, 980 (2010), the particularized need is ordinarily demonstrated when making or further explaining the request for information, not by presenting the justification initially at a ULP hearing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that, to the extent reasons offered in a union's hearing testimony were not previously articulated, they "generally" may not be relied on to establish particularized need. <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Penitentiary, Marion, Ill.</span>, 52 FLRA 1195, 1205 n.10 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Marion</span>) (Member Wasserman dissenting).[10] The Union does not assert that the hearing testimony on which it relies was previously articulated or provide any other basis for concluding that this "general" rule does not apply here. Accordingly, we do not consider the hearing testimony in assessing whether the Union established particularized need.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10] We note that, in one decision after <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the Authority considered reasons proffered in testimony for the scope of an information request. <span class="Italic">See U.S. DOJ, INS, N. Region, Twin Cities, Minn.</span>, 51 FLRA 1467, 1475-76 (1996) (<span class="Italic">INS</span>), <span class="Italic">recons. den.</span>, 52 FLRA 1323 (1997), <span class="Italic">pet. for review den.</span>, 144 F.3d 90 (D.C. Cir. 1998). In <span class="Italic">INS</span>, after the union requested information, the parties met and the agency, while raising certain concerns regarding the request, did not raise a concern regarding the scope of the information requested. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 1469-70. The Authority found it appropriate to consider hearing testimony regarding the scope of the request because to do otherwise "would give undue weight to whether the agency asked or the union answered questions about matters that, unlike other matters that were discussed...neither party appeared concerned about at the time of the request." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1476. However, the Authority subsequently indicated in <span class="Italic">Marion </span>that the holding in <span class="Italic">INS </span>was limited, noting that it was "the only Authority decision issued after [<span class="Italic">IRS</span>] where" the Authority considered reasons proffered at a hearing, and emphasizing that although the parties had discussed many aspects of the information request in <span class="Italic">INS</span>, they had not discussed scope. 52 FLRA at 1205 n.10. As there were no discussions in this case, and there is no claim that <span class="Italic">INS</span> applies, it does not provide a basis for considering the hearing testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, FCI Ft. Fix and AFGE Local 2001,</span> 64 FLRA 106, 109-10 (2009) (particularized need justification (and response) should be supplied at or near time of request and response, not for the first time at ULP hearing).</p>
<p class="noindent">A union is entitled to information that will enable it to realistically assess the strengths or weaknesses of an employee's grievance and to determine the most appropriate course of action to take. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, Wash., DC and Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, AFGE</span>, 39 FLRA 531, 539 (1991), <span class="Italic">complaint dismissed on other grounds following court remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, Wash., DC and Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, AFGE</span>, 51 FLRA 462 (1995); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council Local 2544</span>, 58 FLRA 656 (2003) (information request appropriate to assist in presenting reply to discipline and for evaluating a case for arbitration). There is no requirement that information requested under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) actually be used in a grievance. An agency's contention that a potential grievance is not grievable does not relieve the agency of its obligation to furnish the requested data. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 3937</span>, 39 FLRA 298, 309 (1991) (agency is required to furnish information concerning filling of nonunit positions when information is necessary for union to fulfill its representational responsibilities). The test for whether information requested by a union is improperly denied is not whether the related grievance is contractually grievable. A broader test is applied: &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) requires management to furnish the union with requested information "to the extent not prohibited by law," that is "reasonably available and necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Region VII and NTEU</span>, 10 FLRA 251, 253 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent">The information sought must have some relevance to working conditions. Management did not violate the statute by failing to disclose information concerning contracts for services that have been contracted out or that may have impacted bargaining unit employees when there were no unit employees displaced, reassigned, subject to RIF, or otherwise adversely affected, and no grievances were pending because of contracting out. This was so despite a contract provision that contractor personnel would not be used to replace civilian personnel unless it was more economical. <span class="Italic">Director of Admin., Hq., Air Force and AFGE-GAIU Council of Hq. USAF Locals</span>, 6 FLRA 110, 110-11 (1981). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">FAA, Aviation Standards Nat'l Field Office, Mike Monroney Aeronautical Ctr. and NFFE Local 2097</span>, 43 FLRA 1221, 1230 (1992) (determining to be "necessary" disclosure of names of members of Technical Evaluation Team--that included unit employees--designated by management to develop plan for evaluating contractor proposals; information would assist union in determining whether team members had conflicts of interest, in evaluating appraisals of team members, and in determining whether to request bargaining over effect on unit of selection of unit employees as team members). Special disclosure requirements pertain to information sought by unions that can be characterized as internal management guidance and recommendations. For judicial guidance on the factor of "necessity" and the demonstration of "particularized need" for information that constitutes management guidance and recommendations, refer to <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 523, 529, 531-34 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-11-097.html#sec3-98">Internal Agency Information; Deliberative Process; Management Guidance, Advice, Counsel, or Training</a>").</p>
<p class="noindent">Under the prior test of "relevance," although the union had to identify its need for the requested information in more than an abstract manner, <span class="Italic">DMA and NFFE Local 1827</span>, 21 FLRA 595, 595 (1986), the request was to be reasonably construed if its necessity could reasonably be discerned. <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 811 F.2d 769, 774-75 (2d Cir. 1987), involved requests for time and attendance records, progress reviews, and performance appraisals. The agency requested and was refused specific information about the union's request. The reviewing court concluded that FLRA construed the content of the union's inquiries too narrowly. The union adequately conveyed its need for the requested information<span class="Italic">.</span> On remand, FLRA sent the <span class="Italic">AFGE v.
