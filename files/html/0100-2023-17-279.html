<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-276"><span id="page_2235"></span><span class="space">p.</span> Hazard Pay</h5>
<p class="noindent">Related to but distinct from EDP are hazard pay differentials. OPM advises:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hazardous duty pay is additional pay for the performance of hazardous duty or duty involving physical hardship.&#x2003;Hazardous duty pay is payable to General Schedule (GS) employees covered by chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code. Prevailing rate (wage) employees are eligible to receive environmental differential pay in certain circumstances under a separate statutory provision (5 U.S.C. 5343(c)(4)).</p>
<p class="noindent"><a href="https://www.opm.gov/faqs/topic/payleave/index.aspx?cid=c4c7e7ca-48be-4650-bbc8-6ec08e8fd479">www.opm.gov/faqs/topic/payleave/index.aspx?cid=c4c7e7ca-48be-4650-bbc8-6ec08e8fd479</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 5545, OPM regulates hazard pay:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;The Office shall establish a schedule or schedules of pay differentials for duty involving unusual physical hardship or hazard, and for any hardship or hazard related to asbestos, such differentials shall be determined by applying occupational safety and health standards consistent with the permissible exposure limit promulgated by the Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Under such regulations as the Office may prescribe, and for such minimum periods as it determines appropriate, an employee to whom chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of this title applies is entitled to be paid the appropriate differential for any period in which he is subjected to physical hardship or hazard not usually involved in carrying out the duties of his position. However, the pay differential--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;does not apply to an employee in a position the classification of which takes into account the degree of physical hardship or hazard involved in the performance of the duties thereof, except</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(A)&#x2003;an employee in an occupational series covering positions for which the primary duties involve the prevention, control, suppression, or management of wildland fires, as determined by the Office; and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(B)&#x2003;in such other circumstances as the Office may by regulation prescribe; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;may not exceed an amount equal to 25 percent of the rate of basic pay applicable to the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">OPM's implementing regulations for General Schedule employees are at 5 CFR Part 550, Subpart I (2022). The allowance of hazard pay differential is not authorized if the underlying hazard has been taken into account in the position classification. Under 5 CFR 550.904 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Authorization of hazard pay differential.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;An agency shall pay the hazard pay differential listed in appendix A of this subpart to an employee who is assigned to and performs any duty specified in appendix A of this subpart. However, hazard pay differential may not be paid to an employee when the hazardous duty or physical hardship has been taken into account in the classification of his or her position, without regard to whether the hazardous duty or physical hardship is grade controlling, unless payment of a differential has been approved under paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;For the purpose of this section, the phrase "has been taken into account in the classification of his or her position" means that the duty constitutes an element considered in establishing the grade of the position--i.e., the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform that duty are considered in the classification of the position....</p>
<p class="noindent">The statutory and regulatory bases for the pay were described in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1102 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FDC Seatac</span>, 65 FLRA 40, 43 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Hazardous Duty Act, codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545, authorizes the payment of hazard pay differentials to employees who perform hazardous duties. <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 51</span>, 40 FLRA 614, 621 (1991). Before an Arbitrator may award hazardous duty pay, a union must establish that "(1) [t]he hazard or physical hardship [is] not...considered in the classification of the employee's position pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(d)[;] (2) [t]he hazard or physical hardship [is]...listed in Appendix A to 5 C.F.R.

<p class="noindent-1">However, the Arbitrator's alternative order, that the Agency petition OPM to amend its regulations, to which no exception was filed, is not deficient. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.903(b) specifically permits agencies to file requests with OPM seeking to amend Appendix A.

<p class="noindent-1">The Union's claim that the award is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(d) is without merit. Although that provision provides for the establishment and payment of differentials for certain duties, it does not address or require the payment of a hazard differential for the underwater duty involved in this case. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Land Mgmt., Eugene Dist.

Consequently, the Union's claim provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Union's assertion that the award conflicts with the implementing regulations is meritless. The Arbitrator determined that Appendix A only specifies diving as a hazardous duty when it is "required in scientific and engineering pursuits, or search and rescue operations[.]" The Arbitrator found that "the [g]rievant's diving duties [were] not part of scientific and engineering pursuits or search and rescue operations." Consequently, because the hazard that the grievant faced was not listed <span id="page_2236"></span>in Appendix A, the Arbitrator concluded that he was not entitled to a hazard pay differential.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Union's interpretation of these regulations differs from the Arbitrator's interpretation, the Union's assertions do not prove that the Arbitrator's interpretation conflicts with the plain wording of the regulations or is otherwise impermissible. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Interior,</span> 43 FLRA at 764 (determining that, under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, an award is deficient if the arbitrator's interpretation of a regulation conflicts with the plain wording of that regulation or is otherwise impermissible). Moreover, given the Arbitrator's underlying factual findings, which are undisputed and to which we defer, his legal conclusion that the grievant was precluded from obtaining a hazard pay differential because the underwater duty he performed was not listed in Appendix A to 5 C.F.R. part 550 is consistent with the applicable regulations. Finally, even assuming that the grievant participated in dives only occasionally and that the hazard that the grievant faced while diving was not considered in the classification of his position, the grievant would not be entitled to a hazard pay differential because the test, as noted above, mandates that the hazard faced by a grievant be included in Appendix A. <span class="Italic">See Fed.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Glenview Naval Air Station and AFGE Local 1641</span>, 48 FLRA 1420, 1429-30 (1994), set aside an award of hazard pay when asbestos exposure was not covered by the OPM regulation (since amended):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we note that the OPM regulation authorizing a hazardous duty pay differential for GS employees based on exposure to airborne asbestos was not in effect at the time of the events giving rise to the grievance. Further, we note that when the OPM regulation authorizing hazardous duty pay differentials for GS employees in these cases was enacted, the regulation was not given retroactive application. Therefore, we will address the exceptions based on the statutory and regulatory provisions in effect at the time of the claimed exposure to asbestos.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority previously has found that hazardous duty pay for GS employees is governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(d) and its implementing regulations contained in 5 C.F.R. part 550, subpart I and Appendix A. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren, Virginia and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2096</span>, 44 FLRA 1118, 1125 (1992); <span class="Italic">IRS, Wichita</span>, 40 FLRA at 621; <span class="Italic">VA, Leavenworth</span>, 35 FLRA at 17. The Authority has noted that, generally, employees may be compensated for the performance of hazardous duties in one of two ways: classifying the employees' positions so as to take such duties into account; or providing employees with a hazardous duty pay differential. Only OPM can promulgate regulations authorizing the payment of a hazardous duty pay differential. <span class="Italic">See IRS, Wichita</span>, 40 FLRA at 622. Therefore, in order to warrant a pay differential, certain regulatory requirements must be satisfied. Those requirements provide that the hazard or physical hardship must be listed in Appendix A to 5 C.F.R. part 550, subpart I and that the hazard or hardship must not have been considered in the classification of the position. In addition, for most of the time period covered by the Arbitrator's award, the regulations required that the performance of the duties involving a hazard or physical hardship had to be "irregular or intermittent."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator did not find that an entitlement was specifically authorized under law and regulation and did not award a hazardous duty pay differential consistent with the applicable regulatory requirements. Specifically, the Arbitrator failed to find that exposure to asbestos was a category listed in Appendix A, that the employees' positions had not been classified to take into account the performance of hazardous duties, and that, at all relevant times, the duties were performed on an irregular or intermittent basis. Such findings would have been necessary in order to sustain an entitlement to a hazardous duty pay differential. Instead, the Arbitrator found that because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(d) allows hazardous duty pay for GS employees, the Agency could enter into a contractual agreement authorizing such a pay differential.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Fort Campbell</span> [37 FLRA 186 (1990)], we stated that we will find an award deficient when it is contrary to a controlling Government-wide regulation. We find that the regulations contained in 5 C.F.R. part 550, subpart I, Appendix A governing hazardous duty pay are controlling Government-wide regulations with regard to the entitlement to such pay. In our view, the Arbitrator's award, in part, contravenes those regulations for the following reason. In order to find a contractual entitlement to a hazardous duty pay differential, the contractual entitlement would have to be consistent with the statutory and regulatory requirements governing hazardous duty pay. Because the Arbitrator ordered the payment of a hazardous duty pay differential without satisfying one of the regulatory requirements, namely, the existence of a category covering asbestos exposure in Appendix A, the contractual entitlement found by the Arbitrator was insufficient to establish a legal basis on which to award such a pay differential....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Red River Army Depot and AFGE Local 3961</span>, 53 FLRA 46, 53 (1997) (hazardous duty pay provisions of 5 USC 5545(d) and the implementing regulations governing entitlement resulting from asbestos exposure were effective on June 3, 1993, and had no retroactive application); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">DOT, FAA and NATCA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v55/55-136.html">55 FLRA 797</a>, 801 (1999) (asbestos exposure: arbitrator properly gives weight to an OPM advisory opinion interpreting hazard pay differentials, particularly if opinion is not developed specifically for the arbitration.").</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitration award sustaining a grievance claiming hazardous duty pay should provide a basis for determining the amount of covered work, expressed in days of work or percentage of time worked, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army and AFGE Local 1834</span>, 54 FLRA 1117, 1124-25 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once it has been established that HPD is authorized, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.905 requires the agency to pay the HPD for the hours in a pay status on the day on which the hazardous duty is performed. In this case, the Arbitrator failed to outline in his award, with particularity, the time periods for which the grievants were eligible for HPD to satisfy section 550.905. The Arbitrator's finding that the grievants were exposed on a "regular" and "recurring" basis from October 1990 through January 12, 1995 does not satisfy the regulations. This finding is not satisfactory because it does not provide the Agency with sufficient information to determine how many hours or days it must pay the grievants HPD. Thus, even though the grievants meet the eligibility requirements for HPD, the Arbitrator's findings regarding the period during which the grievants performed the hazardous work are legally insufficient. Furthermore, the record in this case does not permit the Authority to make the necessary findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's ability to review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the legal conclusions arrived at in an award is dependent on the sufficiency of the record before it. <span class="Italic">Army Research</span>, 53 FLRA at 1710. If an award fails to contain the factual findings necessary to assess the arbitrator's legal conclusions, and the findings cannot be derived from the record, the award will be set aside and the case will be remanded to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator, absent settlement, so that the requisite findings can be made. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, the Arbitrator failed to outline in his award material findings of fact regarding the time periods for which the grievants were eligible for HPD pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.905. Accordingly, we will remand this case to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, to obtain additional findings regarding the period of time the grievants were exposed to the hazardous agents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we do not mean to suggest, as the Agency does, that the Arbitrator is required to make explicit findings regarding the presence of "unstable and highly sensitive" materials for "every day between October 1, 1990 and January 12, 1995." The Arbitrator may make findings on a daily or hourly basis if he chooses to do so. Alternatively, he may make findings as to either the percentage of time in a pay status the grievants were exposed to the unstable and highly sensitive material, or findings as to particular periods of time during which the grievants were exposed to said material.[11] If the Arbitrator chooses the latter approach upon remand, it would be up to the parties, in the implementation stage of the award, to calculate each grievant's specific entitlement to HPD.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;For instance, the Arbitrator could find that the grievants were exposed to the hazardous agents every day they worked for 60% of their time spent in a pay status, or that the grievants were exposed to the hazardous agents 80% of the days they worked in a pay status per month, etc. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 43 FLRA 207, 210 (1991) (employees awarded EDP for 35 percent of the "total hours during which they were in a pay status and actually at work" pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.511(b)(2)). Or, for example, the Arbitrator could find that the grievants were exposed to the hazardous agents during the 2 1/2 week period in October of 1994 when the truck with 1.1 and 1.2 class material was parked outside of building 2201 and/or during the period that partially opened boxes of ammunition were returned to building 2201 in the months of October through August of 1992, etc.</p>
<p class="noindent">The hazard pay analysis properly includes consideration of whether the position occupied by the grievant was designed to embrace the hazard encountered on the job, defeating the claim to the differential, as occurred in <span id="page_2237"></span>the award under review, <span class="Italic">IBPO Local 591 and Dept. of Navy, Navy Region Mid-Atl.</span>, 61 FLRA 434, 434-36 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant is a Police Officer (Explosive Dog Handler), GS-9, at the Norfolk Naval Base. His typical work environment includes high-crime areas where potentially harmful physical danger is present. His work often involves contact with drug abusers and, thus, he has a high risk of coming into contact with individuals who may have HIV-AIDS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the periods of September 27, 2001 to October 29, 2001 and January 23, 2002 to February 20, 2002, the grievant was temporarily assigned to naval facilities in Washington, D.C. His duties, while on temporary assignment, included searching, with his dog, Postal Service vehicles, and packages therein, which had originated from the Brentwood Postal Facility. The Brentwood Facility was determined to have been the source of possible anthrax contamination during this period. When the Agency became aware of this potential anthrax contamination, it directed the grievant to undergo medical examination to determine whether he had been exposed to anthrax.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the grievant became aware that he might be entitled to HPD for potential exposure to anthrax, he filed a grievance. The Agency denied the grievance and it was submitted to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator framed the issue as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Is the [g]rievant...entitled to [HPD] for exposure to anthrax for the time frame he was detailed to Naval District Washington...?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator noted that, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.904(a), an agency must pay the HPD listed in Appendix A of the regulations to an employee who is assigned to and performs any duty specified in Appendix A. The Arbitrator indicated that, under the Appendix, employees may be entitled to HPD if their duties involve virulent biological material, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, materials of micro-organic nature which, when introduced into the body, can cause serious disease or fatality. The Arbitrator also noted that, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.904(a), an employee will not be paid HPD if the hazardous duty or physical hardship is taken into account in the classification of the employee's position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that, under the Police Officer Classification Standard Guidelines (Guidelines), the grievant's position is classified as Level 9-3, the category designated as involving exposure to the highest type of risks. Specifically, the standards classify such work environments as those which regularly involve high risks with exposure to potentially dangerous situations or unusual environmental stress. He also found that Level 9-2, described as involving moderate risk, was defined as including the possibility of exposure to infectious biological materials. He noted in this regard that the grievant's position description stated that his duties would involve potential exposure to HIV-AIDS, which could be described as infectious biological material.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that, "based on the position description alone, there is insufficient basis" for concluding that "potential anthrax exposure was an occupational hazard that was foreseen in the [g]rievant's position description." Rather, he found the Guidelines "compelling." Referencing the fact that Level 9-2 explicitly mentioned "infectious biological materials," he stated that this classification standard clearly contemplated employees being exposed to anthrax. He noted further in this regard that the grievant's position was classified at the next higher level and involved a higher level of risk. Noting that higher level of risk, the Arbitrator found that "[w]hile no reference to 'infectious biological agents' is made in the Level 9-3 grade classification, it may be assumed that this position would encapsulate all the risks of the Level 9-2 provision; particularly as the Level 9-3 position is considered 'high risk' as opposed to the 'moderate risk' rating of Level 9-2."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on this analysis, the Arbitrator found that the type of risk involved in potential exposure to anthrax "was incorporated into the [g]rievant's position description." Consequently, the Arbitrator concluded that the grievant "is not entitled to HPD differential under the O[ffice of] P[ersonnel] M[anagement] regulations."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(d)(1), the hazard pay differential provided by &#x00A7; 5545(d) "does not apply to an employee in a position the classification of which takes into account the degree of physical hardship or hazard involved in the performance of the duties thereof, except in such circumstances as the Office of Personnel Management may by regulation prescribe." Fraternal Order <span class="Italic">of Police, Local 158, </span>58 FLRA 371, 372 (2003). <span class="Italic">See also </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.904(a). The Union argues that the Arbitrator erred in determining that reference to possible exposure to HIV in the grievant's position description is sufficient to constitute exposure to infectious biological materials under the classification standard applied to his position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument is unavailing. The Arbitrator specifically found that such a reference in the position description was not sufficient. However, the Arbitrator based his conclusion, that the classification of the grievant's position encompassed exposure to infectious biological materials, on the fact that his classification at the highest level included hazards referenced in the moderate hazard level. The Union does not challenge whether that conclusion is contrary to law. We note, in this regard, that the Union: (1) does not dispute that the grievant's position is already classified at, and the grievant therefore is being paid commensurate with, the higher level of risk; and (2) does not claim, or demonstrate, that an employee may be classified, and paid, simultaneously with respect to hazards categorized at two levels of risk. Moreover, no other basis is argued to find that the Arbitrator's conclusion is erroneous as a matter of law. Therefore, the Union has not established that the award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VA San Diego Healthcare Sys. and NAGE</span>, 65 FLRA 45, 48 (2010), set aside an award of hazard pay because the employee's position classification took into account exposure to the hazard:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(d), a GS employee is entitled to a hazardous duty differential for any period in which "he is subjected to physical hardship or hazard not usually involved in carrying out the duties of his position." [6] In <span class="Italic">Adair v. United States</span>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit defined the term "usually involved in carrying out the duties of his position" as "inherent in a position, which regularly recurs<span class="Italic">, </span>and which is performed for a substantial part of the working time." 497 F.3d 1244, 1253 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;In addition, hazard pay is not warranted where the classification of the position "takes into account" the fact of such exposure to hazards. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that the incumbent in the Waste Manager position performed at least two hazardous duties: (1) the collection and transportation of "red bags" containing bio-hazardous waste and (2) the operation of equipment related to the disposal of medical and bio-hazardous waste material. Although the Arbitrator found that the employee performs the latter duty "only occasionally," he found that she collects and transports containers of bio-hazardous waste materials "daily--indeed, apparently for a significant period each work day." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also id. </span>at 17 (noting employee's "direct, daily, hands-on contact with containers (red bags) of medical waste"). These factual findings, which are undisputed, support a conclusion that this duty is inherent in the Waste Manager position, regularly recurs, and is performed for a substantial part of the working time. As such, it is usually involved in carrying out the duties of the Waster Manager position. Because a GS employee is entitled to a hazard duty pay only if the hazard duty is not usually involved in the employee's position, contrary to the Arbitrator's holding, the incumbent in the Waste Manager position is not entitled to such pay.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The Arbitrator also found that the employee's daily exposure to the bio-hazardous materials was not taken into account in classifying her position. In enacting 5 U.S.C. 5545(d), Congress noted that "unusual physical hardships or hazards which are inherent in a position, which regularly recurs<span class="Italic">, </span>and which is performed for a substantial part of the working time, are best compensated for through the regular position classification process[,]" rather than enhanced compensation." <span class="Italic">Adair</span>, 497 F.3d at 1253. We note that Article 13 of the parties' agreement describes the process that an employee may follow if she believes her position is improperly classified.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Although the Agency argues in its opposition that "[h]azard pay is a type of [e]nvironmental [d]ifferential pay[,]" a hazard pay differential and environmental differential pay are distinct.

<p class="noindent-1">The threshold requirements for an employee's entitlement to a hazard pay differential originate from a statutory mandate, as well as government regulation. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Alaska</span>, 54 FLRA 1117, 1122 (1998); <span class="Italic">see also </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545 &#x0026; 5 C.F.R. Part 550, subpart I. As relevant here, a grievant must satisfy three requirements before he is entitled to a hazard pay differential: (1) the hazard or physical hardship must not have been considered in the classification of his position pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(d); (2) the hazard or physical hardship must be listed in Appendix A to 5 C.F.R. Part 500; and (3) he must be performing a hazardous duty within the definition of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.902. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Alaska</span>, 54 FLRA at 1122.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency only contests the Arbitrator's conclusion with respect to the first requirement--i.e., whether the hazardous duty was considered in the <span id="page_2238"></span>classifications of the positions at issue. Therefore, the other requirements are not before us.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the Arbitrator's factual findings, the award of a hazard pay differential is not contrary to law. In his award, the Arbitrator evaluated the credibility of evidence and testimony presented to him at arbitration before concluding that the classification of the grievants' positions did not take into account the performance of certain hazardous duties. The Arbitrator cited specific testimony demonstrating that "the reference to equipment [in the position descriptions] does not take in to consideration the stun munitions, because chemical munitions were listed separately, and explosive munitions were not listed, and are considered a serious hazard." Additionally, he noted that, based on certain testimony, it became clear to him that "the position description[s] did not include duties that were being performed by the grievants" and that, in his estimation, the job classifications did not contain language regarding the performance of the hazardous duties at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, to the extent that the Agency contends that the Arbitrator's award of a hazard pay differential is deficient because testimony demonstrates that the grievants' positions were classified to include a hazard pay differential, its contention is without merit. The Agency's argument merely challenges the weight that the Arbitrator accorded to certain testimony; accordingly, the Agency has not established that the award is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See U.S. DOL</span>, 19 FLRA 300, 301-02 (1985) (finding that the arbitrator's award was not contrary to law when the arbitrator did not rely on certain classification standards and expert witness testimony indicating that the grievants' positions were classified to include a hazard pay differential when making his decision on the merits). Moreover, an arbitrator's failure to set forth specific findings, or to specify and discuss all allegations in a grievance, does not provide a basis for finding an award deficient. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office, </span>41 FLRA 1042, 1049 (1991) (citation omitted). In this regard, an arbitrator is not required to specify or discuss specific items of evidence on which an award is based or which otherwise were considered by the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Charleston Naval Shipyard, Charleston, S.C., </span>39 FLRA 987, 993 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 37 FLRA 766, 773-74 (1990)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, given the Arbitrator's underlying factual findings, his conclusion that the classification of the grievants' positions did not take into account the performance of certain hazardous duties is not contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Army, Alaska</span>, 54 FLRA at 1123 (finding that, given the arbitrator's underlying factual findings, his legal conclusion that the grievants worked with, or in close proximity to, unstable and highly sensitive material, for which they were entitled to a hazard pay differential, was consistent with the applicable regulations).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the hazard pay analysis requires determination of whether the disputed hazardous duties were taken into account in the classification of the grievants' positions, or if the dispute is whether the duties involved an irregular or intermittent hazard or physical hardship, the arbitrator's determination will be considered a factual determination to be set aside on the basis of a "nonfact" only if the central fact underlying the award is "clearly erroneous but for which a different result would have been reached." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr., Dahlgren and AFGE Local 2096</span>, 44 FLRA 1118, 1122 (1992) (sustaining arbitrator's reasoning that performance of hazardous duties need only be irregular or intermittent, not both). <span class="Italic">Pershing VAMC and AFGE Local 2328</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-149.html">71 FLRA 769</a>, 770-72 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting), set aside an award of hazard pay to licensed practical nurses when the arbitrator did not properly consider whether the hazard was encompassed within the nurses' position classification:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator ruled that he had jurisdiction to hear the issue of added compensation as to the LPNs and AMSAs and upheld the Union's grievance for HPD for both. With regard to the LPNs, the Arbitrator noted that the functional statement defining the scope of the position provides that "[t]he incumbent may be exposed to infected patients and contaminated materials and may be required to don protective clothing in isolated situations or operative/invasive procedures. The Arbitrator determined that because there was "no reference" to the hazards claimed by the Union and the hazards the LPNs encounter were "outside the scope of dealing directly with administering to the patient," handling the biohazardous bags was not a part of the LPNs' nursing duties....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to law because under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.904, HPD may not be paid where the hazardous duty has been considered in the classification of the position. The Agency asserts that that the duties of handling biohazardous materials are classified within the LPNs' functional statement.[17]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. The functional statement is the LPN job description. Award at 37. It states "the scope of the position and the responsibilities involved, including the duties involved and generally what is expected of the employee and what the employee can expect is required of the position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Additionally, we note that the Agency also argues that the Arbitrator failed to properly apply 5 C.F.R. Part 532, Subpart E, which concerns environmental differential pay. Agency Exceptions at 5-6. However, HPD--which is governed by the Hazardous Duty Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545, and regulations that apply to general schedule (GS) employees--is distinct from environmental differential pay--which is governed by regulations that apply to wage grade employees. <span class="Italic">See U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, Fed. Corr. Complex, Tucson, Ariz</span>., 65 FLRA 267, 269 n.2 (2010) (<span class="Italic">Fed. BOP</span>). Because the grievants at issue here, the LPNs, are GS employees, the Hazardous Duty Act applies to them. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The threshold requirements for an employee's entitlement to a hazard pay differential originate from a statutory mandate, as well as government regulation.[18] A grievant must satisfy three requirements before he or she is entitled to a hazard pay differential: (1) the hazard or physical hardship must not have been considered in the classification of his or her position pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(d); (2) the hazard or physical hardship must be listed in Appendix A to 5 C.F.R. Part 500 (Appendix A); and (3) he[/she] must be performing a hazardous duty within the definition of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.902.[19]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator failed to make the necessary factual findings for an award of HPD. He found that the hazards claimed by the Union are not referenced in the LPN functional statement, are "outside the scope of dealing directly with administering to the patient," and instead "stem from having to deal with and handle materials and wastes that are or may be contaminated, such as needles [and] broken glass." He found that it is possible an LPN may be injured or contaminated while transporting a red bag. But, these findings are insufficient to support the legal conclusion that the LPNs are entitled to HPD. It is not clear if the Arbitrator evaluated the classification of the LPN position, as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.904, because his analysis does not make a finding as to the first requirement for entitlement to HPD. He only summarily concluded that the hazards are not referenced in the functional statement.[21] Moreover, the Arbitrator failed to even address the second and third requirements. For example, although Appendix A requires a determination as to the protection afforded by protective devices[22] the Arbitrator made no findings as to the effectiveness of any available protective equipment. In fact, he did not cite Appendix A at all or specifically address whether handling contaminated materials and wastes is a hazardous duty under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.902, and he made no other factual findings for our <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;To this end, we note a glaring inconsistency in the Arbitrator's factual findings. Although the Arbitrator found that "the hazards to the LPNs stem from having to <span class="Italic">deal with and handle materials and wastes that are or may be contaminated</span>, such as needles [and] broken glass," which he determined is not referenced in the functional statement, the functional statement actually provides that "[t]he incumbent may be exposed to...<span class="Italic">contaminated materials</span>." Award at 38 (emphasis added). Furthermore, Member Abbott would caution that permitting the Arbitrator to decide what activities come within the territory of being an LPN may not be a decision that an arbitrator, who is not a medical professional, should be making. <span class="Italic">See U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, Fed. Med. Ctr. Carswell, Ft. Worth, Tex</span>., 70 FLRA 890, 892, nn.21-22 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (Member Abbott questioning whether arbitrators should be permitted to decide questions of medical competency).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[22]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. Part 550, Subpart I, App. A.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, because there are no factual findings to support the Arbitrator's conclusion that the LPNs are entitled to HPD, we find that he erred as a matter of law. Thus, we grant the Agency's exception that the award as to the LPNs is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 933 and VAMC Detroit</span>, 58 FLRA 480 (2002), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, considered an arbitrator's ruling on the timeliness of a grievance seeking recovery of hazard pay for asbestos exposure. The discussion earlier on environmental differential pay should be reviewed for decisions involving interpretations by arbitrators of the contractual and statutory limitation periods for recovery of EDP and hazard pay differentials.

<p class="noindent-1">If the agency is covered by a an agency-specific personnel system that is exempt from most of the requirements of Title V, including hazard pay provisions of 5 USC 5545(d), an arbitrator has no statutory basis to award hazard pay in response to a grievance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp.</span>, FAA, 61 FLRA 803 (2006).</p>
