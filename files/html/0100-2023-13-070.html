<p class="Body-Text">Although discontinued service retirement under 5 USC 8336(d) is considered involuntary for purposes of the early retirement statute, a separate determination must be made of whether an appealable adverse action occurred when the employee alleges his resignation was coerced. <span class="Italic">Lichtman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 24 MSPR 524, 525-26 (1984) (removal decision based on unacceptable performance coupled with resignation and discontinued service annuity application); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Covington v. DHHS</span>, 750 F.2d 937 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (appellant entered into a discontinued service retirement based on an incorrect notice from the agency that he was subjected to a reduction in force with no right of assignment, when in fact the agency's action constituted a transfer of function that apparently could have resulted in retention of the appellant's position; the appellant was not required to challenge the RIF to establish the materially misleading nature of the agency's RIF notice); <span class="Italic">Allen v. <span id="Page_2038"></span>OPM</span>, 77 MSPR 212, 219-20 (1998) (comparing the definition of "involuntary" for purposes of a discontinued service retirement and the definition of "involuntary" for purposes of MSPB adverse action jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Musone v. USDA</span>, 31 MSPR 85, 89 n.4 (1986) ("Contrary to appellant's further contention, the concept of involuntariness for the purposes of determining whether an appealable adverse action has occurred when the employee alleges that his resignation was coerced is a separate determination from whether a retirement was involuntary for the purpose of discontinued service retirement."); <span class="Italic">Lematta v. DHHS</span>, 22 MSPR 18, 20 n.2 (1984) ("Board's determination of the voluntariness of a resignation or retirement for purposes of Board jurisdiction is totally separate and distinct from the Office of Personnel Management's determination of involuntary separation for retirement purposes under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 83"), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Sanderson v. OPM</span>, 72 MSPR 311, 315 (1996) ("The determination of an involuntary separation for retirement purposes under 5 USC chapter 83 is 'totally, separate and distinct from' a determination of involuntary retirement or resignation for Board jurisdictional purposes. <span class="Italic">Lematta v. DHHS</span>, 22 MSPR 18, 20 &#x0026; n.2 (1984); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 11 MSPR 60, 63-64 (1982)."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Higgins v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-11-0039-I-1 (NP 11/26/2012) ("It appears that the appellant is correct that he meets the requirements for a discontinued service annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(1). However, we find that the appellant's retirement eligibility did not preclude the agency from going forward with the removal action as it was otherwise entitled to do.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Nebblett v. OPM</span>, 237 F.3d 1353, 1358-59 (Fed. Cir. 2001), an individual may not fail to challenge an involuntary retirement before the Board and then challenge the retirement as involuntary when OPM denies a claim for a discontinued service annuity. According to the court, the discontinued service retirement is to be based on the employer's lawful action at the time of the employee's separation. If the separation is unlawful, the remedy is pursued through the employee's Board appeal against the employer, seeking restoration of employment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an otherwise voluntary resignation is proven to be the result of coercion by the employing agency, the agency's conduct necessarily is determined to have been wrongful. This is so whether the action that prompted the otherwise voluntary resignation is misinformation or deception caused by the agency and upon which the employee relied, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984), a threat of disciplinary action that the agency knows is not sustainable, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Schultz v. United States Navy,</span> 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987), or any other improper act by the agency, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 1136. When an employee proves that intolerable working conditions have forced the employee to resign, it necessarily follows that those working conditions are unlawful, and in need of correction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency further argues that it has consistently viewed involuntary separations under section 8336(d)(1) to require the common element of a lawful undertaking, a point that is firmly established in long-standing precedent of the Board. In this regard, the agency is correct: <span class="Italic">Allen</span> and <span class="Italic">Sanderson, supra</span>, are but, examples of the Board's interpretation of "involuntary separation," for purposes of section 8336(d), to require lawful agency action that provoked a separation. The agency also reminds us that this court has previously looked to the examples in the FPM as guides to determine whether a separation is involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Yarbrough v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 770 F.2d 1056, 1058-59 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the argument that the remedies for coerced resignations and for retirement annuities when an employee is involuntarily removed are entirely different, the agency posits that OPM is not equipped to resolve the question of whether Ms. Nebblett's resignation was coerced by unlawful agency action. The agency points out that in order for Ms. Nebblett's view to prevail, OPM would be forced to conduct a hearing to determine if her resignation was indeed coerced. The defendant in those circumstances would be the agency that allegedly committed the wrongful coercion. As an adverse action under Chapter 75 before the Board, the agency would be defending itself in a typical fashion, with each side familiar with the discovery and litigating rules. But with the adverse action hearing being conducted in the first instance by OPM, to determine entitlement to the retirement annuity, OPM asserts that it has no authority and no regulations by which it could hale the agency into court to test the employee's assertions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the agency asserts that the interpretation it gives to "involuntary separation" in the key statute--that such a separation must stem from a lawful agency act--is a reasonable one that commands our adoption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Ms. Nebblett recognizes that the key statute does not itself provide a definition of an "involuntary separation," she argues that her separation, if she were to prevail on her allegation of coercion, would constitute a resignation caused by the agency, against her will. Ms. Nebblett does not deny that she could have availed herself of the remedy afforded by Chapter 75, namely a challenge to her unlawful removal, which if successful would have entitled her to reinstatement with back pay. She also does not respond to the agency's argument that were she to succeed in proving that her resignation was unlawfully coerced, she would thereby prove that she had never been separated, and thus disqualify herself under section 8336(d)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Nebblett rejects the agency's argument that OPM lacks the tools to decide whether her resignation was coerced, pointing to an express provision in Chapter 83 that empowers OPM to "perform...such acts...as are necessary and proper to carry out this subchapter." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(a) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Ms. Nebblett that the agency cannot prevail solely on the ground that OPM may not have procedures in place that would permit it to efficiently resolve the factual question of whether Ms. Nebblett's resignation was coerced by working conditions so intolerable that no reasonable employee could be expected to endure those conditions. The agency has the power and means to provide an answer to that factual question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A person in Ms. Nebblett's situation might argue that it is inhumane to force an employee who has been coerced into resignation by intolerable working conditions to vindicate her wrong by seeking reinstatement to the very agency that had wrongly pushed her out its door. While such an argument has a measure of appeal, it discounts the importance of proving, in a Chapter 75 proceeding, that the wrongful circumstances existed at the agency, the circumstances that caused the constructive removal. In order for the wrongful working condition to be corrected, it must first have been proven wrongful. A person who succeeds in proving a constructive removal because of intolerable working circumstances provides the necessity for the agency to correct its wrong. A work environment so intolerable that no reasonable person can remain in it is an environment that must be changed, for the better. It is to the improved environment that the successful Chapter 75 litigant should be reinstated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by Ms. Nebblett's arguments that the agency's interpretation of the key statute is unreasonable. To the contrary, we find that the agency's interpretation is correct. The type of involuntary separation to which section 8336(d)(1) speaks is one that results from lawful agency action. Since the agency action that allegedly caused Ms. Nebblett's resignation in 1983 necessarily must be deemed to be unlawful, she cannot meet the requirements for an immediate retirement annuity under section 8336(d)(1). We therefore affirm the final decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nebblett</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Gaghan v. OPM</span>, 111 MSPR 397, 398-402 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-14, 2009 MSPB 100 (2009), concluding that a disability retirement initially approved but ultimately not granted by OPM did not qualify the separated employee for discontinued service annuity based on a theory that the employee was misled by OPM as to his eligibility for disability retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 1, 2001, the appellant filed an application for disability retirement. On February 13, 2002, OPM approved the application, and 1 week later the appellant's employing agency, the U.S. Postal Service, processed the appellant's separation for disability retirement. After receiving correspondence in which the Postal Service questioned the appellant's entitlement to a disability retirement annuity, however, OPM reevaluated the case, and on January 18, 2005, it rescinded its approval, finding that the appellant did not meet the criteria for disability retirement. Although the appellant challenged the rescission of his annuity, the action was upheld by the Board and by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Gaghan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, MSPB Docket No. PH-0831-05-0239-I-2 (Initial Decision, Oct. 18, 2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 250 Fed. Appx. 319 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the Federal Circuit had issued its decision on the appellant's disability retirement appeal, the appellant submitted an application for a discontinued service retirement annuity. OPM denied that application; it sustained its denial in a reconsideration decision; and the appellant appealed the reconsideration decision to the Board's Northeastern Regional Office. The administrative judge to whom the appeal was assigned issued an initial decision reversing OPM's reconsideration decision and finding the appellant entitled to a discontinued service annuity. In that decision, she found that OPM had misled the appellant by approving his disability retirement application, that the appellant had relied on this misinformation to his detriment in retiring, and that the appellant's disability retirement therefore was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has filed a timely petition for review of the initial decision, and the appellant has filed a timely response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A CSRS employee who has completed at least 25 years of service, and who "is separated from the service involuntarily, except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency," is entitled to a discontinued service annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336 (d)(1). The appellant had over 30 years of service on the effective date of his disability retirement. He therefore would be entitled to a discontinued service retirement annuity if he was "separated...involuntarily," as that phrase is used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have indicated above, the administrative judge found that the appellant had met this criterion. In doing so, she relied on holdings, by <span id="Page_2039"></span>the Board and by our reviewing court, that a resignation or retirement that was based on incorrect or misleading information was involuntary, i.e., that it was tantamount to a removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> Initial Decision at 3-4 (citing <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1574-75 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues on petition for review that the administrative judge applied an incorrect standard in finding that the appellant's separation was involuntary. We agree with OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note first, in this regard, that the cases on which the administrative judge relied in referring to the rule that a resignation or retirement based on misinformation is involuntary generally deal with actions allegedly effected under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. That is, they generally deal with alleged <span class="Italic">de facto</span> removals under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 (1), in which the individual seeks restoration as an employee. <span class="Italic">See Covington</span>, 750 F.2d at 941, 944 (an employee who retired after receiving a reduction-in-force (RIF) notice informing him that he had no right of assignment or retention was to be given, on remand, an opportunity to present evidence that he was misinformed, and that he would, in the absence of his retirement, have been entitled to be retained as an employee); <span class="Italic">Scharf</span>, 710 F.2d at 1575 (because the petitioner's decision to retire was based on misleading advice, it was involuntary and therefore an adverse action; and because it was effected without benefit of the procedures agencies are required to follow in effecting adverse actions, the individual's employing agency was ordered to cancel the retirement and reinstate him retroactively in his former position); <span class="Italic">Aldridge</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 21, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 13 (the Board remanded the appeal for a hearing on the issue of whether the appellant's retirement was the result of agency misinformation and therefore an involuntary act within the Board's jurisdiction as a constructive discharge); <span class="Italic">Rysavy</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. at 265 (the Board remanded the appeal for a hearing on whether the appellant's retirement prior to the effective date of his scheduled RIF action was involuntary, and therefore tantamount to a removal, because it was based on misinformation regarding the effect of the retirement on his right to appeal the RIF action).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The other case on which the administrative judge relied, i.e., <span class="Italic">Cortinas</span>, concerns misleading information on which the individual relied in electing, at the time of his separation, to receive a monthly annuity rather than a lump-sum distribution of his retirement contributions. <span class="Italic">See Cortinas</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. at 515. This case has no relevance to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336 (d)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[T]he Board has long held that the determination of an involuntary separation for retirement purposes under 5 U.S.C. [chapter] 83 is totally separate and distinct from a determination of involuntary retirement or resignation for Board jurisdictional purposes under 5 U.S.C. [chapter] 75." <span class="Italic">Allen v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 212, 216 (1998). In the present case, the appellant does not allege that his former employer obtained his resignation in violation of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 by providing him, either intentionally or negligently, with misinformation, and he does not seek to have his separation from the Postal Service cancelled. Instead, as we have indicated above, he seeks to have his disability retirement annuity replaced with a discontinued service annuity. The cases on which the administrative judge relied therefore are inapplicable here. <span class="Italic">See Sanderson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 311, 316 (1996) (even if the appellant's former employing agency had obtained his resignation by providing him with misinformation regarding his entitlement to an annuity, a finding of involuntariness based on such misinformation would be insufficient to establish entitlement to a discontinued service retirement annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336 (d)), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 129 F.3d 134 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 522 U.S. 1115 (1998); <span class="Italic">Gammill v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 484, 488-89 (1985) (the employing agency's incorrect statement that the appellant would be eligible for a discontinued service annuity if he retired, although providing a basis for voiding the resignation and restoring the appellant to the employment rolls, did not make the appellant eligible for an annuity).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that our reviewing court has considered a case similar to the one now before us. In <span class="Italic">Nebblett v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 237 F.3d 1353, 1354-55 (Fed. Cir. 2001), it addressed a claim that the petitioner's employing agency had coerced the petitioner's resignation through improper actions (in that case, intolerable working conditions), that the petitioner accordingly was involuntarily separated, and that she therefore was entitled to a discontinued service retirement annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336 (d)(1). The court noted that a separation obtained through intolerable working conditions or through misinformation was unlawful, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1358, and it held that the "type of involuntary separation to which section 8336(d)(1) speaks is one that results from lawful agency action," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1359. It concluded, therefore, that, even if the petitioner could prove that her resignation was involuntary as alleged, she would not be eligible to receive a discontinued service annuity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court's decision in the case described above, as well as the underlying Board decision in the same case, was based in part on a provision of the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) defining the term "involuntary," as that term was used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336 (d)(1). The court noted that the FPM defined that term as applying to separations under conditions such as "reductions in force, expiration of an incumbent's term of office, and other actions, all of which are proper and legal acts taken by an agency that result in an employee's involuntary separation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1356; <span class="Italic">see Nebblett v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 524, &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (referring to same definition). Although the FPM has been abolished, OPM has continued to define the term in a similar manner in its <span class="Italic">CSRS and FERS Handbook (Handbook)</span>, whose provisions have superseded the relevant part of the FPM. <span class="Italic">See Handbook</span>, &#x00A7; 44A1.1-2A; <span class="Italic">Nebblett</span>, 237 F.3d at 1358. According to the Handbook, "[a]n involuntary separation that may qualify an employee for a discontinued service retirement is any separation against the will and without the consent of the employee other than a separation for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency." <span class="Italic">Handbook</span>, &#x00A7; 44A1.1-2A.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in the Handbook definition quoted above suggests that the separation of the appellant in this case for disability retirement qualifies as an "involuntary separation" for purposes of discontinued service retirement. The appellant does not argue that his separation was against his will or without his consent, and he does not deny that he voluntarily applied for retirement. Moreover, none of the examples the Handbook includes with its definition describe circumstances that could be said to be present here.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Examples of "involuntary separations" listed in the Handbook include, in addition to the ones mentioned by the court in <span class="Italic">Nebblett</span>, "[u]nacceptable performance (unless due to employee's misconduct)," "[r]eassignment outside commuting area when no mobility agreement exists," and "[f]ailure to continue to meet qualification requirements of the position...." <span class="Italic">Handbook</span>, &#x00A7; 44A1-1-2A.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The case now before us differs somewhat from <span class="Italic">Nebblett</span> in that the appellant in this case allegedly relied on misinformation that was provided by OPM, rather than by his employing agency. The decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414 (1990), however, indicates that these differences are immaterial to the outcome of this case. In <span class="Italic">Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. at 416, 434, the Court held that an individual's reliance on misinformation provided by a government official could not serve as a basis for the individual's entitlement to annuity benefits not otherwise permitted by law. Moreover, while the misinformation at issue in that case was provided by an official of the individual's employing agency, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 416-17, nothing in <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> suggests that the result in the case would have been different if the misinformation had been provided by OPM. Instead, the reasoning on which the decision is based indicates that misinformation provided by any Executive Branch official would provide an insufficient basis for awarding benefits because that branch is not empowered by the Constitution to overrule "the difficult judgments reached by Congress as to the common good...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 427-28; <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 428 ("If agents of the Executive were able, by their unauthorized oral or written statements to citizens, to obligate the Treasury for the payment of funds, the control over public funds that the [Appropriations] Clause reposes in Congress in effect could be transferred to the Executive.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we need not determine whether OPM's 2002 approval of the appellant's disability retirement application can properly be regarded as the providing of misinformation or misleading information on which the appellant relied to his detriment. Even if it can properly be regarded in this manner, it does not provide a proper basis on which to find that the appellant is entitled to a discontinued service retirement annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336 (d)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A resignation to obtain a discontinued service retirement is not involuntary even though an agency personnel specialist informs the appellant that the resignation may be appealed on the basis that it is involuntary. The result is explained in the distinction between the right to challenge any resignation as involuntary and the determination on the merits of whether the resignation is involuntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. USDA</span>, 832 F.2d 1259 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Nebblett v. OPM</span>, 83 MSPR 524, 527 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (intolerable working conditions do not establish an involuntary separation for purposes of entitlement to a discontinued service annuity), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Nebblett v. OPM</span>, 237 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2001), <span class="Italic">post</span>. [Refer to the ability to appeal a personnel action that provides the basis for an appellant's discontinued service annuity in Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-047.html#sec2-46">Retirement Appeal</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a RIF is lawful, the resultant discontinued service annuity cannot be challenged as involuntary, <span class="Italic">Riccio v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 98 MSPR 345, 347-48 &#x00B6; 7 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the agency is unable to support its decision to separate the appellant by RIF, then the appellant would be entitled to reinstatement, back pay, and <span id="Page_2040"></span>related remedies without regard to involuntary retirement doctrine, and he could not receive any further relief via an involuntary retirement claim. Conversely, if the agency's decision to separate the appellant by RIF was valid, then the appellant's claim that his discontinued service retirement was involuntary would automatically fail. <span class="Italic">See Scalese v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 247, 249 (1995) (a successful appeal from a removal for cause moots a claim of involuntary retirement because the remedy for an involuntary retirement would already have been received, whereas affirmance of a removal for cause precludes a finding that a retirement resulting from the removal was involuntary; in either case an involuntary retirement claim need not be addressed, as all of the appellant's rights are determined upon adjudication of the removal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The existence of discontinued service annuity status does not bar the constructive adverse retirement appeal if the annuity status is the result of improper agency action. Discontinued service annuity following separation by RIF did not bar a USERRA action based on the agency's failure properly to assign the employee prior to the RIF and following his return from military service. The agency's violation of the employee's USERRA rights rendered the retirement involuntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rogers v. Dept. of Army</span>, 88 MSPR 610, 618-19 &#x00B6; 17 (2001); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dobratz v. DHHS</span>, 53 MSPR 9 (1992) (a discontinued service annuity did not moot a challenge to the underlying Chapter 43 removal that qualified the appellant for the annuity).</p>
