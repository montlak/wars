<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-71"><span class="space">3.</span> Crediting Plan; Rating Scheme</h4>
<p class="noindent">The Merit Systems Protection Board described crediting plans, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Devine</span>, 8 MSPR 640, 642-43 (1981):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A crediting plan is an evaluation tool to measure and compare the qualifications of applicants.&#x2003;After the various evaluation criteria for a position have been selected and the sources from which applicant information will be drawn have been identified, benchmarks are developed for each of those criteria at various levels. These benchmarks, which comprise the core of a crediting plan, are written descriptions of what experience, education, training, appraisals information, awards, and tests and/or interview results will constitute excellent, good, moderate or limited possession of the evaluation criteria. Numerical values are assigned to each benchmark under each criterion and, utilizing these numerical values, evaluation boards determine the individual ratings of the applicants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Crediting plans are intended to provide a systematic and reliable means for assigning rating levels when evaluating applicants' backgrounds for promotion purposes. When there are numerous applications to evaluate, the basis for assigning ratings to an applicant's background would vary if there were no written documentation as to the reasons for or methods of assigning ratings. It is the goal of crediting plans to reduce inconsistencies in rating techniques and arbitrary assessments of evaluation criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because of their importance to the selection process, unions, understandably, would like unlimited access to crediting plans. Knowing their content would place a union in a more informed position from which to bargain regarding the selection of evaluation criteria, the assignment of numerical values, and the wording of benchmarks. It would also enable a union to afford more informed representation in a grievance proceeding to a union member who suspected that the contents of a crediting plan had been manipulated to enable a selecting official to discriminate for or against a particular applicant.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Allenwood Fed. Prison Camp, Montgomery and AFGE Local 148</span>, 51 FLRA 650, 651 n.2 (1995), adopted a definition of a crediting plan:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"'Crediting plans' are documents developed by an employer to rate and rank candidates for a specific position. A crediting plan typically consists <span id="Page_329"></span>of a list of criteria reflecting the knowledge, skills, and other characteristics deemed necessary for a particular job, as well as devices used to measure whether a candidate satisfies those criteria." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons v. FLRA</span>, 988 F.2d 1267, 1268 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 63 FLRA 70 (2009) (considering in context of arbitration award application to crediting plans of 5 CFR Part 300, governing federal sector employment practices, and 29 CFR Part 1607, involving uniform guidelines governing validation of crediting plans that have adverse impact on any race, sex, or ethnic group); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 64 FLRA 127, 130-31 (2009) (distinguishing requirements of 5 CFR Part 300 for establishment of qualification standards for newly-created positions from selective factors for award consideration).</p>
<p class="noindent">A crediting plan could be relevant and necessary for the union properly to process a grievance concerning nonselection for promotion. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Region VIII and NTEU</span>, 18 FLRA 377, 389-90 (1985) (ALJ Decision). But there was no requirement, either under &#x00A7; 7114 or through collective bargaining, that an agency provide a union with all of its crediting plans. Under <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 23 FLRA 681, 683-84 (1986), a proposal for the release and disclosure of crediting plans and related rating information was nonnegotiable because it required blanket disclosure, regardless of whether release would undermine the fairness and validity of selection procedures. <span class="Italic">GSA and AFGE Local 236</span>, 29 FLRA 197, 200 (1987), <span class="Italic">on remand</span> from 19 FLRA 418 (1985), explained that blanket disclosure of crediting plans would not be required for collective bargaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Montana Air Chapter of Association of Civilian Technicians and U.S. Department of the Air Force, Montana Air National Guard</span>, 19 FLRA 946 (1985), the Authority adopted the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service v. FLRA</span>, 762 F.2d 119 (D.C. Cir. 1985). The court's decision reversed the Authority's decision that crediting plans were negotiable in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service</span>, 11 FLRA 247 (1983). In <span class="Italic">Montana</span>, the Authority concurred in the result reached by the court and determined that the content of crediting plans is not within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since the content of crediting plans is not a negotiable matter, we conclude that the information is not "necessary" within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4)(B) and, therefore, the Union is not entitled to the Respondent's plans to pursue its stated purpose of negotiating regarding their content. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. and Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Dams Project, Boulder City, Nevada</span>, 26 FLRA No. 98 (1987)....</p>
<p class="noindent">The bar against blanket disclosure of crediting plans prevented the negotiability of a proposal that employees be entitled to see any records used in the ranking or rating process under merit promotion procedures. The now abolished FPM Supp. 335-1, Subch. S6 and FPM Letter 335-15 were considered government-wide regulations precluding the disclosures. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1858 and Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal Commissary</span>, 27 FLRA 69, 73 (1987) (relying on <span class="Italic">Customs Serv.</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>). But under [the now abolished] FPM Supp. 335-1, Subch. S6, release of crediting plans was authorized if the release would not create any unfair advantage to some candidates or compromise the utility of the selection process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior and AFGE Local 1978</span>, 26 FLRA 832, 835-36 (1987). The determination of whether release of the plans creates an unfair advantage or compromises the system should be based on the particular circumstances present on a case-by-case basis, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army Hq., XVIII Airborne Corps and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 26 FLRA 407, 413 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Ft.

<p class="noindent-1">In the cases under consideration, we find that disclosure of the requested data would not create an unfair advantage to some candidates or compromise the utility of the Agency's selection process and, therefore, disclosure would not be contrary to the requirements of the FPM. The requests are limited to two specific selection actions and do not require the blanket disclosure of all agency crediting plans....&#8197;The crediting plans in these cases will be subject to limited disclosure to the Union to fulfill its representational duties. We believe that disclosure under these circumstances will not result in an unfair advantage to prospective candidates (the subject selection actions have been substantially completed) and that disclosure will not destroy the integrity of the Agency's selection process....&#8197;[U]nit employees, who may be Union members, have sat on the rating panel and have had access to the crediting plan; and there was no evidence that in the past the Union had disseminated the information so as to prejudice the selection process.</p>
<p class="noindent">Relying on <span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1858 and Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal Commissary</span>, 27 FLRA 69, 75-77 (1987), determined to be negotiable a proposal that the union be allowed access to the complete merit promotion selection data (including crediting plans) when no unfair advantage was created for some candidates and the utility of the selection process was not compromised. Also negotiable was a copy of the merit promotion selection roster, if requested in writing, when a unit employee asked the union to represent him in a formal complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously explained...in [<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>], we found that a proposal was outside the duty to bargain because it required blanket disclosure of existing agency crediting plans without regard to whether release of those plans would undermine the fairness and validity of the selection procedure. We also found, however, that under FPM Supplement 335-1, subchapter S6, release of crediting plans is authorized where the release would not create any unfair advantage to some candidates or compromise the utility of the selection process. A determination as to whether release of crediting plans would create an unfair advantage or compromise the utility of the selection process depends on the particular circumstances present and should be made on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In [<span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg</span>]...we found that disclosure of the requested data would <span class="Italic">not</span> create an unfair advantage to some candidates or compromise the utility of the agency's selection process and therefore would not be contrary to the requirements of the FPM. The requests were limited to two specific selection actions and did not require blanket disclosures of all agency crediting plans. The crediting plans were subject to limited disclosure to the union to fulfill its representational duties. We stated that disclosure under those circumstances would not result in an unfair advantage to prospective candidates (because the selection actions had been completed) nor would it destroy the integrity of the agency's selection process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The disclosures of crediting plans contemplated...here are directly analogous to the disclosures in <span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg</span>. The provision requires Union access to selection data only when a unit employee has asked the Union for representation in connection with a formal complaint. As implied by the provision and confirmed by the Union's explanation, the selection data covered by the provision is data which has [sic] already been used in a selection action. The Union also has explained that its access to this information will be limited to instances in which the information is necessary to enable the Union to evaluate the fairness of a completed selection action in connection with an EEO complaint, a contractual grievance, or an unfair labor practice. This explanation is consistent with the provision's wording. Adopting this explanation of the provision for the purpose of this decision, we conclude--absent a showing by the Agency that the Union had disseminated this type of information in the past so as to prejudice the Agency's procedures--that the disclosures of crediting plans covered by this provision are the equivalent of those in <span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another example of individualized analysis of disclosure of crediting plans is <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Council 33</span>, 40 FLRA 449 (1991), <span class="Italic">remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Allenwood Prison Camp v. FLRA</span>, 988 F.2d 1267, 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">post</span>, determining, 40 FLRA at 456-60:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority previously has addressed disclosure of information contained in crediting plans in various contexts.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service</span>, 23 FLRA 681 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>), the Authority found that a proposal that would require an agency to disclose existing crediting plans to a union, on request, was inconsistent with FPM Supplement 335-1, subchapter S5-3(c), which the Authority found to be a Government-wide rule or regulation. The Authority noted that subchapter S5-3(c) provides that "[c]rediting plans...should not be released...if, in the agency's view, such release would undermine the fairness and validity of the selection procedure." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 683. The Authority found that a determination as to whether release of crediting plans would create an unfair advantage or compromise the utility of the selection process should be made on a case-by-case basis. The Authority concluded that the proposal in <span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span> would have authorized a blanket disclosure of existing crediting plans without regard to whether the release of such plans would undermine the fairness and validity of the selection procedure. Consequently, the Authority concluded that the proposal was inconsistent with the FPM and was outside the duty to bargain....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Authority has found proposals authorizing blanket disclosure of crediting plans to be outside the duty to bargain, the Authority has required the disclosure of information relating to crediting plans where a union has established the right to such information to fulfill its representational functions under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. For example, the Authority has found that unions are entitled to crediting plans in order to determine whether to file grievances on behalf of unit employees. The failure of an agency to provide the requested information in such circumstances has been found to violate the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More particularly, in <span class="Italic">Fort Bragg</span> the Authority found that the FPM did not prohibit the release of the requested data, which included crediting plans. Utilizing the case-by-case approach suggested in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> for determining whether the release of crediting plans would create an unfair advantage or compromise the utility of the selection process, the Authority concluded that disclosure of the plans would not conflict with the FPM. The Authority noted that the requests were limited to two specific selection actions and did not require the blanket disclosure of all agency crediting plans. Moreover, disclosure of the plans was necessary for the union to fulfill its representational duties. Consequently, <span id="Page_330"></span>noting that the selection actions had been substantially completed, the Authority concluded that disclosure would not result in an unfair advantage to prospective candidates and would not destroy the integrity of the agency's selection process. 26 FLRA at 413.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Union's request for the crediting plan was clearly to fulfill its representational functions under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. A unit member was not selected to fill a vacancy for which he had applied. The Union requested the appropriate crediting plan in order to determine whether to file a grievance over the selection action. The Union also requested information on each of the applicants for the position, including performance appraisals, education and experience....&#8197;There is no evidence in the stipulated record that the Respondent objected to disclosing this information. Without the additional information that would be provided by the crediting plan, however, the Union has no way of evaluating the information that it apparently has received in order to determine whether it should file a grievance on behalf of the prospective grievant. Indeed, in this situation, the crediting plan is critical to a determination of whether the selection procedure was improperly conducted or whether there is a strong argument that the prospective grievant should have been chosen for the position. Therefore, we find that the information was necessary within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that the Respondent has some concerns that disclosure of the requested plan might affect the integrity of the evaluation process.&#x2003;In view of the fact that the selection process at issue here has been completed, and that there is no evidence that the Union would use the requested information for any purpose other than to evaluate this grievance, however, we conclude that disclosure will not result in an unfair advantage to prospective candidates and will not destroy the integrity of the Agency's selection process....&#8197;Accordingly, the failure of the Respondent to provide the requested information in such circumstances is a violation of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the Respondent's assertion that the grievance was nongrievable did not relieve the Respondent of its obligation to furnish otherwise necessary information....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the Respondent's argument that the release of the crediting plan would interfere with its right to determine its internal security practices, the Authority has held that an agency's right to determine its internal security practices concerns the right to determine policies and take actions that are part of its management's plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, its physical property, and its operations....&#8197;Additionally, in arguing that a particular plan or policy falls within the scope of the right to determine internal security practices, an agency must show that there is a reasonable link between the plan or policy and the security of its personnel, property or operations....&#8197;We find that the Respondent has not identified in what manner the release of a specific crediting plan, requested with respect to a particular promotion action, would affect its ability to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property, or operations. Accordingly, even assuming that the Respondent is correct in arguing that disclosure of information under section 7114(b)(4) could impermissibly interfere with its rights under section 71O6(a), we find that the release of the crediting plan would not directly interfere with management's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent">Compulsory disclosure of crediting plans and similar ranking criteria came under close scrutiny in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Allenwood Prison Camp v. FLRA</span>, 988 F.2d 1267, 1269-72 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The court determined that FLRA was required to compel unions to make a particularized showing of need in order to obtain a crediting plan, and that FLRA was required to consider, before directing disclosure, countervailing considerations, e.g., agency concerns about the security of data released to unions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is the latest in a series of attempts by federal employee unions to gain access to agency crediting plans.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. United States Customs Serv.</span>, 802 F.2d 525, 531 (D.C. Cir. 1986), the union attempted to obtain Customs Service crediting plans under the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA"), 5 USC 552 (1988). This Court held that the crediting plans were exempt from disclosure because they "related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(2) (1988). The Court explained that "advance knowledge of the plans by applicants would allow and induce at least some of them to embellish--or perhaps even fabricate--their backgrounds to suit the appropriate crediting plan." 802 F.2d at 529. The Eleventh Circuit reached the same result in <span class="Italic">Kaganove v. EPA</span>, 856 F.2d 884, 886-90 (7th Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 488 U.S. 1011, 109 S. Ct. 798, 102 L. Ed.2d 789 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the proceedings we now review, federal employee unions seek access to crediting plans under the FSLMRS, which requires a federal agency to disclose information "necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B). The issue before us is the meaning and application of this necessity requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA held that the unions needed access to the crediting plans in order to determine whether a disappointed employee has a grievable grievance against the agency.&#x2003;In assessing the unions' need, the FLRA applied a broad standard, focusing upon the relevance of the information sought. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Allenwood</span>, 40 F.L.R.A. No. 42, at 10. Under this standard a union satisfies the necessity requirement of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) if the data sought "<span class="Italic">would be useful</span> to the Union in the investigation and/or presentation of a potential grievance." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Serv., Border Patrol, El Paso, Texas</span>, 37 F.L.R.A. 1310, 1320 (1990) (emphasis added). The FLRA urges that its application of the broad standard is appropriate because crediting plans are the "Rosetta stone," without which "[a] union could not hope to make an intelligent decision as to whether a selection action was properly conducted by management."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's interpretation of "necessity" is inconsistent with this Court's decisions in two cases decided since the FLRA rulings in these cases. In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 956 F.2d 1223, 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), and <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 523, 532 (D.C. Cir. 1992), we made clear that &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) requires a union to demonstrate a "particularized need" for information it seeks. In evaluating whether a union has satisfied this standard, the Authority must consider 1) the union's particularized need for the requested information sought, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 952 F.2d at 532 (the particularized need standard may well be met "<span class="Italic">where the union has a grievable complaint covering the information</span>"; <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, 956 F.2d at 1225 (same), and 2) the countervailing anti-disclosure interests of the agency, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 952 F.2d at 531 ("[a] Statute that requires 'necessity' implicitly recognizes countervailing interests, because a 'need,' by definition, is an interest of particular strength and urgency."); <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, 956 F.2d at 1224 ("The Authority should have considered countervailing interests against disclosure, and because it did not do so we remand for reconsideration.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA argues first, that the "particularized need" analysis should not be applied to the crediting plans here at issue; and second, that even under the "particularized need" test, the Authority correctly ordered disclosure of the crediting plans. We find both of these arguments to be without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The argument that the "particularized need" test should not apply here relies on the proposition that "Authority analysis of union need for data in the grievance setting has generally focused only on whether the data <span class="Italic">would be useful</span> to the union in grievance investigation or presentation." Respondent's Br. at 16 (emphasis added). The FLRA urges that "considerations such as the employers' countervailing interests against disclosure need not be considered in resolving these cases." Respondent's Br. at 20. This argument is a non-starter. We rejected this theory, advanced under the rubric of a relevance test, in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA attempts to distinguish the information sought in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span> as "predecisional, deliberative management memos...and employee disciplinary records," whereas the information contained in the crediting plans are "objective, non-personal data." Respondent's Br. at 16. From this the FLRA concludes that "[t]he unions' data requests in these cases therefore should not be judged by the stringent standards set by this Court's 'particularized need' analysis in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and [<span class="Italic">Air Force</span>]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This argument avails the Authority nothing. The FSLMRS does not distinguish between "predecisional, deliberative" data and "objective, non-personal data." The necessity requirement stipulated in section 7114(b)(4)(B) is unitary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's second response to <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span> is a half-hearted insistence that even under a "particularized need" analysis, the Authority correctly ordered disclosure of the crediting plans. The FLRA argues it balanced the agencies' interests in nondisclosure against the unions' need for the crediting plans and reminds us that it is entitled to deference in balancing the competing interests at issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Beth Israel Hosp. v. NLRB</span>, 437 U.S. 483, 501, 98 S. Ct. 2463, 2473, 57 L. Ed.2d 370 (1978) (striking the balance between conflicting legitimate interests under the national labor laws is "'often a difficult and delicate responsibility, which the Congress committed primarily to the National Labor Relations Board, subject to limited judicial review'") (quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local Union No. 449</span>, 353 U.S. 87, 96, 77 S. Ct. 643, 648, 1 L. Ed.2d 676 (1957)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While mindful of the deference we owe federal agencies in applying statutes they administer, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984), we are constrained to conclude that the FLRA's decisions do not pass muster under the necessity requirement of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B), as clarified by this Court in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>. In each of these cases, the FLRA entirely failed to consider whether the union had a particularized need, comparable to the potentially grievable complaints considered in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>. In <span class="Italic">Allenwood</span>, the Authority merely stated that "the [agency's] assertion that the grievance was nongrievable did not relieve [it] of its obligation to furnish" the information. 40 FLRA No. 42, at 10. The reasoning of the ALJs in the two <span class="Italic">HUD</span> cases, which the Authority adopted without analysis, is similarly spare....</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_331"></span>These conclusory assertions plainly do not satisfy the requirement that the FLRA weigh the particularized need of the union for the information against the agency's interest in withholding it before ordering disclosure of a crediting plan. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 952 F.2d at 531-32. On other occasions, the Authority itself has recognized that under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) "a union's mere assertion that it needs data to process a grievance does not automatically oblige the agency to supply such data." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n, Washington, D.C.</span>, 20 FLRA 357, 357-58 (1985). While it is true that &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) does not require a union actually to file a grievance before it seeks information pursuant to the FSLMRS, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Govt Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1345 v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 1360, 1364 (D.C. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span> make clear that a union is required to articulate some, particularized need for the information sought.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This conclusion is neither novel nor unique to the federal context.&#x2003;Even in the private sector--where disclosure is governed by the less stringent relevance standard--a union is not entitled to information absent "some initial, but not overwhelming, demonstration by the union that some violation is or has been taking place." <span class="Italic">San Diego Newspaper Guild, Local No. 95 v. NLRB</span>, 548 F.2d 863, 869 (9th Cir. 1977); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB</span>, 440 U.S. 301, 314, 99 S. Ct. 1123, 1131, 59 L. Ed.2d 333 (1979) ("A union's bare assertion that it needs information to process a grievance does not automatically oblige the employer to supply all the information in the manner requested.")....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA also impermissibly minimized or disregarded the important antidisclosure interests of the agencies.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Allenwood</span>, the FLRA dismissed the agency's concerns by noting that the selection process had been completed and that the union had not indicated that it would use the crediting plan for any purpose other than to process the possible grievance. <span class="Italic">Allenwood</span>, 40 F.L.R.A. No. 42, at 10. In the two <span class="Italic">HUD</span> cases, the Authority simply adopted thinly reasoned findings of its ALJs, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">HUD-1</span>, 42 F.L.R.A. No. 71, at 2; HUD-2, 43 F.L.R.A. No. 60, at 1-2, which dismissed the agencies' countervailing interests solely on the fact that the selection process had terminated....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Allenwood</span> the FLRA appeared to suggest that the union would not allow the crediting plan to leak out, <span class="Italic">see</span> 40 F.L.R.A. No. 42, at 10, but the union certainly made no guarantees in that case, and neither the ALJs nor the Authority said anything about this matter in either of the other two cases under review. Contrary to respondents' wish, the possibility of union misuse of the information must be of concern to the FLRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB</span>, 440 U.S. 301, 315, 99 S. Ct. 1123, 1131, 59 L. Ed.2d 333 (1979) (holding that NLRB abused its discretion in requiring employer to release to union certain employee aptitude tests used to screen job applicants, in part because the "remedy selected by the Board does not adequately protect the security of the tests"). In response to earlier attempts to gain access to crediting plans under FOIA, this and other courts have explicitly recognized agencies' interests in the confidentiality of crediting plans. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. United States Customs Serv.</span>, 802 F.2d 525, 531 (D.C. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Kaganove v. EPA</span>, 856 F.2d 884, 886-90 (7th Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 488 U.S. 1011, 109 S. Ct. 798, 102 L. Ed.2d 789 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA maintains that the agencies' legitimate concerns about the harm of disclosure in the FOIA cases are simply not present in these cases because the personnel decisions at issue are complete. This argument is not only inadequate, but disingenuous. As the agencies point out, crediting plans are often re-used. In any event, if a union was successful in its unfair labor practice complaint, another job search to fill the job at issue would be required, presumably utilizing the same crediting plan, the contents of which would be known to the union. Thus, the mere fact that the challenged selection process has been completed does not eliminate or reduce agencies' interest in maintaining the confidentiality of their crediting plans.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(b)(4)(B), as explained in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, requires the FLRA to determine whether a union has demonstrated a particularized need for the information sought. This mandates an inquiry into whether the union has a particularized need for the information, and whether the union's need is outweighed by the agency's countervailing interest in keeping the crediting plans confidential. In these cases the FLRA applied a less demanding test, based solely upon the usefulness or relevance of the requested information to the union, and failed adequately to assess either the particularized need for access to the crediting plans or the countervailing agency interest. Thus, we grant the petitions for review and remand these cases so the FLRA can ascertain the necessity of the requested crediting plans in accordance with the Statute, as construed in <span class="Italic">Air Force</span> and <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Allenwood</span> was followed as to the "particularized need" analysis in <span class="Italic">VA v. FLRA</span>, 1 F.3d 19, 23 (D.C. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The court's analysis was adopted by the Authority and <span class="Italic">Allenwood</span> was remanded to the Authority's ALJ for additional factfinding in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Allenwood Fed. Prison Camp and AFGE Council 33, Local 148</span>, 49 FLRA 597, 602 (1994). Following remand, FLRA concluded that the union did not demonstrate a particularized need for the crediting plan, <span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Allenwood Fed. Prison Camp, Montgomery and AFGE Local 148</span>, 51 FLRA 650, 655 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union stated in its request that it needed the crediting plan to investigate the nonselection of two unit employees--Vogel and Cuddeback--for promotion to a supervisory position, and that a timely response was required due to the "extremely tight [time] frame for filing grievances and/or unfair labor practices." However, the request did not describe in any way the grievance or ULP under consideration. In addition, the Union's request stated that "[f]ailure to provide this information...in a timely manner will be deemed cause for the Union to have to file an [u]nfair [l]abor [p]ractice...." This reference to a ULP reasonably could be interpreted as a threat to file a ULP charge if the requested information was not released by a particular date.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Union's request for the crediting plan was not sufficient for the Respondent to make a "reasoned judgment" as to whether disclosure was required. <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 50 FLRA at 670. In so doing, we reject as unsupported the Judge's statement that, by referring to the possibility of an unfair labor practice, the Union's request for information "made clear" to the Respondent that the crediting plan was needed because "discrimination was suspected." As such, the Union failed to establish that the crediting plan is necessary, within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4)(B). In these circumstances, the Respondent was not obligated to provide the Union with the requested information under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In order to demonstrate that information is "necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining" under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, a union "must establish a particularized need for the information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs the requested information, including the uses to which the union will put the information, and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute." <span class="Italic">IRS, Wash., D.C.,</span> 50 FLRA at 669. It is not sufficient that the information would simply be useful or relevant; instead, the information must be "required in order for the union adequately to represent its members." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 669-70. The union's responsibility for articulating its interests in the requested information requires more than a conclusory assertion and must permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether disclosure of the information is required under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 670. To accomplish this, a union must articulate its need at or near the time of the request, not for the first time at the ULP hearing. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, INS, N. Region, Twin Cities, Minn.,</span> 51 FLRA 1467, 1472 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency is responsible for establishing any countervailing anti-disclosure interests and, like the union, must do so in more than a conclusory way. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 1472-473. <span class="Italic">See also HCFA,</span> 56 FLRA at 506. Such interests must be raised at or near the time it denies the union's request. <span class="Italic">See United States DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Det. Ctr., Houston, Tex.,</span> 60 FLRA 91, 93 (2004) (<span class="Italic">FDC Houston</span>) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record supports the Judge's determination that neither of the Union's information requests articulated a particularized need for the crediting plan. As the Judge found, the Union's initial request explained its need for the requested information, including the crediting plan, in order to determine whether the Agency complied with all applicable laws and merit promotion principles in its selection procedures. In response to its initial request, the agency provided the Union the opportunity to review the entire promotion file, except for the crediting plan. It is undisputed that Union officials were provided an opportunity to come to the Agency's office and review the promotion file and compare the KSA responses of the two correctional officers with those of the other applicants, including the selectee. The GC also acknowledges that if a thorough review had been conducted by the Union officials, they "would have known, to an absolute certainty" whether the selection process was flawed, and the Union would not have required access to the crediting plan to discover an error in the selection process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union then submitted a second information request that was essentially identical to the first but also included a section labeled "particularized need." Even though that section used the same language that the Authority found to establish a particularized need in <span class="Italic">HCFA,</span> the specific facts of this case warrant a different result.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">HCFA,</span> the agency produced no documents in response to the union's two information requests and expressed no security concerns regarding the disclosure of crediting plans. By contrast, here, the Agency produced "upwards of several hundreds of pages" and provided the Union the opportunity to review the entire promotion file, except the crediting plan, and to explain why those documents did not satisfy its needs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, unlike the agency in <span class="Italic">HCFA,</span> the Agency human resources officer here denied access to the crediting plan in response to the first <span id="Page_332"></span>request based on her understanding that access to crediting plans was restricted to members of the rating panel. In response to the second request, the Agency cited decisions from the District of Columbia and Seventh Circuits which held that crediting plans are exempt from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(2), because they relate "solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency." <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v, United States Customs Serv.,</span> 802 F.2d 525, 531 (D.C. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Kaganove v. EPA,</span> 856 F.2d 884, 886-90 (7th Cir. 1988). Subsequently, the D.C. Circuit held that the potential for harm from disclosure continued even after the challenged selection process was completed. <span class="Italic">United States Dept of Justice, Bureau of Prisons v. FLRA,</span> 988 F.2d 1267 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>),</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC argues that the Agency's explanation of its countervailing anti-disclosure concerns were "not responsive to" the Union's offer to view the crediting plans instead of receiving a copy. In this regard, the GC mistakenly asserts that the cases cited by the agency address only risks associated with the release of copies of crediting plans. All three decisions discussed above concern the risks of disclosing information within the crediting plan regardless of the method of disclosure. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons,</span> the DC Circuit determined that having the contents "known to the Union" would compromise the agencies' interest in maintaining the confidentiality of their crediting plans." 988 F.2d at 1272.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the GC offers additional explanations of the Union's need for the crediting plan, specifically that: (1) access to the crediting plan would enhance the Union's litigation posture in arbitration; (2) a thorough review of the promotion file would have been too burdensome; and (3) the Union's information request was based not on the non-selections of the two correctional officers, but, instead, on an investigation of the selection process as a whole. However, the Authority will only consider assertions that are made at or near the time of the request and not those that are made for the first time at the ULP hearing. <span class="Italic">See Twin Cities,</span> 51 FLRA at 1472; <span class="Italic">United States EEOC,</span> 51 FLRA 248, 258 (1995) (Authority declined to consider GC's explanation, at the hearing, for the Union's need for work assignment information when the Union offered no explanation at the time of the information request). Based on the foregoing, the Authority finds that the Union did not articulate a particularized need for the crediting plan at or near the time of its requests for information.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">USDA, APHIS and Nat'l Ass'n of Agric. Employees, Branch 15</span>, 26 FLRA 630, 634-35 (1987), decided before the <span class="Italic">Allenwood</span> decisions, considered, in the context of a ULP case, the release of a set of evaluation criteria called a rating scheme, requested by the union to determine whether to file a grievance concerning its belief that the agency deviated from publicly announced evaluation criteria for filling a vacant position. The union was entitled to the information; release of the information was not prohibited by law under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg, North Carolina</span>, 26 FLRA No. 52 (1987), we recently decided that even if FPM Supplement 335-1 is a "law" within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4), it does not prohibit release of crediting plans in all circumstances. Citing our decision in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service</span>, 23 FLRA No. 91 (1986), we reiterated the finding that under FPM Supplement 335-1, release of crediting plans is authorized where the release would not create any unfair advantage to some candidates or compromise the utility of the selection process. Therefore, the determination as to whether release of the information would create an unfair advantage or compromise the utility of a selection process depends on the particular circumstances present and, consequently, should be made on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Union requested a copy of the rating scheme for the purpose of processing a grievance concerning the filling of a particular position. The information was sought to enable the Union to determine whether the Respondent had structured the rating scheme in such a way as to unilaterally change the criteria for the position as set forth in the vacancy announcement in violation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. The Union's request does not require blanket disclosure of the Respondent's crediting plans. Rather, disclosure of the rating scheme pertains to only one selection and would enable the Union to fulfill its representational responsibilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, in agreement with the Judge, we find that in the particular circumstances of this case, disclosure of the rating scheme will not create any unfair advantage to prospective candidates for the particular position involved, since the disputed selection action has been completed, and that disclosure will not compromise the Respondent's selection process. We find that where, as here, the requested information is necessary to the processing of a grievance, a bare assertion that an unfair advantage or compromise of selection procedures will result from release of the information, based on nothing more than speculation that the information will be used improperly by the Union for other purposes, does not establish that release of the information would be contrary to FPM Supplement 335-1. We note that the Union has had representatives present at Promotion Review Panel proceedings in the past....&#8197;There is no showing that the Union has disseminated the information contrary to the restrictions of FPM Supplement 335-1.</p>
