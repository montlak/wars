<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-245"><span id="page_2147"></span><span class="space">o.</span> Preparatory Time; Changing Clothing; Preliminary and Postliminary Activities</h5>
<p class="noindent">5 CFR 551.412 (2022), implementing the FLSA, provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Preparatory or concluding activities</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;(1) If an agency reasonably determines that a preparatory or concluding activity is closely related to an employee's principal activities, and is indispensable to the performance of the principal activities, and that the total time spent in that activity is more than 10 minutes per workday, the agency shall credit all of the time spent in that activity, including the 10 minutes, as hours of work.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;If the time spent in a preparatory or concluding activity is compensable as hours of work, the agency shall schedule the time period for the employee to perform that activity. An employee shall be credited with the actual time spent in that activity during the time period scheduled by the agency. In no case shall the time credited for the performance of an activity exceed the time scheduled by the agency. The employee shall be credited for the time spent performing preparatory or concluding activities in accordance with paragraph (b) of &#x00A7; 551.521 of this part.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;A preparatory or concluding activity that is not closely related to the performance of the principal activities is considered a preliminary or postliminary activity. Time spent in preliminary or postliminary activities is excluded from hours of work and is not compensable, even if it occurs between periods of activity that are compensable as hours of work.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court provided guidance on FLSA compensation of post-shift activity--a security screening--in <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. v. Busk</span>, 574 U.S. 27, 29-37 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employer in this case required its employees, warehouse workers who retrieved inventory and packaged it for shipment, to undergo an antitheft security screening before leaving the warehouse each day. The question presented is whether the employees' time spent waiting to undergo and undergoing those security screenings is compensable under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 201 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>., as amended by the Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947, &#x00A7; 251 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. We hold that the time is not compensable....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Enacted in 1938, the FLSA established a minimum wage and overtime compensation for each hour worked in excess of 40 hours in each workweek. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6(a)(1), 7(a)(3), 52 Stat. 1062-1063. An employer who violated these provisions could be held civilly liable for backpay, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees. &#x00A7; 16, <span class="Italic">id</span>., at 1069.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But the FLSA did not define "work" or "workweek," and this Court interpreted those terms broadly. It defined "work" as "physical or mental exertion (whether burdensome or not) controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer and his business." <span class="Italic">Tennessee Coal, Iron &#x0026; R. Co. v. Muscoda Local No. 123</span>,321 U.S. 590, 598, 64 S. Ct. 698, 88 L. Ed. 949 (1944). Similarly, it defined "the statutory workweek" to "includ[e] all time during which an employee is necessarily required to be on the employer's premises, on duty or at a prescribed workplace." <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co</span>., 328 U.S. 680, 690-691, 66 S. Ct. 1187, 90 L. Ed. 1515 (1946). Applying these expansive definitions, the Court found compensable the time spent traveling between mine portals and underground work areas, <span class="Italic">Tennessee Coal, supra</span>, at 598, 64 S. Ct. 698, and the time spent walking from timeclocks to work benches, <span class="Italic">Anderson, supra</span>, at 691-692, 66 S. Ct. 1187.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These decisions provoked a flood of litigation. In the six months following this Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, unions and employees filed more than 1,500 lawsuits under the FLSA. S. Rep. No. 37, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 2-3 (1947). These suits sought nearly $6 billion in back pay and liquidated damages for various preshift and postshift activities. <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress responded swiftly. It found that the FLSA had "been interpreted judicially in disregard of long-established customs, practices, and contracts between employers and employees, thereby creating wholly unexpected liabilities, immense in amount and retroactive in operation, upon employers." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 251(a). Declaring the situation to be an "emergency," Congress found that, if such interpretations "were permitted to stand,...the payment of such liabilities would bring about financial ruin of many employers" and "employees would receive windfall payments...for activities performed by them without any expectation of reward beyond that included in their agreed rates of pay." &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 251(a)-(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress met this emergency with the Portal-to-Portal Act. The Portal-to-Portal Act exempted employers from liability for future claims based on two categories of work-related activities as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;Except as provided in subsection (b) [which covers work compensable by contract or custom], no employer shall be subject to any liability or punishment under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended,...on account of the failure of such employer...to pay an employee overtime compensation, for or on account of any of the following activities of such employee engaged in on or after the date of the enactment of this Act--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform, and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities, "which occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at which such employee commences, or subsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he ceases, such principal activity or activities." &#x00A7; 4, 61 Stat. 86-87 (codified at 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(a)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At issue here is the exemption for "activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Court has consistently interpreted "the term 'principal activity or activities' [to] embrac[e] all activities which are an 'integral and indispensable part of the principal activities.'" <span class="Italic">IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez</span>, 546 U.S. 21, 29-30, 126 S. Ct. 514, 163 L. Ed.2d 288 (2005) (quoting <span class="Italic">Steiner v. Mitchell</span>, 350 U.S. 247, 252-253, 76 S. Ct. 330, 100 L. Ed. 267 (1956)). Our prior opinions used those words in their ordinary sense. The word "integral" means "[b]elonging to or making up an integral whole; constituent, component; <span class="Italic">spec</span>[<span class="Italic">ifically</span>] necessary to the completeness or integrity of the whole; forming an intrinsic portion or element, as distinguished from an adjunct or appendage." 5 Oxford English Dictionary 366 (1933) (OED); accord, Brief for United States as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 20 (Brief for United States); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Webster's New International Dictionary 1290 (2d ed. 1954) (Webster's Second) ("[e]ssential to completeness; constituent, as a part"). And, when used to describe a duty, "indispensable" means a duty "[t]hat cannot be dispensed with, remitted, set aside, disregarded, or neglected." 5 OED 219; <span class="Italic">accord</span>, Brief for United States 19; <span class="Italic">see also</span> Webster's Second 1267 ("[n]ot capable of being dispensed with, set aside, neglected, or pronounced nonobligatory"). An activity is therefore integral and indispensable to the principal activities that an employee is employed to perform if it is an intrinsic element of those activities and one with which the employee cannot dispense if he is to perform his principal activities. As we describe below, this definition, as applied in these circumstances, is consistent with the Department of Labor's regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our precedents have identified several activities that satisfy this test. For example, we have held compensable the time battery-plant employees spent showering and changing clothes because the chemicals in the plant were "toxic to human beings" and the employer conceded that "the clothes-changing and showering activities of the employees [were] indispensable to the performance of their productive work and integrally related thereto." <span class="Italic">Steiner, supra</span>, at 249, 251, 76 S. Ct. 330. And we have held compensable the time meatpacker employees spent sharpening their knives because dull knives would "slow down production" on the assembly line, "affect the appearance of the meat as well as the quality of the hides," "cause waste," and lead to "accidents." <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. King Packing Co</span>., 350 U.S. 260, 262, 76 S. Ct. 337, 100 L. Ed. 282 (1956). By contrast, we have held noncompensable the time poultry-plant employees spent waiting to don protective gear because such waiting was "two steps removed from the productive activity on the assembly line." <span class="Italic">IBP, supra</span>, at 42, 126 S. Ct. 514.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Department of Labor's regulations are consistent with this approach. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 790.8(b) (2013) ("The term 'principal activities' includes all activities which are an integral part of a principal activity"); &#x00A7; 790.8(c) ("Among the activities included as an integral part of a principal activity are those closely related activities which are indispensable to its performance"). As an illustration, those regulations explain that the time spent by an employee in a chemical plant changing clothes would be compensable if he "c[ould not] perform his principal activities without putting on certain clothes" but would not be compensable if "changing clothes [were] merely a convenience to the employee and not directly related to his principal activities." <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 790.8(c). As the regulations explain, "when performed under the conditions normally present," activities including "checking in and out and waiting in line to do so, changing clothes, washing up or showering, and waiting in line to receive pay checks" are "'preliminary'" or "'postliminary'" activities. &#x00A7; 790.7(g).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The security screenings at issue here are noncompensable postliminary activities. To begin with, the screenings were not the "principal activity or activities which [the] employee is employed to perform." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(a)(1). Integrity Staffing did not employ its workers to undergo security screenings, but to retrieve products from warehouse shelves and package those products for shipment to Amazon customers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The security screenings also were not "integral and indispensable" to the employees' duties as warehouse workers. As explained above, an activity is not integral and indispensable to an employee's principal activities unless it is an intrinsic element of those activities and one with which the employee cannot dispense if he is to perform those activities. The screenings were not an intrinsic element of retrieving products from <span id="page_2148"></span>warehouse shelves or packaging them for shipment. And Integrity Staffing could have eliminated the screenings altogether without impairing the employees' ability to complete their work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the test could be satisfied merely by the fact that an employer required an activity, it would sweep into "principal activities" the very activities that the Portal-to-Portal Act was designed to address. The employer in <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, for instance, required its employees to walk "from a timeclock near the factory gate to a workstation" so that they could "begin their work," "but it is indisputable that the Portal-to-Portal Act evinces Congress' intent to repudiate <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>'s holding that such walking time was compensable under the FLSA." <span class="Italic">IBP, supra</span>, at 41, 126 S. Ct. 514. A test that turns on whether the activity is for the benefit of the employer is similarly overbroad.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject the employees' argument that time spent waiting to undergo the security screenings is compensable under the FLSA because Integrity Staffing could have reduced that time to a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> amount. The fact that an employer could conceivably reduce the time spent by employees on any preliminary or postliminary activity does not change the nature of the activity or its relationship to the principal activities that an employee is employed to perform. These arguments are properly presented to the employer at the bargaining table, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(b)(1), not to a court in an FLSA claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">* * *</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We hold that an activity is integral and indispensable to the principal activities that an employee is employed to perform--and thus compensable under the FLSA--if it is an intrinsic element of those activities and one with which the employee cannot dispense if he is to perform his principal activities. Because the employees' time spent waiting to undergo and undergoing Integrity Staffing's security screenings does not meet these criteria, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p class="noindent">What follows is FLRA's take on arbitrators whose decisions were challenged as to FLSA compensation of preliminary and postliminary work. The decisions vary, depending on whether they were issued after (and address) the 2014 <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing Solutions</span> decision.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In his award, the Arbitrator stated, as relevant here, that any preparatory activity that is indispensable and closely related to an employee's principal activities is itself a principal activity, and is compensable under the FLSA.[16] However, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations that implement the FLSA in the federal sector[17] distinguish principal activities from preparatory activities for federal employees.[18] In this regard, the regulations state, as pertinent here, that "a preparatory activity that an employee performs prior to the commencement of his or her principal activities...[is] not [a] principal activity."[19] Although the Authority has previously made statements similar to the Arbitrator's,[20] the Authority has since clarified that it follows the OPM regulations.[21] Accordingly, in order to resolve the Agency's exceptions, we reiterate here that, in the federal sector, a pre-shift activity that is "closely related" and "indispensable" to a principal activity is a preparatory activity--not a principal activity.[22] However, preparatory activities <span class="Italic">are</span> compensable if an employee performs them for more than ten minutes per workday.[23]</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 521 F.3d 1148, 1153-55 (9th Cir. 2008), affirming that the FLSA and Portal-to-Portal Act supply the waiver of sovereign immunity necessary for an arbitrator to award back pay in an overtime case, provided the background of those statutes:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLSA was enacted in 1938, and, among other things, granted covered employees statutory rights to overtime compensation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207. These rights are enforceable under the FLSA through various remedies, as stated at 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216. In <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.</span>, 328 U.S. 680, 690-91, 66 S. Ct. 1187, 90 L.

In response to Anderson, Congress passed the Portal-to-Portal Act in 1947. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 251(a) (finding that the FLSA "has been interpreted judicially in disregard of long-established customs, practices, and contracts between employers and employees"). The Act pared back the definition of "workweek" set forth in Anderson. Indeed, as one court has noted with respect to the Portal-to-Portal Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[w]alking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform, and activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities are excluded from FLSA's protections by the Portal-to-Portal Act; employers need not pay employees overtime...for such activity.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">However, the Portal-to-Portal Act carved out two exceptions, which do not relieve an employer from paying overtime; specifically:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section which relieve an employer from liability and punishment with respect to any activity, the employer shall not be so relieved if such activity is compensable by either--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;an express provision of a written or nonwritten contract in effect, at the time of such activity, between such employee, his agent, or collective-bargaining representative and his employer; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;a custom or practice in effect, at the time of such activity, at the establishment or other place where such employee is employed, covering such activity, not inconsistent with a written or nonwritten contract, in effect at the time of such activity, between such employee, his agent, or collective-bargaining representative and his employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(b). Additionally, the Portal-to-Portal Act states that when the terms "employee" and "employer" are used in relation to the FLSA, they each have the same meaning as defined under the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 262(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1974, Congress amended the FLSA by expanding the definition of "employee," and the statute states that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In the case of an individual employed by a public agency, such term means--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">any individual employed by the Government of the United States--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;as a civilian in the military departments (as defined in section 102 of Title 5),</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 203(e)(2)(A). Thus, "Congress extended the Act to cover most government employees." <span class="Italic">El-Sheikh v. United States</span>, 177 F.3d 1321, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Government employees were given the right to sue for violations of the FLSA, including those pertaining to overtime compensation. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>By authorizing suits against the United States, the amendment waives the government's sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1324 (citing <span class="Italic">Saraco v.

<p class="noindent-1">No party disputes that the FLSA waives the United States' sovereign immunity. Instead, the IRS argues that the FLSA is not applicable in this case and that the Portal-to-Portal Act does not expressly waive sovereign immunity. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Lane</span>, the Supreme Court analyzed whether the United States waived sovereign immunity under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 518 U.S. at 189. The Supreme Court specifically looked at the remedies provision of the statute in determining that the United States had not waived sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">See </span>518 U.S. at 192-93. Therefore, in determining whether the United States has waived sovereign immunity in this case, we will examine the remedies provision of the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously noted, this case was brought on behalf of affected employees seeking overtime pursuant to Article 29, Section 3E of the CBA. Indeed, the arbitrator recognized that the IRS violated the FLSA in <span id="page_2149"></span>not complying with the CBA provision. Under these circumstances, the Portal-to-Portal Act's exception under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(b)(1) must be read in conjunction with the FLSA. <span class="Italic">Cf. Astor v. United States</span>, 79 Fed. Cl. 303, 319 (2007) (noting that the Back Pay Act and the FLSA should be read as complementary where plaintiffs sought interest on their back pay awards, not on liquidated damages); <span class="Italic">Adams v. United States, No. 00-447C</span>, 2003 U.S. Claims LEXIS 238, 2003 WL 22339164 (Fed. Cl. Aug. 11, 2003) (noting that claims for back pay under the FLSA are governed by the Portal-to-Portal Act's statute of limitations), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 391 F.3d 1212 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The relevant remedies provision for overtime protections is found within the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is a case that concerns overtime.&#x2003;The FLSA has always governed overtime, and although NTEU supports its claim for overtime compensation by invoking the Portal-to-Portal Act, we nevertheless look to the FLSA's remedies provision to determine whether the government waived its sovereign immunity.<span class="Italic"> See Adams v. United States</span>, 48 Fed. Cl. 602, 609 (2001) (noting that in the case of overtime pay under the FLSA, the statute itself provides the remedy and that the FLSA's remedial provision is a source of back pay). Because the Portal-to-Portal Act's remedies for overtime are found within the FLSA, and no party disputes that the FLSA waives sovereign immunity, the FLRA properly determined that the United States waived sovereign immunity.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;A monetary award can be either legal or equitable in nature. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Army v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth.</span>, 312 U.S. App. D.C. 309, 56 F.3d 273, 276 (D.C. Cir. 1995). The remedy will be considered equitable if it is an attempt to give the plaintiff what he is entitled to as opposed to a substitute for a consequential loss. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. In <span class="Italic">Department of Army</span>, the Army Finance and Accounting Office ("FAO") increased the lag between pay periods from ten to twelve days. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 274. However, the new policy was not announced in advance, and it resulted in several employees having insufficient funds in their bank accounts to cover checks they had written.<span class="Italic"> See id. </span>The FLRA ordered the FAO to reimburse all employees for monies lost or interest charged as a result. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 274-75. The D.C. Circuit noted that:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">proper notice of the pay-lag policy change was the thing to which the commissary employees were entitled. The interest charges for which the employees seek compensation are sums they lost only as a consequence of the Army's failure to give them the notice they were due. Accordingly, any compensation for such interest is properly characterized as "money damages."</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 276. Ultimately, the court reviewed 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(g)(3) (setting out the powers and duties of the FLRA) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(7) (addressing prevention of unfair labor practices) of the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Act ("FSLMRA"), and determined that the United States had not waived sovereign immunity to the award of monetary damages. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Army</span>, 56 F.3d at 279. However, unlike the monetary award in <span class="Italic">Department of Army,</span> the FLRA's award of compensation in this case was an order of the very thing to what the affected employees were entitled to under the arbitrator's award. Additionally, the award of compensation in this action was under the Portal-to-Portal Act, as a complement to the FLSA, as opposed to the award via the FSLMRA in Department of Army.</p>
<p class="noindent">The parties may be in dispute over whether certain activities preliminary to or following regular work constitute compensable time for FLSA purposes. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1482 and Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow</span>, 49 FLRA 644, 646-48 (1994), considered FLSA law involving preparation and preliminary activities, as it declined to set aside an award denying overtime compensation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will find that an arbitration award is deficient under section 7122(a) of the Statute if the award is inconsistent with law, rule, or regulation. For the following reasons, we find that the Arbitrator's award is not inconsistent with applicable regulation and we will deny the Union's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the Arbitrator erred by not finding that the grievant is entitled to overtime for putting on his safety shoes prior to the beginning of his shift.&#x2003;As relevant here, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412, "[i]f an agency reasonably determines that a preparatory...activity is closely related to an employee's principal activities, and is indispensable to the performance of the principal activities,...the agency shall credit all of the time spent in that activity...as hours of work." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a). Preparatory activities are those activities employees perform prior to the commencement of their principal activities. <span class="Italic">General Services Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, Council 236</span>, 37 FLRA 481, 484 (1990) (<span class="Italic">GSA</span>). Principal activities are the activities employees are employed to perform. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A preparatory activity that is not closely related to the performance of an employee's principal activities is considered a preliminary activity. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(b). Time spent in a preliminary activity "is excluded from hours of work and is not compensable[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where employees are not required to change clothes at the place of work, but are allowed to do so at home, they are not entitled to compensation for the time spent changing clothes because that activity is considered a noncompensable preliminary activity. <span class="Italic">See</span> Comp. Gen. B-192831 (April 17, 1979) (unpublished), Comp. Gen. B-156407 (July 14, 1976) (unpublished), and Comp. Gen. B-182610 (February 5, 1975) (unpublished). <span class="Italic">See also</span> Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Supplement 990-2, Book 550, Appendix I.[3] The Arbitrator found that although the grievant was required to have his safety shoes on at the start of his shift, he was not required to change into those shoes at the work site and, under the Sideletter, was permitted to put the shoes on at home prior to coming to work. The Union does not dispute the Arbitrator's finding.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;During the pendency of this case, various provisions of the FPM were abolished and others were provisionally retained through December 31, 1994. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Sunset Document, Summary Table at 8, 10. FPM Supplement 990-2, Book 550, Appendix I has been provisionally retained. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, Summary Table at 10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, therefore, that in the circumstances of this case, the Arbitrator did not err in finding that the grievant was not entitled to overtime. The time spent by the grievant in putting on his safety shoes prior to his shift constitutes a noncompensable preliminary activity which is excluded from hours of work under the FLSA and for which the grievant is not entitled to overtime. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(b). Moreover, we also find that the Union has not demonstrated that the grievant is entitled to overtime pay because the Agency suffered or permitted the grievant to perform work. "Hours of work" includes time during which the employee is "suffered or permitted" to work. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.401(a)(2). However, as noted above, time spent in a preliminary activity, such as the one at issue in this case, is excluded from hours of work and is not compensable. Consequently, the grievant is not entitled to overtime on the basis that he was suffered or permitted by the Agency to put his shoes on at the work site prior to the start of his shift<span class="Italic">. Compare</span> <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, 37 FLRA at 485 (the Authority found that the performance of compensable preparatory and concluding activities was suffered or permitted by the agency and concluded that the employees involved in the case were entitled to overtime compensation).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VAMC Huntington and AFGE Local 2344</span>, 56 FLRA 990, 991 (2000), noted that time to change clothing before or after work is not compensable unless the compensation is mandated by a negotiated agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLSA, as amended by the Portal-to-Portal Act, provides that "activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to" an employee's "principal activity" are not compensable. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(a). There is an exception requiring payment for such activities pursuant to "an express provision of a written or nonwritten contract...between [the employee's] collective bargaining representative and his employer." 29 USC &#x00A7; 254(b)<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that the clothes-changing at issue in this case is preliminary/postliminary activity.[5] Thus, under the FLSA, the time spent changing clothes is not compensable unless compensation is required by a collective bargaining agreement. The award in this case requires payment pursuant to Article 20, Section 3K of the parties' agreement, which, by its plain terms and as interpreted by the Arbitrator, requires payment whenever clothes-changing at work is "permitted."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The Authority has held that, where employees are not required to change clothes at their place of work, that activity is preliminary/postliminary. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1482</span>, 49 FLRA 644, 647 (1994) (citations omitted). <span class="Italic">Cf.

However, the Union's argument that OPM's regulations, particularly 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(b), do not bar compensation for preliminary/postliminary activities that are made compensable by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement has been expressly rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Air Force v.

In particular, the court held in that case that, in "barring compensation" for activities described in section 551.412(b)--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, preliminary and postliminary activities--OPM exercised its "broad authority...to rule out...bargaining" over contract terms that provide payment for these activities. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 451.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">This dispute arises out of a grievance filed by the Union alleging that the Agency violated the overtime compensation provisions of the FLSA, and the Federal Employees Pay Act, by failing to compensate correctional officers for certain pre-shift and post-shift activities.[1]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;This case is one in a series of disputes among various AFGE local unions and the Agency concerning overtime pay for pre-shift and post-shift activities under the FLSA (e.g., <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed Bureau of Prisons, United States Penitentiary, Marion, Ill.,</span> 61 FLRA 765 (2006); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the Arbitrator found that the Agency failed to compensate the correctional officers for pre-shift and post-shift overtime. In this regard, the Arbitrator concluded that the correctional officers are required to "perform essential responsibilities of their positions on an overtime basis." In so concluding, the Arbitrator found that, prior to the commencement of the correctional officers' shifts, they must report to the front lobby and check in with the Operations Lieutenant, who advises them of their posts of duty. Following their report to the Operations Lieutenant, the correctional officers must pass through the control room "sally port," which is a secured hallway used to enter the Control Center. Upon entering the Control Center, each correctional officer must slide a magnetic disc across a board displaying his/her name from the "out" position to the "in" position to reflect the correctional officer's presence at the facility. The correctional officers then line up to obtain the equipment necessary to perform their assigned duties during their shifts. The process by which the equipment is provided to the correctional officers involves their receipt of "chits" marked with their names in exchange for the required equipment.[3] After receiving all of the necessary equipment, each correctional officer exits the Control Center through the sally port and proceeds to his/her assigned post.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The Arbitrator found that the equipment received at the Control Center may include items such as batteries, body-alarms, two-way radios, radio cases, key rings, handheld metal detectors, flashlights, handcuffs, leg irons, callouts and crew kits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator made several findings with regard to the pre-shift and post-shift activities performed by the correctional officers and the amount of time that the officers spend performing such activities. The Arbitrator found that it takes the correctional officers approximately 5 to 10 minutes from the time that they report to the Operations Lieutenant until they clear the Control Center's sally port and obtain all necessary equipment before departing to their posts. The Arbitrator estimated that the length of time that it takes the correctional officers to reach their assigned duty posts from the Control Center varies between 3 and 15 minutes, depending on the location of the posts. The Arbitrator determined that, when arriving at their duty posts, the correctional officers take anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes to exchange information and/or inventory equipment with the outgoing correctional officers, depending on the type of post to which the correctional officers are assigned.[4] In this regard, the Arbitrator found that some posts are monitored 24 hours per day, others 16 hours per day, and still others only 8 hours per day. The Arbitrator found that the 8-hour posts do not require any type of exchange at all and the 16-hour posts only require exchanges once every 24 hours. In sum, the Arbitrator found that "the precise amount of time consumed in the performance of the foregoing duties varies among correctional officers since some posts are [monitored] for three shifts, others posts for two shifts[,] and the remaining for one shift, distances from [the] Control Center to posts vary[,] and at some posts equipment is exchanged between incoming and outgoing correctional officers while at other posts equipment must be withdrawn from [the] Control Center."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The Arbitrator found that the exchange may include exchanging equipment which remains on post, exchanging chits for freshly drawn equipment, inventorying all keys and ammunition, reviewing the daily inspection report, staff information report, and post logbook, and exchanging any other pertinent information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Arbitrator did not distinguish between the different types of officers, i.e., those who pick up their equipment at the control center from those who do not, those whose duty posts are near the control center from those whose posts are not, and those who spend a considerable amount of time exchanging equipment and information from outgoing officers at the duty posts from those who do not, he determined that, "based upon the totality of the evidence presented," all correctional officers spend approximately 30 minutes per day engaged in pre-shift and post-shift activities and that the time is not <span class="Italic">de minimis.[</span>5] The Arbitrator concluded that the Agency failed to lawfully compensate the correctional officers "for pre-shift and post-shift overtime pursuant to the [FLSA] and Federal Employees Pay Act."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The Arbitrator concluded that the post-shift activities performed by the officers essentially follow the pre-shift routine in reverse and constitute approximately the same amount of time that it took to complete the pre-shift activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, the Arbitrator awarded the correctional officers "one-half hour [back pay] at their respective overtime rates of pay plus interest thereon for all full shifts they completed commencing three years prior to initiation of the subject grievance...until the date of this Award." Although the Arbitrator found that the Agency's violation of the FLSA was willful, he denied the Union's request for liquidated damages under the FLSA. The Arbitrator also declined to compensate correctional officers for their time spent reviewing the Agency's contingency plans. Lastly, the Arbitrator awarded the Union attorney fees. The Arbitrator remanded the matter to the parties to determine the precise amount of compensation due to the correctional officers and attorney fees due to the Union.</p>

Congress subsequently amended the FLSA with the Portal-to-Portal Act (the Act), distinguishing between "the principal activity or activities that an employee is hired to perform," which are compensable, and "activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities," which are not compensable. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(a)(2). <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1482,</span> 49 FLRA 644, 646-47 (1994); <span class="Italic">Gen. Serv. Admin.,</span> 37 FLRA 481, 484 (1990) (GSA); <span class="Italic">see also Reich v. New York City Transit Auth.,</span> 45 F.3d 646, 649 (2nd Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">Reich</span>). A given activity constitutes a "principal activity," as opposed to a preliminary or postliminary task, if it is "an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed[.]" <span class="Italic">Steiner v. Mitchell,</span> 350 U.S. 247, 256 (1956) (<span class="Italic">Steiner</span>); <span class="Italic">see also GSA,</span> 37 FLRA at 484 ("[p]reparatory and concluding activities of more than 10 minutes per workday are compensable as hours of work when they are 'closely related to an employee's principal activities, and [are] indispensable to the performance of the principal activities[.]'") (quoting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether given activities are an integral and indispensable part of employees' principal activities, "what is important is that such work is necessary to the business and is performed by the employees, primarily for the benefit of the employer, in the ordinary course of that business." <span class="Italic">Dunlop v. City Elec. Inc.,</span> 527 F.2d 394, 401 (5th Cir. 1976) (<span class="Italic">Dunlop</span>). Pre-shift and post-shift activities that are integral and indispensable to an employee's principal activity or activities are themselves principal activities under the Act. <span class="Italic">Alvarez,</span> 546 U.S. 21. As a general matter, employees are entitled to be paid for time before and after their ordinary work shift if they are engaged in activities that are "closely related to [their] principal activities, and [are] indispensable to the performance of the principal activities[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1). Therefore, "during a continuous workday, any walking time that occurs after the beginning of the employee's first principal activity and before the end of the employee's last principal activity...is covered by the FLSA." <span class="Italic">Alvarez,</span> 546 U.S. at 37.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has applied these legal principles to Agency prison employees in previous cases.&#x2003;Specifically, the Authority has held that time spent traveling after obtaining equipment at the control center is compensable. <span class="Italic">United States Dept of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kan.,</span> 59 FLRA 593, 597-98 (2004) (<span class="Italic">BOP, Leavenworth</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator erroneously awarded the same amount of overtime compensation to all of the correctional officers even though not all of the correctional officers spend time performing compensable pre-shift and post-shift activities under the FLSA. Specifically, the Arbitrator found that, "[b]ased upon the totality of the evidence...[the] average amount of time expended per day <span id="page_2151"></span>per correctional officer is equal to 30 minutes in excess of their regular eight-hour shift." As such, the Arbitrator awarded "each correctional officer" 30 minutes of overtime compensation. For the following reasons, we find that the award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In awarding each correctional officer the same amount of overtime compensation, the Arbitrator erred in failing to differentiate among correctional officers who perform pre-shift and post-shift duties warranting compensation and those who do not. In this respect, the Arbitrator found that the correctional officers' pre-shift and post-shift activities vary depending on the type of post to which they are assigned. Some correctional officers must stop at the Control Center to pick up equipment before proceeding to their duty posts and some do not. Other correctional officers spend time exchanging equipment and information at their duty posts with the outgoing officer, while others do not. Under the FLSA and Authority precedent, only the officers picking up their equipment at the Control Center are entitled to compensation for their travel time to and from their duty stations because obtaining such equipment is "indispensable to the performance of [the correctional officers'] principal activities," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1), and "any walking time that occurs after the beginning of the employee's first principal activity and before the end of the employee's last principal activity...is covered by the FLSA." <span class="Italic">Alvarez,</span> 546 U.S. at 37; <span class="Italic">see also BOP, Terre Haute,</span> 58 FLRA at 330 (prison employees must be compensated from the time that they pick up the equipment necessary for them to perform their job duties, including time traveling to and from the employee's duty station from the point where equipment is picked up); <span class="Italic">see also BOP, Leavenworth,</span> 59 FLRA at 597-98 (travel after the commencement of an employee's principal activity at the control center is compensable); <span class="Italic">see also GSA,</span> 37 FLRA at 484-87.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Correctional officers who merely check in upon their arrival at the facility and then travel directly to their duty posts without stopping to pick up equipment at the Control Center, are not entitled to compensation for this travel time under the FLSA, as they are not engaged in activities "indispensable to the performance of the principal activities" until they arrive at their posts. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1); <span class="Italic">see BOP, Terre Haute,</span> 58 FLRA at 330 (citing <span class="Italic">Amos,</span> 13 Cl. Ct. at 449-50 (employees who do not obtain equipment necessary to perform their duties prior to walking to their duty stations do not receive compensation for time spent passing through the control room and travel to their duty stations); <span class="Italic">see also Alvarez,</span> 546 U.S. at 37 (walking time that takes place prior to an employee's first principal activity or after an employee's last principal activity is non-compensable)). However, any pre-shift and post-shift time spent by these correctional officers exchanging equipment and information with outgoing officers at their duty posts that is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis,</span> is compensable since such activity is "indispensable" to the performance of their principal activities. <span class="Italic">See BOP, Terre Haute,</span> 58 FLRA at 330 (prison employees must be compensated from the time that they pick up the equipment necessary for them to perform their job duties). As such, the award is contrary to law because, in awarding overtime compensation, the Arbitrator did not distinguish between the correctional officers picking up their equipment at the Control Center from those who do not, nor between officers who exchange equipment and information at their duty posts from those who do not.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, although the Arbitrator found that the time spent by the correctional officers performing pre-shift and post-shift activities could greatly vary, he awarded "each correctional officer" 30 minutes of overtime compensation without taking this variance into consideration. Specifically, the Arbitrator estimated that the length of time that it takes the correctional officers to reach their assigned duty posts from the Control Center could range from 3 to 15 minutes, and determined that, when arriving at their duty posts, the correctional officers could take anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes to exchange information and/or inventory equipment with the outgoing correctional officers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the Authority has held that correctional officers picking up their equipment at a control center are entitled to compensation for their travel time to and from their duty stations if the time spent traveling is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>because obtaining such equipment is indispensable to the performance of their principal activities. <span class="Italic">BOP, Leavenworth,</span> 59 FLRA at 594. In addition, correctional officers who bypass the Control Center are entitled to compensation for any pre-shift and post-shift time that is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>that is spent exchanging equipment and information at their duty posts with outgoing correctional officers. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1), provides for the compensation of "a preparatory or concluding activity" where, among other things, the total time spent in that activity is more than 10 minutes per workday. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1). As such, time spent in such activities totaling fewer than 10 minutes per workday is <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412 (a)(1) and not compensable. <span class="Italic">See BOP, Leavenworth,</span> 59 FLRA at 598 (award contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1) where total time awarded to employees by arbitrator did not exceed 10 minutes per workday). Because the award could potentially compensate correctional officers whose compensable pre-shift and post-shift duties do not exceed 10 minutes per workday, the award is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, as the award distinguishes neither the correctional officers who pick up the equipment necessary for their work at the Control Center from those who do not, nor the correctional officers who spend time exchanging information and equipment at their duty posts from those who do not, we are unable to determine whether the award requires the Agency to compensate the correctional officers for activities that are either not performed, or not compensable. Moreover, as the award does not account for the varying amount of time that the correctional officers who <span class="Italic">do</span> perform compensable pre-shift and post-shift activities are engaged in such activities, we are unable to determine whether those correctional officers are compensated in accordance with the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the award is deficient. As the record does not provide sufficient information for the Authority to determine which correctional officers perform compensable activity and the amount of time that the correctional officers are engaged in such activity, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator for clarification consistent with this decision. <span class="Italic">See BOP, Terre Haute,</span> 58 FLRA at 330 (award remanded to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator for clarification where it was not clear as to which activities were included in the compensation awarded).</p>
<p class="noindent">"Checking in" time, not normally compensable, was evaluated in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons USP Atwater and AFGE Local 1242</span>, 68 FLRA 857, 859 (2015) (Member DuBester concurring) ((recon. den., 69 FLRA 238 (2016)), describing when it is compensable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Act, checking in is not ordinarily regarded as a compensable preparatory activity.[25] However, the Authority has found that employees who perform certain additional activities when checking in may be compensated for the check-in if the employees spend more than ten minutes performing those activities.[26] In this regard, in <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP, Federal Correctional Institution, Jesup, Georgia</span>, the Authority held that compensating prison employees for the time that they spent checking in was lawful because the arbitrator found that employees not only "check[ed] in at the lieutenant's office," but also "check[ed] their mailboxes, receiv[ed] instructions, and review[ed] and sign[ed] various documents."[27] Similarly, here, the Arbitrator found that officers did more than check in at the lieutenant's office--the officers also received post assignments, exchanged pertinent information, dropped off and signed incident reports, and reviewed other documents. As the Agency does not allege that the Arbitrator's factual findings are nonfacts, we defer to those findings.[29] And those findings support the Arbitrator's conclusion that the time that the officers spent checking in at the lieutenant's office is compensable.[30]</p>

<p class="noindent">One of the earlier prison overtime cases is <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, USP Terre Haute and AFGE Local 720</span>, 58 FLRA 327, 329-30 (2003), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 58 FLRA 587 (2003), involving, among other activities, moving a marker on an accountability board to show an employee's presence within the facility:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency alleges that the award is deficient because the following activities are non-compensable under &#x00A7; 254: (1) walking from the security perimeter to the administrator's office; (2) moving a marker on an "accountability board" in the administrator's office to indicate that the employee is inside the institution; and (3) walking from the administrator's office to the control center.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first and third disputed activities, the following types of activities have been found non-compensable: monitoring a police radio during the commute to work, where employees were compensated for responding to incidents if the response lasted more than thirty minutes, <span class="Italic">see Aiken v. City of Memphis, Tenn.,</span> 190 F.3d 753, 759 (6th Cir. 1999); travel on employer-supplied buses to the work site and back where the employees were given information about their work for the day during travel but were not required to use the buses, and no work was performed before, during, or after the travel, <span class="Italic">see Vega v. Gasper, </span>36 F.3d 417, 425 (5th Cir. 1994) (<span class="Italic">Vega</span>); travel from picking up identification tags (used to verify attendance and control access to the job site) to the job site, on a bus required by the employer for security reasons, where there was no evidence that employees engaged in any work during the travel, <span class="Italic">see Dolan v. Project Constr. Corp., </span>558 F. Supp. 1308, 1309-11 (D. Colo. 1983) <span class="Italic">(Dolan); </span>and travel on an employer-furnished truck to the principal place of work, where the employer was not required to supply the truck, <span id="page_2152"></span>and the employees were permitted to provide their own transportation, <span class="Italic">see Tanaka v. Tom, </span>299 F. Supp. 732,735 (D. Haw. 1969).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These decisions indicate that, unless employees are required to engage in principal activities during their travel, their time spent traveling to and from the actual place of performance of their principal activities is noncompensable, even if it is on the employer's premises, and even if it occurs after the employee checks in. Because there is no evidence that the employees in this case engage in any principal activities during their travel from the security perimeter to the administrator's office, or from the administrator's office to the control center, such travel is non-compensable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union relies on <span class="Italic">Reich v. N.Y. City Transit</span> <span class="Italic">Auth., </span>45 F.3d 646, 650 (2nd Cir. 1995) <span class="Italic">(Reich), </span>where the court held that police officers can be compensated for the portion of their travel in which they engage in principal activities. However, as there is no evidence that the employees in the instant case engage in any principal activities while walking between the security perimeter and the administrator's office, <span class="Italic">Reich </span>does not support an award of compensation for that travel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the second disputed activity--moving a marker on the accountability board in the administrator's office--the legislative history of &#x00A7; 254 specifically includes "[c]hecking in or out" as non-compensable activities<span class="Italic">. Vega, </span>36 F.3d at 425 (quoting S. Rep. No. 48, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. p. 47 (1947) (emphasis deleted). The employees in this case are required to move a marker on the accountability board in order to show that they are "inside" the institution. Thus, this activity is analogous to "checking in" with the Agency, and the legislative history of &#x00A7; 254 supports a conclusion that this activity is not compensable. In addition, the Arbitrator made no findings, and there is no basis for concluding, that the employees perform any other activities at the administrator's office. Accordingly, we conclude that moving a marker on the accountability board is not compensable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's reliance on the nature of the institution as a correctional facility in awarding compensation is misplaced. In this connection, even where security reasons require controlled access to a work site, time spent traveling to and from the place of performance of principal activities is not compensable. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Dolan, </span>558 F. Supp. at 1309-11 (travel not compensable despite fact that employees were required, for security reasons, to utilize employer-supplied transportation). <span class="Italic">Cf. Amos v. United States, </span>13 Cl. Ct. 442, 449-50 (1987) (compensating employees of correctional facility for travel to duty stations because they were required to pick up work-related items, but noting that "[i]f they did not have to obtain these items in the control room, the time spent passing through the control room and walking to their duty station clearly would not be compensable"). Thus, the fact that security reasons require controlled access to the employees' job site does not support compensation for the employees' travel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the award of compensation for activities and travel between the security perimeter and the control center is contrary to &#x00A7; 254(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator awarded twenty minutes of overtime compensation without specifying what activities that includes.&#x2003;It is unclear whether the award includes compensation for picking up equipment at the control center and walking to the place of performance of principal activities, which the Agency concedes is legally permissible. Thus, we are unable to determine whether the award encompasses compensation for activities that the parties concede to be compensable. Accordingly, we remand this matter to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to clarify whether the award provides compensation for picking up equipment at the control center and wailing to the place of performance of principal activities and, if so, how much time was spent by employees in such activity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Following remand, the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">USP Terre Haute</span> determined that the employees engaged in compensable activities for 15 minutes a day and he awarded backpay and liquidated damages retroactive to the filing date of the grievance.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator's award of overtime for flipping accountability chits is contrary to law. In <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP, U.S. Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Indiana</span> (<span class="Italic">Terre Haute</span>),[66] the Authority has held that "moving a marker on the accountability board is not compensable" because it "is analogous to 'checking in' with the Agency, and the legislative history of [the Portal-to-Portal Act] supports a conclusion that this activity is not compensable."[67]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[66]&#x2003;58 FLRA 327 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[67]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 330.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator distinguished the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Terre Haute</span> based on his finding than an employee "does not 'check in' when he or she moves a chit on the accountability board; that happens when the officer walks through the front door. By moving a chit with his name on it, an officer becomes 'accountable' and on-duty." But, regardless of whether the employees actually "check in" when they move their accountability chits, notifying one's employer that one is accountable and on-duty is "<span class="Italic">analogous to</span> 'checking in,'" and therefore non-compensable.[69] Thus, the Arbitrator's conclusion that flipping an accountability chit is an integral and indispensable preparatory or concluding activity is contrary to Authority precedent. But flipping an accountability chit is compensable when it occurs during the continuous workday.[70]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[69]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Terre Haute</span>, 58 FLRA at 330 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[70]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Lexington</span>, 68 FLRA at 939.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Agency does not challenge the Arbitrator's conclusion that the travel that occurs after employees undergo security screenings and don their duty belts is an integral and indispensable preparatory activity. Thus, if the amount of time that employees spend on preparatory and concluding activities is significant enough to be compensable, then flipping an accountability chit at the beginning of the workday is part of the compensable, continuous workday.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But the Arbitrator also awarded post-shift overtime to some employees for flipping their accountability chits at the end of the day even though he did not find that those employees engaged in any compensable activities after flipping their accountability chits. Accordingly, these overtime awards are contrary to law, and we set them aside. The Agency, does not, however, challenge the Arbitrator's conclusion that the travel time that immediately precedes flipping the accountability chits is an integral and indispensable concluding activity. Thus, on remand the Arbitrator should reduce the overtime awards of employees by the amount of time the employees spend moving the chit. The Arbitrator should also assess whether, after reducing the overtime awards to discount the time spent flipping accountability chits, the time spent on the remaining, compensable pre- and post-shift activities is substantial enough to be compensable.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator's award as to the 2001 grievance is contrary to &#x00A7; 254(a) because it provides compensation for preliminary and postliminary activities to employees who report directly to their posts. Specifically, the Agency argues that the award improperly provides compensation for activities that are not closely related to employees' principal activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, under the FLSA, as amended by the Act, a given activity constitutes a principal activity if it is an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which employees are employed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Steiner</span>, 350 U.S. at 256. To be an integral and indispensable part of employees' principal activities, the work in question must be necessary to the job being performed and primarily for the benefit of the employer. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Reich</span>, 45 F.3d at 650;<span class="Italic"> Dunlop</span>, 527 F.2d at 401.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Insofar as the Custody Department is concerned, where employees as of April 12, 1999, were required to report to their post of duty, the Arbitrator found that the relieving officer, and the relieved officer, conducted an exchange of equipment, an inventory of equipment, and an exchange of information. The Arbitrator found that these activities were integral to the job, noting that employees ran the risk of discipline for missing equipment if such inventories were not done. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ballaris v. Wacker Siltronic Corp.</span>, 370 F.3d. 901, 911 n.14 ((9th Cir. 2004) ("evidence that an employee has been disciplined for the failure to follow a clear rule established by a company would weigh in favor of a finding that the activities are 'integral and indispensable'"). The Arbitrator concluded that the process of relieving an officer at a post of duty required at least 15 minutes in addition to the regularly scheduled tour.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's factual findings support his legal conclusion that the activities conducted upon relief at a post of duty are integral to the work performed by employees. The exchange of equipment, the inventory of equipment, and the exchange of information concerning operations at the post are clearly necessary to the job being performed at the post and are conducted primarily for the employer's benefit. Otherwise, there would be no risk of discipline from the employer. Given the nature of these findings, the Agency has provided no basis for its claim that the activities conducted upon relief of a post in the Custody Department do not constitute employees' principal duties. Thus, the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator erred in concluding that the activities are not preliminary or postliminary and that those activities are compensable under the FLSA, as amended by the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Agency claims that the award is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(b). Section 551.412(b), provides, in part, that "[t]ime spent in preliminary or postliminary activities is excluded from hours of work and is not compensable...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(b). As found above, the Agency has not established that the activities in dispute constitute preliminary or postliminary activities. Rather, the Arbitrator's factual findings support his legal conclusion that such activities are integral to the work performed by employees and thus, are compensable under the FLSA, as amended by the Act. Accordingly, the Agency has failed to demonstrate that the award is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(b). As to the Agency's claim that the award is inconsistent with HRM 610.1, the Arbitrator pointed out that HRM 610.1 permitted shifts to begin when an employee reports to a post to relieve the officer on duty. Nothing in the section authorizing such a starting time dictates the activities that must take place to constitute compensable work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Compensable and noncompensable, preliminary and postliminary, time for prison workers was again explored in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons MCC Chicago and AFGE Local 3652</span>, 63 FLRA 423, 428-33 (2009), noting the distinction between time compensable under FLSA and FEPA, and also including a statutory and regulatory appendix, set out following the decision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The award, in part, is contrary to the FLSA</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the award grants overtime compensation for time spent in preliminary and postliminary activities (waiting for elevators) independent of any time spent on obtaining or returning equipment. The Agency asserts that absent evidence that unit employees perform "principal work activities" during the time spent waiting for elevators, the award of "30 minutes of overtime pay" for each day worked "to all bargaining unit employees" for such waiting time is inconsistent with the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(a), which amended the FLSA, provides that no employer will be liable under the FLSA for failing to pay overtime to an employee for:</p>

<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, by this amendment, Congress distinguished between "the principal activity or activities [that an] employee is employed to perform," which are compensable, and "activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities," which are not compensable. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(a)(1)-(2). <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1482,</span> 49 FLRA 644, 647 (1994); GSA, 37 FLRA 481, 484 (1990) (<span class="Italic">GSA</span>). <span class="Italic">See also Reich v.

Testimonial evidence may be sufficient evidence and it is not necessary that all similarly situated employees testify in order to be covered by any subsequent award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously applied 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254 as it concerns whether employees walking or traveling time constituted a compensable activity. In <span class="Italic">BOP, Terre Haute, Ind.,</span> 58 FLRA at 329, the Authority found that where there was no evidence that employees therein had engaged in any principal activities during their travel from the penitentiary's security perimeter to the administrator's office, or from the administrator's office to the control center, such travel was non-compensable under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254. In so concluding, the Authority noted certain activities that courts have found non-compensable under &#x00A7; 254, such as travel from picking up identification tags (used to verify attendance and control access to the job site) to the job site, on a bus required by the employer for security reasons. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> and the cases cited therein. The Authority stated that the court's decisions indicated that "unless employees are required to engage in principal activities during their travel, their time spent traveling to and from the actual place of performance of their principal activities is non-compensable, even if it is on the employer's premises, and even if it occurs after the employee checks in." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 329.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found such walking/traveling to be in certain instances compensable, however. For example, in <span class="Italic">BOP, Leavenworth, Kan.,</span> 59 FLRA 593, the Authority found that picking up equipment at the penitentiary's control center and walking from there to duty stations as well as returning <span id="page_2154"></span>the equipment to the control center are compensable activities. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 597. <span class="Italic">See also, Amos,</span> 13 Cl. Ct. 442, (finding that compensating employees of a correctional facility for travel to duty stations because they were required to pick up work-related items was compensable, but noting that "[i]f they did not have to obtain these items in the control room, the time spent passing through the control room and walking to their duty station clearly would not be compensable." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 449).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the instant case, the Arbitrator found that "[a]ll current and former employees who have picked up pouches, keys, transfriskers, and/or other equipment (other than batteries alone) at the beginning of their shifts and/or who have returned such equipment to the [C]ontrol [R]oom at the end of their shifts," as well as employees who are required to either pick up <span class="Italic">or</span> drop off such equipment in the Control Room, "are entitled to compensation[.]" The Arbitrator's factual findings reveal that picking up and dropping off such equipment as well as picking up or dropping off the equipment is a '"significant type of work' because it is an essential and integral part of an employee's...duties" and is not <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> because the time spent in such activity is more than 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, to the extent that the award requires the Agency: (1) to compensate current and former unit employees for picking up equipment at the Control Center and walking, including waiting for elevators, from the center to their duty stations as well as returning the equipment to the Control Room; and (2) to compensate all employees who currently report to work and are required to either pick up <span class="Italic">or</span> drop off such equipment in the Control Room, the Arbitrator's factual findings establish that the award is consistent with Authority precedent and court decisions that have found that picking up equipment at a penitentiary's control center and walking from there to duty stations as well as returning the equipment to the control center are compensable activities. Accordingly, the Agency has not demonstrated that this part of the award is inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(a) of the FLSA.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;It is noted that the Arbitrator found that the Agency's action in failing to compensate unit employees violated the FLSA and the FEPA. As to FEPA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(a), the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA) amended Title 5, providing, as relevant here, that federal employees who are covered by the overtime pay provisions of the FLSA are not subject to the overtime pay rates and computations established in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(a), and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) subsequently promulgated regulations implementing FEPCA. <span class="Italic">See International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 529,</span> 57 FLRA 784, 785 (2002). <span class="Italic">See also Aaron v. United States,</span> 56 Fed. Cl. 98, 101 (2003). OPM's regulations establish that federal employees who are covered by the overtime provisions of the FLSA are entitled to overtime pay only under that statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 532.503(a)(1), 550.101(c). <span class="Italic">See also United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Sea Systems Command,</span> 57 FLRA 543, 546 n.12 (2001). Accordingly, as the employees herein are covered by the overtime provisions of the FLSA, FEPA does not apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also found that all other current and past employees, who were not required to go to the Control Room to pick up and/or drop off equipment, are entitled to at least 30 minutes of overtime a day solely for the extra time it took the employee to take an elevator to and from his/her duty post. The Arbitrator found that these employees were "entitled to added compensation for the extra time it takes them to take an elevator to and from their duty posts because the totality of the record establishes that all employees...on a daily basis must wait for elevators for a total of...30 minutes going up and down the facility[.]" The Arbitrator stated that the Agency must compensate these employees for arriving so early and for leaving work so late because the "Agency itself has made such significant waiting an integral and essential part of their job by virtue of [its] official policy of pretending that there are no elevator delays and by refusing to properly rectify those delays over the four years the grievance was pending[.]" However, the Arbitrator's factual findings with respect to these employees do not show that they were required to engage in any work during their travel that is an integral and an indispensable part of employees' job duties as correctional personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union relies on the Arbitrator's factual findings that this case does not involve commuting but what happens after employees have finished their commuting, and thus argues that the FLSA provides for compensation for time spent on Agency mandated work (waiting for elevators). However, as the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">BOP, Terre Haute, Ind.,</span> "unless employees are required to engage in principal activities during their travel, their time spent traveling to and from the actual place of performance of their principal activities is non-compensable, even if it is on the employer's premises, and even if it occurs after the employee checks in." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 329. As the Arbitrator's factual findings do not show that these employees were engaged in any work during their travel that is an integral and indispensable part of their job duties as correctional personnel, such travel time is non-compensable under the 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Alvarez,</span> which concerned whether employees were entitled to compensation under the Act for time spent walking to their work areas after donning protective gear and for time spent waiting to don the gear, does not require a different outcome. In <span class="Italic">Alvarez,</span> the Supreme Court held that since donning and doffing the protective gear was admittedly integral and indispensable to the employee's principal activity, such donning and doffing was itself a principal activity, and thus walking to and from changing and work areas, post-donning and pre-doffing, was part of the workday for which employees were entitled to compensation. The Court also held, however, that in the absence of any showing that the employees were required to report at a specific time and wait to don the gear, the time spent waiting to don gear was preliminary to the first principal activity of the workday and thus such time was not compensable except by agreement of the parties or the custom and practice in the particular industry. In this case, the Arbitrator's factual findings with respect to these employees do not show that while traveling to their posts of duty they were required to engage in any activity that is an integral part of their job duties as correctional personnel. As such, <span class="Italic">Alvarez</span> provides no basis for finding that the travel involved with respect to these employees is compensable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, based on the above, the Agency has demonstrated that this portion of the award is inconsistent with 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(a). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., BOP, Terre Haute, Ind,</span> 58 FLRA at 329.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that the portions of the award that order compensation to employees that either pick up and return <span class="Italic">or</span> pick up or return equipment to the Control Room are not deficient. We further find that, to the extent the award orders compensation of 30 minutes of overtime a day for time spent waiting for an elevator to all current and past employees who were not required to go to the Control Room, we find this portion of the award is inconsistent with 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The award, in part, is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the Arbitrator awarded 10 minutes of compensation to employees who picked up <span class="Italic">and</span> returned equipment and 5 minutes of compensation to those employees who only picked up <span class="Italic">or</span> returned equipment. The Agency argues that such grants of compensation for "pre- and[/or] post-shift activity" are <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1) because the time awarded is 10 minutes or less.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1), if an agency reasonably determines that a preparatory or concluding activity is closely related to an employee's principal activities and is indispensable to the performance of the principal activities, and that the total time spent in that activity is more than 10 minutes per workday, the agency is authorized to credit all of the time spent in that activity, including the 10 minutes, as hours of work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's exception is based on the premise that any time spent by these employees, waiting for the elevators, is not compensable. As noted, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, this premise is not correct. In this case, the Arbitrator specifically awarded "40 minutes" of overtime for each workday to all employees who picked up <span class="Italic">and</span> returned equipment to the Control Room and "35 minutes" of overtime for each workday to employees who picked up <span class="Italic">or</span> returned equipment to the Control Room. The award thus orders overtime that exceeds the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> test of 10 minutes per workday. Accordingly, the Agency has not demonstrated that this portion of the award is contrary to the requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency further asserts that the award is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(b) to the extent that the Arbitrator awarded compensation based on the parties' agreement. In the award, the Arbitrator stated that "even if...payment is not required under any federal law or regulation, payment is independently required under Article 18, Section [a] of the agreement[,] which provides for an 8-hour work day because employers cannot unreasonably require employees to be at their work sites outside of a contractually-provided work day." The Arbitrator found therefore, that the "Agency...has independently violated Article 18, Section a, even if it did not violate federal regulations which involved non-contractual rights." Relying on <span class="Italic">Dep't of Air Force,</span> the Agency argues that compensation under a collective bargaining agreement is barred by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(b), which provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;A preparatory or concluding activity that is not closely related to the performance of the principal activities is considered a preliminary or postliminary activity. Time spent in preliminary or postliminary activities is excluded from hours of work and is not compensable, even if it occurs between periods of activity that are compensable as hours of work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Dep't of Air Force,</span> the court interpreted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 551.412(b). The court found that &#x00A7; 4(b) of the Portal-to-Portal Act, which recognizes compensability by contract or custom for time that would otherwise be precluded by 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(a), does not override OPM regulations implementing 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(a) and prohibiting certain conduct from being treated as hours of work for purpose of compensation. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Air Force,</span> 952 F.2d at 450-51. The court noted that, while contrary collective bargaining provisions were recognized as exceptions to the requirements <span id="page_2155"></span>of the Portal-to-Portal Act, Part 551 of the OPM regulations acted to "rule out such bargaining" for federal employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 451. The court further found that OPM "intended its regulations in Part 551 to be mandatory." <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 952 F.2d at 451 (footnote omitted). Thus, based on the court's decision, "a contract provision that requires the Agency to compensate an employee in a manner contrary to Part 551 of OPM's regulations is contrary to a Government-wide rule or regulation, despite any exception created by &#x00A7; 4(b) of the Portal-to-Portal Act." <span class="Italic">See also NTEU,</span> 59 FLRA 119, 122 (2003) (Member Pope dissenting), <span class="Italic">aff'd, NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 418 F.3d 1068 (9th Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that all current and past employees who were not required to go to the Control Room are entitled to at least 30 minutes of overtime a day for the extra time required to take an elevator to and from his/her duty post. The Arbitrator's factual findings concerning these employees do not show that, while traveling to their posts of duty, including waiting for elevators, they were required to engage in any activity that is an integral part of their job duties as correctional personnel. The Arbitrator's factual findings for these employees thus do not show that the activity of waiting for elevators is closely related to the performance of the principal activity and thus, under the OPM regulation, it is a preliminary/postliminary activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(b) preliminary or postliminary activities are excluded from hours of work and are not compensable. Since the Arbitrator's interpretation of Article 18, Section a would permit the subject employees to be compensated for "hours of work" that are excluded from "hours of work" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(b), the Arbitrator's award requiring these employees to be compensated under this provision for time spent waiting for an elevator is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(b). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United Stated Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Medical Ctr., Huntington, W. Va.,</span> 56 FLRA 990, 991 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we deny the Agency's exceptions to the extent that such exceptions claim that the award of compensation to employees who picked up and/or returned equipment to the Control Room is contrary to the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1). To the extent that the Arbitrator relied on Article 18, Section a to award 30 minutes of overtime per work day for time spent waiting for an elevator to all current and past employees who were not required to go to the Control Room, we find that this portion of the award is deficient because it is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Paragraph G of the award is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When resolving an exception which contends that the award is contrary to a management right under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority first considers whether the award affects the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See United Stated Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr., Div. Newport, Newport, R.I.,</span> 63 FLRA 222, 225 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In Paragraph G (at 92) of his award, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to grant prospective overtime pay to employees described in Paragraphs E (that is, employees who must pick up and/or drop off equipment in the control room) and F (that is, employees who must wait for elevators even if they do not pick up/drop off equipment) "until the Agency expressly [changes its policy on arrival and departure times]." Specifically, the Arbitrator permitted the Agency to stop paying overtime to these employees when it stopped requiring them to be in the lobby more than five minutes before the start of their shifts and permitted them to leave their work duties at a time that would enable them to be in the lobby no more than five minutes after the end of their shifts. The Agency asserts that this part of the award affects its right to assign work because the five-minute requirement will prevent the Agency from determining when work assignments will occur. The Agency also claims that the location of employees and when they can begin and end their shifts affect its right to determine its internal security under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute includes the right to determine when work assignments will be performed. <span class="Italic">See Int'l Ass'n of Fire Fighters,</span> 59 FLRA 832, 833-34 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Mgmt. and Specialty Training Ctr., Aurora, Colo.,</span> 56 FLRA 943, 944 (2000)) (<span class="Italic">BOP</span>). Because the determination of employees' daily work schedules--employees' daily starting and quitting times--constitutes a determination of the length of the workday and when during the day assigned work will be performed, it constitutes an exercise of management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B). <span class="Italic">See BOP,</span> 59 FLRA at 833.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The portion of the award in dispute here does not require the Agency to make any changes in employees' starting and quitting times. The award does not prohibit the Agency from ordering involuntary overtime. Under the award, the Agency has the option of either changing its policy (under which employees are considered late if they are not at their work stations at the scheduled start of their shift, regardless of the time spent picking up equipment, or employees are late leaving work because of having to drop off equipment) or continuing to pay overtime as described in the award. Thus, the award would not prevent the Agency from determining when the subject employees should report to or leave work. Rather, the award leaves it to the Agency to make such determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the Agency's contention that the award affects its right to determine its internal security, it is well established that the right to determine internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute includes the authority to determine the policies and practices that are part of an agency's plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property, or operations against internal or external risks. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU,</span> 53 FLRA 539, 581 (1997). Where the agency shows a link, or reasonable connection, between its objective of securing or safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations and the policy or practice designed to implement that objective, a proposal that "conflicts with" the policy or practice affects management's right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU,</span> 55 FLRA 1174, 1186 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, relying on Authority precedent, the Agency asserts that the determination of the practices and policies which are necessary to the accomplishment of the security function of the agency, including the assignment of personnel, is directly related to the determination of an agency's internal security practices, and that the award by "requiring [the Agency] to place employees at certain locations at the start and finish of their shifts" affects its right to determine its internal security. As found above, the portion of the award in dispute here does not require the Agency to make any changes in employees' starting and quitting times nor does the award require the Agency to assign employees to certain locations at the start and end of their shifts. Rather, the award gives the Agency the option of determining whether to continue to pay overtime to the subject employees. As the award does not require the Agency to make any changes in employees' starting and quitting times and does not require the Agency to assign employees to certain locations at the start and end of their shifts, the Agency has failed to establish that this portion of the award affects its internal security under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the above, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that the award affects a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award is deficient to the extent that it provides a remedy to employees for time spent waiting for an elevator.&#x2003;Accordingly, we set aside these portions of the remedy. The Agency's other exceptions are denied.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, no employer shall be subject to any liability or punishment under the [FLSA]...on account of the failure of such employer to pay an employee minimum wages, or to pay an employee overtime compensation, for or on account of any of the following: activities of such employee engaged in on or after May 14, 1947--</p>

For purposes of this subsection, the use of an employer's vehicle for travel by an employee and activities performed by an employee which are incidental to the use of such vehicle for commuting shall not be considered part of the employee's principal activities if the use of such vehicle for travel is within the normal commuting area for the employer's business or establishment and the use of the employer's vehicle is subject to an agreement on the part of the employer and the employee or representative of such employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;Compensability by contract or custom</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section which relieve an employer from liability and punishment with <span id="page_2156"></span>respect to any activity, the employer shall not be so relieved if such activity is compensable by either--</p>

<p class="noindent-1">5. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412 provides, in relevant part, as follows: &#x00A7; 551.412 Preparatory or concluding activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)(1) If an agency reasonably determines that a preparatory or concluding activity is closely related to an employee's principal activities, and is indispensable to the performance of the principal activities, and that the total time spent in that activity is more than 10 minutes per workday, the agency shall credit all of the time spent in that activity, including the 10 minutes, as hours of work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;A preparatory or concluding activity that is not closely related to the performance of the principal activities is considered a preliminary or postliminary activity. Time spent in preliminary or postliminary activities is excluded from hours of work and is not compensable, even if it occurs between periods of activity that are compensable as hours of work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Overtime for relief officers, dependent on classification of some of the preliminary work as principal activity, was granted by an arbitrator and exceptions to the award were denied in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, USP Coleman and AFGE Local 506</span>, 68 FLRA 52 (2014) (Member Pizzella concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3652 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, MCC Chicago</span>, 68 FLRA 394, 399-401 (2015), affirmed the evidentiary analysis of an arbitrator who found no compensable preshift activity under the continuous workday doctrine:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award is not contrary to law.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency rebutted the Union's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is contrary to law because the Agency's evidence was "not sufficient" under the <span class="Italic">Mt. Clemens</span> framework, which requires "[p]recise rebuttal." We note, in this regard, that the Arbitrator "assume[d]" that the Union established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case--he did not find that the Union actually established it. But, in any event, the Union's claim does not demonstrate that the Arbitrator's finding regarding rebuttal is contrary to law. Under <span class="Italic">Mt. Clemens</span>, two methods are available for the Agency to rebut a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case: (1) by presenting evidence of the precise amount of work performed or (2) by presenting evidence "to negative the reasonableness of the inference to be drawn from the employee's evidence."[95] The Arbitrator applied the second method, finding that the Agency's representative evidence "largely negates the Union's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case." The Union provides no basis for finding that the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[95]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Mt. Clemens</span>, 328 U.S. at 687-88.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the Agency did not violate the FLSA by failing to keep accurate records of the employees' time. In this connection, the Authority has stated that an agency is not required to maintain records for overtime that is not worked.[98] And because the Arbitrator determined that the employees did not perform compensable tasks outside of their scheduled shifts--a finding that the Union has not shown to be deficient--there was no overtime for which the Agency failed to maintain records. Thus, the Union's record-keeping argument provides no basis for finding the award contrary to law.[99]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Union argues that the Arbitrator failed to apply the continuous-workday doctrine, and that he erred as a matter of law in finding that checking in, picking up batteries, or being alert and vigilant do not start the employees' compensable workday. As the Authority has explained, employees are entitled to compensation under the FLSA, as amended by the Portal-to-Portal Act (the Act),[101] for the principal activities that the employees are hired to perform,[102] but are compensated for activities that are preliminary or postliminary to those principal activities only if the preliminary or postliminary activities last more than ten minutes.[103] Under the continuous-workday doctrine, activities that take place between the first and last principal activities of the day, including those that would otherwise be excluded from compensation under the Act, are covered by the FLSA because they occur during the continuous workday.[104]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Regarding check-in, the Arbitrator found, based on the evidence before him, that it involved "little more than taking attendance," and that, consistent with Authority precedent involving a similar check-in,[106] the activity was not a principal activity. The Union argues that the Arbitrator's finding that check-in is not compensable conflicts with the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP, Federal Correctional Institution, Jesup, Georgia</span> (<span class="Italic">Jesup</span>).[108] However, unlike the Arbitrator in this case, the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">Jesup</span> "specifically found that employees do more than check in at the lieutenant's office[;] [h]e found that they also check their mailboxes, receive instructions, and review and sign various documents," and, therefore, that the check-in activity there was compensable.[109] Thus, <span class="Italic">Jesup</span> is distinguishable from this case, and the Union's reliance on that decision provides no basis for concluding that the Arbitrator erred, as a matter of law, by not awarding compensation for the check-in.[110]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Regarding picking up batteries at the control center, the Union asserts that the Arbitrator erred in concluding that this activity is not integral and indispensable to the employees' principal duties, because the Arbitrator erroneously assessed whether employees are "required" to pick up batteries. In this regard, the Union claims that the correct inquiry is whether picking up batteries is "necessary" and performed "primarily for the benefit of the employer."[112] However, the Arbitrator found that because batteries were available at the employees' posts, and that picking up batteries was a choice rather than a necessity, it was "not indispensable to the performance of the principal activities." The Arbitrator's conclusion is consistent with the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Metro</span> that, under the FLSA, the agency was not required to compensate employees who were not required to pick up batteries but did so anyway.[114] The Union also asserts that the Agency conceded, in a filing to the Authority in an <span class="Italic">unrelated</span> case involving a <span class="Italic">different</span> <span class="Italic">institution</span>, that picking up batteries is "indispensable to the performance of the principal work activity." But arguments regarding what the Agency claimed in a different case are not pertinent to our analysis here.[116] Therefore, the Union provides no basis for concluding that the Arbitrator erred by finding that battery pick-up was not compensable.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Regarding employees needing to be alert and vigilant, the Union argues that the Arbitrator--in finding that this is not compensable--erroneously relied on the expense and administrative difficulty involved in paying employees for all time spent inside the prison. The Union also asserts that other arbitrators have found that a requirement that correctional officers be alert and vigilant is compensable. However, the Union does not cite any court or administrative precedent that supports a conclusion that, as a matter of law, a requirement that employees be alert and vigilant when they travel within a prison requires compensation for that travel.[119] And with respect to the Union's reliance on other arbitration awards, as stated previously, arbitration awards are not precedential.[120] Therefore, the Union's arguments provide no basis for concluding that the Arbitrator erred, as a matter of law, in concluding that the employees are not entitled to compensation solely because they are required to be alert and vigilant.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[119]<span class="Italic">See Terre Haute</span>, 58 FLRA at 329 ("unless employees are required to engage in principal activities during their travel, their time spent traveling to and from the actual place of performance <span id="page_2157"></span>of their principal activities" within a prison is not compensable); <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="noindent-2">[120]<span class="Italic">Warner Robins</span>, 68 FLRA at 106.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the Arbitrator erred by not awarding overtime to employees who picked up and dropped off equipment other than batteries at the control center, because "[i]t is undisputed that picking up and dropping off equipment at the [c]ontrol [c]enter is compensable work." However, as discussed previously, the Arbitrator made no findings regarding employees who picked up equipment other than batteries at the control center, and we found that he did not exceed his authority by failing to do so. Thus, there is no basis for finding that the Arbitrator was required to award overtime pay for this alleged activity, and the Union's argument provides no basis for finding the award contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument regarding the continuous-workday doctrine assumes that the activities discussed above are compensable and, thus, that at least one of them began the continuous workday. But, for the reasons discussed above, the Union has not demonstrated that any of those activities are compensable. Therefore, the Union provides no basis for finding that the Arbitrator erroneously failed to apply the continuous-workday doctrine.</p>
<p class="noindent">Presence at the worksite before the onset of compensable preliminary activities is essentially voluntary time by the employee and it is not compensable, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1741 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Milan</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-031.html">62 FLRA 113</a>, 118-19 (2007):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general matter, employees are entitled to be paid for time before and after their ordinary work shift if they are engaged in activities that are "closely related to [their] principal activities, and...indispensable to" those activities. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.412(a) (1); <span class="Italic">BOP, Marion,</span> 61 FLRA at 770. For prison employees, the Authority has found that employees must be compensated from the time that they pick up equipment necessary for their jobs, including time traveling to and from the employee's duty station from the point where equipment is picked up. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Ind.,</span> 58 FLRA 327, 329 (2003) (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>); <span class="Italic">see generally IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez,</span> 546 U.S. 21 (2005). However, employees are not entitled to reimbursement for time spend traveling to and from the worksite if they are not required to pick up equipment, even if they are required to check in at a different location. <span class="Italic">DOJ,</span> 58 FLRA at 329-30.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with this precedent, the Arbitrator found that employees are entitled to be paid once they pick up their equipment, but that they are not entitled to be paid for time that they voluntarily report to work early, but do not pick up their equipment and begin working, or for time waiting in line. The Union agrees that the point at which equipment is picked up is the start of the compensable work day, but argues that employees are entitled to pay for time that they voluntarily come to work early because it is the Agency's responsibility to exercise control that employees do not perform work that it does not intend. Exceptions at 44 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.402(a)). However, the principle relied on by the Union only applies to <span class="Italic">work</span> performed by the employees. As explained above, time spent traveling to work and waiting for work to begin, whether in line or not, is not considered to be compensable time. Nothing in the FLSA requires the Agency to pay employees for voluntary activity that does not qualify as compensable work. <span class="Italic">See generally Amos v. United States,</span> 13 Cl. Ct. 442, 450 (1987) (employees entitled only to pay for "time reasonably required, after gaining possession of the keys and other items, to leave the control room" and walk to work). As such, the Union has not established that the award is contrary to law because it did not award compensation for employees voluntarily arriving at work early.</p>
<p class="noindent">Time spent traveling to a post in a prison is not compensable if there is no principal activity during the travel. Maintaining vigilance is not a principal activity warranting overtime compensation for travel time under <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons USP Atwater and AFGE Local 1242</span>, 68 FLRA 857, 859-60 (2015) (recon. den., 69 FLRA 238 (2016)) (Member DuBester dissenting in part):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator incorrectly concluded that the officers' vigilance and the possibility of encountering inmates while traveling through the main corridor made that travel time compensable. In this regard, the Agency argues that the award conflicts with the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP, Federal Correctional Institution, Allenwood, Pennsylvania (Allenwood)</span>[32] and <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP, U.S. Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Indiana (Terre Haute)</span>.[33] In response, the Union contends that, under the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, U.S. Penitentiary, Coleman II, Florida (Coleman)</span>,[34] "maintaining vigilance in secure areas of the prison" makes the officers' travel time compensable.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Generally, under the Act, the time that an employee spends traveling to his or her post is not compensable unless the employee is required to engage in a principal activity during that travel.[36] In both <span class="Italic">Allenwood</span> and <span class="Italic">Terre Haute</span>, arbitrators found that certain prison employees were entitled to compensation for their travel time in a secured area on the way to their duty posts.[37] In both cases, the Authority found the awards contrary to law because the arbitrators had made no findings that the employees performed principal activities during their travel.[38] In particular, the Authority rejected the idea that the dangerous nature of the prisons meant that the employees' vigilance amounted to a principal activity that made the travel compensable.[39] Similarly, federal-court decisions addressing the compensability of travel time have clarified that, while work that occurs during travel may be compensable, the mere possibility that an employee <span class="Italic">might</span> be called upon to perform work while traveling does not make all travel time compensable.[40]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, while the Arbitrator found that "violent circumstances and inmate misconduct have occurred" and that officers "may encounter inmates" when passing through the main corridor, he did not find that officers en route to their posts have had to address such circumstances or misconduct. Additionally, although the Arbitrator here found the officers' "vigilance" while traveling to be "integral and indispensable" to officers' principal activities, he did not find the travel to be a principal activity itself. We note, in this regard, that the Arbitrator determined that the main corridor is continuously staffed by officers who "patrol and monitor for anything that happens" in the main corridor. Thus, it is the primary duty of those officers--not the officers en route to their posts--to respond to any violent circumstances or inmate misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's findings distinguish this case from <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>. In <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>, an arbitrator found that once certain prison employees entered a particular secure area, they began performing their principal duties because they were in the presence of inmates, they <span class="Italic">were</span> called upon to restrain inmates, and incidents involving the inmates "[did] occur" inside the area.[46] More specifically, in <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>, unlike here, the arbitrator found that that "[o]n one occasion[,] [an officer] personally assisted staff in restraining inmates who'd been fighting while he was walking in the corridor."[47] Thus, we interpret the holding in <span class="Italic">Coleman</span> to be limited to the circumstances in which an arbitrator expressly found that employees performed a principal activity, not merely an integral and indispensable activity, when they actually engaged with inmates.[48] Those circumstances are not present here, as the Arbitrator found only that the officers' "vigilance" while traveling was "integral and indispensable."[49]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">Member Pizzella notes that, as he did in <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>, "'the dangerous nature of the correctional environment' does not transform non-compensable activities into integral and indispensable activities." <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>, 68 FLRA at 59 (Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of Member Pizzella) (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, Fed. Prisons Camp, Bryan, Tex</span>., 67 FLRA 236, 238 (2014) (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, Fed. Corr. Inst., Allenwood, Pa</span>., 65 FLRA 996, 999 (2011) (Member DuBester dissenting in part))). In other words, vigilance and heightened awareness does not make an activity compensable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, in this case, the Agency concedes that "if an employee is (as opposed to might be) called upon to respond to an emergency,...then the Agency would pay that employee from the time of that response forward, since there would be a principal activity once that involvement began." This approach is consistent with <span class="Italic">Reich v. N.Y.C. Transit Authority (Reich)</span>,[51] in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit interpreted the Act to require payment for any principal activities that employees performed during travel, but found that it would "go too far" to extend that holding to render all travel time compensable.[52] Thus, consistent with <span class="Italic">Reich</span>,as well as the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">Allenwood</span> and <span class="Italic">Terre Haute</span>, we find that the mere possibility that the officers <span class="Italic">could</span> be called upon to perform a principal duty while traveling is not sufficient, by itself, to make the travel here compensable under the Act.[53]</p>
