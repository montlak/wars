<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-274"><span class="space">23.</span> Employee Privacy; Search</h4>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">AFGE, Dept. of Educ. Council of AFGE Locals and Dept. of Educ.</span>, 38 FLRA 1068, 1092 (1990), <span class="Italic">reaff'd on reconsideration</span>, 39 FLRA 1241 (1991), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied as to other proposals</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Minerals Mgmt. Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 969 F.2d 1158, 1160-61 (D.C. Cir. 1992), FLRA developed a seemingly straightforward proposal--"Tests will be given in a sanitary, secluded area, which provides the employee with privacy"--into an extensive discussion of the meaning of privacy in the context of drug testing. Proposal 5, Section B, survived to negotiations, 38 FLRA at 1094-1099:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section B of Proposal 5 provides that urine samples will be taken in a sanitary area which accords employees privacy.&#x2003;The Union states that "'privacy'...is intended to have its normal dictionary meaning. However, this may include some intrusion as the result of a reasonable suspicion by management that an employee may attempt to invalidate or falsify the urine specimen." The Union asserts that "the 'privacy provision' of this proposal is consistent with law, rule and regulation." We find that section B of Proposal 5 is consistent with the final Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing, 53 Fed. Reg. 11970-89, and the Executive Order. We also find that we do not need to determine whether section B involves the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) because we conclude that, even if section B were found to directly interfere with that right, section B would constitute an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute and is negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 4(c) of the Executive Order provides that "[p]rocedures for providing urine specimens must allow individual privacy, unless the agency has reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen provided." Thus, the Executive Order mandates that agencies allow employees individual privacy when providing urine samples. An agency may limit an employee's privacy only if the agency has reason to believe that the employee will attempt to alter or substitute his or her sample.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By providing that employees be allowed privacy when providing a urine sample, section B of Proposal 5 does not in any way prevent the Agency from exercising its right to limit an employee's privacy if the Agency believes that the employee will alter or substitute a urine sample. The wording of section B does not establish any specific standard which the Agency must use in determining whether it is appropriate to assign an observer to monitor the collection of a urine sample. The Union states that the requirement for privacy "may include some intrusion as the result of a reasonable suspicion by management that an employee may attempt to invalidate or falsify the urine specimen."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union also states that the proposal is intended to be implemented consistent with law, rule, and regulation. We note that section B of Proposal 5 is similar to section 2.2(f)(7) of the final Guidelines, which provides that "[t]he individual may provide his/her specimen in the privacy of a stall or otherwise partitioned area that allows for individual privacy." In providing for personal privacy therefore, section B affords employees nothing more or less than is provided by the final Guidelines.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we reject the Agency's contention that section B of Proposal 5 would prohibit the presence of an observer and thus conflicts with the Executive Order and management's rights. As noted above, section B of Proposal 5 does not in any way prevent the Agency from exercising its right to limit an employee's privacy if it has a reason to believe that the employee will alter the sample.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also contends that the legal standard in section B is different from the standard in the Executive Order.&#x2003;The Agency argues that section B would prohibit the presence of an observer when management had "reason to believe" that the sample may have been tampered with and concludes that because section B would preclude an observer section B is contrary to the Executive Order and interferes with management's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Rock Island I</span>, 30 FLRA at 1079-81, the Authority held that a proposal which restricted the agency's ability to assign an observer to monitor the collection of a urine sample was nonnegotiable because it was inconsistent with Executive Order No. 12564. Proposal 12 in <span class="Italic">Rock Island I</span> restricted management's decision to assign an observer to monitor the collection of a urine sample to those circumstances where it has "probable cause" to believe that an employee will alter the test sample.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority stated that the probable cause standard is a generally recognized legal standard.&#x2003;Considering the standard within the context of the proposal, the Authority found that the proposal would have the effect of permitting the agency to assign an observer to monitor the taking of a urine sample "only where the weight of the available evidence supports the conclusion that the employee is tampering with or is about to tamper with the sample." <span class="Italic">Rock Island I</span>, 30 FLRA at 1081. The Authority interpreted the standard in section 4(c) of the Executive Order--providing that employees would give urine samples in private except where management has "reason to believe" that a particular employee will alter or substitute for the sample--to permit an observer where there is "any reason at all which gives rise to and supports a belief that the employee may alter the sample."... The Authority found that the probable cause standard was more restrictive than the standard in Executive Order No. 12564, and, therefore, the proposal was inconsistent with the Executive Order and nonnegotiable under section 7117(a)(1) of the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the issuance of <span class="Italic">Rock Island I</span>, HHS issued the final Guidelines which set forth "indicia of 'reason to believe'" within the meaning of section 4(c) of the Executive Order. Section 2.2(f)(14) of the final Guidelines, 53 Fed. Reg. at 11973. <span class="Italic">See also</span> FPM Letter 792-19, Section 4.g(2) (Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guidance implementing section 4 (c) of the Executive Order). The final Guidelines and FPM Letter 792-19 clarify the "reason to believe" standard in the Executive Order. Therefore, we will interpret the "reason to believe" standard in the Executive Order, consistent with the final Guidelines and FPM Letter 792-19, which were issued after the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Rock Island I</span>. Consequently we no longer will follow the Authority's interpretation of the "reason to believe" standard in...the Executive Order, as set forth in <span class="Italic">Rock Island I</span>, which permitted an agency to assign an observer if it has "any reason at all" which gives rise to and supports a belief that an employee may alter a urine sample.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn, then, to consideration of the meaning of the phrase "reason to believe." The final Guidelines, consistent with section 4(c) of the Executive Order, provide that an agency's drug testing program "shall allow individual privacy unless there is reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided." Section 2.2(e) of the final Guidelines, 53 Fed. Reg. at 11980; FPM Letter 792-19, Section 4.g. "[I]ndicia of 'reason to believe' are set out in [section] 2.2(f) [of the final Guidelines]." 53 Fed. Reg. at 11973. They include, but are not limited to, unusual temperature of the specimen, unusual color of the specimen, and the unusual behavior of a particular individual....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The procedures in the final Guidelines also require that: (1) an agency first record in a permanent record book the evidence which leads to a reason to believe that an individual may alter the specimen...(2) all specimens suspected of being adulterated be tested...and (3) whenever there is reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided, the agency must obtain a second sample as soon as possible under direct observation.... "The Final Guidelines also add a requirement that any 'reason to believe' observation be concurred in by a higher level supervisor of the collection site person."... At a minimum, therefore, these provisions, taken together, require the presence of specific and particularized facts which would give an agency "reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now consider whether the "reasonable suspicion" standard in section B is consistent with the "reason to believe" standard as discussed above. In its Government-wide guidance to agencies on the implementation of the terms of the Executive Order OPM defines "reasonable suspicion" to test an employee for illegal drugs as an articulable belief that an employee uses illegal drugs drawn from specific and particularized facts and reasonable inferences from those facts."... We read section B as imposing a "reasonable suspicion" for observation standard which contains elements similar to the "reasonable suspicion" for testing standard in the OPM guidance. That is, the effect of section B is to require that the Agency be able to provide reasons to support its suspicion that an employee may alter or substitute a urine sample, which reasons are based upon specific facts and reasonable inferences from those facts before the Agency assigns an observer to monitor the collection of the sample.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Construed in this manner, the "reasonable suspicion" standard in section B is consistent with the "reason to believe" provisions of the Executive Order and with the final Guidelines and the OPM guidance implementing section 4(c) of the Executive Order....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Interpreted consistent with the Union's statement of meaning, section B contains the same requirements as the final Guidelines....</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_809"></span>...The Union has not defined "reasonable suspicion" in any contrary manner, and nothing in the record before us suggests an interpretation of "reasonable suspicion" that is inconsistent with applicable law, rule and regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that in our disposition of Proposal 1 above, we held that proposals which bind management to compliance with the requirements of law and regulation in the exercise of section 7106(a)(1) rights directly interfere with those rights. We do not need to reach the question of whether the decision to assign an observer to monitor an employee urine sample, as provided in Section B, involves the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) because the proposal is negotiable in any event. If the decision to assign an observer to monitor an employee urine sample does not constitute the exercise of management's right under section 7106(a)(1), section B is negotiable because it would not directly interfere with the exercise of a management right and, as we found above, section B is consistent with the requirements of the Executive Order and the final Guidelines.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, if the decision to assign an observer constitutes the exercise of management's right under section 7106(a)(1), the limitation imposed on the exercise of that right by the incorporation of the Executive Order standard in section B would, consistent with our holding as to Proposal 1, directly interfere with that right. However, section B would nevertheless be negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Again, consistent with our holding as to Proposal 1, the benefit to employees of the protection afforded their privacy by the application of the Executive Order standard outweighs any burden on management's right to act, under section 7106(a)(1), without regard to the requirements of the Executive Order.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal that "[n]o person shall be observed by any other than the official observer while providing a sample" was negotiable, <span class="Italic">NAGE, FUSE, Local R1-144 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr., Newport</span>, 42 FLRA 730, 769, 770-71 (1991) (Proposal 9):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 9 requires the Agency to assign only official observers to observe the collection process.&#x2003;In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, we interpret the proposal as taking effect only where the Agency has determined that an observer is required because there is reason to believe that an employee will alter or substitute his or her sample. <span class="Italic">See</span> Section 4(c) of Executive Order No. 11564.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find, consistent with the wording of the proposal and the Union's stated intent, that the proposal would not restrict the Agency's determination as to which persons could be an official observer or the number of individuals who could be designated as official observers. We note, in this regard, that the proposal refers to "the" official observer. The Union explains, however, that "[t]he proposal does not intend to limit in any way the number of management appointed official observers. The intent is to allow only official observers to view the testing."... In our view, the Union's explanation is consistent with the wording of the proposal. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that there is a particular individual who has been designated as "official observer." Accordingly, the phrase could equally plausibly be read to refer to the class of individuals designated by the Agency as an "official observer." Consequently, we will adopt the Union's explanation of the proposal for purposes of this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Interpreted in this manner, Proposal 9 does not limit the number of official observers that could be assigned in any given instance where the Agency determines that an observer is necessary. The proposal limits observation of the collection process to those persons designated as observers by the Agency but does not restrict the Agency's ability to designate those observers or to assign them to observe a particular instance of specimen collection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on this interpretation, we find that Proposal 9 does not directly interfere with management's rights to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) or to determine the numbers, types and grades of employees assigned to a work project under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. Proposals that require management to assign work to particular employees directly interfere with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.... Because Proposal 9 does not restrict management's ability to designate the persons who will serve as observers, we find,...the proposal does not directly interfere with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, proposals that direct management to assign a particular number of employees to a particular task directly interfere with management's right to determine the numbers of employees assigned to a work project under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.... Proposals that preserve management's discretion as to the numbers of employees to assign to a work project or tour of duty do not directly interfere with management's right under section 7106(b)(1)....</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposal 12, that the employer not use observers during the sampling routine unless there is probable cause to believe the employee will alter the sample, was nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 15 and Dept. of Army, Army Armament, Munitions and Chem. Command, Rock Island</span>, 30 FLRA 1046, 1079-80 (1988). The proposal prevented the agency from assigning an observer unless it had sufficient evidence to conclude that an employee was altering or about to alter a test sample. The proposal was contrary to &#x00A7; 4(c) of the Executive Order, providing that procedures relating to sample collection allow the employees to give samples in private unless management has "reason to believe" that a particular employee will alter or destroy the sample, a standard lower than the probable cause standard of the union proposal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">IAM Local Lodge 2424 and Dept. of Army, Aberdeen Proving Ground</span>, 31 FLRA 205, 222-23 (1988) (Proposal 24, "Employees will not be directly observed while they are providing a sample unless there is just cause to believe that the employee has tampered, adulterated, or otherwise has attempted to affect the test results," nonnegotiable: "Like the union in <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center</span>, the Union here does not define the term 'just cause' or provide any evidence that explains the intent of the proposal."); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2185 and Tooele Army Depot</span>, 31 FLRA 45, 49, 51 (1988) (nonnegotiable Proposals 2 and 3: varying from provisions of Executive Order circumstances where observer would be permitted in sample collection process).</p>
<p class="noindent">But a variant of the "reason to believe" proposal concerning testing privacy was considered in <span class="Italic">NFFE Council of GSA Locals and GSA</span>, 41 FLRA 728, 729 (1991). The proposal was that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Observation by collection site personnel will be permitted only when such personnel have reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided based on criteria set forth in chapter 4-2.e and f of the GSA order.</p>
<p class="noindent">The proposal was negotiable, 41 FLRA at 732-39:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 authorizes direct observation by collection site personnel only when such personnel "have reason to believe" that the individual to be tested for drugs may alter or substitute the specimen "based on criteria set forth in chapter 4-2.e and f" of GSA Order OAD P 9700. Chapter 4-2 of the GSA Order provides, in its entirety, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Privacy requirements</span>. Any individual subject to testing shall be permitted to provide urine specimens in private, and in a rest room stall or similar enclosure so that the employee is not observed while providing the sample. Collection site personnel, however, may observe the individual provide the urine specimen when such personnel have reason to believe the individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided. The collection site personnel will be of the same gender as the employee. Collection site personnel may have reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided when--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;The individual is being tested relating to reasonable suspicion testing;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;Facts and circumstances suggest that the individual is an illegal drug user;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003;Facts and circumstances suggest that the individual is under the influence of drugs at the time of the test;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">d.&#x2003;The individual has previously been found by GSA to be an illegal drug user;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">e.&#x2003;Facts and circumstances suggest that the individual has equipment or implements capable of tampering with or altering urine samples; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">f.&#x2003;The individual has previously tampered with a sample.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Read in conjunction with the GSA Regulation to which it refers, it is clear that Proposal 1 would permit observation by collection site personnel "only when such personnel have reason to believe" that an employee may alter or substitute the specimen because: (1) facts and circumstances suggest that the employee has equipment or implements capable of tampering with or altering the sample; or (2) the employee previously has tampered with a sample.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Executive Order and the FPM Letter</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's contentions that Proposal 1 is inconsistent with the Executive Order and the FPM Letter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 4(c) of the Executive Order provides that "[p]rocedures for providing urine specimens must allow individual privacy, unless the agency has reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided." The Executive Order neither provides any examples of situations where there is such a "reason to believe" nor in any other way addresses the matter. Moreover, the Executive Order does not mandate direct observation in any circumstances. It merely provides an exception to the requirement that employees be afforded privacy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 also provides for direct observation when collection site personnel "have reason to believe" that an employee may alter or substitute a specimen. The Union states, in this regard, that the proposal is intended to encompass the "reason to believe" standard set forth in the Executive Order. As the Union's statement is consistent with the plain wording of the proposal, and as the Executive Order neither defines <span id="page_810"></span>the "reason to believe" standard nor requires direct observation in any situation, we conclude that, by permitting direct observation when the Agency has reason to believe, based on the specified criteria, that an employee may alter or substitute a specimen, Proposal 1 is consistent with the Executive Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">FPM Letter 792-19, Section 4.g provides, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">g.&#x2003;Privacy in Drug Testing. Agency drug testing procedures under E.O. 12564 must allow individual privacy unless the agency has reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided. Agencies should refer to the HHS Mandatory Scientific and Technical Guidelines for Federal Employee Drug Testing Programs for the specific procedures to be followed in conducting drug tests.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Generally, an employee or applicant may be required to provide a sample under observation only if there is reason to believe that the employee or applicant may alter or substitute the urine specimen. For example, employers may wish to require observation when facts and circumstances suggest that the person to be tested: (a) is an illegal drug user; (b) is under the influence of drugs at the time of the test; (c) has previously been confirmed by the agency to be an illegal drug user; (d) is seen to have equipment or implements used to tamper with urine samples; (e) has recently been determined to have tampered with a sample.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no conflict between Proposal 1 and section 4.g(2) of the FPM Letter. It is clear, in this regard, that Proposal 1 lists only two of the five circumstances discussed in connection with direct observation in section 4.g(2). Like the Executive Order, however, section 4.g(2) does not mandate testing under direct observation in any of those circumstances. Rather, as plainly worded, section 4.g(2) speaks only to circumstances in which "employers <span class="Italic">may wish</span> to require observation...." (Emphasis is original). As such, section 4.g(2) shows an intent to allow agencies discretion to determine when direct observation of employees providing specimens is appropriate. Indeed, consistent with its discretion, the Agency has elected to include in its Agency regulation a circumstance which is not contained in section 4.g(2). Consequently, although Proposal 1 lists only two of the five circumstances in section 4.g(2), it does not conflict with the FPM letter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, although not raised by the Agency, we note that the HHS "Guidelines...clarify the 'reason to believe' standard in the Executive Order."... In particular, section 2.2(e) and (f) of the Guidelines provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Privacy</span>. Procedures for collecting urine specimens shall allow individual privacy unless there is reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Integrity and Identity of Specimen</span>.... The following minimum precautions shall be taken to ensure that unadulterated specimens are obtained and correctly identified:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(7)&#x2003;The individual may provide his/her specimen in the privacy of a stall or otherwise partitioned area that allows for individual privacy.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(13) If the temperature of a specimen is outside the range of 32.5 (degrees)-37.7 (degrees) C/90.5 (degrees)-99.8 (degrees) F, that is reason to believe that the individual may have altered or substituted the specimen, and another specimen shall be collected under direct observation of a same gender collection site person and both specimens shall be forwarded to the laboratory for testing.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(16) Whenever there is reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided, a second specimen shall be obtained as soon as possible under the direct observation of a same gender collection site person.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the Executive Order and the FPM Letter, the Guidelines provide that direct observation must be based on a reason to believe that an employee may alter or substitute a urine specimen. Unlike the Order and the Letter, however, section 2.2(f)(13) of the Guidelines provides that, if a specimen is outside a specified temperature range, that fact "is a reason to believe that the individual may have altered or substituted the specimen[.]" In that circumstance, the Guidelines require the collection of another specimen under direct observation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no basis in the record on which to conclude that Proposal 1 would prohibit direct observation in the situation where it is required by section 2.2(f)(13) of the Guidelines. The proposal provides for direct observation when circumstances suggest that the tested employee has equipment capable of tampering with or altering the specimen or when the individual has previously tampered with a sample. We note, in this regard, that none of the sections of the GSA Order other than the two encompassed by Proposal 1 appear to relate to the situation where direct observation is required by the Guidelines. Moreover, there is no assertion in the record that the GSA order does not encompass direct observation in the circumstance where such observation is mandated in section 2.2(f)(13) of the Guidelines. Accordingly, in the absence of any indication in the record to the contrary, we conclude that an employee's provision of a specimen falling outside the temperature range specified in section 2.2(f)(13) of the Guidelines would suggest either that the employee has equipment capable of tampering with a specimen or that the employee has tampered with a specimen. As such, the direct observation which is required by the Guidelines would be permitted under subsections e and f of the GSA Order, as encompassed by Proposal 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Internal Security Practices</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that Proposal 1 is nonnegotiable because it is inconsistent with management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. For the following reasons, we disagree with the Agency's argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In [<span class="Italic">AFGE Dept. of Educ. Council of AFGE Locals and Dept. of]</span> <span class="Italic"> Education</span>, [38 FLRA 1068 (1990)], section B of Proposal 5 required that management accord employees privacy when providing urine specimens unless, consistent with the union's statement of intent, management had a "reasonable suspicion...that an employee may attempt to invalidate or falsify the urine specimen." 38 FLRA at 1094 (citation omitted). The agency in <span class="Italic">Education</span> argued, as the Agency does here, that the disputed proposal interfered with management's right to determine its internal security practices. In responding to the agency's argument, we noted that it was unnecessary to reach the question of whether the disputed proposal interfered with a management right under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute because:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[i]f the decision to assign an observer to monitor an employee urine sample does not constitute the exercise of management's right under section 7106(a)(1), section B is negotiable because it would not directly interfere with the exercise of a management right....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">On the other hand, if the decision to assign an observer constitutes the exercise of management's right under section 7106(a)(1), the limitation imposed on the exercise of that right by the incorporation of the Executive Order standard in section B would...directly interfere with that right. However, section B would nevertheless be negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.... [T]he benefit to employees of the protection afforded their privacy by the application of the Executive Order standard outweighs any burden on management's right to act, under section 7106(a)(1), without regard to the requirements of the Executive Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1098-99.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Using the framework set out in <span class="Italic">Education</span>, we find it unnecessary here to determine whether Proposal 1 directly interferes with the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1). Applying the framework set forth in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 24, 31-33 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Kansas Army National Guard</span>), we conclude that even if Proposal 1 directly interferes with the exercise of that right, it is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement. We note three things.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, unlike the disputed proposal in <span class="Italic">Education</span>, Proposal 1 restricts the criteria on which the Agency's "reason to believe" may be based. The two criteria contained in the proposal are broad, however. They encompass facts and circumstances suggesting that an employee has equipment capable of tampering with a sample and situations where an employee has tampered with a sample. In fact, the first criteria is broader than that specified in the FPM Letter. Section 4.g(2)(d) of the FPM Letter provides that an agency may wish directly to observe an employee when the employee "is seen to have equipment or implements used to tamper with urine samples[.]" Proposal 1 would permit direct observation when facts and circumstances merely "suggest" that an employee has such equipment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Executive Order, the Guidelines, and the FPM Letter indicate a clear preference for employee privacy during testing. In fact, as noted previously, all three provisions <span class="Italic">require</span> such privacy unless there is "reason to believe" that employees may tamper with specimens. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab</span>, 109 S. Ct. 1384, 1394 n.2 (1989) (<span class="Italic">NTEU v. Von Raab</span>) (Court stated that disputed drug-testing program did not "carry the grave potential for 'arbitrary and oppressive interference with the privacy and personal security of individuals[ ]'" because, among other things, "[t]here is no direct observation of the act of urination, as the employee may provide a specimen in the privacy of a stall.") For the reasons previously discussed, Proposal 1 is fully consistent with the principle of employee privacy and with the portions of the Order, Guidelines, and the Letter addressing it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, consistent with the preference in the Executive Order, the <span id="page_811"></span>Guidelines, and the FPM Letter for employee privacy, there can be no reasonable dispute that direct observation of an employee while that employee provides a urine specimen is a direct and significant intrusion on the employee's privacy:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">There are few activities in our society more personal or private than the passing of urine. Most people describe it by euphemisms if they talk about it at all. It is a function traditionally performed without public observation; indeed, its performance in public is generally prohibited by law as well as social custom.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn.</span>, 109 S. Ct. 1401, 1413 (1989).... To the extent that the decision to observe directly an employee providing a urine sample constitutes the exercise of the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices, the intrusion on employees' privacy results directly from the exercise of the right and, in our view, constitutes an adverse effect under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 preserves management's right to observe employees directly in two broad circumstances when there is reason to believe that the employees may alter or substitute the specimens. Proposal 1 also ensures that, except in the circumstances set forth, employees are afforded privacy. We conclude that the benefit afforded to employees by Proposal 1 outweighs any interference with management's right under section 7106(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For all of these reasons, we conclude that Proposal 1 is negotiable. The proposal is consistent with Executive Order 12564 and FPM Letter 792-19. If the decision to observe employees while they provide urine specimens does not constitute the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices, Proposal 1 is negotiable because it would not directly interfere with the exercise of that management right. Even if such decision constitutes the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices, however, Proposal 1 would not excessively interfere with that right and would, therefore, be negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another negotiable proposal concerning observers was considered in <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 3097 and DOJ, Justice Mgmt. Div.</span>, 42 FLRA 412, 503-05 (1991). Proposal 50 was that "[e]mployees shall not be observed while providing a urine sample unless there is reason to believe a particular employee may alter or substitute the specimen provided, with that reason being non-arbitrary and rational." FLRA said of the proposal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we reject the Agency's suggestion that we decline to rule on the negotiability of Proposal 50 because it is too vague. In the case relied on by the Agency, <span class="Italic">Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center</span>, 31 FLRA at 115-16, the union sought to apply a "just cause" standard to direct observation of the provision of urine samples. In the absence of any reasonable explanation of how that standard would apply to a decision to directly observe an employee, the Authority was unable to determine whether the proposal was consistent with the "reason to believe" standard contained in the Executive Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, Proposal 50 contains a "reason to believe" standard, and it is clear from the record how the proposal would apply. Our task, therefore, is to decide whether the modifying words, "non-arbitrary and rational," are incompatible with the "reason to believe" standard contained in the Executive Order and governing regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span> [38 FLRA 1068 (1990)], section B of Proposal 5 provided that employees would be afforded privacy during the drug testing process unless management had "a reasonable suspicion" that an employee might attempt to invalidate or falsify the urine sample. 38 FLRA at 1094. In finding section B to be negotiable, we found that, in implementing the "reason to believe" standard contained in the Executive Order, the HHS Guidelines and FPM Letter 792-19 require that an agency decision to require direct observation of an employee providing a urine sample "be based on a reasonable belief, which is supported by particular and objective facts, that the employee may alter or substitute the sample." 38 FLRA at 1098. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, 41 FLRA at 736.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We read Proposal 50 as imposing a standard no different from that in the HHS Guidelines and the FPM Letter.&#x2003;That is, the proposal requires that the Agency be able to provide reasons to support its belief that an employee may alter or substitute a sample and that those reasons be based on specific facts and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts before an observer is assigned to oversee the collection of that employee's sample. Accordingly, we find that Proposal 50 is consistent with the Executive Order, the HHS Guidelines, and FPM Letter 792-19.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find, in accordance with <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>, that it is unnecessary to determine whether the proposal involves the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, because we conclude that, even if Proposal 50 were found to directly interfere with that right, the proposal would nonetheless be negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1098-99. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, 41 FLRA at 737-39.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that Proposal 50 is nonnegotiable because it conflicts with the Agency's drug plan for which it asserts there is a compelling need. We disagree. We note, in this regard, that chapter 4.E. of the Department of Justice "Drug-Free Workplace Plan" parallels both the HHS Guidelines and the FPM Letter concerning direct observation. That is, in accordance with the Guidelines and the FPM Letter, chapter 4.H. does not require direct observation in the enumerated situations. Rather, chapter 4.H. provides that "[o]bservation is <span class="Italic">permitted</span>...when there is reason to believe a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen provided."... Accordingly, even if we were to accept the Agency's assertion that the proposal precludes direct observation in circumstances encompassed by the Agency's plan, the plan does not prohibit bargaining over the proposal because observation in such situations under the plan is not mandatory. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1501 and U.S. Department of the Air Force, Airlift Military Command, McChord Air Force Base, Washington</span>, 38 FLRA 1515, 1521 (1991) (as regulation provided agency with discretion as to disputed matter, proposal was not inconsistent with the regulation).</p>
<p class="noindent">Other proposals restricting "direct observation" were negotiable in <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 3097 and DOJ, Justice Mgmt. Div.</span>, 42 FLRA 412 (1991). Evaluated were these provisions, 42 FLRA at 505:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Proposal 51</span>. Reasonable suspicion testing in and of itself is not grounds for direct observation in the provision of a urine sample. There must be additional reason to believe that an employee may tamper with a sample before direct observation may be used.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Proposal 52</span>. The fact that an employee is being tested because facts and circumstances suggest that the individual is an illegal drug user or is under the influence of drugs at the time of the test shall not in and of itself be cause for direct observation of the employee when he/she provides the urine sample. Direct observation may be used only when there are additional facts and circumstances which suggests [sic] that an employee might tamper with a urine sample.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA explained the negotiability of Proposals 51 and 52, 42 FLRA at 508-10:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals 51 and 52 would, respectively, prevent direct observation of an employee's provision of a urine specimen solely on the basis that: (1) the employee is being tested because there is a reasonable suspicion that he or she is an illegal drug user; or (2) facts and circumstances suggest that the employee is an illegal drug user or is under the influence of illegal drugs at the time of the test. The proposals would authorize direct observation only when the Agency has reason to believe that the employee might tamper with the sample to be provided.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, 41 FLRA at 729, the first disputed proposal authorized direct observation of an employee providing a urine sample only when there is reason to believe that the employee may alter or substitute the sample because facts and circumstances suggest that the employee either possesses equipment or implements capable of tampering with or altering the sample or has previously tampered with samples. Like Proposals 51 and 52, the <span class="Italic">GSA</span> proposal narrowed the grounds justifying direct observation provided in the applicable drug testing regulations. In fact, the proposal in <span class="Italic">GSA</span> is even more restrictive than Proposals 51 and 52, in that it authorized direct observation only in two specified circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining the negotiability of the disputed proposal in <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, we first examined relevant provisions of the Executive Order, the HHS Guidelines, and FPM Letter 792-19. We concluded, for reasons discussed fully therein, that this statutory and regulatory guidance provided agencies with discretion, except in one instance, in determining when direct observation of employees providing specimens is appropriate. With respect to the one exception, section 2.2(f)(13) of the HHS Guidelines requires that a second specimen be obtained under direct observation when a first specimen is outside specified temperature ranges. We concluded, in view of the discretion afforded by the Executive Order and the applicable regulations, that the <span class="Italic">GSA</span> proposal was not inconsistent with either the Executive Order or the FPM Letter. We also found nothing in the <span class="Italic">GSA</span> proposal preventing direct observation in the single situation where such supervision is mandated by the HHS Guidelines.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, we find that the requirement in Proposals 51 and 52 that the decision to observe directly an employee undergoing "reasonable suspicion" testing be supported by specific reasons to believe that the employee will alter or substitute the sample is not inconsistent with provisions in the Executive Order or applicable regulations. Moreover, as with the <span class="Italic">GSA</span> proposal, we find nothing in the proposals' wording or in the record which prevents direct observation in the situation where such observation is mandated by the HHS Guidelines. Consequently, for the reasons more fully stated in <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, Proposals 51 and 52 are consistent with the Executive Order, FPM Letter 792-19, and the HHS Guidelines. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 733-36.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, with respect to the FPM Letter, that OPM has announced its intention to revise the letter. Office of Personnel Management, <span class="Italic"><span id="page_812"></span>New Developments in Employee and Labor Relations</span> (July 1991) at 3. In particular, OPM states that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he mere fact that an employee is undergoing a reasonable suspicion test is not, in and of itself, grounds for the agency to visually observe the employee giving the sample. Visual observation may only be required when there is reason to believe that a particular employee may tamper with a test or sample.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find, in this regard, no inconsistency between our conclusion that Proposal 51 is not inconsistent with the FPM Letter and OPM's intention to revise it. That is, we adhere to our view that, as presently written, the FPM Letter does not require direct observation of the provision of urine samples by employees undergoing reasonable suspicion testing. That OPM seeks to make that interpretation clear does not undermine our finding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our next step in <span class="Italic">GSA</span> was to determine whether the disputed proposal excessively interfered with the agency's right under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute to determine its internal security practices. We noted that, if the decision to observe employees while they provide urine specimens did not constitute the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices, the proposal was negotiable because it would not directly interfere with the exercise of that management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also concluded, however, that if such decision constitutes the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices, the proposal did not excessively interfere with that right. In so finding, we noted that the proposal preserved management's right to observe employees directly "in two broad circumstances when there is reason to believe that the employee may alter or substitute the specimens." 41 FLRA at 739. On the other hand, the proposal provided significant benefits to employees by limiting the intrusion on employee privacy occasioned by direct observation, and reflected the preference for privacy expressed in the Executive Order and applicable regulations. Therefore, we concluded that the proposal would not excessively interfere with management's right to determine its internal security practices and would "be negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons fully discussed in <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, and noting again that Proposals 51 and 52 impose a less rigorous standard on the Agency's decision to require the collection of specimens under direct observation than the <span class="Italic">GSA</span> proposal, we find that Proposals 51 and 52 are negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Agency's additional arguments that the proposals: (1) interfere with the right to discipline under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute; and (2) conflict with the Agency drug plan, for which a compelling need exists, are without merit. As to the first argument, we note that these proposals deal exclusively with the drug testing program and do not in any way prescribe what investigative steps the Agency may take in connection with a potential disciplinary proceeding. Concerning the second argument, as we observed with regard to Proposal 50, the Agency's drug testing plan provides managers with discretion to observe directly in specified circumstances. As direct observation under the Agency's plan is a discretionary matter, the Agency is obligated to exercise that discretion through collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1808 and Dept. of Army, Sierra Army Depot</span>, 42 FLRA 542, 546, 552 (1991), disapproved the negotiability of Proposal 4, demanding "auditory" privacy during drug testing unless it appeared that the employee was abusing illegal substances. The proposal did not provide exceptions for conditions, set forth in the Guidelines, that would necessitate deviations from the guarantee sought by the proposal. As a result, the proposal was inconsistent with government-wide regulations. A different result was reached in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3457 and Dept. of Interior, Minerals Mgmt. Serv.</span>, 42 FLRA 567, 573-77 (1991), involving Proposal 3, seeking auditory and visual privacy. The union stated the proposal was not intended to "preclude the appropriate, limited, and controlled observation under the circumstances described in HHS Guidelines," and "the degree of privacy to be accorded to employees is that which is 'reasonable under the circumstances.'" <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 and Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv., Blue Ridge Parkway</span>, 43 FLRA 836, 875, 880-82 (1991) (Proposal 5B negotiable: that tests be given in sanitary, secluded area affording employees visual and auditory privacy; union position statement allowed for direct observation if there is reason to believe that individual may alter or substitute specimen).</p>
<p class="noindent">Passing muster in <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 3097 and DOJ, Justice Mgmt. Div.</span>, 42 FLRA 412, 471 (1991), was Proposal 30:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sample collections are to be accomplished in a manner compatible with employee dignity.&#x2003;It is technically feasible to verify that a sample has not been tampered with without subjecting the tested employee to a degrading experience.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA declared the "employee dignity" proposal negotiable, adding a number of qualifications taken from the union's position statement, 42 FLRA at 473-76:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 30 would require the Agency to collect specimens "in a manner compatible with employee dignity," and not subject "the tested employee to a degrading experience." The Union states that the proposal "does not prevent management from observing the provision of the sample if there is reason to believe that tampering might occur."... Furthermore, the Union asserts that its proposal "does not automatically preclude direct observation, because it is understood that higher authority has stated that direct observation can occur when there is 'reason to believe' that a sample may be tampered with."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Interpreted in this manner, we reject the Agency's argument that the proposal would permit direct observation only when the Agency has evidence that an employee had previously tampered with a sample. Rather, as the Union points out, direct observation would be authorized when management has reason to believe that an employee may alter or substitute the specimen. Accordingly, we find that Proposal 30 is consistent with the Executive Order, the FPM Letter, and the HHS Guidelines. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span>, <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, 41 FLRA at 733-36.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, we reject the Agency's assertion that the proposal is nonnegotiable because it conflicts with an Agency regulation for which a compelling need exists. To support its assertion, the Agency relies on the portion of its Agency-wide plan set out at section 4.H. addressing direct observation of the provision of a urine sample. That portion of the plan provides the following, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The employee or applicant to be tested will provide his or her sample in a rest room stall or similar enclosure so that the employee is not being observed while providing the sample. Observation is permitted, however, when there is reason to believe a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen provided.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]o sustain an argument that a proposal is nonnegotiable because it conflicts with an agency regulation for which there is a compelling need, the agency must, initially, identify an agency regulation with which the disputed proposal conflicts. We find no such conflict here. First, there is no assertion that the Agency's drug testing plan requires, or even contemplates, the collection of urine samples in a manner which is incompatible with employee dignity. Secondly, as discussed above, the Union interprets the proposal, which interpretation we adopt, as enabling the Agency to observe directly the provision of urine samples in situations where the Agency has reason to believe that the affected employee may alter or tamper with the sample. As such, there is no conflict with the Agency's drug testing plan.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that, even if the proposal is consistent with the HHS Guidelines, Proposal 30 interferes with management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. For the following reasons, we disagree with the Agency's argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span> [38 FLRA 1068 (1990)], section B of Proposal 5 required that management accord employees privacy when providing urine specimens unless, consistent with the union's statement of intent, management had a "'reasonable suspicion...that an employee may attempt to invalidate or falsify the urine specimen.'" 38 FLRA at 1094 (citation omitted). The agency in <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span> argued, as the Agency does here, that the disputed proposal interfered with management's right to determine its internal security practices. In responding to the agency's argument, we noted that it was unnecessary to determine whether the disputed proposal interfered with a management right under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute because:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[i]f the decision to assign an observer to monitor an employee urine sample does not constitute the exercise of management's right under section 7106(a)(1), section B is negotiable because it would not directly interfere with the exercise of a management right....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">On the other hand, if the decision to assign an observer constitutes the exercise of management's right under section 7106(a)(1), the limitation imposed on the exercise of that right by the incorporation of the Executive Order standard in section B would...directly interfere with that right. However, section B would nevertheless be negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.... [T]he benefit to employees of the protection afforded their privacy by the application of the Executive Order standard outweighs any burden on management's right to act, under section 7106(a)(1), without regard to the requirements of the Executive Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1098-99.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Using the framework set out in <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>, we find it unnecessary here to determine whether Proposal 30 directly interferes with the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1). Applying the framework set forth in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA 24, 31-33, we conclude that even if Proposal 30 directly interferes with the exercise of that right, it is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, 41 FLRA at 737-39.</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable in <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 3097 and DOJ, Justice Mgmt. Div.</span>, 42 FLRA 412, 478, 480-82 (1991), was Proposal 31: "Employees who are sent for drug testing will <span id="page_813"></span>not be subject to any kind of search or frisk procedures and they will not be required to disrobe with the exception of outer garments prior to providing urine samples":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 31 concerns the measures the Agency may take to insure the integrity of the specimen provided by an employee being tested for drugs.&#x2003;The proposal prevents the Agency from requiring, as part of its effort to assure the integrity of the specimen provided, that an employee submit to a search, frisking, or, except for outer garments, disrobing. For the following reasons, we find that the proposal is negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Legal and Regulatory Framework</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 4(c) of the Executive Order states that "[p]rocedures for providing urine specimens must allow individual privacy, unless the agency has reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided." The Executive Order neither provides any examples of situations where there is such a "reason to believe" nor does it specify what measures may be taken to avert the alteration or substitution....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FPM Letter provides more specific guidance to agencies.&#x2003;Specifically, section 4.g provides, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">g.&#x2003;Privacy in Drug Testing. Agency drug testing procedures under E.O. 12564 must allow individual privacy unless the agency has reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided. Agencies should refer to the HHS Mandatory Scientific and Technical Guidelines for Federal Employee Drug Testing Programs for the specific procedures to be followed in conducting drug tests.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Generally, an employee or applicant may be required to provide a sample under observation only if there is reason to believe that the employee or applicant may alter or substitute the urine specimen. For example, employers may wish to require observation when facts and circumstances suggest that the person to be tested: (a) is an illegal drug user; (b) is under the influence of drugs at the time of the test; (c) has previously been confirmed by the agency to be an illegal drug user; (d) is seen to have equipment or implements used to tamper with urine samples; (e) has recently been determined to have tampered with a sample.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2.2(f) of the HHS Guidelines states that "[t]he following minimum precautions shall be taken to ensure that unadulterated specimens are obtained...." Among the "minimum precautions" is a request by the collection site person that the individual to be tested "remove any unnecessary outer garments such as a coat or jacket that might conceal items or substances that could be used to tamper with or adulterate the individual's urine specimen." Section 2.2(f)(4). In addition, the Guidelines require that, except for an individual's wallet, personal belongings, including a purse or brief case, remain with the outer garments. When the sample provided is outside a specified temperature range, section 2.2(f)(13) requires another specimen to be collected under direct observation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither the Executive Order, the FPM Letter, nor the HHS Guidelines requires personal searches of any kind to ensure the integrity of samples provided. Accordingly, we find that Proposal 31 is consistent with the Executive Order, the FPM Letter, and the HHS Guidelines.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, we reject the Agency's argument that Proposal 31 is nonnegotiable because it conflicts with the Agency-wide drug testing plan, for which a compelling need exists. The Agency relies, in this connection, on the same portion of the plan, concerning direct observation of the provision of urine samples, discussed in connection with Proposal 30.... That section does not address, in any way, searching or frisking employees. Accordingly, the Agency has not demonstrated that Proposal 31 conflicts with the Agency's plan.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Internal Security Practices</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons discussed extensively in connection with Proposal 30, as well as those set forth in <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, 41 FLRA at 737-39, we find it unnecessary here to determine whether Proposal 31 directly interferes with the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>, 38 FLRA at 1094. Applying the principles set forth in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33, we conclude that even if Proposal 31 directly interferes with the exercise of that right, it is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More specifically, under the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> principles, Proposal 31 is an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the Agency's exercise of its right to test employees for drugs. It benefits employees by preventing the intrusion on their privacy incident to frisking and disrobing. As discussed above, we find that this benefit to employees outweighs the burden imposed on the Agency's exercise of its right to test for drugs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note again, in this regard, that the Executive Order, the FPM Letter, and the HHS Guidelines provide for direct observation of the provision of a urine sample when management has reason to believe that the sample may be altered or substituted. The proposal does not prevent the Agency from directly observing an employee to ensure the sample's integrity. In this connection, the Union states that "[t]he Agency's concern with the possibility of tampering with the sample is addressed by its ability to collect a specimen under direct observation."... The proposal's interference with management's right, therefore, is not significant when weighed against the proposal's protection of employees' privacy interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Indeed, the Agency itself suggests that searches are not essential to assuring that tampering or substitution will not occur. In describing the circumstances where it would conduct a search, based on a belief that an employee possessed implements or equipment for altering the sample, the Agency states that "[t]his situation would then be brought to the attention of agency personnel who would be authorized to conduct a 'pat-down' search, or if the employee refused to permit such a search, to directly observe provision of the specimen." If an individual employee, under the Agency's procedures, can prevent a personal search simply by declining to submit to it, then we must conclude that the Agency does not view searches as central to the protection of the integrity of its drug testing program. Accordingly, we find that the proposal does not excessively interfere with management's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
