<p class="Body-Text">The Board's evaluation of the severity of drug-related offenses is circumstantial, mixed. First offenses involving drugs may lead to removal.<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 245, 254 (1994) (crane operator removed for a first offense of drug involvement (ascertained through drug testing) because of the agency's concern "about the ability of its crane operators to safely handle explosive substances"); <span class="Italic">DeLaughter v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPR 380, 384-85 (1992) (removal of a mail handler who used marijuana on agency property; the appellant had a series of disciplinary actions within two years prior to removal, coupled with an additional current offense of being absent from a work area without authorization, and only four years of service with the agency); <span class="Italic">Zimmerman v. DHHS</span>, 19 MSPR 454, 456-57 &#x0026; n.2 (1984) (removal for using agency facilities to support the distribution of controlled substances; no distinction was drawn between gratuitous distribution and distribution for profit since both activities were prohibited by agency regulations and criminal statutes; the penalty was not mitigated because the appellant "learned a lesson from this experience"). The Board affirms removal for first time drug offenses, despite the presence of mitigating factors, if the employees are subject to random drug testing and hold sensitive positions. <span class="Italic">Zazueta v. DOJ</span>, 94 MSPR 493, 498-99 &#x00B6; 8 (2003) (Border Patrol agent with drug enforcement responsibility), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Zazueta v. DOJ</span>, 104 Fed. Appx. 166 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP). Of significance may be the appellant's position, <span class="Italic">Henry v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, AT-0752-16-0632-I-1 (NP 3/31/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board consistently has held that removal is a reasonable penalty for drug use when the employee performs work that, if the employee were impaired, could result in substantial danger to life and property, notwithstanding other mitigating factors. <span class="Italic">E.g., Holton,</span> 884 F.3d at 1142, 1143-44; <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 557, 563-64, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 168 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 79, 83 (finding that removal for a first offense was appropriate for a journeyman aircraft mechanic, considering that a mistake could result in the loss of both an aircraft and its crew), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 66 F.3d 346 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not all drug involvement warrants removal. Unintentional smoking of a marijuana-laced cigar by a correctional officer while off duty and reported by the officer to his management, in a situation caused by an estranged spouse, and that caused no impairment of his ability to work, warranted complete reversal of a removal in <span class="Italic">McNeil v. DOJ</span>, 117 MSPR 533, 540-41 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16, 14, 2012 MSPB 38 (2011) ("we find that he has excellent potential for rehabilitation assuming that any such 'rehabilitation' in the traditional sense is even necessary"; "We recognize that this case appears to involve a novel legal question regarding whether the agency met its burden of proving nexus. Nevertheless, under the particular circumstances of this appeal, we need not resolve the question of whether the agency proved a nexus between the grounds for its action and the efficiency of the service. Even assuming that such a nexus exists, we find that the penalty of removal is unreasonable and that the maximum reasonable penalty is no penalty at all."). Similarly, adverse action was set aside that resulted from a positive drug screen when the employee ate some baked delicacies at a party without knowing they were laced with marijuana in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> DE-0752-14-0091-I-2 (NP 4/2/2015) (separate opinion by Member Robbins), a decision that rested in part on analysis of the credibility of the employee, who first offered that the drug screen showed positive because of exposure to second-hand inhalation of marijuana smoke at the party and who later offered that the test results likely reflected what he ate rather than what he inhaled:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrasting the circumstances here to those in <span class="Italic">McNeil v. Department of Justice</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14 (2012), the agency argues that the administrative judge improperly inferred an element of scienter for the word "use" in the charge. We find, however, that the appeal was correctly decided. In <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>, the appellant had inadvertently smoked a marijuana-laced cigar that his estranged and mentally-unstable wife left in his truck. <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 10. Although the appellant had provided a urine sample that tested positive for marijuana metabolites as charged, <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, &#x00B6; 2, he credibly testified that he had unwittingly ingested marijuana when he smoked the cigar, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, &#x00B6; 10. The administrative judge thus found that the maximum reasonable penalty was no penalty at all and reversed the removal, which the Board upheld. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 14. Here, the charge pertained not to the appellant's positive urine sample but instead to his alleged use of marijuana. <span class="Italic">McNeil</span> is not directly on point but illustrates how one might ingest marijuana without "using" it and thus reasonably influenced the administrative judge's analysis. Further, the administrative judge explained that, even if he had not construed the charge to require proof of intent, he would have reversed the action "because the maximum reasonable penalty for unknowing or unintentional ingestion is no penalty at all."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of Transportation</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 639, 642 (1990), the agency argues that even in cases of passive ingestion, intent need not be proven. In doing so, however, the agency minimizes the facts that are controlling in <span class="Italic">Scott</span>. The appellant there had failed to comply with a series of rehabilitation agreements for alcohol abuse. <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. at 640. The agency proposed his removal but held the action in abeyance pending his acceptance and successful completion of another rehabilitation agreement requiring him to abstain from ingesting alcohol or "any other substance of abuse." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 640-41. We note that these factors are not present here. Less than 3 months after accepting the agreement, the appellant tested positive for cannabinoids and was removed for violating its terms. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 641. On appeal, he claimed that he ingested marijuana passively while attending a party where other guests were smoking the substance. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The administrative judge found that the rehabilitation agreement did not distinguish between passive and active ingestion and that the agency was not required to prove that the appellant's ingestion was active. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> On review, however, the Board cited the testimony of the agency's Assistant Regional Flight Surgeon that the appellant's THCA levels, which were 12.4 to 13.7 times the minimal level for a positive drug test, resulted not from passive ingestion but instead from "illegal drug use." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 642-43. <span class="Italic">Scott</span> thus does not support the proposition that the agency seeks to advance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another case that the agency cites, <span class="Italic">Cole v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 120 M.S.P.R. 640 (2014), is inapposite because the appellant in that case admitted that he had knowingly used marijuana.[4] <span class="Italic">See also Cole</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4. In contrast, the administrative judge here found that the appellant credibly testified that his use of marijuana was inadvertent and unintentional. In so finding, he relied in significant part on demeanor evidence from the hearing. The Board gives deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing; the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Sufficiently sound reasons for the Board to overturn demeanor-based credibility determinations include findings that are incomplete, inconsistent with the weight of the evidence, and do not reflect the record as a whole. <span class="Italic">See Faucher v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 203, &#x00B6; 8 (2004). The administrative judge considered additional factors beyond his observations of witness demeanor. These factors included the internal consistency of the appellant's testimony, the consistency of his testimony with that of other witnesses, and the inherent <span class="Italic">probability</span> of his version of events. <span class="Italic">See Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The agency cites <span class="Italic">Cole's</span> holding that an agency is required to prove only the "essence of the charge" for the proposition that a positive drug test effectively <span class="Italic">requires</span> the Board to find that it proved the appellant used marijuana. <span class="Italic">See Cole</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 8. Without engaging in a detailed analysis of agency regulations and Executive Order No. 12564, Drug Free Work Place, we note that there have always been circumstances under which a positive drug test would not necessarily lead to a removal action. For instance, section 4(b) of the Executive Order anticipates that an employee might show a valid medical explanation for a positive drug test, and section 5(f) allows for the presentation of rebuttal evidence in the face of a positive test result. <span class="Italic">See</span> Drug Free Work Place, 51 Fed. Reg. 32,889, 32,891 (Sept. 15, 1986); <span class="Italic">see also Lazenby v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 514, 518 (1995) (the Executive Order states that an agency must initiate a disciplinary action, though not necessarily a removal action, against an employee who is found to use drugs).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's primary reason for the Board to reject the administrative judge's credibility findings is that the appellant "changed his theory" regarding how marijuana metabolites appeared in his urine after learning that the concentration of THCA was too high to be explained by the inhalation of secondhand smoke. (the parties stipulated that a concentration of 33 nanograms per milliliter of urine "is too high to be consistent with a theory based solely on passive inhalation"). When confronted with the information that his urine sample had tested positive for THCA, the appellant initially stated that he had been in a smoke-filled basement for several minutes, suggesting exposure to secondhand smoke. He later attributed the positive urinalysis to accidental ingestion of marijuana-laced snacks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is plausible, however, that the appellant did not initially realize that the food he consumed at the party might have been the source of THCA in his urine. Confusion in the face of an unexpected positive drug test hardly indicates dishonesty. The preponderance of the evidence <span id="Page_2831"></span>leads us to conclude that the appellant did not know he had ingested marijuana. He testified that he did not feel any physical effects that would have suggested ingestion of marijuana after he ate the party food. His cooperative conduct after he was selected for testing is consistent with that of a person who did not anticipate an unfavorable result. The party hosts acknowledged that they served marijuana-laced snacks at the party; these snacks were not labeled as containing marijuana; and they did not observe the appellant smoking marijuana but did see him eating. Further, the level of THCA in the appellant's urine is consistent with his theory of inadvertent ingestion, <span class="Italic">as the agency stipulated</span>.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The appellant's urine contained 33 nanograms of THCA per milliliter (ng/mL), which is slightly more than twice the Department of Health and Human Services' acceptable level of 15 ng/mL. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services, Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs, 53 Fed. Reg. 11,970, 11,983 (Apr. 11, 1988). The concentration of THCA in the appellant's urine was significantly lower than the concentration in other cases that the agency cited. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McNeil</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 13 (the appellant's urine samples showed marijuana metabolite levels of nearly six times the acceptable limit); <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. at 642 (the appellant's urine samples showed cannabinoid levels of 185.30 and 205 ng/mL).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's attack on the appellant's credibility, based on his failure to realize in the first instance that he may have ingested snacks containing marijuana is insufficient reason for the Board to reassess whether his testimony was credible. <span class="Italic">See Weaver v. Department of the Navy</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 129, 133 (1980) (before the Board will undertake a complete review of the record, the petitioning party must explain why the challenged factual determination is incorrect, and identify the specific evidence in the record which demonstrates the error). Instead, the administrative judge's findings are fully consistent with the weight of the evidence and reflect the record as a whole. <span class="Italic">See Faucher</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 203, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">see also Broughton v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 357, 359 (1987) (finding no reason to disturb the administrative judge's findings where he considered the evidence as a whole, drew appropriate references, and made reasoned conclusions). Accordingly, we affirm the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having discussed our decision in this case, we also wish to make clear what the Board is NOT doing in this nonprecedential final order. For instance, we are not excusing the appellant from the consequences of his having traces of a federally-controlled substance found in his system. We likewise are not holding that scienter is a necessary element in establishing violations of controlled substance prohibitions in the federal workplace, leading to discipline. And we are not loosening any longstanding Board precedent based on the changing legal status of marijuana in some jurisdictions. In this case, we are affirming the administrative judge's initial decision because the agency simply failed to meet its legal burden based on its own regulations and policies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Member Robbins offered a separate opinion in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above in the Final Order, the Chairman and I affirmed the initial decision because the agency did not establish its case under its own regulations and policies. We also explained in paragraph 12 what the Board was not doing. To further support our clarification of the limitations of our Final Order, I would like to point out that, in a recent Washington Post article, it noted that President Reagan signed Executive Order 12,564 on September 15, 1986, which requires the federal workplace and workforce to be drug-free. This Executive Order includes especially strict rules for personnel, such as the appellant in this case, who hold or apply for security clearances. Josh Hicks, <span class="Italic">Pot Became Legal in D.C. Today. Does Anything Change for Federal Workers?</span>, WASH.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Unless and until either the President revokes this Executive Order, or Congress changes it by law, in almost all instances it is still illegal for federal employees to use or consume marijuana. It matters not the legal status of the substance in the jurisdiction in which one is presently located; whether one is at work; whether one is on or off federal property; or whether one is intending to use or consume the drug.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The practical effect of this is to place an added burden on those federal employees who live or work in jurisdictions where the legal status of marijuana has recently changed. It is now incumbent on them to affirmatively inquire when they have reason to believe a situation might present itself where marijuana is present and to avoid those situations at the risk of losing gainful employment with the federal government.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although not a mitigation case, <span class="Italic">Torres v. DOJ</span>, 343 Fed. Appx. 610 (Fed.

The employee, who was engaged in some type of athletic contest, thought his trainer was giving him a noncontrolled substance and fired his trainer when he determined that he was being given a controlled substance. Judge Dyk, in a concurring opinion stated it was "well known" that employees found to be using illegal drugs frequently claim that they did not know that they were doing so, and it could be difficult for the government to prove knowledge.

<p class="Body-Text">Not all employees are removed for possession of marijuana on agency premises. Consider <span class="Italic">Shaffer v. DLA</span>, 30 MSPR 369, 370 (1986). The Board concluded the appellant was not guilty of more serious drug offenses, reduced removal to a 30-day suspension based on one sustained charge of unauthorized possession and transfer of marijuana on agency premises, and awarded the appellant counsel fees because he was innocent of the more important and greater part of the original charges. Removal was reduced to a 120-day suspension for an employee who directed a friend to another employee to facilitate a sale of marijuana. The employee provided the assistance out of friendship. There was no monetary gain. The employee was not involved in other transactions. The workplace was not threatened, there being but two conversations on agency premises concerning the off-premises sale. The employee admitted his conduct, expressed remorse, entered rehabilitation on his own volition, and was free of drug use following his removal. <span class="Italic">Schaffer v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The sustained charge of possession of marijuana on agency premises warrants the imposition of some type of discipline. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Swann v. Tennessee Valley Authority,</span> 18 MSPR 290, 292 (1983). The selection of an appropriate penalty generally is left to the sound discretion of the agency. <span class="Italic">See Bassett v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy,</span> 34 MSPR 66, 69 (1987). The Board's function in this regard is not to displace management's responsibility, but to determine whether management conscientiously considered the relevant factors and properly exercised its judgment within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., citing <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 306 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether the agency's penalty amounts to an abuse of discretion, the Board is required to evaluate the unique circumstances of each case. <span class="Italic">See Theisen v. Veterans Administration,</span> 31 MSPR 277, 279 (1986). A penalty grossly disproportionate to the offense, in light of <span id="Page_2832"></span>the particular circumstances of the case, is an abuse of the agency's discretion. <span class="Italic">See Maston v. Department of the Army</span>, 32 MSPR 168, 171 (1987). If the agency's judgment clearly exceeds the limits of reasonableness, it is proper for the Board to specify how the agency's decision should be corrected to bring the penalty within the parameters of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Douglas,</span> 5 MSPR at 306.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case, the Board finds that removal is too severe a penalty for the appellant's first disciplinary offense. The appellant had over twenty-three years of frequently exemplary service with the agency and had no prior disciplinary record at the time of the instant action.[3] Further, there is no evidence that the appellant's alleged drug problem ever affected his ability to perform his job duties.[4] In this regard, we note that the agency chose to retain the appellant in a duty status as a Rigger after his arrest and that he worked in that capacity without incident for the 10-month period between October 23, 1987, and the effective date of his removal. Moreover, the appellant recognized his "drug problem" and sought help from various counseling services immediately after the October 23 incident. Under these circumstances, it appears that the appellant's potential for rehabilitation is good, and that he would continue to provide valuable services to the agency if permitted to return to duty. We therefore find that a 60-day suspension would be the maximum reasonable penalty that would promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Schaffer v. United States Postal Service</span>, 39 MSPR 153, 157-59 (Board found that the agency's selected penalty of removal for drug-related charges was unreasonably severe in light of the affected employee's strong potential for rehabilitation)...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;As part of his reply to the agency's notice of proposed removal, the appellant submitted thirty-nine letters from co-workers and former supervisors attesting to his honesty, good character, and excellent work performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The appellant's long-term former supervisor testified that the appellant's addiction never affected his work performance or detracted from his supervisor's confidence in the appellant's demonstrated ability to perform difficult and dangerous tasks.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal was diminished to a 90-day suspension of an employee whose vehicle (and person) contained marijuana during a routine search at a shipyard gate. The employee had 12 years of satisfactory performance; there was no evidence that the misconduct affected his work performance (agency allowed the employee to continue working after the search); the employee was attempting rehabilitation and had good potential for rehabilitation. <span class="Italic">Bolling v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 668, 673 (1990). Removal was unreasonable for an air traffic controller who used marijuana for one-and-a-half to three years prior to removal. The employee rehabilitated himself, a mitigating factor the agency should have considered. The penalty was mitigated, but a 60-day suspension imposed because the prior conduct was improper, immature, and violated agency policy. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 27 MSPR 654, 657 (1985). <span class="Italic">Bolling</span> and <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> were distinguished in <span class="Italic">Ingram v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e hold that where the Board sustains the charge of involvement with an illegal controlled substance on duty, as it has in this case, stress or personal problems experienced by the appellant generally should not be considered as a mitigating or "relevant" factor in determining the reasonableness of an agency's penalty selection, absent a reasoned explanation of the relationship between the appellant's personal circumstances and the charged misconduct, and without further addressing the question of whether the appellant expressed remorse for the conduct and/or otherwise demonstrated a potential for rehabilitation.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant specifically denied any mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense such as unusual job tensions, personality problems, or mental impairment, the administrative judge considered the appellant's age when the events at issue occurred (19-21 years old) and that the cultural and social mores regarding drug use for people of that age group constituted evidence of tension and pressure to engage in drug use. Again, the administrative judge cites no support for this as a mitigating factor, and we are unaware of any. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06.</p>

Specifically, he successfully completed a drug treatment program, provided two negative drug test results, and expressed his willingness to be voluntarily placed into a drug-testing program. While commendable, the appellant did not undertake these efforts, or any efforts, until after the agency's action.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's use of illegal drugs was a serious offense that could justify a penalty of removal under the Executive Order, the Executive Order does not necessarily mandate a removal for such an offense because it merely requires the "initia[tion]" of removal procedures. Indeed, section 5(g) of the Executive Order states that "[a]ny action to discipline an employee who is using illegal drugs (including removal from the service, if appropriate) shall be taken in compliance with otherwise applicable procedures, including the Civil Service Reform Act." Thus, after a removal is proposed based on the Executive Order, the agency deciding official must weigh the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and determine whether removal is ultimately warranted under the particular circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Burrell</span>, 58 MSPR at 375-76; <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 50 MSPR at 72-73; <span class="Italic">Douglas v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, all of the agency's charges are sustained, the Board will review an agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 306. In making such a determination, the Board must give due weight to the agency's primary discretion in maintaining employee discipline and efficiency, recognizing that the Board's function is not to displace management's responsibility but to ensure that managerial judgment has been properly exercised. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 302.

Moreover, the discharge summary regarding her inpatient drug treatment indicates that she is "a high relapse risk." Although Mr. Ford testified that he would "not necessarily consider the appellant a rehabilitative 'failure,'" he further testified that, based on her history of relapses, she was an "extremely poor risk insofar as recovery [from cocaine addiction was]...concerned." We therefore find that, overall, the appellant has little rehabilitative potential.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency deciding official determined that the use of illegal drugs was incompatible with the appellant's job duties, and indeed it is undisputed that her job duties included treating sensitive parts of aircraft, erecting scaffolding, and operating dangerous water jetting and media blast equipment. Her use of illegal drugs in these circumstances could potentially endanger herself or others and is clearly inconsistent with the agency's duty to maintain a safe environment for its employees in the performance of their duties. The deciding official further considered that she had been clearly on notice that her continued use of illegal drugs could result in her removal. In this regard, we note that the firm choice letter, quoted above, specified that her removal would be proposed for a positive drug test during the one year period beginning with her receipt of that letter. Based on these factors, the deciding official concluded that, despite the appellant's 17 years of service at the agency, the penalty of removal was appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, given the extremely serious nature of her misconduct <span id="Page_2833"></span>involving the appellant's repeated use of cocaine, her prior rehabilitation failures, and the agency's well-founded concerns for the safety of its work force, its selection of the penalty of removal was not beyond the bounds of reasonableness under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Burrell</span>, 58 MSPR at 374-76 (removal upheld for the appellant's use of illegal drugs during the rehabilitation period); <span class="Italic">see also Brown</span>, 65 MSPR 253; <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 50 MSPR at 72; <span class="Italic">Shelledy v. Department of Transportation</span>, 49 MSPR 257, 259, 263-64 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 956 F.2d 1173 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). Accordingly, we sustain the removal action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mitigation may be discounted for an employee whose job is of a sensitive nature involving responsibilities for safety, the situation of an aircraft engine repairer, <span class="Italic">Cole v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 120 MSPR 640, 647-48 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17, 2014 MSPB 16 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board consistently has held that removal is a reasonable penalty for drug use when the employee performs work that, if the employee were impaired, could result in substantial danger to life and property, notwithstanding other mitigating factors. <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 557, 563-64, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 168 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table). Thus, in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 79, 83, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 66 F.3d 346 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table), the Board found that removal for a first offense was appropriate for a journeyman aircraft mechanic, considering that a mistake could result in the loss of both an aircraft and its crew.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, we find that the nature of the appellant's work in this appeal renders the sustained misconduct serious, as work performed on an aircraft engine while under the influence of drugs could result in an accident with the potential loss of life and property. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 82-83; <span class="Italic">see also Davis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 572, 575-76 (1990) (sustaining removal of naval shipyard machinist, whose work involved the overhaul of nuclear submarines, for possession and sale of marijuana). The serious risk to the safety of those dependent upon the proper maintenance of an aircraft obviates the mitigating factors. <span class="Italic">See Thomas</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 83; <span class="Italic">Schulmeister v. Department of the Navy</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 13, 15-16 (1990) (sustaining the removal for possession of cocaine and methamphetamine of an employee whose duties involved inspecting, modifying, and repairing the specialized tooling used in nuclear refueling of nuclear warships), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 928 F.2d 411 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that Executive Order No. 12,564 requires initiation of disciplinary action, including removal if appropriate, where an employee has been identified as a user of illegal drugs, provided that he has not voluntarily identified himself or volunteered for testing, prior to being identified by other means. 51 Fed. Reg. 32,889, &#x00A7; 5(b)(1) and &#x00A7; 5(g) (Sept. 15, 1986). The Order does not limit an agency's authority to remove an employee based on a first offense. The agency's Civilian Drug Demand Reduction Program, as well as its notice to the appellant of August 10, 2011, regarding its testing policy for his position, are consistent with Executive Order No. 12,564.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Post-misconduct rehabilitation, after the agency once offered rehabilitative assistance, was not viewed as mitigating, <span class="Italic">Averill v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 30 MSPR 327, 333-34 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is clear that the agency was not obligated to again offer appellant rehabilitation assistance when previous attempts had failed, the issue arises as to whether under its <span class="Italic">Ruzek</span> obligation, an agency must consider appellant's post-misconduct rehabilitation and offer an appellant an opportunity to demonstrate success before effecting an adverse action. We hold that under the facts and charges in this case it does not. The Board has ruled that where an appellant does not avail himself of agency-offered rehabilitative assistance, an agency's obligation to accommodate ceases. <span class="Italic">See McClarty v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 15 MSPR 199 (1984), (Board found that fact of employee's alcoholism did not preclude his removal for continued absences where agency had referred employee to alcoholic recovery program, but appellant failed to take advantage of it); <span class="Italic">Hairston v. Department of Treasury,</span> 16 MSPR 440 (1983) (Board found agency did not discriminate against an employee in dismissing him for reporting to work under the influence of alcohol where agency had previously offered employee counseling and an opportunity to participate in an alcohol rehabilitation program). Thus, an agency's obligation to provide an additional opportunity to demonstrate success is triggered only when the assistance offered was accepted. Since no action was taken against appellant when he advised the agency of his drug problem, he had both the opportunity to rehabilitate himself and the opportunity to demonstrate success. Appellant did neither as evidenced by the misconduct charges which occurred six months later.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Saiz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 122 MSPR 521, 528 &#x00B6; 14, 2015 MSPB 40 (2015) ("The appellant also has submitted evidence showing that he successfully completed inpatient and outpatient drug treatment, as well as treatment for alcoholism. Although these efforts on the appellant's part are commendable and could be viewed as evidence of his potential for rehabilitation, it remains true that he did not undertake such efforts, or any efforts, until after the incidents in question, which resulted in his arrest and conviction for a drug-related offense. Nor has he argued that he was under unusual job tensions, or suffered any personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, bad faith, malice, or provocation on the part of others that might have affected his behavior.").
