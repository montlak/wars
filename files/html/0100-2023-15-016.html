<h3 class="h3" id="sec7-16"><span class="space">A.</span> MAINTENANCE OF <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">STATUS QUO</span></span></h3>
<p class="noindent"><a href="0100-2023-16-001.html#sec8-1">Chapter 8</a> discusses the necessity for agencies to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> during various phases of negotiations. The salient points of the law are summarized here. [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-16-062.html#sec8-63">Unilateral Changes in Employment Conditions and Past Practice</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 44 FLRA 870, 878 (1992), generally described the obligation of the parties concerning maintenance of existing and prior conditions of employment as they approach and enter impasse:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under existing law, terms and conditions of employment that concern mandatory subjects of bargaining, and that are embodied in a collective bargaining agreement, continue in effect following the expiration of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Adjutant General, State of Ohio, Ohio Air National Guard, Worthington, Ohio</span>, 21 FLRA 1062, 1070 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Ohio Air National Guard</span>). However, upon the expiration of the agreement, either party may elect no longer to be bound by provisions of the agreement concerning permissive subjects of bargaining, but instead may refuse to negotiate with regard to such subjects. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Finally, once the parties have reached an impasse in bargaining, and one party timely invokes the services of the Panel, the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> must be maintained to the maximum extent possible while the impasse is pending before the Panel. <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury</span>, 18 FLRA at 468.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reiterated the effect of FSIP involvement in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Decatur and AFGE Local 2778</span>, 46 FLRA 339, 345-46 (1992), noting as well that the existence of an impasse would be appraised realistically:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once a party timely invokes the services of the Panel, the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> must be maintained to the extent consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency, in order to allow the Panel to take whatever action it deems appropriate. A failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> while a negotiation dispute is pending before the Panel constitutes a violation of section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (6) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of the requirement that the parties maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> "is to facilitate the Panel's consideration of negotiations impasses and allow the Panel to take whatever action it deems appropriate to resolve the dispute." <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 35 FLRA at 950. An agency's obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> while matters are before the Panel is not affected by the nature of the action the Panel eventually takes. In particular, an agency is obligated to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> even if the Panel ultimately declines jurisdiction over the union's request for assistance....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The foregoing cases, among others, confirm that permitting an agency to implement a change in conditions of employment while a union's request for assistance is pending before the Panel would undermine the Panel's role in resolving impasses and is inconsistent with the purposes of the Statute. We find no reason to conclude differently in this case. In this regard, we note that the Union filed its request for assistance after the parties had engaged in bargaining over the institution of paid parking. Indeed, it appears that any failure of the parties to engage in more extensive bargaining can properly be attributed to the Agency's assertion that parking rates were nonnegotiable. Moreover, the Union's request for Panel assistance was filed after notification that the Agency intended to implement paid parking despite the parties' failure to reach agreement. In these circumstances, we reject the Respondent's contention that it was not obligated to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> because, at the time the Union submitted its request for Panel assistance, the parties were not at impasse....</p>
<p class="noindent">The obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> does not necessarily depend on a request for FSIP assistance. The obligation will vary depending upon the stage of the parties' negotiations and any ensuing impasse. The obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> stems from the duty to bargain and remains constant throughout the bargaining process. If management does not maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, it violates 5 USC 7116(a)(5) by failing to bargain in good faith. 5 USC 7116(a)(6) does not establish an independent violation for failing to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> during FSIP proceedings. Section 7116(a)(6) is violated if the agency fails to cooperate with FSIP procedures or if it violates an FSIP order directed it to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo. INS and Nat'l Border Patrol Council, AFGE</span>, 55 FLRA 69, 74 (1999). [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-16-038.html#sec8-39">Impassed Proposals; Incomplete Negotiations; Maintenance of <span class="Italic">Status Quo.</span></a>"]</p>
<p class="noindent">After an impasse in negotiations occurs, an agency must give a union sufficient notice of when a change will be implemented in order to provide the union with a reasonable opportunity timely to invoke the services of the Panel. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 35 FLRA 940, 949 (1990) (FMCS mediator stated the parties were at impasse). A union must, however, protect its right to bargain through reasonable steps, at reasonable times, once impasse is reached. When impasse is reached, assuming adequate notice to the union, the agency may implement proposed changes in working conditions if the matters at issue are not submitted by the union to FSIP. <span class="Italic">DOD, Dept. of Navy, Naval Ordnance Station, Louisville and IAM Lodge 830</span>, 17 FLRA 896, 897-98 (1985). If the union received two weeks notice of some changes in working conditions and mediation was invoked unsuccessfully, the union cannot complain of unilateral implementation of the proposed changes if during the notice period it did not invoke FSIP assistance. <span class="Italic">INS and AFGE Local 1917</span>, 24 FLRA 786, 790 (1986). If the union seeks to obtain assistance from FSIP to resolve an impasse and seeks to bar interim changes in employment conditions pending Panel consideration of the impasse, it must act before the employer implements its last offer, once the employer provides reasonable notice of its intent to implement that last offer. Under the circumstances, a six-day notice was sufficient for the union to seek Panel assistance. When assistance is not timely sought, the union is precluded from successfully prosecuting a ULP against the employer after it implements its last proposal. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 16 FLRA 198, 214 (1984) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R7-23 v. FLRA</span>, 893 F.2d 380, 382 (D.C. Cir. 1990). [Discussed in Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-16-039.html#sec8-40">Existence of Impasse; FMCS, FSIP; Obligations Before and During Impasse</a>."] Two days was not a sufficient opportunity for the union to obtain impasse assistance. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, 832d Combat Support Group, Luke AFB and AFGE Local 1547</span>, 36 FLRA 289, 300 (1990) (ALJ Decision) (citing <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Region V, New Orleans and NTEU</span>, 9 FLRA 116, 132-33 (1982)).</p>
<p class="noindent">For the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> to be maintained as a result of FSIP involvement, the union's request for FSIP assistance must be written with sufficient clarity to place the agency on notice of the nature of the union's request. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 33 FLRA 532, 546 (1988), recounted an insufficient request for assistance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's letter of December 23, 1981, to the Panel did not request Panel assistance to resolve the impasse; it merely provided the Panel with a status report of the situation. Moreover, the letter was not accompanied by specific information, such as a statement of the issues at impasse and related information on the parties' negotiations, required by the Panel's <span id="page_1190"></span>Rules and Regulations, and there is no showing that this evidence was thereafter furnished to the Panel. Further, there is no evidence in the record that the Union attempted any further communication with the Panel. As the Judge stated, there is no explanation as to "why, if the Union was genuinely seeking FSIP and FMCS intervention in this matter, it did not communicate with those agencies after the initial letters of December 23 were sent."...&#8197;Moreover, as the Judge found, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the Panel was aware that its services were being sought. In these circumstances, we agree with the Judge that the Union did not invoke the services of the Panel so as to preclude the Respondent from implementing the change.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another request for assistance, deemed insufficient to require the agency to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, was considered in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 940 and VA, Philadelphia</span>, 52 FLRA 1429, 1434 (1997). The parties entered a Memorandum of Understanding that established a procedure for resolving impasses over impact bargaining arising out of agency changes in its performance appraisal system. The MOU demanded initial resort to FMCS and mediation, followed, if mediation failed, by resort to FSIP. The union requested a mediator from FMCS, and the agency proceeded with its changes when mediation did not commence by a specific date. Sustaining the award of an arbitrator who found no violation of impasse procedures, FLRA declared:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that an agency's failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> to the extent consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency while impasse proceedings are under way constitutes a violation of section 7116(a)(1), (5) and (6). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Decatur, Georgia</span>, 46 FLRA 339, 345-46 (1992). <span class="Italic">But see U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service v. FLRA</span>, 995 F.2d 46, 48 (5th Cir. 1993) (<span class="Italic">Department of Justice</span>) (holding that unilateral implementation during impasse proceedings of a proposal later determined to be nonnegotiable does not violate the Statute). Here, there is no evidence in the record that impasse proceedings were under way following the Union's letter to the FMCS. Accordingly, we deny the exception.[5] <span class="Italic">See Department of Air Force, Scott Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Base, Illinois</span>, 33 FLRA 532, 547 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Scott</span>) (holding that union's letter to FMCS, without more, did not require agency to maintain <span class="Italic">status quo</span>), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R7-23 v. FLRA</span>, 893 F.2d 380 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We note that the facts of the case now before us are distinguishable from those in <span class="Italic">Department of Justice</span> because <span class="Italic">Department of Justice</span> addresses an agency's obligations <span class="Italic">after</span> impasse procedures are under way. Moreover, there is no basis on which to apply the court's holding in <span class="Italic">Department of Justice</span> to the record in this case because there is no evidence or argument as to the outcome of the parties' negotiability dispute. In particular, the proposals at issue do not appear in the record, and a review of Authority case law indicates that they were not the subject of a separate Authority decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA restated the variants concerning maintenance of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> during negotiations in <span class="Italic">Order Denying Request for Gen. Ruling</span>, 31 FLRA 1294, 1295-97 (1988). FLRA declined to provide general guidance, requested by FSIP, regarding when an employer must maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> in personnel policies, practices, and working conditions during negotiations or mediation of a labor agreement. Instead, FLRA summarized its past decisions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Authority decisions concerning whether changes in working conditions properly may be implemented by an agency have turned on many different factors.&#x2003;In...<span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms</span>, 18 FLRA 466...the Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[O]nce parties have reached an impasse in their negotiations and one party timely invokes the services of the Panel, the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> must be maintained to the maximum extent possible, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, to the extent consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency, in order to allow the Panel to take whatever action it deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under this standard, whether or not the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> must be maintained after parties have reached impasse depends on such factors as (1) whether the agency provided the exclusive representative with a reasonable opportunity to seek third-party assistance, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span>, 16 FLRA 198 (1984); (2) whether the exclusive representative timely requests third-party assistance, for example, <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, U.S. Naval Supply Center, San Diego, California</span>, 31 FLRA 1088 (1988); and (3) whether implementation of the change is consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Kansas City Region, Kansas City, Missouri</span>, 23 FLRA 435 (1986). These factors involve evaluations of the facts in each case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether or not the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> must be maintained during bilateral negotiations depends on a case-by-case analysis also. Among the factors which may be addressed in these cases are: (1) whether the change affects conditions of employment as defined in section 7103(a)(14) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska</span>, 23 FLRA 605 (1986); (2) whether the nature and extent of the effect or reasonably foreseeable effect of the change gives rise to a bargaining obligation, <span class="Italic">for example</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration</span>, 24 FLRA 403 (1986); (3) whether the exclusive representative clearly and unmistakably waived its right to negotiate, <span class="Italic">for example</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois</span>, 5 FLRA 9 (1981); (4) whether the agency has provided specific and clear notice to the exclusive representative concerning the nature of the intended change, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Harry Diamond Laboratories, Adelphi, Maryland</span>, 9 FLRA 575 (1982); (5) whether the agency has provided notice which is sufficient to enable the exclusive representative to develop bargaining proposals, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Bureau of Government Financial Operations Headquarters</span>, 11 FLRA 334 (1983); (6) whether the agency is obligated to bargain over the substance of the change or the impact and implementation of the change, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, 31 FLRA 145 (1988); (7) whether the exclusive representative timely requests to bargain, <span class="Italic">for example</span> <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, (District National Office Unit)</span>, 14 FLRA 698 (1984); (8) whether the exclusive representative's proposals are negotiable, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 31 FLRA 651 (1988); and (9) whether the agency was required to implement the change in order to correct an illegal practice, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey Conservation Division, Gulf of Mexico Region, Metairle, Louisiana</span>, 9 FLRA 543 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent">More concretely, in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps and AFGE Local 2317</span>, 42 FLRA 3, 13-14 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint in this case contained a separate allegation that the Respondents violated section 7116(a)(1) and (6) of the Statute by implementing the Marine Corps' "no smoking" policy at a number of Marine Corps installations while the parties at the national level were at impasse before the Federal Service Impasses Panel (the Panel) on a national smoking policy. The Respondents argued that there was no violation of section 7116(a)(1) and (6), because there must be a bargaining obligation before an impasse exists, and as there was no obligation to bargain, there was no obligation on its part to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>. The Panel ultimately declined jurisdiction in the absence of any resolution of the threshold issues related to the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once parties reach an impasse in their negotiations and one party timely invokes the services of the Panel, the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> must be maintained to the maximum extent possible, that is, to the extent consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency, in order to allow the Panel to take whatever action is deemed appropriate....&#8197;Failure to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, to the extent consistent with the necessary functioning of an agency, while a negotiation dispute is pending before the Panel violates section 7116(a)(1), (5) and (6) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found no basis on which to conclude that the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> requirement is, or should be, affected by whatever action the Panel eventually takes regarding the impasse. The purpose of the requirement is to facilitate the Panel's consideration of negotiation impasses and allow the Panel to take whatever action it deems appropriate to resolve disputes. Allowing an agency to implement a change based on its speculation as to what action the Panel will take after implementation would undermine the important role played by the Panel in collective bargaining under the Statute. Therefore, the Authority rejected a respondent's contention that it was not obligated to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> because the Panel declined jurisdiction after implementation....&#8197;The Authority has also rejected a respondent's arguments that its implementation was required by agency deadlines....&#8197;Similarly, while the Authority agreed with an agency that costs are a legitimate factor in deciding what is necessary for the efficient functioning of an agency, the Authority rejected an agency's argument that costs alone required implementation while an impasse was pending before the Panel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">HUD Kansas City</span>, 23 FLRA at 437-38.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Fifth Circuit parted ways with FLRA concerning the obligation to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> during impasse proceedings involving nonnegotiable proposals. FLRA determined that the duty to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> during impasse proceedings exists irrespective of the action ultimately taken by the Panel. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 44 FLRA 1065, 1073 (1992) (Panel declined jurisdiction because of underlying negotiability disputes). FLRA's ruling, however, was set aside during judicial review. As the Fifth Circuit explained in <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS v. FLRA</span>, 995 F.2d 46, 47-48 (5th Cir. 1993), the duty to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> does not exist if the proposals before the Panel are ultimately ruled nonnegotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This dispute has its genesis in revisions by the INS in its policy on the use of firearms by employees.&#x2003;Negotiations between the Agency and the employees' collective bargaining representatives, the National Border Patrol Council and the National Immigration and Naturalization Service Council...concluded with several unresolved disputes. The INS contended that six proposals advanced by the unions were nonnegotiable because they addressed matters reserved to management's discretion. After mediation was deemed likely to be ineffective, the unions asked <span id="page_1191"></span>the Federal Service Impasses Panel to review the matter. Before the Impasses Panel acted, however, the INS implemented its revisions, both those agreed upon and those in dispute. The Impasses Panel thereafter determined that it did not have jurisdiction because negotiability was controverted. At the unions' request, the FLRA reviewed the negotiability of the six proposals and determined that only proposal 5 and portions of Proposals 1 and 2 were negotiable. The INS sought our review of the negotiability of Proposal 5. In a decision rendered on October 20, 1992, we ruled that Proposal 5 was not negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Shortly after seeking FLRA review of the negotiability issue, the unions brought unfair labor practice charges against the INS for implementing the revisions before the Impasses Panel had ruled. On April 30, 1992, prior to our decision on the petition for review of the negotiability order, the FLRA decided that the INS had violated section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (6) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. The INS timely petitioned for review and the FLRA cross-applied for enforcement of its order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue before us is whether an agency commits an unfair labor practice by implementing a change in a condition of employment when a union challenge is pending before the Impasses Panel and it is subsequently determined that the change is a nonnegotiable management prerogative.&#x2003;We conclude that neither the agency's refusal to submit to the jurisdiction of the Impasses Panel nor its unilateral implementation of the change is an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, was enacted in an effort to make the government function more efficiently and effectively. The legislation codifies the right of federal employees to organize and the duty of management to bargain, but tailors these rights and responsibilities "to meet the special requirements and needs of the Government." In section 7101(b) Congress directed that the statute "be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the parties bargain to impasse and mediation does not resolve their differences, the statute authorizes either side to invoke the services of the Federal Service Impasses Panel. The Impasses Panel is empowered to impose specific contract terms on the parties "unless [they] agree otherwise." While a matter is pending before the Impasses Panel, under FLRA rule the parties must maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> to the extent consistent with the necessary functioning of the agency. Failure to do so constitutes an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Certain matters, however, statutorily are exempted from the scope of mandatory bargaining, including, as pertinent herein, an agency's internal security practices and the assignment of work. If management contends that a change falls within an exempted area, the Impasses Panel lacks authority to proceed unless and until the negotiability issues are resolved, subject to a limited exception defined by the FLRA. We agree with the reasoning of the FLRA...that the purposes of the statute are best furthered by allowing the Impasses Panel to resolve those disputes involving negotiability that are controlled by existing FLRA precedents. To that we would add "and existing controlling judicial precedents."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at bar, [by] claiming nonnegotiability the INS implemented its policy revisions before the Impasses Panel declined jurisdiction. Ultimately it was determined that all of the changes, except for portions of two of the union's proposals, were nonnegotiable. The INS concedes that it committed an unfair labor practice with respect to implementation of those measures found negotiable, but otherwise it denies wrongdoing. The FLRA insists that it was an unfair labor practice to implement any of the changes, negotiable or not.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our 1984 decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Dept. of Justice, INS v. FLRA</span>, [727 F.2d 481 (5th Cir. 1984)] persuades [us] that the position taken herein by the FLRA is untenable. In the cited case, the INS implemented changes in employment conditions while a representation election was pending. Determining that the changes involved areas reserved to management's discretion, we held that the INS had not committed an unfair labor practice because the FLRA was not authorized to suspend management rights. We therein stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Congress provided specifically in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106 that "nothing in this chapter shall affect the authority of any management official of any agency" to exercise the rights reserved to management by that section....&#8197;By using the word "nothing"...&#8197;Congress clearly expressed its intent with regard to management's exercise of the rights which had been reserved to it. The use of such words makes it obvious that Congress did not intend to let the Authority decide whether, in its judgment, it was "necessary" for the INS to [make the desired changes] during the pendency of the election....&#8197;Construing the statute to allow the Authority to promulgate a rule which would bar management from exercising its reserved rights during the pendency of a representation question would hardly lead to an INS which was as effective and efficient as possible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly here, the position urged by the FLRA would suspend management rights pending Impasses Panel action. Neither the language nor spirit of the statute would so permit. Whereas unilateral implementation during Impasses Panel proceedings of a change that is determined to be negotiable might be an unfair labor practice, we hold that unilateral implementation of a change determined to be nonnegotiable is not.</p>
