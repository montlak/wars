<p class="Body-Text">The IRA is established at 5 USC 1221 (including the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act amendments):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1221. <span class="Italic">Individual right of action in certain reprisal cases</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section and subsection 1214(a)(3), an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may, with respect to any personnel action taken, or proposed to be taken, against such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), seek corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;This section may not be construed to prohibit any employee, former employee, or applicant for employment from seeking corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board before seeking corrective action from the Special Counsel, if such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has the right to appeal directly to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)(1)&#x2003;Any employee, former employee, or applicant for employment seeking corrective action under subsection (a) may request that the Board order a stay of the personnel action involved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;Any stay requested under paragraph (1) shall be granted within 10 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the date the request is made, if the Board determines that such a stay would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)(A) The Board shall allow any agency which would be subject to a stay under this subsection to comment to the Board on such stay request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; Except as provided in subparagraph (C), a stay granted under this subsection shall remain in effect for such period as the Board determines to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C) The Board may modify or dissolve a stay under this subsection at any time, if the Board determines that such a modification or dissolution is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)(1)&#x2003;At the request of an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment seeking corrective action under subsection (a), the Board shall issue a subpoena for the attendance and testimony of any person or the production of documentary or other evidence from any person if the Board finds that the testimony or production requested is not unduly burdensome and appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;A subpoena under this subsection may be issued, and shall be enforced, in the same manner as applies in the case of subpoenas under section 1204.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), in any case involving an alleged prohibited personnel practice as described under section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), the Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate if the employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has demonstrated that a disclosure or protected activity described under section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) was a contributing factor in the personnel action which was taken or is to be taken against such employee, former employee, or applicant. The employee may demonstrate that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure or protected activity; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2) Corrective action under paragraph (1) may not be ordered if, after a finding that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor, the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)(1)&#x2003;A final order or decision shall be rendered by the Board as soon as practicable after the commencement of any proceeding under this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3758"></span>(2)&#x2003;A decision to terminate an [OSC] investigation under subchapter II may not be considered in any action or other proceeding under this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;If, based on evidence presented to it under this section, the Merit Systems Protection Board determines that there is reason to believe that a current employee may have committed a prohibited personnel practice, the Board shall refer the matter to the Special Counsel to investigate and take appropriate action under section 1215.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Jurisdiction</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Generally</span>. Under 5 U.S.C. 1221(a), an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may appeal to the Board from agency personnel actions alleged to have been threatened, proposed, taken, or not taken because of the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appeals authorized</span>. The Board exercises jurisdiction over:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Individual right of action (IRA) appeals</span>. These are authorized by 5 U.S.C. 1221(a) with respect to personnel actions listed in 1209.4(a) of this part that are allegedly threatened, proposed, taken, or not taken because of the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity. If the action is not otherwise directly appealable to the Board, the appellant must seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before appealing to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 1</span>: An agency gives Employee X a performance evaluation under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 that rates him as "minimally satisfactory." Employee X believes that the agency has rated him "minimally satisfactory" because he reported that his supervisor embezzled public funds in violation of Federal law and regulation. Because a performance evaluation is not an otherwise appealable action, Employee X must seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before appealing to the Board or before seeking a stay of the evaluation. If Employee X appeals the evaluation to the Board after the Special Counsel proceeding is terminated or exhausted, his appeal is an IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 2</span>: As above, an agency gives Employee X a performance evaluation under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 that rates him as "minimally satisfactory." Employee X believes that the agency has rated him "minimally satisfactory" because he previously filed a Board appeal of the agency's action suspending him without pay for 15 days. Whether the Board would have jurisdiction to review Employee X's performance rating as an IRA appeal depends on whether his previous Board appeal involved a claim of retaliation for whistleblowing. If it did, the Board could review the performance evaluation in an IRA appeal because the employee has alleged a violation of 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(9)(A)(i). If the previous appeal did not involve a claim of retaliation for whistleblowing, there might be a prohibited personnel practice under subsection (b)(9)(A)(ii), but Employee X could not establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal. Similarly, if Employee X believed that the current performance appraisal was retaliation for his previous protected equal employment opportunity (EEO) activity, there might be a prohibited personnel practice under subsection (b)(9)(A)(ii), but Employee X could not establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 3</span>: As above, an agency gives Employee X a performance evaluation under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 that rates him as "minimally satisfactory." Employee X believes that the agency has rated him "minimally satisfactory" because he testified on behalf of a co-worker in an EEO proceeding. The Board would have jurisdiction over the performance evaluation in an IRA appeal because the appellant has alleged a violation of 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(9)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 4</span>: Citing alleged misconduct, an agency proposes Employee Y's removal. While that removal action is pending, Employee Y files a complaint with OSC alleging that the proposed removal was initiated in retaliation for her having disclosed that an agency official embezzled public funds in violation of Federal law and regulation. OSC subsequently issues a letter notifying Employee Y that it has terminated its investigation of the alleged retaliation with respect to the proposed removal. Employee Y may file an IRA appeal with respect to the proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Otherwise appealable action appeals</span>. These are appeals to the Board under laws, rules, or regulations other than 5 U.S.C. 1221(a) that include an allegation that the action was based on the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity. Otherwise appealable actions are listed in 5 CFR 1201.3(a). An individual who has been subjected to an otherwise appealable action must make an election of remedies as described in 5 U.S.C. 7121(g) and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 5</span>: Same as Example 4 above. While the OSC complaint with respect to the proposed removal is pending, the agency effects the removal action. OSC subsequently issues a letter notifying Employee Y that it has terminated its investigation of the alleged retaliation with respect to the proposed removal. With respect to the effected removal, Employee Y can elect to appeal that action directly to the Board or to proceed with a complaint to OSC. If she chooses the latter option, she may file an IRA appeal when OSC has terminated its investigation, but the only issue that will be <span id="Page_3759"></span>adjudicated in that appeal is whether she proves that her protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the removal action and, if so, whether the agency can prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed Employee Y in the absence of the protected disclosure. If she instead files a direct appeal, the agency must prove its misconduct charges, nexus, and the reasonableness of the penalty, and Employee Y can raise any affirmative defenses she might have.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Issues before the Board in IRA appeals</span>. In an individual right of action appeal, the only merits issues before the Board are those listed in 5 U.S.C. 1221(e), i.e., whether the appellant has demonstrated that whistleblowing or other protected activity was a contributing factor in one or more covered personnel actions and, if so, whether the agency has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action(s) in the absence of the whistleblowing or other protected activity. The appellant may not raise affirmative defenses, such as claims of discrimination or harmful procedural error. In an IRA appeal that concerns an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. 7512, the agency need not prove its charges, nexus, or the reasonableness of the penalty, as a requirement under 5 U.S.C. 7513(a), i.e., that its action is taken "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." However, the Board may consider the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its adverse action in determining whether the agency has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the whistleblowing or other protected activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Elections under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g)(3), an employee who believes he or she was subjected to a covered personnel action in retaliation for whistleblowing or other protected activity "may elect not more than one" of 3 remedies: An appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. 7701; a negotiated grievance under 5 U.S.C. 7121(d); or corrective action under subchapters II and III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, i.e., a complaint filed with the Special Counsel (5 U.S.C. 1214), which can be followed by an IRA appeal filed with the Board (5 U.S.C. 1221). Under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g)(4), an election is deemed to have been made based on which of the 3 actions the individual files first.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;In the case of an otherwise appealable action as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an employee who files a complaint with OSC prior to filing an appeal with the Board has elected corrective action under subchapters II and III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, i.e., a complaint filed with OSC, which can be followed by an IRA appeal with the Board. As described in paragraph (c) of this section, the IRA appeal in such a case is limited to resolving the claim(s) of reprisal for whistleblowing or other protected activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Elements and Order of Proof</span>. Once jurisdiction has been established, the merits of a claim of retaliation for whistleblowing or other protected activity will be adjudicated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The appellant must establish by preponderant evidence that he or she engaged in whistleblowing or other protected activity and that his or her whistleblowing or other protected activity was a contributing factor in a covered personnel action. An appellant may establish the contributing factor element through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure or protected activity, and that the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If a finding has been made that a protected disclosure or other protected activity was a contributing factor in one or more covered personnel actions, the Board will order corrective action unless the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure or activity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board explained what it considered a statutory anomaly in the rulemaking notice accompanying the 2013 regulatory changes, 78 Fed. Reg. 39543, 39544 (July 2, 2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have modified and added to the Examples provided in section 1209.2 to illustrate the additional categories of protected activity. Example 2 reflects that, because IRA appeals now include claims of retaliation for exercising the rights protected by 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), but not subsection (A)(ii), whether a claim of retaliation for exercising an appeal, complaint, or grievance right will be cognizable as an IRA appeal depends on whether the prior appeal, complaint, or grievance included a claim of retaliation for whistleblowing. In what might be viewed an anomaly in the scope of protected activity, Example 2 notes that, while a claim that one suffered reprisal for his or her own protected equal employment opportunity (EEO) activity may not be the subject of an IRA appeal, a claim that one suffered reprisal for testifying for or lawfully assisting another employee's protected EEO activity can be the subject of an IRA appeal. This is true because the latter activity is protected by subsection (b)(9)(B), which can form the basis of an IRA appeal, while the former is protected by subsection (b)(9)(A)(ii), which cannot form the basis of an IRA appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3760"></span>&#x00A7; 1209.5 <span class="Italic">Time of filing</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a) <span class="Italic">General rule</span>. The appellant must seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before appealing to the Board unless the action being appealed is otherwise appealable directly to the Board and the appellant has elected a direct appeal. (See &#x00A7; 1209.2(d) regarding election of remedies under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g)). Where the appellant has sought corrective action, the time limit for filing an appeal with the Board is governed by 5 U.S.C. 1214(a)(3). Under that section, an appeal must be filed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;No later than 65 days after the date of issuance of the Special Counsel's written notification to the appellant that it was terminating its investigation of the appellant's allegations or, if the appellant shows that the Special Counsel's notification was received more than 5 days after the date of issuance, within 60 days after the date the appellant received the Special Counsel's notification; or,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;At any time after the expiration of 120 days, if the Special Counsel has not notified the appellant that it will seek corrective action on the appellant's behalf within 120 days of the date of filing of the request for corrective action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Equitable tolling; extension of filing deadline</span>. The appellant's deadline for filing an individual right of action appeal with the Board after receiving written notification from the Special Counsel that it is terminating its investigation of his or her allegations is subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling, which permits the Board to extend the deadline where the appellant, despite having diligently pursued his or her rights, was unable to make a timely filing. Examples include cases involving deception or in which the appellant filed a defective pleading during the statutory period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appeals after a stay request</span>. Where an appellant has filed a request for a stay with the Board without first filing an appeal of the action, the appeal must be filed within 30 days after the date the appellant receives the order ruling on the stay request. Failure to timely file the appeal will result in the termination of any stay that has been granted unless a good reason for the delay is shown.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;The personnel action was or will be based wholly or in part on the whistleblowing disclosure or other protected activity, as described in &#x00A7; 1209.4(b) of this part.</p>

"Otherwise appealable action" appeals are those within the Board's regular appellate jurisdiction, as described in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3, in which the appellant raises an affirmative defense of retaliation for whistleblowing under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and now most of (b)(9) as well. No whistleblower or other affirmative defense, however, may be raised in an appeal under VEOA or USERRA. It is not necessary for an appellant in an OAA to first request corrective action from OSC. However, when an appellant does first raise an OAA to the OSC before appealing to the Board, the Board will find that if the choice was knowingly made, the appellant has elected his remedy. <span class="Italic">See Agoranos v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498 (2013). This constitutes a statutorily-required change from prior law, <span class="Italic">Massimino v.

IRA appeals are an extension of the Board's jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a). If the personnel action in question is not within the Board's regular appellate jurisdiction, the appellant must first seek corrective action from OSC before appealing to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3); <span class="Italic">Knollenberg</span> <span class="Italic">v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ELECTION OF REMEDIES</span>. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g)(2), a person covered by a collective bargaining agreement who claims to have been the victim of reprisal for whistleblowing may elect only one of three remedies--a Board appeal of an OAA, a grievance, or a complaint to OSC. <span class="Italic">See Thurman v. Department of Defense</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 598 (1998). If the action is not otherwise directly appealable to the Board, the appellant must seek corrective action from OSC before appealing to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(b)(1). Filing a complaint with OSC first will allow the appellant to later file an IRA appeal with the Board under the time limits set forth below. Filing a grievance or appeal first will foreclose any other avenue. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sabersky v. Department of Justice</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 210, 213, &#x00B6; 8 (2002) (an appellant who previously appealed a removal action to the Board without raising an affirmative defense of whistleblower retaliation and received a valid final judgment on the merits may not later file an IRA appeal claiming that the removal was the result of such retaliation). In an IRA appeal, the only merits issues before the Board are those listed in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e), i.e., whether the appellant has demonstrated that one or more whistleblowing disclosures was a contributing factor in one or more covered personnel actions and, if so, whether the agency has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken <span id="Page_3761"></span>the same personnel action(s) in the absence of the protected disclosures. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(c). In an IRA appeal, the appellant is precluded from raising any other affirmative defenses, such as claims of discrimination or harmful procedural error.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> When taking an OAA, the agency is required to advise employees of their options under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) and the consequences of their election, including the fact that seeking corrective action from OSC before filing with the Board will result in forgoing important rights to raise other affirmative defenses. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3). The time limits for filing an OAA appeal with the Board are set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). However, if the appellant chooses to first seek corrective action from OSC, the time limits are those set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5. The time limits for filing an IRA appeal depend on the action taken by OSC. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a), discussed below. The right to file an IRA appeal is not conditioned on an appellant's exhaustion of his or her EEO administrative remedies after filing a formal EEO complaint on the underlying personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Horton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 475 (1991). Thus, filing an IRA appeal before receiving a final agency decision on an EEO complaint does not render the IRA appeal premature. The EEO issue may not be heard in the IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Termination of OSC Investigation</span>. The IRA appeal must be filed no later than 65 days after the date of issuance of the written notification by OSC to the appellant that its investigation has been terminated. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a)(1). If the appellant shows the OSC letter terminating its investigation into the allegations was received by the appellant more than 5 days after the date of issuance, the appeal must be filed within 60 days after the date the appellant received the OSC letter. In addition, the filing deadline for IRA appeals is extended to the following business day for deadlines that fall on the weekend or Federal holidays. <span class="Italic">See Pry v. Department of the Navy</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 440 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Equitable tolling</span>. The Board cannot waive the statutory time limit for filing an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Wood v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 587 (1992). However, the deadline for filing an IRA appeal with the Board may be subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling, depending on the circumstances. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(b). <span class="Italic">See Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89, 96, (1990) (Federal courts have typically extended equitable relief sparingly, including those situations where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period, or where the complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass; it does not extend to a claim of excusable neglect). Thus far, at least, the Board has cited only the <span class="Italic">Irwin</span> factors as possible bases for equitable tolling. <span class="Italic">See also Pacilli v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 526, &#x00B6; 11 (2010).

<p class="Block-Quote1">6.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ESTABLISHING JURISDICTION AND BURDENS AT HEARING</span>. An employee must occupy a covered position in a covered agency to bring a claim under the WPA, as amended. For example, the U.S. Postal Service is not a covered agency. <span class="Italic">See Booker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 982 F.2d 517 (Fed.

FBI Employees cannot file an IRA appeal because their agency has specific procedures established for the internal adjudication of whistleblower retaliation claims. <span class="Italic">Van Lancker v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 514, &#x00B6; 9 (2013). In that decision, the Board also held that an FBI employee also may not raise an affirmative defense of whistleblower retaliation. Although the Federal Circuit originally ruled, to the contrary, that FBI employees may raise an affirmative defense of reprisal for whistleblowing on appeal of an OAA, <span class="Italic">Parkinson v. Department of Justice</span>, <span class="blue">815 F.3d 757</span> (Fed.

There the court held that the Board may not hear a whistleblower reprisal claim filed by an FBI preference eligible because the FBI was specifically exempt from protections set forth in the prohibited personnel practices statute and there is a separate review process for claims for whistleblower reprisal for both preference-eligible and non-preference-eligible FBI employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">7.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ANALYSIS</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board follows the Federal Circuit's analysis for establishing Board jurisdiction over an IRA appeal to establish the right to a requested hearing on a whistleblower claim. <span class="Italic">See Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Mudd v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 4 (2013). The Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal if the appellant has exhausted the administrative remedies before OSC and makes nonfrivolous allegations of facts that, if proven, could show that: (1) the appellant engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure; and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Yunus</span>, 242 F.3d at 1371; <span class="Italic">Mudd</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. at 368, &#x00B6; 4. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.57.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exhaustion</span>. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), an employee is required to seek corrective action from the OSC before seeking corrective action from the Board where the personnel action at issue is not directly appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Briley v. National Archives &#x0026; Records Administration</span>, 236 F.3d 1373, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Coufal v. Department of Justice</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 14 (2004). The Board may only consider charges of whistleblowing that the appellant raised before OSC. <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1036 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Coufal</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14, 18. To satisfy the exhaustion requirement, the appellant must have informed OSC of the precise ground of each charge of whistleblowing, giving OSC a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation that might lead to corrective action. The appellant's complaint to OSC must raise "with reasonable clarity and precision the basis for his request for corrective action." <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, 7 F.3d at 1036; <span class="Italic">Coufal</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 14. He need not, however, correctly label the category of wrongdoing he believes he has disclosed because OSC would be expected to properly categorize the matter. Moreover, as whistleblower protections have been increased by Congress, it appears that courts have also taken a more expansive view of whether a matter has been exhausted, so that the degree of specificity required before OSC may have been lessened if the record could be deemed to support the appellant's claim that he had, in fact, raised an issue. An appellant may demonstrate exhaustion of the OSC remedies through the initial OSC complaint, and evidence of amending or supplementing the initial OSC complaint, including but not limited to OSC's determination letter and other letters from OSC referencing the appellant's amended allegations, and the appellant's written responses to OSC referencing OSC's discussion of the amended allegations. <span class="Italic">Mudd</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. at 371, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Kuyoki v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Protected Disclosure</span>. Protected whistleblowing occurs when an appellant makes a disclosure that she reasonably believes evidences a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety. <span class="Italic">Mudd</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. at 369, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Mason v.

The proper test for determining whether an employee had a reasonable belief that her disclosures were protected is whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to, and readily ascertainable by, the employee could reasonably conclude that the actions evidenced a violation of a law, rule, or regulation, or one of the other conditions set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Mudd,</span> 120 M.S.P.R. at 369, &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Alleged disclosures contained in a grievance pursuant to a negotiated grievance procedure under a collective bargaining agreement are not protected under section 2302(b)(8). Reprisal for exercising a grievance right is a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), not 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Serrao v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 95 F.3d 1569, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Mudd</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. at 369, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Davis v.

Department of Defense</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 585, 587-88 (1991) (section 2302(b)(8) does not extend to reprisal for filing grievances, which is protected by section 2302(b)(9)). However, as discussed below, in section 11 of this chapter, the WPEA expanded the scope of whistleblower appeals to include most claims under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3762"></span>Under the WPA, as amended, the appellant is not required to identify the particular statutory or regulatory provision that the agency allegedly violated. The question is whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee could reasonably conclude that the actions evidenced a violation of a law, rule, or regulation, or one of the other conditions set out in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Groseclose</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 194, &#x00B6; 22 (citing <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Alleged protected disclosures of an abuse of authority or gross mismanagement should follow the guidance outlined in Board precedent. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 13 (2001) (an abuse of authority occurs when there is an arbitrary or capricious exercise of power by a Federal official or employee that adversely affects the rights of any person or that results in personal gain or advantage to himself or to preferred other persons); <span class="Italic">White v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 90, 95 (1994) (gross mismanagement means a management action or inaction which creates a substantial risk of significant adverse impact upon the agency's ability to accomplish its mission). As to the disclosure of a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, <span class="Italic">see Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 515 F.3d 1362, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">A variety of factors guide the application of the statutory language, helping determine when a disclosed danger is sufficiently substantial and specific to warrant protection under the WPA. One such factor is the likelihood of harm resulting from the danger. If the disclosed danger could only result in harm under speculative or improbable conditions, the disclosure should not enjoy protection. Another important factor is when the alleged harm may occur. A harm likely to occur in the immediate or near future should identify a protected disclosure much more than a harm likely to manifest only in the distant future. Both of these factors affect the specificity of the alleged danger, while the nature of the harm--the potential consequences--affects the substantiality of the danger.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Contributing Factor</span>. To satisfy the contributing factor criterion, an appellant must raise nonfrivolous allegations that the fact of, or content of, the protected disclosure was one factor that tended to affect the personnel action in any way. <span class="Italic">Atkinson v. Department of State</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 136, &#x00B6; 15 (2007) (citing <span class="Italic">Santos v. Department of Energy</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 370, &#x00B6; 10 (2006)). One way to establish the contributing factor element is through the knowledge/timing test of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1), where the disclosure is shown to have been a contributing factor through circumstantial evidence such as evidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure, and that the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Carey v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 676, &#x00B6; 11 (2003); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Wadhwa v.

<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 353 F. App'x 435 (Fed. Cir. 2009). While the knowledge/timing test is not the only way for an appellant to satisfy the contributing factor standard, it is "one of the many possible ways" to satisfy the standard. <span class="Italic">Carey</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 676, &#x00B6; 11. When the appellant has not specifically alleged that an official knew of the disclosure at issue, the appellant may make nonfrivolous allegations under a "cat's paw" theory that the protected disclosure was a contributing factor by alleging that the official was influenced by an individual with actual knowledge of the disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marchese v. Department of the Navy</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 104, 108 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Personnel action</span>. An IRA appeal must be based on one of the 12 "personnel actions," as that term is detailed in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). A voluntary action is not a personnel action and cannot form the basis for an IRA appeal. Thus, an employee's claim that he or she resigned or retired involuntarily can form the basis for an IRA appeal only if the employee proves that his or her facially voluntary action was actually coerced by the agency or otherwise rendered involuntary under the standards applied in chapter 75 appeals of such actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Koury v. Department of Defense</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 219, &#x00B6; 10 (1999). Further, if the agency actions that form the basis for the involuntariness claim suffice to constitute a hostile environment, the creation of such an environment is a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Colbert v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 12 (2014). Conversely, a termination during probation is a personnel action, but not generally considered an appealable matter. Thus, if an appellant first files an OAA (315H) appeal based on a termination during probation that is ultimately found not to be within the Board's jurisdiction, the appellant can then file an IRA appeal without being held to his initial election of a direct appeal, since he had no right to make such an election. <span class="Italic">Shannon v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 17 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">e.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Threats</span>. To establish Board jurisdiction, the appellant must make nonfrivolous allegations that a person with authority took, failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take, a personnel action. What constitutes a "threat" is often not clear, but a simple belief that the appellant will face discipline does not constitute a threat. <span class="Italic">See Rebstock Consolidation v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 661, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12 (2015). The term "threaten" should be interpreted broadly and, thus, a counseling memorandum warning of possible future discipline, <span class="Italic">Campo v. Department of the Army</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2002), and a supervisor stating that an employee should not expect the same performance rating he had received the year before, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Hathaway</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 595 (1991), were deemed threatened personnel actions. In <span class="Italic">Rebstock</span> the Board stated that "[a]bstract concerns about possible disciplinary action, without any evidence that the agency actually has threatened or suggested it would take such action, do not constitute nonfrivolous allegations that the agency threatened to take a personnel action." Rather, "the agency must take some action signifying its intent to take a personnel action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">f.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Burdens at Hearing</span>. Federal agencies are prohibited from taking, failing to take, or threatening to take, a personnel action against an employee in a covered position because of the disclosure of information that the employee reasonably believes to be evidence of a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2), (b)(8); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 16 (2012). To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of whistleblower reprisal in an IRA appeal, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that he or she made a protected disclosure and that the disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 16. If the appellant makes out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> claim of whistleblower reprisal, the agency is given an opportunity to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2); <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 16. In determining whether an agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of whistleblowing, the Board will consider the following factors: (1) the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of agency officials who were involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">Generally, an AJ should not bifurcate the hearing on the merits of an IRA appeal, that is, first take evidence on whether the agency met its clear and convincing evidence burden because the AJ must give full and fair consideration to the appellant's claim through adjudication of both the merits of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of whistleblower retaliation as well as the agency's affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">Mattil</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 662, 668-69, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (holding that the decision to bifurcate the hearing was unwarranted under the particular circumstances of the appeal when the substance of one of the disclosures at issue was intertwined with the appellant's claim that the immediate supervisor was concerned with the effect of that disclosure on his own career). In light of the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Department of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (evidence only clearly and convincingly supports a conclusion when it does so in the aggregate considering all the pertinent evidence in the record, and despite the evidence that fairly detracts from that conclusion; a complete evaluation of the facts is necessary in every case), it seems likely that bifurcation usually should not be done.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Because the appellant has the burden of proof in an IRA appeal, it is the appellant who presents his or her case first, even when the underlying matter is an appealable action that the appellant chose to bring to OSC. In an OAA, of course, that would not be true.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In addition, one who is perceived as a whistleblower is entitled to the protections of the WPA, even if she has not made protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Jensen v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 379, &#x00B6; 11 n.3 (2007); <span class="Italic">Juffer v.

To make such a claim, the appellant must show: (1) that she exhausted her remedies with OSC on the issue of whether the agency perceived her as a whistleblower; and (2) that the agency's perception of her as a whistleblower was a contributing factor in its decision to take or not take the personnel action at <span id="Page_3763"></span>issue, which she may do through the knowledge/timing test. If the appellant meets these burdens, the agency may still prevail if it can show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the personnel action at issue absent its perception of the appellant as a whistleblower. <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Army</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689 (2011). The Board later extended the "perceived-as" rule under the WPEA to each of the activities it covers. <span class="Italic">Corthell v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 417 (2016).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">8.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">REFERRAL TO THE OFFICE OF SPECIAL COUNSEL (OSC)</span>. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(f)(3), when "under this section," the Board "determines that there is reason to believe that a current employee may have committed a prohibited personnel practice, the Board shall refer the matter to the Special Counsel to investigate and take appropriate action under section 1215." The responsibility to provide such notification now rests with OCB, both if the ID becomes final in the absence of a PFR and if the Board on PFR agrees with the decision. A Law Manager report lists all cases making such a finding and their finality dates. OCB will consult that list to keep track of finality dates and send the notice, so that the regions are relieved of the obligation. Thus, there is no need for the RO or FO to notify OCB when a decision is issued that might call for the issuance of such a referral.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">9.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ATTORNEY FEES</span>. The prevailing party test enunciated in <span class="Italic">Cuthbertson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">10.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">CONSEQUENTIAL AND COMPENSATORY DAMAGES</span>. The Board may order payment of consequential damages, including medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages as authorized by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 (g)(1)(A)(ii), when the Board orders corrective action in a whistleblower appeal to which 5 U.S.C. 1221 applies. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(b). The Board may not award nonpecuniary damages for mental distress under the consequential damages provision, however. <span class="Italic">Kinney v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 338, &#x00B6; 10 (1999). It may, though, award compensation for future medical expenses which are the result of the retaliation and can be proven with reasonable certainty, under its authority to reimburse for "medical costs incurred." <span class="Italic">See Pastor v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 609 (2001). <span class="Italic">See also</span> chapter 13, sections 6 and 7 of this Handbook. Under the WPEA, compensatory damages may also be awarded. While there is little law on such damages in the context of whistleblower retaliation, <span class="Italic">see King v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 663 (2013) (the compensatory damages provision does not apply retroactively), there is a good bit of precedent on such damages in the context of EEO reprisal, much of which is likely to be appropriate in this context as well. Unlike EEO reprisal, however, note that the $300,000.00 limitation is missing from the WPEA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequential damages represent an award that the appellant might be entitled to, if he meets the requirements of the statute. For this reason, the cancellation of the appealed action does not moot an IRA appeal or the appeal of an OAA that includes a whistleblower claim, if the appellant has requested consequential damages or has not yet been informed of his right to do so. After providing sufficient notice, the AJ must afford an appellant a specific opportunity to raise a claim for consequential damages before deciding if it is appropriate to dismiss the appeal as moot. <span class="Italic">Vick v. Department of Transportation</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 68, 69-70, &#x00B6; 5 (2012); <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Department of the Interior</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 238, &#x00B6; 6 (2006). Thus, in situations where the agency may have rescinded the personnel action(s) at issue, the appellant's outstanding claim for consequential damages will preclude dismissal of the whistleblower claim as moot. <span class="Italic">Vick</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 70, &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because consequential damages constitute an award beyond <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief, the appellant would not be eligible for such damages in a case that does not include a WPA claim. <span class="Italic">See Daniels v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 248 (2007) (noting that "[t]he WPA affords to a person who prevails on an allegation of reprisal for whistleblowing relief that exceeds <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief, including medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and other reasonably foreseeable consequential damages."). The appellant therefore will not have received all the relief to which he may be entitled in the WPA appeal even if he receives all the relief to which he is entitled in the OAA case that does not have a whistleblower affirmative defense claim under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has applied a similar rule to an arbitrator's decision in a situation where the appellant filed a grievance of his removal under chapter 75, but an appeal of the agency's action in removing him, on the same date, under chapter 43<span class="Italic">. Dey v. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 167 (2007). Because the appellant had raised a claim of whistleblower retaliation in his chapter 43 appeal, and requested consequential damages if he prevailed on that claim, the AJ could not properly dismiss the appeal without prejudice to await the result of the arbitration of the chapter 75 action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Even if the appellant loses the arbitration, and therefore remains separated from the agency and so ineligible for back pay as a result of the chapter 43 appeal, the appeal is not moot because of the consequential damages claim, inasmuch as he is not eligible for such damages in his arbitration, which did not raise such a claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">11.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT (WPEA)</span>. As a result of the WPEA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) protects not just disclosures, but also certain actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8); or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;other than with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise of any right referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) or (ii);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003; cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of an agency, or to the Special Counsel, in accordance with applicable provisions of law, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003; for refusing to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law, rule or regulations. [Note that "rule or regulation" was added by the Follow the Rules Act, not the WPEA.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While (b)(9) pre-existed the WPEA, it did not then distinguish between (A)(i) and (ii) or provide for the filing of an IRA appeal based on the activities protected by the section. What the WPEA did was to extend the Board's IRA appeal jurisdiction to claims arising under all of (b)(9) except for (b)(9)(A)(ii). WPEA &#x00A7; 101(b)(1)(A). Thus, to the extent the appellant alleges that the agency took, failed to take or threatened to take a personnel action in reprisal for exercising a grievance, complaint, or appeal right, the AJ will need to determine if the Board has jurisdiction to consider such allegations in the context of the IRA appeal by determining whether that grievance, complaint, or appeal was filed to remedy a (b)(8) violation. If it was, then an IRA appeal is viable. <span class="Italic">Clay v. Department of the Army,</span> 123 M.S.P.R. 245 (2016) (the appellant's claim of retaliation for his earlier Board appeal that included a whistleblower issue comes within (b)(9)(A)(i) and is to be analyzed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although (b)(9)(A) protects against reprisal only for those appeals, complaints, and grievances filed by the appellant that were aimed at remedying a (b)(8) violation, as (b)(9)(B) suggests, an IRA appeal may now be filed by any employee who assisted another individual with that person's appeal, complaint, or grievance regardless of whether it involved a (b)(8) claim. <span class="Italic">See Carney v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 446 (2014). Union stewards and others who file such actions on behalf of other employees are, of course, covered, as are individuals who were witnesses or were otherwise of assistance to a complainant, appellant, or grievant. The same burden-shifting analysis applicable to (b)(8) claims is also applicable to (b)(9), meaning that in a chapter 75 case where jurisdiction is established, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that he or she engaged in the protected disclosure and that it was a contributing factor to the personnel action at issue. The burden then shifts to the agency to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action absent that protected activity. <span class="Italic">Alarid v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14 (2015). In IRA appeals based on (b)(9), the appellant must prove he exhausted as to the specific protected action at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPEA also expanded the scope of protected disclosures to comport with what Congress stated it had intended all along. Thus, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(1), a disclosure is not excluded because it was made to the wrongdoer or his supervisor; it revealed information that had previously been disclosed; it was not made in writing; or it was made while off duty. The motive for making the disclosure and the amount of time that has passed since the occurrence of the events described in the disclosure also provide no basis for exclusion. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2), "if a disclosure is made during the normal course of duties of an employee, the disclosure shall not be excluded from subsection (b)(8) if any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend or approve any personnel action with respect to the employee making the disclosure, took, failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take a personnel action with respect to that employee in reprisal for the disclosure." The Board has not yet fully analyzed the provision but in <span class="Italic">Benton-Flores v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 428, &#x00B6; 15 (2014), stated that "[i]n explaining this new <span id="Page_3764"></span>provision in the Act, the Senate Report stated that disclosures made in the course of one's duties are protected only if the employee also proves that the agency took the personnel action with an improper retaliatory motive. S. Rep. No. 112-155, 5-6, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 2012 U.S.C.C.A.N. 589, 593-94. Accordingly, when an appellant has made a protected disclosure in the normal course of her duties, the statute now requires her to prove that the personnel action taken was in retaliation for the disclosure."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the Board's expanded jurisdiction under the WPEA, vague, nonspecific allegations of wrongdoing and simple policy disagreements remain unprotected. <span class="Italic">See Salerno v. Department of the Interior</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 230 (2016).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a result of the WPEA and the All-Circuit Review Act, all IRAs and OAAs that involve (b)(8) and (b)(9) (except (b)(9)(a)(ii)) issues may be appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or any court of appeals of competent jurisdiction. The Board has not yet addressed how it will deal with any split between the circuits that may arise.</p>
