<p class="Body-Text">The Board has considered some unusual cases, with some unusual results, in the area of potential for rehabilitation. Take the individual who falsified an application for an administrative law judge position, <span class="Italic">In re Spielman</span>, 1 MSPR 54, 61, 1 MSPB 50 (1979) (ALJ Decision), a case statutorily placing in the Board responsibility for determining a penalty. The applicant obtained the position, but when his conduct was discovered, it was proposed that he be suspended for 60 days. Determining that the judge made the false statements to obtain appointment to a higher grade than the level of his appointment, and noting the need for honesty and integrity in lawyers and judges, the Board first observed that the most reasonable sanction would be removal from the service. However, because three years had passed since the false statements were made and the judge was well regarded in the agency for his consistently good work, the Board decided to defer to the lesser penalty proposed by the agency. Given the purpose of the action against the ALJ--protection of the integrity and efficiency of the government--and with clear evidence of rehabilitation, the suspension was substantial enough to indicate the seriousness of the offenses yet not financially destructive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hellein v. USDA</span>, 8 MSPR 373, 376 (1981), reflected favorably on intervening good performance by an employee against whom the agency proved charges of unauthorized absence, failure to comply with instructions, and unbecoming conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We note that during the ten-month interim between the occurrence of the incidents for which Hellein was removed and his removal, the agency promoted him from a GS-5 to a GS-7. While an agency is not precluded from removing an employee for reasons predating appointment to the position from which he is to be removed, where, as here, the reasons were known to the agency prior to the employee's promotion to his current position, the agency's consideration of alternatives to removal would appear to be particularly appropriate. Such consideration by the agency in this case, if made at all, would appear to be minimal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Hagmeyer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 757 F.2d 1281, 1285 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (removal was reversed when the agency dropped several charges and proceeded on one that reflected "immaturity rather than culpability" and when, after its investigation, the agency reassigned the employee to a responsible position, suggesting that he was "worthy of rehabilitation"), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 29 MSPR 206, 207 (1985) (removal mitigated to 60-day suspension); <span class="Italic">Grebosz v. Civil Serv. Comm'n</span>, 472 F. Supp. 1081 (SDNY 1979) (the Postal Service permitted the appellant to work pending the outcome of his arrests); <span class="Italic">Hovanec v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 67 MSPR 340, 346 (1995) (agency promoted the appellant during the pendency of his criminal indictment, undercutting the argument that the agency lost trust and confidence in the appellant; "[a]t the very least, the agency could have postponed the appellant's promotion pending the outcome of the criminal indictment"); <span class="Italic">Turchin v. USPS</span>, 39 MSPR 14, 16 (1988) ("[t]he appellant here had an unblemished work record for 9 years, and worked at his distribution clerk position for several months following the shoplifting incident without committing any offenses on the job or giving the agency any additional reason to mistrust him."); <span class="Italic">Goode v. DLA</span>, <span id="Page_2352"></span>31 MSPR 446, 450 (1986) (agency allowed the appellant to continue in the position for a considerable length of time (approximately five months) after learning of the offenses he committed), <span class="Italic">followed in Mann v. DHHS</span>, 78 MSPR 1, 13 (1998); <span class="Italic">Colyott v. USDA</span>, 11 MSPR 487, 490 (1982) ("Additionally, during the 2 1/2 years between the occurrence of this incident and the removal proposal, the appellant's performance had been fully satisfactory.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Intervening good performance will not always boost the employee's case. <span class="Italic">Beardsley v. DOD</span>, 55 MSPR 504, 511 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Normally, the Board does not consider an employee's good work performance in a position to which he has been appointed as a result of falsification to be relevant to a falsification charge and subsequent removal.... However, in the present case, the deciding official relied on the appellant's performance as a mitigating factor. The Board will not usurp the agency's primary role in selecting the penalty by ignoring those mitigating factors the agency itself relied upon.... Accordingly, the administrative judge did not err in relying on the appellant's performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Carr v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3342), discounted the argument that an agency undercuts its avowed loss of trust and confidence in an employee if the employee is permitted to work for a period after the infraction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Arguing against the finding of a nexus, Carr asserts that the record does not support the administrative judge's finding that the DO lost trust in her. According to Carr, management must have trusted her because she was not placed on administrative leave until the DO issued the final removal decision, but was allowed to return to work for forty-five days. Carr provides no authority for her proposition that loss of trust must always be followed by being placed on administrative leave, and we are aware of none. Further, we see no merit to that proposition. Even in cases of serious employee misconduct, the agency may feel that the employee, if appropriately monitored, poses no imminent threat and does not need to be placed on administrative leave. We would be loathe to remove an agency's ability to bestow this discretionary kindness on employees facing removal.</p>

Cir. 2012 NP) (lack of candor or misrepresentations concerning academic credentials led to removal, despite a good record of service in the position); <span class="Italic">Arrieta v. DHS</span>, 337 Fed. Appx. 873, 877 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP) (promotion after misconduct but prior to completion of an IG investigation did not require setting aside an arbitration award sustaining a discharge); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dept. of Army</span>, DE-0752-12-0221-I-1 (NP 5/16/2013) ("The administrative judge did not specifically refer to the deciding official's testimony that he had lost trust in the appellant, but, to the extent that the appellant's argument can be seen as a challenge to the agency's claimed loss of trust, he has provided no support for the proposition that loss of trust must always be followed by the actions to which he refers, and we are aware of none. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Carr v.

Moreover, the agency <span class="Italic">did</span> act immediately to revoke the appellant's access once it became aware of his violation, thereby effectively reflecting its view that a nexus existed between his actions and the efficiency of the service."); <span class="Italic">Tate v.

Dept. of Army</span>, 87 MSPR 27, 30-31 &#x00B6; 9 (2000) (violation of a "firm choice" agreement that one more positive breathalyzer test would support removal: "The fact that the appellants returned to duty after the misconduct in no way diminishes the seriousness of their on-duty alcohol use."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Hamilton v.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Wilkes v. VA</span>, 6 MSPR 732, 736, 6 MSPB 611 (1981), the employee performed well for four years after the action supporting his removal. The Board sustained the removal, however, concluding that it was required to balance the claimed rehabilitation against the seriousness of the offense, involving violation of regulations governing the conduct of loan officers. Finding that the gravity of the offense "outweighed" the rehabilitation, the Board affirmed the penalty in <span class="Italic">Wilkes</span> with the observation that "we have to balance the claimed rehabilitation against the seriousness of the offense." [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-090.html#sec7-89">Staleness of Charge</a>," and in Chapter 11, "<a href="0100-2023-18-028.html#sec11-29">Stale Charges; Laches</a>."] In the more typical situation, involving improved work habits for the short period of time that follows receipt of a removal proposal, the Board tends to discount the claim of rehabilitation. <span class="Italic">See Jiggetts v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 48 MSPR 252, 256 (1991) (that the agency permitted the employee to remain in position for eight months while it investigated a theft was not mitigating when removal was proposed within two months from the time the agency concluded that the employee committed the theft); <span class="Italic">Crawford v. DOJ</span>, 45 MSPR 234, 238 (1990) (discounting a favorable appraisal that was the product of but one month of supervision by the rating official).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board considers an adverse action based on the specifications in the agency decision letter and does not permit actual or constructive amendment of the agency decision through events brought out during Board adjudication of an appeal, the Board permits agencies to demonstrate misconduct postdating the adverse action as evidence negating an appellant's claim to a good work record<span class="Italic">. See Winston v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 96, 101 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Meads v. VA</span>, 36 MSPR 574, 584 (1988)). <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Dept. of Army</span>, 56 MSPR 415, 421 (1993), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant correctly argues on petition for review that those disciplinary actions occurring after the date of the misconduct at issue here may not be considered as evidence of a lack of rehabilitation potential. Such conduct may, however, be considered as evidence of disciplinary actions against the appellant and of his work record. <span class="Italic">Meads v. VA</span>, 36 MSPR 574, 584 (1988); <span class="Italic">Cf. Mann v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 54 MSPR 693, 698-99 (1992) (actions occurring after the misconduct at issue considered as evidence of a lack of rehabilitative potential when those actions related to the appellant's perceptions of the gravity of his misconduct; disciplinary action, however, occurring after the misconduct [a letter of counseling] not considered as an exacerbating factor, i.e., evidence of a lack of rehabilitative potential).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But subsequent disciplinary action is not necessarily in derogation of evidence of an employee's performance. It depends, <span class="Italic">Cantu v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 88 MSPR 253, 256 n.* (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 14-day suspension for AWOL may be considered as evidence of the appellant's job performance or work record<span class="Italic">. See Fowler</span>, 77 MSPR at 14; <span class="Italic">Wigen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 MSPR 381, 385 (1993). However, the record shows that the 14-day suspension was based on the appellant's absence on a single scheduled workday (a Sunday), and the agency has not alleged or shown that the appellant's job performance or work record was unsatisfactory as a whole. In fact, the agency deciding official testified that she considered the appellant's 12 years of satisfactory service in determining the penalty. We therefore find that the appellant's 14-day suspension for AWOL does not constitute significant evidence negating the appellant's satisfactory job performance or work record.</p>

USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 381, 385 (1993) (although discipline was not received until after the occurrence of the current offense and could not be considered evidence of a prior disciplinary record because it could have no deterrent effect on charged misconduct, the AJ could properly find that the subsequent misconduct reflected adversely on the appellant's work record) (citing <span class="Italic">Meads v.
