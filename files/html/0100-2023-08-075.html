<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Ellis-Smith v. DOD</span>, DC-315I-13-0266-I-1 (NP 7/10/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Transfer" is a term of art in personnel actions in the competitive service, defined as "a change of an employee, without a break in service of 1 full workday, from a position in one agency to a position in another agency." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(18).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The OPM rules governing tenure and probationary completion for employees who transfer within the competitive service are:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 315.501 (2022) <span class="Italic">Transfer.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subject to part 335 of this chapter, an agency may appoint by transfer to a competitive service position, without a break in service of a single workday, a current career or career-conditional employee of another agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 315.502 (2022) <span class="Italic">Tenure on transfer.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;General rule. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a career employee who transfers remains a career employee and a career-conditional employee who transfers remains a career-conditional employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Exceptions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A career-conditional employee who transfers to a position required by law to be filled on a permanent basis becomes a career employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A career employee who transfers from a position required by law to be filled on a permanent basis becomes a career-conditional employee unless he or she has completed the service requirement for career tenure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 315.503 (2022) Acquisition of competitive status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who was serving probation when he was appointed under &#x00A7; 315.501 acquires a competitive status automatically on completion of probation.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A person who is:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Transferred under &#x00A7; 315.501; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Promoted, demoted, or reassigned; before he completed probation is required to complete the probationary period in the new position.</p>

DHUD</span>, 44 MSPR 48, 52 (1990) (agency corrected the original designation of the move as a transfer); <span class="Italic">Demshok v.

<p class="Body-Text">If the change from one agency to another is a transfer without a break of a full workday, the employee transferred is required to complete, rather than begin anew, the probationary period in the new position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bilodeau v. American Battle Monuments Comm'n</span>, 39 MSPR 243, 247 (1988) (no transfer after an examination of the totality of the circumstances involving a resignation and paperwork presented in an attempt to demonstrate a transfer; examining when the appellant first performed a federal function or was supervised by a federal employee while performing his duties). The position movement must, however, be the result of a transfer, <span class="Italic">Oulvey v. VA</span>, 7 MSPR 312, 315, 7 MSPB 203 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As appellant was a government employee who moved from a competitive position with one federal agency to a competitive position with another without a break in service of a workday, the personnel action was correctly identified as a "transfer." <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Supp. 296-31, July 9, 1979, at V-35. However, appellant was not appointed "non-competitively" by transfer as described at FPM Ch. 315, Subch. 8, para. 8-2a. He was selected from a certificate of eligibles and given a career-conditional appointment by means of a transfer. The new appointment required a one-year probationary period, as was indicated on the SF 50. 5 C.F.R. 315.801(a)(1); FPM Ch. 315, Subch. 8, para. 8-2.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The question may be whether a transfer occurred. The Board examined the circumstances of an appointment that could have been made by transfer or from a register in <span class="Italic">Niles v. DOJ</span>, 9 MSPR 63, 66-67 (1981), and decided that the appointment was by transfer, meaning no new probationary period was required:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's power of appointment is an executive function. The agency has the discretion to determine whether it will appoint from a register or by promotion transfer. <span class="Italic">Tierney v. United States</span>, 168 Ct. Cl. 77 (1964). When, as here, the agency has the option to appoint an individual by either means, its decision becomes a question of fact. The Board is persuaded by appellant's statements and actions that he sought a promotion transfer, believed he had been offered one, and took his new position expecting to be treated as a transferred employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant evidenced this intent to OPM as shown by its letter to appellant informing him that to obtain appointment by transfer he must submit his application directly to the agency. Though the appellant may have known that the agency could appoint by either of two means, he expressed his preference on several occasions including during the interview for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that at the time of the interview the agency had not reached its final decision about what means of appointment it would use should it hire appellant. The panel merely informed appellant that his name appeared on the certificate of qualified eligibles received by the agency from OPM and that this gave the agency the right to impose a probationary period on him. Though the agency made its options known to Niles during the interview, the Board is persuaded it did not arrive at <span id="Page_104"></span>its conclusions about the method it would use to appoint appellant until after the interview.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds the affidavits of the interviewers less persuasive than appellant's statements about the conclusiveness of the agency's decision at the date of the interview about which method of appointment it would use. They recite no details about the interview, while appellant's recitations of its are detailed and consistent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's letter offering employment to appellant stated that the appointment would be a promotion transfer. When appellant reported to work, he made it apparent that he expected to receive reimbursement for moving and travel expenses. Appellant's request for reinstatement to his former position allows the inference that he found his treatment in his new job to be radically different from that which he had anticipated. The Board finds little help for the agency's position in the SF-50. It was cut a week after appellant reported for work, more than a month after the agency had made its offer of a transfer to appellant, and days after appellant had been frank with the agency that he was not happy with his treatment after reporting. The SF-50 cannot by itself operate to amend or revoke an otherwise legitimate appointment once the employee is actually working for the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scott v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 7 MSPB 741, 8 MSPR 282 (1981); <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Reagan</span>, 663 F.2d 239 (D.C. Cir., 1981). Accordingly, we conclude that appellant was not a probationary employee at the time of his removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pervez v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 193 F.3d 1371, 1374-75 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("personnel action code is 100 for a career appointment from a register and 130 for a transfer"); <span class="Italic">Marcus v. United States</span>, 473 F.2d 896, 898 (Ct. Cl. 1973) ("[I]t appears that HEW appointed the plaintiff from the Civil Service Register, as it had the discretionary authority to do under 5 CFR 315.501 instead of appointing him as a transferee.... The agency had the discretion to choose whether it would transfer plaintiff or not and unless that choice is arbitrary or capricious it cannot be overturned.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marcus</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, explained the basis for preserving the exercise of an agency's discretion to appoint from a register rather than to transfer an employee from another agency, 473 F.2d at 900:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is unfortunately true that long service in a tenured position in Government is no guarantee of competence. As everyone knows, tenure sometimes protects incompetence, and the only reason why it is tolerated is that its alternative, the spoils system, fosters incompetence even more. An agency is not normally required to assume that employees of other agencies are competent. Should one of them apply for employment, it can reject him entirely, accept him as a new appointee from the Register, with a concomitant probationary period, or accept him as a transferee. It is entitled to make its decision in light of its obligation to get its work out. It is absurd to say that tenure makes no difference: that it is just as easy to get rid of an incompetent tenured employee as a probationer, except for a little more paper work. The very purpose of tenure is to establish that there will be differences, of which the thirty day notice is but the beginning.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit said of the implications of transfers on probationary requirements, <span class="Italic">Poores v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 91-3273):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If Poores was laterally reassigned or transferred, then no new probationary period was required and her probationary period for the second position of Internal Auditor ended on January 18, 1989. FPM Chapter 315, Subch. 8-2(a) and (e). If she was a direct hire, she was required to undertake a new one-year probationary period, since her new job was in a different line of work. FPM Chapter 315, Appendix A-3c(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Niles v. DOJ</span>, 9 MSPR 63, 66-67 (1981), the Board may examine information other than the coding on an SF-50 to determine the correct nature of an appointment. <span class="Italic">Yancey v. Dept. of Army</span>, 32 MSPR 606, 608 (1987). An error on a SF-50 concerning the means of appointment will not prevent the government from discharging the employee as a probationer if the true nature of the appointment should have been reflected by the appointment papers. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 729 F.2d 772 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (reviewing an arbitrator's decision). An agency's error does not permit waiver of probation. It is immaterial that the employee was initially advised that her appointment was by transfer. Once the error is corrected and the appointment properly recorded as a hire from a register, the employee was subject to probation. That the employee might not have taken the job had she known of the probation requirement is immaterial, <span class="Italic">Phillips v. DHUD</span>, 44 MSPR 48, 52 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency personnel office notified the appellant by memorandum dated March 23, 1989, that the original appointment transferring her to HUD was improper. The agency then issued a corrected SF-50 which stated that the appointment was a competitive appointment from the register and informed her that her appointment was subject to a one year probationary period. Although the initial error was unfortunate, the government has a legitimate interest in protecting the competitive process and the appellant's SF-50 was properly corrected to reflect her competitive appointment from a register rather than a transfer<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.,</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 3304; <span class="Italic">and</span> <span class="Italic">Hatfield v. Department of the Interior,</span> 28 MSPR 673 (1985) (where the appellant's erroneous appointment violated 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.501, the Board found that the appellant's removal protected the competitive process.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that regardless of the nature of her appointment she was not subject to a probationary period. We find, however, that although the agency should have informed the appellant of it at an earlier date, and although it is possible that the appellant might not have taken the position if she had known of the probation requirement at the time of entrance on duty, the appellant is subject to probation and such requirement cannot be waived. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.801(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Rochniak v. Department of the Navy</span>, 9 MSPB 808, 10 MSPR 603, 605 (1982), <span class="Italic">modified by Long v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 32 MSPR 438 (1987). Nor can the agency's error confer jurisdiction on the Board to hear the appeal on the merits. <span class="Italic">Cf. Batchelder v. Department of the Army</span>, 10 MSPB 454, 11 MSPR 529 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee selected for a career-conditional appointment from a register is required to serve a one year probationary period. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.801(a)(1). The appellant was selected from a civil service register by HUD. Thus, being appointed from a register required the appellant to serve a one-year probationary period<span class="Italic">. Sullivan v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 32 MSPR 194 (1987).</p>
