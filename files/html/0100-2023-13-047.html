<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-48"><span class="space">n.</span> Failure to Accommodate Disability</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fritz v. SSA</span>, 315 Fed. Appx. 281, 284-85 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), synopsized the law relating involuntary actions and disability discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Normally, the Board lacks jurisdiction over resignations and retirements because those acts are presumed voluntary. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1327-28 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). A petitioner can overcome the presumption of voluntariness and obtain a hearing on jurisdiction, however, by making nonfrivolous allegations that (1) the resignation or retirement was based on threats of adverse action, (2) the resignation or retirement was based on alleged misinformation or deception, or (3) the resignation or retirement was coerced through "working conditions so intolerable" that the employee was forced to leave. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1328 (quotation marks omitted). In cases of allegedly involuntary disability retirement, the Board lacks jurisdiction unless the employee shows "that there was an accommodation available on the date of his separation that would have allowed him to continue his employment, and that the agency did not provide him that accommodation." <span class="Italic">Benavidez v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 241 F.3d 1370, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The approach of the Federal Circuit was reiterated, <span class="Italic">Broughton v. MSPB</span>, 581 Fed. Appx. 882, 884-85 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Broughton's allegation here is that her asthma disability forced her to retire involuntarily. We have held that in order to establish such involuntary disability retirement, employees must show there was an accommodation available on the date of their separation that would have allowed them to continue their employment, and that the agency did not provide that accommodation. <span class="Italic">Benavidez v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 241 F.3d 1370, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Thus, if no accommodation would have allowed Ms. Broughton to continue working, then the agency cannot be said to have constructively removed her. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Williams v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 227 Fed. Appx. 916, 919 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board determined that although Ms. Broughton suffers from asthma, she did not provide sufficient evidence that an accommodation existed at the time of her resignation that would have allowed her to continue working. Ms. Broughton argues that if she had received a fan for her desk, she would have been able to work again. But substantial evidence supports the administrative judge's factual finding that a fan would not have been a sufficient accommodation. The agency undertook a special cleaning of the air ducts and carpet and considered other measures such as a fan, but the agency's health experts concluded that these measures would not help in the long run. Moreover, Ms. Broughton herself stated at a status conference with the administrative judge that because of her medical condition, she was not capable of returning to work even with an accommodation during the period at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Ms. Broughton claims that the Board failed to apply certain laws favorable to her position, such as the requirement to make reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9(b), or under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112. We have considered these claims and do not find them persuasive. Without first establishing its primary jurisdiction to hear Ms. Broughton's employment claims, the Board may not decide Ms. Broughton's discrimination-related claims. <span class="Italic">See Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1343 (citing <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1245 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>)) (rejecting the argument that the Board may consider discrimination claims under its pendent or ancillary jurisdiction without first establishing its principal jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appeal involving a resignation allegedly coerced by both failure to accommodate a disability and a hostile working environment was considered in <span class="Italic">Conover v. Dept. of Army</span>, 78 MSPR 605, 611-12 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the appellant's claim that her resignation was the result of disability discrimination, we find that the appellant has raised a nonfrivolous allegation sufficient to warrant a jurisdictional hearing. The elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination generally include: A showing that the appellant is a qualified disabled person and the action appealed was based on her disability; and, to the extent possible, an articulation of a reasonable accommodation under which the appellant believes that she could perform the essential duties of her position or of a vacant position to which she could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See Spencer v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy,</span> 73 MSPR 15, 24-25 (1997). Ultimately, the appellant must prove that she is a qualified person with disabilities, i.e., a disabled individual who can perform the essential functions of her position with or without reasonable accommodation, without endangering the health and/or safety of herself and/or others. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a); <span class="Italic">Clark v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 552, 561 (1997). However, to meet her burden of proof with respect to establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the appellant need merely <span class="Italic">articulate a reasonable accommodation</span> under which she believes she could perform the essential duties of her position or of a vacant position to which she could be reassigned<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that a hostile work environment caused her to resign, in effect, resulting in a constructive discharge. In cases where the appellant has alleged that intolerable working conditions led to her resignation or retirement, the Board has held that the appropriate test for involuntariness is "whether under all of the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign [or retire]." <span class="Italic">Markon v. Department of State,</span> 71 MSPR 574, 577 (1996) (quoting <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Services Administration</span>, 68 MSPR 513, 520 (1995)). The Board has further found that, when allegations of discrimination and reprisal are alleged in connection with a determination of voluntariness, such evidence of discrimination or retaliation may only be addressed insofar as it relates to the issue of voluntariness and not whether the evidence would establish discrimination or reprisal under the standard of Title VII<span class="Italic">. Markon,</span> 71 MSPR at 578. Thus, evidence of discrimination or EEO retaliation goes to the ultimate question of coercion--"'whether under all of the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign [or retire].'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. On remand, the administrative judge should consider the appellant's allegations of mistreatment to determine whether, under the particular circumstances, a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign and should consider the appellant's allegations of disability discrimination as a factor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A resignation alleged to be involuntary based on a denial of accommodation requires evaluation of all related circumstances despite the lapse of time between the accommodation request and the date of the resignation, <span class="italic">Valenzuela v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-22-0039-I-1 (NP 2/3/2023) (remanding following dismissal of the appeal):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The denial of a reasonable accommodation that would have permitted an employee to continue working despite her medical conditions, and that leads to the employee's resignation, is a wrongful action that can be the basis of an alleged involuntary resignation claim. <span class="italic">Hosozawa v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6-7 (2010) (finding that an appellant nonfrivolously alleged that her retirement was involuntary when she alleged that the agency denied her request for a reasonable accommodation that would have permitted her to continue to work full-time despite her medical conditions). Here, the appellant asserts that her resignation was involuntary because the agency denied her September 2020 request for accommodation that, according to her doctors, would have permitted her to continue to work despite her various health issues, and without which her health further worsened, causing her to develop left arm neuropathy in April 2021.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize the passage of time between the denial of the reasonable accommodation request and the appellant's resignation, but, at this stage of the proceedings, do not find it significant. First, according to the appellant, her health condition deteriorated because of the agency's September 2020 reasonable accommodation decision, and the fact that she worked under the accommodation imposed by the agency for several months does not mean that the agency's failure was not the cause of the appellant's resignation. Second, the Federal Circuit has held that at the jurisdictional stage of a Board proceeding, the Board should not discount the probative value of an allegation that supports a claim <span id="Page_1976"></span>of involuntariness because of the passage of time. <span class="italic">Trinkl v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 727 F. App'x 1007, 1010-11 (Fed. Cir. 2018).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Alleged harassment, disability discrimination, and undesirable shift assignments causing emotional distress warranted a hearing on an involuntary resignation claim, <span class="Italic">Swift v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 29, 32-33 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has found that where an employee's working conditions are rendered so intolerable by alleged discrimination or harassment that he is "forced" into resignation, there has been a constructive discharge, and the employee's resignation is involuntary.<span class="Italic"> See Burke v. Department of Treasury,</span> 53 MSPR 434, 438 (1992); <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, 32 MSPR at 247. The ultimate question to be decided in this regard is whether working conditions were so difficult that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">See Collins v. Argonne National Laboratory</span>, 757 F. Supp. 934, 937 (N.D. Ill. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant was diagnosed as suffering from depression with anxiety, aggravated by stress on the job, as well as from a nervous disorder called Dysthymic Disorder. Dysthymia is a medical term used to describe mental disorders, including depression. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1 J.E. Schmidt, M.D., <span class="Italic">Attorneys' Dictionary of Medicine and Word Finder</span> D-144 (1986). In his letter of resignation, the appellant stated that "I have been harassed, lied on <span class="small">[sic]</span> and ridiculed. My health is declining due to these depressive conditions." In response to the administrative judge's jurisdictional order, the appellant specified particular acts of alleged harassment, including his purposeful assignment to a graveyard shift, despite requests from his physicians that he be changed to a day shift. Although the appellant stated that his shift was finally changed years later as part of a grievance settlement, the appellant also alleged that he was assigned to a work area "designed to intimidate injured employees to resign or return to their original craft position," and that his supervisor again refused medical requests that he be reassigned to a less stressful situation, in light of his psychiatric problems. The appellant also submitted a letter from William R. Gardner, M.D., one of his attending physicians, who stated that "[i]n my opinion [the appellant's] symptoms were directly caused by the conditions at his working area. After it was not possible to correct the conditions of employment, I recommended that he resign. He is able to work, but not in a stressful position." Richard D. Yentis, M.D., another of the appellant's physicians, stated that the appellant was physically able to tolerate the working conditions, but that his mental condition was aggravated by the harassment he was receiving from his supervisor, leading to his resignation. Yentis concluded that the appellant's mental condition would improve with a change in supervisors and working conditions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that appellant's contentions, coupled with his supporting medical evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the appellant, are sufficient to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness, and that he was therefore entitled to hearing on that issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, 32 MSPR at 247 (appellant's allegations of agency's humiliating, arbitrary, and willful conduct cast sufficient doubt upon the presumption of voluntariness of retirement to require hearing, where requested); <span class="Italic">Jovanovich v. Veterans Administration</span>, 3 MSPB 510, 3 MSPR 438, 440 (1980) (appellant was entitled to requested hearing on voluntariness where allegations of harassment by supervisory personnel and language of resignation indicating appellant was being forced to resign, raised issues of fact which could not be labeled as frivolous).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">An agency's failure to provide a light duty assignment, albeit unjustified, did not--despite complications arising in the appellant's life resulting from the agency's action--constitute intolerable working conditions sufficient to support an involuntary resignation claim when the appellant could have opposed the agency's treatment of him through the use of a contract grievance procedure or through protests to higher levels of agency management, <span class="Italic">Baker v. USPS</span>, 84 MSPR 119, 127-30 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-23 (1999) (following remand from 71 MSPR 680 (1996)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A resignation is involuntary if, due to a violation of law that directly affected an employee's rights, a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign<span class="Italic">. Baker,</span> 71 MSPR at 695. The issue of voluntariness rests on whether the totality of the circumstances supports the conclusion that the employee was effectively deprived of free choice in the matter, and application of this test must be gauged by an objective standard rather than by the employee's purely subjective evaluation. <span class="Italic">McCray v. Department of the Navy,</span> 80 MSPR 154 &#x00B6; 8 (1998). The relevant issue is whether a reasonable person with the employee's specific physical or mental condition would have felt forced to resign. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Henriksen v. Department of Energy,</span> 79 MSPR 213 &#x00B6; 12 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to his August 1990 request for permanent light duty, the appellant testified that he would call Sue Kennaugh, the agency manager who was in charge of permanent light-duty requests, to ask about the status of his request and she told him at one time that she had not received his request. He testified that Kennaugh told him that she had misplaced his request during an office move so he personally took the relevant documents to her in July or August 1990. The appellant also claimed that the agency did not communicate a light-duty offer to him in response to that request. <span class="Italic">Baker,</span> 71 MSPR at 692 (the Board found that this issue did not need to be addressed because the agency had no work available within the appellant's August 1990 restrictions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also testified as follows: The agency did not respond to his January 1991 request for permanent light duty, he tried to call Kennaugh but did not get a concrete response; and, in July 1991, the agency sent him a letter informing him that he had been on leave without pay for 1 year and that be would be taken off the rolls for health and life insurance; "everything got dark and I had no recourse. I could only think about the money"; his family was "going down the drain" financially, mentally, and physically, and the only place he knew to get money besides "sticking a gun in somebody's face" was to get his retirement contributions; he had already tried to get disability retirement, was told by the agency's retirement section that he wasn't eligible for disability retirement, and therefore did not follow through with that but decided to resign because after 13 months he "just lost confidence" and did not know what was going on.... He further testified that he was under duress at the time because he had put his faith in the agency to find him a permanent light-duty job, but the system failed and there was nothing he could do; as a former reservist, he received disability retirement benefits from the Army beginning in October 1990; he started having thoughts about hurting people, he sought treatment for depression in April 1991, and he was still receiving treatment as of the July 25, 1994 initial hearing....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record includes a May 10, 1994 letter from the appellant's clinical psychologist and psychiatrist indicating that the appellant was being treated for his service-connected disability with a combination of psychotherapy and medication, the treatment began in April 1991, and the appellant has had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with depression since his tour of duty in Vietnam. The letter indicates that the appellant was first seen in April 1991, when he was evaluated as reacting to the additional stress of being terminated from his job which created additional marital and financial stress, lack of confidence in his ability to support his family, and less ability to handle emotional outbursts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the appellant testified that he resigned after the agency notified him in June 1991 that his health benefits were being terminated, he had no work and no job, taking away his health benefits was the "last straw," "nobody was doing anything," he needed money desperately, he resigned in order to get his retirement money which totaled nine or ten thousand dollars, he assumed the system would do what it was supposed to do, he was coerced into resigning because of the money issue, the agency withheld a job from him, and he had nowhere to go and nowhere to appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On cross-examination, the appellant testified that he was aware that other employees who faced disciplinary action or light-duty problems had filed appeals involving claims of disability discrimination; he talked to a union official over lunch and was told that the agency would probably find him a light-duty job; he contacted a union representative after he resigned but did not hear back from the representative; he did not go to his union when he was having problems getting light-duty work because he "was following the procedure" and was not required to go to his union which was very weak at that time and grievances could take six months to get resolved. Finally, the appellant testified that "I didn't want to raise a lot of waves because I've seen people who make waves get no results or get ostracized for them. So, you know, I was playing the game by the rules."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, when asked by the administrative judge why he did not "make waves" when he got no response to his second request for permanent light duty, the appellant testified that he did not know about the Board, he talked to Kennaugh and she said she was working on it, he went to her several times, his union was not strong and had lost many cases, and he didn't know he could grieve such matters. The appellant admitted that he had previously filed a grievance alleging that Mail Clerks were taking Mailhandler positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1977"></span>Under the totality of the circumstances, we find that the appellant has not shown by preponderant evidence that a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign. While we recognize that the appellant was under stress and felt that he had no choice but to resign, his medical evidence does not indicate the extent of his PTSD and depression, nor does it indicate that his decision-making abilities were impaired. The appellant took no reasonable steps, such as filing a grievance or even contacting a management official other than Kennaugh, to ascertain why there had been no response to his request for permanent light duty, which we find a reasonable person in the appellant's position would have done. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bates v. Department of Justice,</span> 70 MSPR 659, 670-72 (1996) (finding that the employee was coerced into resigning by a continuous and unredressed pattern of harassment, which had escalated to a level potentially endangering her safety; although the appellant complained repeatedly about the harassment, the agency's efforts were belated, half-hearted, and ineffective); <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Services Administration,</span> 68 MSPR 513, 522-23 (1995) (finding an involuntary resignation where, among other things, the appellant's formal complaint of whistleblowing and many grievances were either ignored or investigated in an unfair and meaningless manner).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that he was aware of other options, such as filing a grievance or discrimination complaint, yet provided no persuasive explanation as to why he did not follow such a course of action, especially after allegedly having similar problems with his August 1990 request. That the appellant did not feel that filing a grievance or taking other action would be successful does not excuse his failure to act. <span class="Italic">Cf., e.g., Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 MSPR 604, 608 (1995) (discouragement at the likely outcome of a petition for review does not establish good cause for a delay in filing such a petition). His desire to avoid protracted grievance procedures and avoid financial hardship does not establish that his choice to resign was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Castro v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 51 MSPR 530, 534 (1991). Thus, the appellant has not shown that he was effectively deprived of free choice in the matter, and his appeal of his alleged involuntary resignation must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Subjective fears did not establish that a resignation was involuntary after an agency reassigned a disabled employee to different positions to locate a suitable permanent position. The employee resigned, fearing that the agency would dump him into a bad job. The resignation was not coerced: the employee did not have a right to the job of his choice; the fears were subjective and not based on agency misconduct, <span class="Italic">Hall v. Dept. of Army</span>, 20 MSPR 328, 330, 332-33 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that appellant developed an allergy (hypersensitivity) to the ammonia used in his job as Photostat Diazo Operator due to an overexposure to ammonia fumes caused by improper ventilation at appellant's work area. Pursuant to the agency's doctor's instructions, appellant was removed from his work area and detailed to various other positions in the agency during the six months preceding his resignation. His last detail was to a position which appellant believed was less desirable, involved no technical skills and was under the supervision of an agency employee who appellant alleged had improperly attempted to pressure him into applying for the position on a permanent basis. Appellant alleges that the agency's actions in failing to place or train him for a permanent position requiring technical skills, detailing him to a less desirable position, and placing him on AWOL in effect coerced him into resigning. Appellant's position is not persuasive, particularly in light of the undisputed testimony of the agency's personnel officer that appellant was advised at the time of his resignation that the agency was still attempting to find a permanent position and encouraged him to withdraw his resignation. Appellant's subjective fears that the agency would have placed him permanently in the allegedly undesirable position he was being detailed into are not probative and are premised on his erroneous assumption that the agency was obligated to offer him the reassignment of his choice. This Board has previously rejected appellant's assertion that an agency must attempt to accommodate an employee in the manner the employee desires. <span class="Italic">Hyatt v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 8 MSPB 56 (1981); <span class="Italic">Springer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 7 MSPB 63 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant asserts that resignation was involuntary for lack of accommodation, there should be some evidence that an accommodation request was made. <span class="Italic">Delorito v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-0752-13-0517-I-1 (NP 9/12/2013) ("He did not, for example, request an accommodation based on his medical condition, nor did he seek relief for alleged disability discrimination through the equal employment opportunity process. He did not seek relief by grieving the agency's action (if that avenue was open to him). There is no evidence that the agency was proposing or effecting an adverse action because of his failure to work a particular schedule, but, had that been the case, the appellant could have exercised appeal rights once the agency acted. The record instead shows that the appellant did nothing more than make an initial oral request to a supervisor. He thus failed to allege nonfrivolously that a reasonable person in his position would have had no alternative but to resign."); <span class="Italic">Peasley v. SBA</span>, DC-0752-15-0305-I-1 (NP 10/23/2015) (remand: "Here, the appellant alleged that the agency singled him out to change his tour of duty, despite requests for accommodation, exacerbating a preexisting medical condition. He also submitted a letter from his treating physician, which describes a deteriorating medical condition and suggests that it may be due to his work situation.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Medical conditions do not necessarily make a resignation coercive. An employee who complained at the hearing of a medical condition previously unknown to the agency was not harassed into resigning as a result of a failure by the agency to reassign the employee. <span class="Italic">Spiegel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 6 MSPR 31, 34, 6 MSPB 40 (1981). At issue are the conditions leading to the resignation. Although evidence of the failure of the agency to accommodate a disability is probative as to a resignation alleged to be involuntary, evidence of the appellant's medical conditions after his resignation is not relevant to voluntariness. <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 412, 417-19 (1997).
