<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-159"><span class="space">a.</span> Jurisdictional Analysis</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ferby v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 451, 455-57 (1985), analyzed the jurisdictional effect of an LCA. The appellant was removed and entered into a negotiated agreement for abeyance of the removal and return to work in consideration of an agreement to serve a new probationary period and waiver of an appeal right to the Board during that probationary period. An LCA is valid, according to <span class="Italic">Ferby</span>, if the agreement is "comprehensive, freely made, and fair, and...[is not] the result of duress or bad faith negotiation on the agency's part." Assuming the validity of the agreement, the Board considers whether the charged conduct falls within the gamut of prohibited behavior and whether the agency's implementation of the agreement is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of agency discretion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As correctly noted by the presiding official, while the Board has not previously considered the issue of waiver of an appellant's statutory appeal rights, it has addressed the waiver of the right to a hearing as part of those appeal rights and has concluded that it may be effectively waived if such action constituted the informed, intentional relinquishment of a known right. In <span class="Italic">Christian v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPB 395, 3 MSPR 310 (1980), the Board adopted the Supreme Court's definition of waiver as set forth in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Zerbst</span>, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 146 (1958). In that case, the Supreme Court held that even the constitutional Sixth Amendment right to counsel in a criminal proceeding was susceptible to waiver if such action was the informed, intentional abandonment of a known right, free of any coercion or duress<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Overmyer v. Frick Company</span>, 405 U.S. 174, 92 S. Ct. 775, 31 L. Ed.2d 124 (1972) (the Supreme Court noted that due process rights involving personal liberties in criminal matters, as well as property interests in civil matters, may be waived if voluntarily and knowingly done).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of this standard governing the waiver not only of an appellant's right to a hearing before the Board in a Federal employment matter, but also of fundamental, constitutionally-based procedural rights in civil and criminal matters, we find no error in the presiding official's conclusion that the appellants in the instant cases knowingly and intentionally waived their right to appeal to the Board the reinstatement of the suspended removal penalties against them. The terms of the waiver in the last-chance agreements appear comprehensive, freely made, and fair, and there is no evidence in the record, or presented by the appellants with their petitions for review, that the execution of those agreements was in any way the result of duress or bad faith negotiation on the agency's part. Further, the record reveals that the appellants were represented at all relevant times and that the agreements were thoroughly negotiated by the parties and were the subject of mutual consideration. Having ascertained that the parties entered into the last-chance settlement agreements free of coercion, and that the agreements were entered and accepted into the record below, the Board finds that we have the authority to enforce those agreements and we do so here....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both appellants assert in their petitions for review that, while they agreed to abandon any appeal of the initial charges underlying the removal actions, they never intended to waive the right to a hearing regarding subsequent allegations of misconduct. We note that appellant Jackson admitted at his Board hearing that he was given a forum in which to present to appropriate agency officials his side of that subsequent misconduct. We note further that the record contains significant sworn testimonial evidence of appellant Jackson's subsequent misconduct which triggered the agency's reinstatement of the removal. We note also that appellant Ferby does not deny the subsequent charge which led to the reinstatement of his removal penalty. Further, we find that the appellants' subsequent misconduct--respectively, assaulting a supervisor and intoxication on the workroom floor--disrupted the performance of their duties, had a direct adverse impact on the efficiency of the workplace and, thus, clearly fell within the gamut of prohibited behavior contemplated by the parties in negotiating the settlement agreements. We thus conclude that the conduct with which the appellants were charged was properly considered to be violative of the settlement agreements and that their implementation has not been shown by the appellants to have been arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of the agency's discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, and more important, it is the challenge of precisely these matters that the appellants clearly relinquished by voluntarily acceding to the terms of the last chance agreements. It is clear from the "four corners" of these agreements, quoted above, that the appellants waived their right to challenge, by appeal to the Board, not only the original removal actions but also any subsequent disciplinary actions taken against them by the agency during the agreed-upon probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants also contend in their petitions that the subsequent incidents of misconduct were "blown out of proportion by the agency and that [they have] been subjected to an excessive and unfair penalty as a result." We infer that by this the appellants mean to argue that removal is an excessively severe penalty, under the circumstances, for the instances of assault and intoxication which triggered reinstatement of the suspended removal sanctions. We need not decide that question directly, however, for we note that the original removal actions had been found warranted and were effected by the agency solely upon charges of excessive absence without leave. The "sanction" for the appellants' subsequent transgressions was not removal <span class="Italic">per se</span>, but rather reinstatement of a conditionally suspended removal penalty levied for previous misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant Ferby contends, in a related argument, that the agency disparately treated him by imposing a removal sanction for assault but levying lesser sanctions on others charged with similar conduct. As noted above, however, the penalty imposed against Mr. Ferby for assault in this case was reinstatement of a previously suspended removal for other reasons, and not removal for more recent misconduct. Both appellants also submit documentation purporting to show the agency's disparate treatment of them in relation to other employees who had entered into similar settlement agreements. As discussed above, the appellants surrendered their right to challenge such matters by voluntarily agreeing to the terms of their settlement agreements.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">For the Board to have jurisdiction related to a last chance agreement, assuming nonfrivolous allegations of its breach, either the agreement must have been accepted by the Board for enforcement in the course of an appeal within the Board's jurisdiction (allowing the Board authority to review a claimed breach under its enforcement procedures), or the action taken under the agreement must be within the Board's jurisdiction. If neither condition is met, the Board lacks the authority to enforce the agreement or remedy its breach, <span class="Italic">Lumpkins v. VA</span>, AT-0752-13-0297-C-1 (NP 9/16/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed this petition for enforcement, alleging that the agency breached a last chance settlement agreement (LCSA) by assigning him to the wrong position under the agreement and by failing to provide him with appropriate orientation and training for that position. Initially, the agency had proposed the appellant's removal but, pursuant to the LCSA, reassigned him to a lower-graded position. The agreement, however, was executed prior to the filing of any Board appeal and thus was not entered into the record for enforcement purposes. Soon thereafter, the appellant sought to vacate the LCSA through the Board's appeal process, arguing that he entered into the agreement under duress. The administrative judge found that he had voluntarily entered into the LCSA and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. On review, the Board affirmed the initial decision. The appellant now seeks to enforce the LCSA. The administrative judge dismissed this petition for enforcement based on lack of jurisdiction because he found that the appellant had never established the Board's jurisdiction over the underlying appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reviewed the appellant's arguments. The administrative judge, however, properly dismissed this petition for lack of jurisdiction. The administrative judge explained that the appellant offered no evidence and argument addressing the jurisdictional issue in response to his order to show cause, and that the Board may enforce a settlement agreement only when that agreement has been entered into the record for enforcement purposes. CID at 2 (citing <span class="Italic">Chapman v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 246, 249 (1995)). In addition, this petition for enforcement arose after the Board declined to find jurisdiction over the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">Lumpkins II</span> at 8. As a result, the only proper action the administrative judge could have taken was to dismiss the petition for enforcement for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hunt v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 590, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2010). Accordingly, we affirm the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Tackett v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 624, 628 &#x00B6; 8 (1999), summarized <span class="Italic">Ferby</span> and emphasized that the Board's role is to determine whether the appellant breached the agreement, not whether the misconduct warrants removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Our role is not to interpret the language of the LCSA in a way that modifies the agreement's material terms, but rather it is to determine whether the alleged breaches occurred, considering the facts and circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Womack v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 63 MSPR 213, 216, <span class="Italic">dismissed,</span> 36 F.3d 1111 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). We also note that in a case like this, when determining whether an appellant has breached a LCSA, it is not the Board's responsibility to determine whether the breaching misconduct warrants removal. When a removal is "suspended," as it was by the LCSA here, and then the appellant commits a breach of the LCSA, the "suspended" removal is "reinstated." The penalty of removal then is a product of the former misconduct. Once a determination that a breach has occurred is made, the issue of the reasonableness of the removal is a matter not before us in operation of the waiver provision of the LCSA. <span class="Italic">See Ferby v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 26 MSPR 451, 457 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reemphasizing the comprehensive nature of the waiver involved in an LCA, <span class="Italic">Martin v. DOD</span>, 70 MSPR 653, 656-57 (1996), explained that the Board's jurisdiction does not embrace an independent penalty analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee may waive her right of appeal to the Board by freely agreeing to do so. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. USPS</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">McCall v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 666-69 (Fed. Cir. 1988). A waiver may eliminate the employee's right to appeal any aspect of the underlying removal, including both the factual basis and the legal validity of the proposed removal action<span class="Italic">. See Stewart</span>, 926 F.2d at 1148 n.*. The agreement "predicates the reimposition of removal and concomitant waiver of appeal rights on breach of one or more of the stipulations that the agreement contains." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 1148. It is the Board's responsibility to determine whether these preconditions for enforcement have been met<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. If they are, and the agreement is enforceable, then the Board is without jurisdiction to hear the appeal. <span class="Italic">See McCall</span>, 839 F.2d at 668-69. As the party seeking to appeal a removal following a last-chance agreement, the appellant bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, to establish that the agency breached it either by acting in bad faith or materially failing to comply with its provisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Link v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant first argues on petition for review that waiver of the right to file an appeal based on discrimination is void as contrary to public policy. The case law cited above is clear, however, that this is not true with respect to a general waiver of appeal rights. Moreover, our reviewing court has found that the possible non-enforceability of an agreement's waiver of discrimination appeal rights to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) does not affect the validity of the waiver of appeal rights to the Board. <span class="Italic">Briscoe v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 55 F.3d 1571, 1572 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Appellant did not dispute below, and does not do so on review, the misconduct that led to the imposition of the removal or the agency's allegation that by so conducting herself, she breached the agreement. Her claims that the agency acted in bad faith when it removed her because removal constitutes an excessive penalty since her actions were caused by learning that her former husband was terminally ill, and that it was this circumstance that caused her to relapse while otherwise making good progress in rehabilitation, we find, go to the substance of her appeal rather than the enforceability of the agreement's appeal rights waiver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the contention that through the settlement the agency improperly predetermined the penalty provides no basis for setting aside the agreement. Any last-chance settlement agreement with a waiver of appeal rights necessarily precludes the Board's review of procedural issues such as notice and opportunity to reply, and does not allow for an independent penalty analysis. That outcome, though, is the result of bargaining between the parties in which the appellant agrees to give up her appeal rights in return for another opportunity to succeed. She voluntarily waived those rights rather than take her chances that the first proposed removal would be sustained in an appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 321 Fed. Appx. 925 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) ("under the last chance agreement, the Department was not required to give Mr. Jones any additional warnings that he was engaging in misconduct").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an adverse action decision is held in abeyance for the duration of an LCA and if the removal is imposed upon the appellant's breach of the agreement, on appeal the Board does not reach the validity of the underlying removal unless the appellant first demonstrates that he did not violate the LCA or that the agency violated the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boone v. VA,</span> DC-0752-10-0375-I-1 (NP 11/18/2010) ("Board lacks jurisdiction to reach the issue because the appellant voluntarily waived his adverse action appeal rights rather than contest the removal in abeyance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bland v. Department of the Navy</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 388, 391-92 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 107 F.3d 30 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table)."). Analysis of a preappeal LCA is provided by <span class="Italic">Covington v. Dept. of Army</span>, 85 MSPR 612, 618-24 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-20 (2000). The appellant and the agency entered into a settlement agreement calling for the agency to cancel a proposed removal in exchange for appellant's acceptance of a 14-day suspension with a stipulation that if the appellant was AWOL within a year of the settlement, she would either resign or be removed and that any right to a Board appeal from the resignation or removal would be waived. The appellant also waived any appeal from or grievance concerning the 14-day suspension. Within the year following the settlement, the agency fired the appellant for a few hours of AWOL that the appellant asserted should not have been charged against her because of the protections of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. The Board determined that the appellant was entitled to be heard as to the FMLA claim. If she prevailed on that claim, the agency could not rely on the waiver of appellant's appeal rights. If she did not prevail on the FMLA claim, it was implied that the Board would be divested of jurisdiction by the waiver provision of the LCA. If the FMLA claim was valid, the AJ would consider the removal based upon the agency's charges and mitigating factors:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question remains whether the agency may invoke the parties' April 28, 1999 settlement agreement to assert that the appellant waived her right of appeal to the Board of this subsequent removal action for AWOL. The existence of Board jurisdiction is a threshold issue in adjudicating an appeal, and the appellant bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] ; <span class="Italic">Williams v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 64 MSPR 436, 438 (1994). The issue of Board jurisdiction is always before the Board and may be raised by either party or <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by the Board at any time during a Board proceeding. <span class="Italic">E.g., Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 85 MSPR 1 &#x00B6; 14 (1999); <span class="Italic">Engler v. Department of the Navy,</span> 69 MSPR 109, 114 (1995). Further, an agency's provision in a decision of notice to an appellant of a right to appeal the action to the Board, such as in the agency's September 23, 1999 removal decision notice here, does not serve to confer jurisdiction on the Board where it does not otherwise exist. <span class="Italic">E.g., Hunter v. Department of Justice,</span> 73 MSPR 290, 294 (1997); <span class="Italic">Miles-Townsend v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 37 MSPR 405, 407 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the Board has the authority to consider a settlement agreement that the parties entered into in proceedings not before the <span id="Page_1121"></span>Board, such as the April 28, 1999 settlement agreement in this case, so as to determine its effect on a personnel action before the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sullivan v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 79 MSPR 81, 84 (1998) (settlement of an EEOC complaint); <span class="Italic">Laity v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 61 MSPR 256, 261 (1994) (settlement of a grievance). Thus, we find that the agency may invoke the parties' settlement agreement, in which the agency claims the appellant waived her right of appeal to the Board of a subsequent removal action for AWOL within 1 year from the date of the agreement, to assert that the settlement agreement divests the Board of jurisdiction over this appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson,</span> 85 MSPR 1 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 13-14; <span class="Italic">Laube v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 70 MSPR 643, 644, 646 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next issue is whether the April 28, 1999 settlement agreement waives the appellant's appeal right to the Board in this case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lockridge,</span> 72 MSPR at 619. A settlement agreement, such as the agreement here, is a contract, and the interpretation of its terms is a question of law. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army,</span> 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Mobley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 55 MSPR 467, 474 (1992). It is well settled that a waiver of the statutory right of appeal to the Board must be clear, unequivocal, and decisive. <span class="Italic">E.g., Smith v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 78 MSPR 594, 597 (1998). However, the Board has long held that an appellant's waiver of appeal rights in a settlement agreement is enforceable and not against public policy if the terms of the waiver are comprehensive, freely made, and fair, and the execution of the waiver was not the result of duress or bad faith on the part of the agency. <span class="Italic">McCall v. U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service,</span> 839 F.2d 664, 666-67 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Merriweather v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of</span> Transportation, 59 MSPR 434, 437 (1993). Implicit in such an agreement is a requirement that the agency abide by it in good faith. <span class="Italic">See McCall,</span> 839 F.2d at 667-68. A waiver of appeal rights that meets these criteria divests the Board of jurisdiction over an appeal. <span class="Italic">McCall</span>, 839 F.2d at 669; <span class="Italic">Laube</span>, 70 MSPR at 646; <span class="Italic">Merriweather,</span> 59 MSPR at 437-38.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To show that a waiver of appeal rights in a settlement agreement is unenforceable, an appellant must show that: He complied with the agreement, but the agency breached it; he did not voluntarily enter into the agreement; or the agreement was the result of fraud or mutual mistake<span class="Italic">. See Link v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 51 F.3d 1577, 1582-83 (Fed.

Department of the Air Force,</span> 80 MSPR 306 &#x00B6; 10 (1998). Where an appellant raises a nonfrivolous factual issue of compliance with such a settlement agreement, the Board must resolve that issue before addressing the scope and applicability of a waiver of appeal rights in the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Stewart v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 926 F.2d 1146, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 85 MSPR 1 &#x00B6; 16; <span class="Italic">Tackett v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Air Force,</span> 80 MSPR 624 &#x00B6; 6 (1999)....&#8197;As the administrative judge found, in a LCSA case the agency has the burden of proof to show that it did not interfere with an appellant's FMLA rights in taking its action. <span class="Italic">Gardner v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 MSPR 9, 13-15 (1998); <span class="Italic">see also Landahl v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the FMLA, an "eligible" employee of a covered employer is entitled to unpaid leave, or paid leave, if earned, for a period of 12 weeks in any 12-month period, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, in order to care for the parent of the employee if the parent has a serious medical condition. 5 USC &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1)(C). A "serious health condition" is defined as "an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves...continuing treatment by a health care provider." 5 USC &#x00A7; 6381(5); <span class="Italic">Landahl</span>, 83 MSPR 40 &#x00B6; 8. An employee is not required to explicitly invoke the FMLA in requesting covered leave. <span class="Italic">Landahl</span>, 83 MSPR 40, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v.

It is sufficient that the employee make the agency aware of circumstances that would warrant leave under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">Landahl</span>, 83 MSPR 40 &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the agency asserts that the appellant was AWOL for 5 hours on July 26, 1999, since she did not appear at work for the rest of the day after using her 3 hours of approved sick leave or contact her second-level supervisor, Terry, to request additional leave in accordance with established leave approval procedures, and that the agency was thereby entitled to remove the appellant and invoke the asserted waiver of her Board appeal right under the agreement. However, the appellant asserts that: "[C]onsistent with the [FMLA]," she "made several earnest attempts to contact her job, without success" during the time period she was on approved sick leave on July 26, 1999, to request additional leave to transport her mother to a medical appointment and remain with her "[a]fter learning that [her] mother was going to have X-rays done"; the agency's management was previously aware of her mother's illnesses; after the appellant had been unsuccessful in attempting to contact Terry, her daughter "repeatedly attempted contact, eventually speaking with a female [employee], who stated she would relay the message"; and the "[a]ppellant went about taking care of her mother, later verifying her daughters [sic] success." In reply to her proposed removal, the appellant submitted written statements from her daughter attesting to her unsuccessful attempts to contact Terry telephonically on July 26, 1999, to request additional leave for the appellant, and from a co-worker's daughter, Captain Dana Johnson, attesting to similar difficulties in reaching the Central Issue Facility telephonically due to the numerous business call it receives. The appellant also submitted a July 26, 1999 "Certificate of Excuse and Treatment" signed by Glenn A. Duncan, M.D., certifying that Princella Boswell (the appellant's mother) was seen in his office on that date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant at this stage of her appeal is not required to prove the jurisdictional threshold issue that the agency has breached the settlement agreement; she need only nonfrivolously allege it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stewart,</span> 926 F.2d at 1148-49; <span class="Italic">Gutierrez v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 MSPR 564, 568 (1997). We find that the appellant's allegations, if proven, may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that she was not AWOL and that the agency breached the settlement agreement by charging her with 5 hours' AWOL on July 26, 1999, and removing her, when the agency knew or should have known that she was requesting leave under the FMLA for that time period and that she was entitled to such leave. <span class="Italic">See Landahl</span>, 83 MSPR 40 &#x00B6; 11. The agency has the burden of proof to show that it did not interfere with the appellant's FMLA rights in taking its action. <span class="Italic">See Gardner</span>, 79 MSPR at 13-15. We find, therefore, that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency has breached the parties' April 28, 1999 settlement agreement by charging her with 5 hours of AWOL on July 26, 1999, and removing her, requiring a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Stewart</span>, 926 F.2d at 1148-49; <span class="Italic">Gutierrez</span>, 73 MSPR at 568.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the administrative judge determines that the agency's AWOL charge was proper under the settlement agreement, she must then address the scope and applicability of the asserted waiver of appeal rights in the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Stewart,</span> 926 F.2d at 1148; <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> 85 MSPR 1 &#x00B6; 16; <span class="Italic">Tackett</span>, 80 MSPR 624 &#x00B6; 6.

<p class="Block-Quote1">If the administrative judge finds that the agency has breached the settlement agreement, or that the agreement does not constitute a valid waiver of the appellant's right of appeal to the Board in this case, she shall find that this appeal of the agency's new removal action is within the Board's jurisdiction and adjudicate the appeal on the merits<span class="Italic">.

In the event that the administrative judge reaches the issue of the penalty, she shall treat the agency's allegations regarding the settlement agreement in the penalty section of the proposed removal notice as an aggravating factor on which the agency relied in selecting the penalty. It is not appropriate to treat this factor as the determinative factor, however, because the agency did not state or suggest that this was the sole or determinative factor; in fact, the agency described another aggravating factor (the appellant's past disciplinary record) in the penalty section of the proposal notice. <span class="Italic">See <span id="Page_1122"></span>Douglas,</span> 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR at 304 (the agency's advance notice of the charges should include factors on which the agency intends to rely for imposition of an enhanced penalty so that the employee will have a fair opportunity to respond to those factors).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board does not have jurisdiction over an action taken pursuant to an LCA in which an appellant waives his right to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Rosell v.

To establish that a waiver of appeal rights in an LCA is unenforceable, an appellant must establish that (1) he complied with the agreement, (2) the agency breached it, (3) he did not voluntarily enter into the agreement, or (4) the agreement was the product of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Rosell</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">see also Link v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The LCA provided that the appellant waived any right to appeal to the Board if he were removed as a result of his breach of the agreement. It also provided that the appellant would serve a 14-day suspension, and that his removal for improper conduct toward his supervisor would be held in abeyance for 2 years, during which time the appellant would "maintain reasonable and satisfactory punctuality, attendance, appropriate conduct, work performance and good work habits acceptable to management." The LCA stated that "one substantiated allegation of significant misconduct or significant violation of Agency rules will be sufficient to establish that he has breached this agreement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was removed for an unscheduled absence on August 3, 2008, because the agency concluded he took an unauthorized break on that date. The appellant asserts that, as the only supervisor on duty, he had authority to take the break when he did. The record, however, does not contain evidence regarding the rules governing the appellant's breaks. Accordingly, we find that the appeal must be remanded for further proceedings.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board lacks jurisdiction over an action taken pursuant to a LCA in which an appellant waives his right to appeal to the Board. To establish that a waiver of appeal rights in a LCA should not be enforced, an appellant must show one of the following: (1) He complied with the LCA; (2) the agency materially breached the LCA or acted in bad faith; (3) he did not voluntarily enter into the agreement; or (4) the LCA resulted from fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Rhett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 178, &#x00B6; 13 (2010). An appellant is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing if he raises a nonfrivolous factual issue of compliance with the LCA. Nonfrivolous allegations are allegations of fact which, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994). The dissent disagrees with the Board's decision to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, asserting that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction in his pleadings. We find, though, that the undisputed evidence establishes the appellant breached the LCA in several different ways. He is therefore not entitled to a hearing and his appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee signs a last chance agreement waiving future appeal rights to the Board, the Board lacks jurisdiction over further appeals unless the employee can show non-frivolous allegations that he did not violate the agreement, or that the agreement is unenforceable because the agency acted in bad faith or the employee's actions were not voluntary. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. USPS</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1148-49 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">McCall v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 667-68 (Fed. Cir. 1988)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Gibson v. VA</span>, 160 F.3d 722, 727-31 (Fed. Cir. 1998), Judge Plager discussed the relation between Board jurisdiction and appeals from actions ostensibly blocked by LCAs:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A last chance agreement typically arises when an agency threatens or takes an adverse action (often discharge--statutorily referred to as "removal") against an employee for some misconduct. The employee has the right to appeal an adverse action to the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB" or "Board"); the claimed grounds justifying an appeal may be simply a denial of the misconduct, or they may involve some other defenses such as retaliation for whistle-blowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sometimes before the employee is discharged, sometimes after the discharge and in the course of an appeal to the Board, the parties settle their differences by entering the last chance agreement. If the case is one in which the agreement is entered into prior to an actual discharge, such as the case here, the agency will agree to hold in abeyance the discharge on the grounds alleged, on the condition that the employee straightens up and flies right (often for a limited period of time). The employee agrees to do so, and agrees that, if the employee fails (i.e., again misbehaves), the employee may be immediately terminated with no appeal rights (i.e., waives any right to appeal). If the agreement arises during the appeal process, the agency agrees to reinstate the employee (on the same condition of good behavior), and the employee similarly agrees to accept termination without appeal rights in the event of a lapse of behavior.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There appears to be no standard form or text for these last chance agreements--each agency deals with its problems on an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> basis--though the language in which the waiver provision is cast tends to be a simple, broad statement to the effect that the employee waives any right of appeal. There are several ways such waiver provisions could be understood.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One way is that, if the agency determines in its discretion that the employee has engaged in a subsequent act of misconduct (as defined by the agreement), and thus breached the agreement, the employee is out, and there is no review of the agency decision by the MSPB. This result could be rationalized by treating the eventual discharge as exclusively the consequence of a breach of an agreement, in essence a breach of the last chance employment contract, and thus not an adverse action over which the MSPB has jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701(a), 7513(d), 7512 (1994). (Whether the employee could obtain direct review, in a court of competent jurisdiction, of the discharge on the ground that the alleged breach of the contract did not occur, and thus the discharge is a breach of contract by the Government, is a question which to my knowledge has not been addressed.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A variant on this analysis is to treat the eventual discharge as an adverse action as well as a breach of the last chance agreement, and treat the employee's waiver as applying to both aspects of the case, that is, as a waiver of MSPB review as to both the initial charges and the <span id="Page_1123"></span>subsequent alleged breach of the employment contract. Under this variant the employee would be conclusively barred from challenging the Government's action before the MSPB. In effect, the employee is unable to state a claim for which the MSPB could grant relief. <span class="Italic">See Link v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1584 (Plager, J., concurring).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the Board nor this court has understood last chance agreements in either of these ways. Instead, the waiver is deemed to apply "only to the facts underlying and the legal validity of the original [threatened or carried out] removal." <span class="Italic">Stewart v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1149 n.* (Fed. Cir. 1991). Despite the generally unqualified language in these last chance agreements that the employee waives appeal rights to the MSPB, the question of whether there has been an actual breach of the last chance agreement by the employee through a subsequent act of misconduct is deemed a question that the employee may take to the MSPB for review; that is, the employee is deemed "not [to have] waive[d] his right to contest the breach of the agreement itself." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Stated another way, the employee's breach of the agreement is said to be a condition precedent to the waiver: "The last chance agreement predicates the...waiver of appeal rights on breach of one or more of the other stipulations the agreement contains." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1148; <span class="Italic">see also Briscoe v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 55 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This understanding does not make the employee's "waiver" promise under the last chance agreement meaningless. To the contrary, the employee gives up something significant in exchange for the agency's forbearance from pursuing (or sustaining) the discharge. What the employee gives up is the case that the Government otherwise must prove under the law to justify removal of an employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee challenges an adverse action (e.g., discharge) in the ordinary course by initiating MSPB review, the Government, to have the action upheld, must establish, one, that the charged conduct occurred, two, that there is a nexus between that conduct and the efficiency of the service, and, three, that the penalty imposed is reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Pope v. United States Postal</span> Ser<span class="Italic">v.</span>, 114 F.3d 1144, 1147 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The Government bears the burden of proving its charges by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Hale v. Department of Transp.</span>, 772 F.2d 882, 885 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, when discharge under a last chance agreement is the case, the sole issue raised on appeal to the MSPB is whether the employee in fact violated the agreement by an act of 'misconduct' as defined under the agreement. Nexus with the efficiency of the service is not at issue, nor is the reasonableness of the penalty (typically the discharge). Furthermore, the universe of actionable misconduct often is defined quite broadly by the agreement; for example, under the agreement in this case "[a]ny infraction of VA policies or regulations...will result in immediate termination...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The outstanding question posed by this understanding of the last chance agreement is, which party bears the burden of persuasion on the one matter at issue[,] i.e., whether the employee in fact breached the agreement. In the ordinary MSPB appeal from an adverse action, the Government, as previously noted, bears the burden of establishing the offense. And under ordinary contract law, a party alleging breach--here the Government--bears the burden of proving the breach<span class="Italic">. See Technical</span> <span class="Italic">Assistance Int'l, Inc. v. United</span> States, 150 F.3d 1369, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In my view, this should be the starting point in last chance agreement cases as well. That is, absent an explicit contrary provision in the agreement, the Government bears the burden of justifying its action (typically removal) by proving that the employee in fact violated the terms of the agreement. Thus, the way in which the burden is allocated under these last chance agreements is a matter of contract interpretation. If the parties in the last chance agreement assign the burden of persuasion otherwise--as they certainly could--that controls. If the agreement is silent on the matter, as it is in this case, the default position should be the 'ordinary' allocation of the burden of persuasion--the Government alleges breach, the Government should prove its case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The case that the Government must prove is only that the employee violated the behavioral requirements of the last chance agreement. The Government need not establish a nexus between the misconduct and the efficiency of the service, or that the penalty is appropriate to the misconduct. This is because, as recognized in <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, 926 F.2d at 1149 n.*, the employee is deemed to have waived his right to refute the original alleged misconduct, as well as the questions of whether that misconduct has a nexus with the efficiency of the service and whether the penalty (discharge) is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In effect, the discharge that flows from the misconduct that constitutes breach of a last chance agreement stands on both the original alleged misconduct and the subsequent misconduct constituting breach. The resulting termination is not merely a reinstatement of the original proposed or carried out removal. Nor is the termination based entirely on the subsequent misconduct, as the otherwise prerequisite nexus may be lacking, or, more likely, the penalty (termination) may be considered disproportionate. It is the combination of breach of the employment contract--the last chance agreement--coupled with the initial adverse action that justifies the termination; and it is the latter aspect--the adverse action aspect--of the transaction that gives the MSPB undoubted jurisdiction to hear the employee's appeal of whether a breach in fact occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unfortunately, the analysis used by the Board in these last chance agreement cases, largely left uncorrected by this court, begins with a misunderstanding of the Board's "jurisdiction," and as a result allocates the burden of persuasion in a perverse way. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Briscoe</span>, 55 F.3d at 1573, <span class="Italic">McCall v. United States Postal</span> Ser<span class="Italic">v.</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 668-69 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">but see Link</span>, 51 F.3d at 1584 (Plager, J., concurring). Under this "jurisdiction" view of the case, the Board accepts an employee's appeal from the agency's decision that there has been a breach of the last chance agreement. The Board reviews the case to decide whether there has been a breach<span class="Italic">. See Briscoe</span>, 55 F.3d at 1573 ("It is the board's responsibility to determine whether...[a breach of the agreement has occurred].").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Board agrees with the employee that there has been no breach (that is, that the agency does not have cause to discharge), the Board concludes that there has been no waiver of appeal rights and that it therefore has jurisdiction, and it then overturns the agency decision. If, however, the Board on the merits agrees with the agency that a subsequent act of misconduct occurred, breaching the last chance agreement, the Board allows the discharge to stand. But the Board explains this by saying it never had "jurisdiction" to hear the appeal, i.e., it dismisses for "lack of jurisdiction." And our cases generally parrot this reasoning. <span class="Italic">But see Stokes v. Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Aviation Admin.</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 687 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Board dismissal of a probationary employee's appeal for "'lack of jurisdiction'...when...the Board goes on to determine the entire case...is...inappropriate. It is at best incongruous to speak as though the jurisdictional issue is all that has been decided when it is the entire case that has been decided.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is an explanation (or motivation, on the Government's part) for this Alice-in-Wonderland view of jurisdiction. By saying that the question is one of "jurisdiction," the Board can invoke the familiar rule that an employee who appeals an agency action to the Board has the burden of establishing that the Board has jurisdiction over the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) (1997); <span class="Italic">Link</span>, 51 F.3d at 1581. The employee therefore must establish that the employee's complaint falls within the limited review authority that Congress assigned to the Board. In this way, the Board explains--attempts to justify--why the employee on appeal to the Board in a last chance agreement case has the burden of proving that the breach, alleged by the Government, did not occur. <span class="Italic">But see Stokes</span>, 761 F.2d at 687 ("[B]y treating the entire case as one directed solely to the issue of jurisdiction, the Board allocates to the probationary employee the entire burden of proof on all issues throughout the case. That allocation is contrary to that set forth in our cases.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the case before us, the employee was assigned the duty of proving that his misconduct--his violation of the agreement to behave--did not occur. He attempted to do that by arguing that there was no policy, regulation or rule controlling an employee's access to the hospital ward, and thus his entering there was not a breach. Under the "jurisdiction" rule, the employee should have had to prove the non-existence of the policy, regulation, or rule. The majority here properly dismisses that idea, noting that to put on the employee the burden of proving that something does not exist is a bad idea, particularly when the other party is the possessor of the proof. <span class="Italic">See Brush v. Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management</span>, 982 F.2d 1554, 1561 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Instead, the court shifts the burden of persuasion on that question to the Government (the Government on these facts being found to have carried the burden). A perfectly sensible, but, under the "jurisdiction" theory, incorrect twist on the burden allocation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The flaw of course is with the notion that the problem is one of the Board's "jurisdiction." In terms of subject matter jurisdiction as it is properly understood, if the issue before the Board is viewed as one purely of contract rights, the Board has no jurisdiction over the cause at all, regardless of whether the Government or the employee is right, since the Board does not hear contract cases. If the issue is whether an adverse action--e.g., "a removal"--was properly taken against an employee, the Board has unquestioned jurisdiction, and that is true whether on the merits the Government is shown to have been right or wrong in its decision that a breach of the last chance agreement occurred. 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701 (a), 7513(d), 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "jurisdiction" explanation is a red herring. The analysis should be straightforward: when the Government terminates an employee for violation of a last chance agreement, the Government bears the burden of justifying the termination by proving the alleged breach--unless the agreement allocates the burden differently. Thus, this is a matter of construction of the employment contract (the last chance agreement). Though the issue before the Board arises from the agreement, the <span id="Page_1124"></span>question is whether the Government has properly taken an adverse action (discharge of the employee on the basis of the alleged breach), and there is no doubt that the Board has jurisdiction to decide that question. This is abundantly clear when we remember the invariable rule that a party to litigation cannot by agreement create jurisdiction in a forum when it would not otherwise exist, nor can it take away jurisdiction that Congress has granted. <span class="Italic">See</span> 15 Charles A. Wright <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, <span class="Italic">Federal Practice and Procedure</span> &#x00A7; 3801, at 7 (2d ed. 1986) ("[J]urisdiction over the person...can be waived,...unlike jurisdiction of the subject matter, which cannot be waived by the parties."); <span class="Italic">Industrial</span> <span class="Italic">Addition Ass'n v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</span>, 323 U.S. 310, 313, 65 S. Ct. 289, 89 L. Ed. 260 (1945) ("Want of jurisdiction...may not be cured by consent of the parties; but when the court has jurisdiction, it has power to decide the case brought before it....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the end, I agree with the result in this case. The agency discharged Mr. Gibson for misconduct which amounted to a breach of the last chance agreement. When Mr. Gibson challenged that determination before the Board, as our cases entitle him to do, the Board agreed with the agency, finding that there was a visitor policy understood to apply to employees as well as visitors and that Mr. Gibson violated the policy. Though the Board stated that Mr. Gibson had the burden of proving non-breach, I do not read the Board's decision as relying on that isolated statement. To the contrary, I read the decision as stating on the whole that the preponderance of evidence established each of these findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal here, I cannot conclude that there is an absence of substantial evidence in the record to support the findings by the Board, or that the Board otherwise erred. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c) (1994). I only regret that the Board, and this court, continues potentially to confuse litigants, many of whom are <span class="Italic">pro se,</span> and sometimes ourselves, by describing these cases in terms of "jurisdiction," rather than in straightforward terms displaying a clear understanding of these last chance agreements.</p>

The court considered assertions that the appellant was entitled to hearing and discovery, and the court commented on how LCA terms with plain meaning would be construed:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because there is no allegation that petitioner did not knowingly and voluntarily enter the last-chance agreement or that the agency breached the agreement, the issue for us is whether the Board erred in finding that petitioner violated the agreement without holding a hearing. The administrative judge performed a careful analysis of the last-chance agreement and the other evidence. We find no error in the administrative judge's analysis or conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The requirement that petitioner be "on duty" in ordinary parlance imposed a requirement that petitioner be engaged in performing her assigned tasks during the workday. <span class="Italic">See Webster's Third New International Dictionary</span> 705 (1968) (defining "on duty" as "assigned to a task or duty: engaged in or responsible for some specific performance"). The term "on duty" is to be contrasted with the term "off duty" which means "not assigned to any specific task or duty: free from assignment or responsibility." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In two affidavits by union representatives, submitted in connection with petitioner's motion for reconsideration, the affiants stated that "[t]he collective bargaining agreement [between the agency and AFGE] defines 'duty' only in terms of duty stations" and that petitioner's duty station was "BPA headquarters." They thus construed the agreement as simply obligating petitioner to be at the headquarters building. Whether or not these affidavits were considered to be part of the record, they merely claim that another agreement (the collective bargaining agreement) used "duty" in a different sense. They raise no issue as to whether the term "on duty" had an established meaning different from the ordinary meaning and thus do not suggest an ambiguity in the last-chance agreement. <span class="Italic">See Jowett, Inc. v. United States</span>, 234 F.3d 1365, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that evidence of custom or trade usage may not be used to vary the meaning of an unambiguous term in a contract unless the evidence shows an accepted industry meaning different than the ordinary meaning). The affiants' construction of the last-chance agreement is also irrelevant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1369&#x2013;70 (stating that "affidavits that those familiar with trade practices...would interpret the [agreement] differently are irrelevant, unless they identify a specific term that has a well-understood meaning in the industry and that was used in, or omitted from, the contract").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, we must determine whether the Board erred in finding that a hearing was not required before determining whether petitioner violated the terms of the last-chance agreement. We hold that the Board did not err. It is undisputed that petitioner was away from her work station and not engaged in performing her assigned tasks for a significant portion of the day on August 9, 1999. Here, although the administrative judge focused on her absence in the afternoon to meet with Ms. Juarez, petitioner, by her own admission, was not working at her assigned tasks for a significant portion of the day without permission from her supervisor. Because the last-chance agreement expressly required petitioner to obtain permission from her supervisor prior to any absence from work, such conduct was a violation of the agreement. Petitioner does not claim that her absences from work were trivial or for an insignificant period, or that she was otherwise engaged in performing her assigned tasks during her absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner contends that, as a matter of practice, although the rules required supervisor permission, employees did not typically obtain permission before meeting with a union steward, and were not typically disciplined for failing to do so, relying on the two affidavits from union representatives submitted after the administrative judge's decisions. Again, whether or not these affidavits are properly considered to be part of the record, they are irrelevant. While ordinary employees might have enjoyed such latitude to depart from governing rules without disciplinary action, petitioner did not by the explicit terms of the last-chance agreement. While petitioner contends that the last-chance agreement required her to be treated like any other agency employee, this is only true for situations not governed by the agreement. Paragraph 16 of the last-chance agreement specifically limited the treatment of petitioner as an ordinary employee when it stated: "Except for the specific requirements of the agreement, appellant will be treated like any other BPA employee." In any event, petitioner's failure to comply with the last-chance agreement was not limited to the period of her meeting with the union steward but encompassed several hours of the workday.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The last-chance agreement was a product of several years of petitioner's repeated failure to be available to work full-time at her position, and repeated failures on her part to notify the agency and obtain permission for such absences. Despite enormous patience and accommodation by the agency throughout her tenure as an employee, and repeated warnings that any further failure to be "on duty" would lead to her termination, petitioner does not dispute that she was absent from her work station and not performing her assigned tasks for much of the day on August 9, 1999, without notifying or obtaining permission from her supervisor as specifically required by the agreement. We hold that such conduct was a violation of the terms of the last-chance agreement and that a hearing was not required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner complains that she was not allowed discovery on the issue of the Board's jurisdiction and that this was a denial of her due process rights. In fact her counsel specifically stated in a December 21, 1999, affidavit that he delayed requesting discovery until a decision on the jurisdiction issue. In any event, petitioner has not shown that denial of discovery would have been prejudicial even if sought on the jurisdictional issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Expressing concerns about LCAs, Judge Plager concurred in <span class="Italic">Buchanan</span>, 247 F.3d at 1340-41:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I concur in the result, though I find the case closer, and more troubling, than my colleagues. That the employee here was a problem employee is without doubt. Whether the last chance agreement (LCA) was unwise, in the sense that perhaps the agency should have stuck to its firing guns in the first instance, is an open question. Once having entered into the LCA, however, the agency, as well as the employee, was bound by its terms....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether resolving government labor-management disputes through these LCA's is good public policy is debatable. One need not decide that issue to recognize that often they are sources of further conflict between the dissatisfied employing agency and the equally dissatisfied employee. Be that as it may, once there is such an agreement, the parties should have to live with it. When the agreement contains a provision as broad and as ambiguous as this "on duty" one, I would have thought a better process would have been for the Board to give the employee at least a hearing in the matter, rather than this back-of-the-hand dismissal without a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If you accept the AJ's fact finding, sustained by a divided Board, comb the record for support, and construe the agreement in the Government's favor, the result is sustainable under our standard of review.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">After determining that Ms. Long violated the terms of her LCA, the administrative judge recognized the provision in the LCA by which Ms. Long waived her rights to an appeal, paragraph 8. An LCA may properly include a term waiving all appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Gibson v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 160 F.3d 722, 725 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Because the administrative judge found Ms. Long violated the terms of the LCA, and did not find the agency breached the LCA, the MSPB would retain jurisdiction over Ms. Long's case only if she "did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into the agreement." <span class="Italic">Link v.

The alleged assurance that she would retain appeal rights if she did not breach the agreement--a fundamentally true statement--becomes irrelevant upon the administrative judge's finding she did breach the agreement. Moreover, as duress, Ms. Long alleges financial pressure motivating her to retain her job, which does not amount to sufficient duress to invalidate the agreement. <span class="Italic">See McCall v.

USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 178, 182-86 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-17, 2010 MSPB 21 (2010), presents a comprehensive review of LCAs and their jurisdictional effect on adverse action appeals. The appellant entered an LCA conditioned on absence-free attendance for a period of time. The LCA was entered as part of a grievance settlement after the appellant was removed based on alleged attendance related misconduct. During the period of the LCA, the agency informed the appellant that it would remove him based on breach of the agreement. The appellant then filed an appeal of the first removal, contending the LCA was invalid and he filed another appeal, challenging the second removal. The Board considered but rejected the appellant's argument that he entered the LCA without knowing he could have appealed the first removal to the Board; the appellant violated the LCA and that the agreement contained a valid waiver of appeal rights. Joining both appeals at the PFR level, the Board dismissed the appeals as beyond the its jurisdiction based on the LCA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee chooses to file and settle a grievance by agreeing to lesser discipline, that course of action is presumptively voluntary and therefore divests the Board of jurisdiction over the underlying matter. <span class="Italic">Swink v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 620, &#x00B6; 9 (2009); <span class="Italic">Perry v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 272, 276 (1997). However, the Board will review the terms of a settlement agreement and the surrounding circumstances to determine if it retains jurisdiction over an appeal of an action that was settled in another procedural avenue. <span class="Italic">Swink</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 620, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 276. A presumption exists that Board appeal rights are waived when the other procedural avenue is a grievance and the settlement of that grievance does not specifically reserve the right to file a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Hanna v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 461, 118 (2006); <span class="Italic">Laity v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 256, 261-62 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agreement here provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">All parties agree with this resolution and waive further appeal of this action and any other action caused by the violation of any of the above [provisions] for a period not to exceed eighteen months. The waiver of appeal rights includes, but is not limited to, those under the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB); the grievance-arbitration procedures; the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB); and EEO Forums; Federal and Civil Courts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The above language indicates that the appellant clearly waived his right to file a Board appeal of the September 5, 2008 removal action. <span class="Italic">See Mays v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 995 F.2d 1056, 1059 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Laity</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 263. Similarly, nothing in the last-chance settlement agreement expressly preserved the appellant's right to appeal the September 5, 2008 removal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Perry</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 277.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we agree with the administrative judge's determination that the appellant failed to show that his acceptance of the last-chance settlement agreement was invalid. The appellant correctly asserted below that the agency failed to inform him in connection with the September 5, 2008 removal that, as a preference-eligible employee, he had the right to appeal his removal to the Board. The appellant argued that, because he was not aware that he had Board appeal rights, his waiver of those rights in the last-chance settlement agreement was not knowing and voluntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the basis of the grievance that the union filed on the appellant's behalf was, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant was a preference-eligible veteran entitled to adverse action procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, it is clear that the appellant's union representative in the grievance proceeding was aware that the appellant had Board appeal rights. Moreover, the last-chance settlement agreement itself clearly mentions Board appeal rights in two places on the signature page, including the following statement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I, [the appellant], have read and understand the conditions and restrictions set forth in the above agreement. I am mentally and physically fit so as to be able to understand this agreement in its entirety. I know and understand that I may have appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board, the grievance-arbitration procedure, NLRB, and EEO with respect to any removal action taken against me.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant and his union representative signed and dated this specific statement in addition to signing the remainder of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the appellant did not understand the statement, he could have requested clarification, but he does not claim that he did so. Thus, we find that the appellant knew or should have known that he may have had Board appeal rights at the time he entered into the agreement. Therefore, his claims that the last-chance settlement agreement is invalid because he entered into it "with blinders on," and that the agency fraudulently concealed his rights from him, are not supported by the record evidence. <span class="Italic">Cf. Perry</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 278 (it is immaterial whether the agency's failure to inform the appellant of a Board appeal right at the time it imposed the action under appeal caused him to be unaware of his appeal rights when he entered into the settlement agreement, assuming he did not know of a Board appeal right when he entered into the agreement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The last-chance settlement agreement did not expressly preserve the appellant's right to file a Board appeal over his September 5, 2008 removal and the appellant has not shown that it is invalid or otherwise should not be enforced. Moreover, the appellant ratified the agreement and accepted the fruits of the agreement by returning to work in accordance with its provisions. <span class="Italic">See Mays</span>, 995 F.2d at 1059. Consequently, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant failed to show that the Board has adverse action jurisdiction over the September 5, 2008 removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the appellant's removal effective March 20, 2009, the Board lacks jurisdiction over an action taken pursuant to a last-chance settlement agreement in which an appellant waives his right to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 466, &#x00B6; 17 (2007). To establish that a waiver of appeal rights in a last-chance settlement agreement should not be enforced, an appellant must show one of the following: (1) He complied with the last-chance settlement agreement; (2) the agency materially breached the agreement or acted in bad faith; (3) he did not voluntarily enter into the agreement; or (4) the last-chance settlement agreement resulted from fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Id.; Covington v. Department of the Army</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 12 (2000). Where an appellant raises a nonfrivolous factual issue of compliance with a settlement agreement, the Board must resolve that issue before addressing the scope of and applicability of a waiver of appeal rights in the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Covington</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends here that he did not breach the agreement. He further alleges that the agreement is invalid because he was unaware that he had Board appeal rights at the time he entered into it. As noted above, however, the evidence shows that the appellant knew or should have known that he had Board appeal rights when he entered into the last-chance settlement agreement, and he has failed to show that the agreement is invalid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The last-chance settlement agreement provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Absences, other than those documented as [covered under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993], constituting more than two (2) frequencies (occasions) within a period of time not to exceed 90 days or whenever the employee utilizes the frequencies, whichever comes first, will result in immediate removal. If the frequencies occur in a period of time less than 90 days, removal may be effected without waiting 90 days. [The appellant] understands and agrees that such removal will be without appeal in any form or forum....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[The appellant] understands that even though he is required to furnish satisfactory documentation for his absences, they are still considered absences under this agreement and are counted regardless of whether the leave is charged to leave without pay, annual leave, sick leave, failure to work overtime, short clock rings, or failure to work a holiday.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that the appellant was not eligible for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 because he had not worked a sufficient number of hours in the prior year. There is also no dispute that the appellant incurred two unscheduled absences when he did not report for work on December 12 and December 19, 2008, and he was required to maintain perfect attendance thereafter until February 19, 2009. The agency alleged that the appellant violated the last-chance settlement agreement when he incurred unscheduled absences on February 1-2, 2009, and February 5-7, 2009. The administrative judge found that the appellant incurred the charged unscheduled absences and thus breached the agreement. The appellant has not challenged this finding on review and we see no reason to disturb it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not shown that he complied with the last-chance settlement agreement or that it is invalid. Therefore, we must next <span id="Page_1126"></span>address the scope and applicability of the waiver of appeal rights in the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Stewart</span>, 926 F.2d at 1148; <span class="Italic">Covington</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 12. As noted above, the last-chance settlement agreement provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">All parties agree with this resolution and waive further appeal of this action and any other action caused by the violation of any of the above [provisions] for a period not to exceed eighteen months. The waiver of appeal rights includes, but is not limited to, those under the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The last-chance settlement agreement further provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I, [the appellant], have read and understand the conditions and restrictions set forth in the above agreement. I am mentally and physically fit so as to be able to understand this agreement in its entirety....&#8197;I know and understand that I have waived my appeal rights through any and all forums and avenues, including, but not limited to, the Merit Systems Protection Board,...for any removal action initiated against me for violation of this last chance agreement during this two-year period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this language constitutes a clear and unequivocal waiver of the appellant's right to appeal the March 20, 2009 removal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Covington</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 16; <span class="Italic">Merriweather v. Department of Transportation</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 434, 437 (1993). Because, for the reasons noted above, the appellant has not shown that this waiver is unenforceable, the Board lacks jurisdiction over his appeal of the March 20, 2009 removal, and the administrative judge correctly dismissed it for lack of adverse action jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Application of an LCA to divest the Board of jurisdiction over an appeal was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Smith v. VA,</span> 169 Fed. Appx. 585, 585-87 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 31, 2003, Smith was removed from his position as a part-time food service employee for the Department of Veterans Affairs ("agency") based on the sustained charge of using insulting, abusive, and obscene language. Smith timely appealed the agency's decision to the Board. The appeal was resolved by a last chance settlement agreement ("LCSA"). The terms of the LCSA provided, in pertinent part, that Smith must maintain conduct acceptable to his supervisors, and it stated that Smith's obligation "extends to all aspects of conduct affecting the workplace, including but not limited to abusive/threatening language, aggressive behavior, punctuality, attendance, and leave usage." According to the LCSA, if Smith failed to comply with the obligations under the agreement, the removal that was imposed on January 31, 2003 would immediately revive, with no further right to appeal concerning the removal or the decision resulting in the revival of that removal. Upon execution of the LCSA, Smith returned to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 15, 2003, Smith was scheduled to report to duty for his 6:30 <small>A.M.</small> to 10:30 <small>A.M.</small> work shift. Smith failed to report to duty and did not inform his supervisor of his absence. The agency provided notice to Smith of a proposed reprimand for his four hours of absence without leave and failure to follow leave procedures. Pursuant to the LCSA, on July 7, 2003, the agency revived the prior removal action, and Smith was removed from his position. Smith appealed his removal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Smith argues that the Board erred in dismissing his petition for lack of jurisdiction. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that government employees may waive their right of appeal in exchange for a last chance opportunity to retain their employment. <span class="Italic">See, e. g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Stewart v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1148-49 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">McCall v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 666-68 (Fed. Cir. 1988). To overcome a waiver of appeal rights in an LCSA, the appellant must show that he complied with the agreement, that the agency breached the agreement in a material way, or that he did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into the agreement. <span class="Italic">Link v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Smith asserts that he did not waive his appeal rights in the LCSA because he complied with the LCSA as "best as possible under the circumstances." To support his contention, Smith states that he was unaware of the posted work schedule and that his absence was an honest mistake. The LCSA expressly provides that even one instance of discipline will be cause for his immediate removal. Further, the Board found that it was Smith's responsibility to check the work schedule and that he was adequately reminded of his obligations under the LCSA. Thus, the Board correctly determined that Smith failed to show he complied with the LCSA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Smith further contends that the agency breached the LCSA because his removal was discriminatory based on race. We lack the jurisdiction to decide Smith's racial discrimination and the claim before us is therefore waived. Smith makes no factual allegations to support his contention. The Board correctly determined that Smith failed to show that his removal was racially motivated or that he was treated differently than similarly situated employees not members of his protected class.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Smith alleges that witness statements used to support his initial removal lacked credibility. Smith improperly attempts to raise an argument regarding evidence supporting his initial removal. To the extent that Smith's claim rests upon a challenge to the presiding judge's credibility determination, such a determination is virtually unreviewable by this court. <span class="Italic">Hambsch v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 796 F.2d 430, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Thus, we decline to address Smith's credibility challenge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Smith fails to show that the Board made an error of law when it determined that the parties had entered into a valid LCSA. The Board's determination that Smith has not shown that he complied with the LCSA or that the agency breached the LCSA is supported by substantial evidence. Thus, the Board lacked jurisdiction to review his petition.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">An agency violated an LCA when it failed properly to apply the operative term of the agreement: commission of an offense requiring discipline. Under the facts of the case, discipline was not required and the agency should not have discharged the appellant, <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 113 MSPR 592, 595-97 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12, 2010 MSPB 91 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the LCA expressly provides that the agency will remove the appellant for commission of "any offense requiring discipline." We discern no ambiguity in the term "requiring," which is a participial form of the verb "require," the ordinary meaning of which is to "direct or instruct" and to "[o]rder, command, demand, compel, coerce,...make mandatory." <span class="Italic">West's Legal Thesaurus/Dictionary</span> 654 (1985). <span class="Italic">See also Webster's Third New International Dictionary</span> 1929 (Merriam-Webster 1993) ("require" means "to ask for authoritatively or imperatively:...insist upon, usu. with certainty or urgency"); <span class="Italic">Mississippi River Fuel Corporation v. Slayton</span>, 359 F.2d 106, 119 (8th Cir. 1966) (the word "required" implies something mandatory). Thus, the agency could only remove the appellant under the LCA if the appellant committed an offense for which discipline is mandatory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that failure to use proper safety equipment is not an offense requiring discipline. Although agency policy and Executive Order 12566 require seat belt use by operators of government owned vehicles, neither mandates disciplinary action for violations. Rather, the policy provides that an employee's failure to wear a seat belt "may result in disciplinary action," which plainly suggests that discipline is discretionary, not mandatory. Further, the charged misconduct does not violate a statute that mandates discipline, such as misuse of a government vehicle or engaging in prohibited partisan political activity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7326, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1349. Although the Table of Penalties in the Department of Interior Departmental Manual <span class="Italic">suggests</span> penalties for failure to use proper safety equipment, ranging from a written reprimand to removal, it does not compel discipline for this offense. Thus, the AJ erred in finding that failure to use proper safety equipment is an offense requiring discipline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the administrative judge found that the appellant disobeyed agency policy and Executive Order 12566, and that disobedience is an offense requiring discipline, these findings are erroneous and deny the appellant the required notice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. The agency did not charge the appellant with disobedience. S<span class="Italic">ee</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1); <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 50, 57 (1991) (the appellant must know of the claims with which he is being charged so that he may adequately prepare and present a defense before the agency); <span class="Italic">Gottlieb v. Veterans Administration,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. 606, 609 (1989) (the Board is required to review the agency's decision on an adverse action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency; the Board may not substitute what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis). Thus, the administrative judge erred in considering the alleged charge of disobedience in this appeal. In any event, the Board has treated disobedience and insubordination offenses as involving willful and intentional conduct. <span class="Italic">See Redfearn v. Department of Labor</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 307, 312-13 (1993). Here, the agency has not shown that the appellant's failure to use proper safety equipment was willful and intentional. In fact, the agency indicated in its proposal and decision notices that the offense was "inadvertent" and not intentional.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, the administrative judge erred in finding the appellant committed an offense requiring discipline, that the agency properly invoked the LCA, and that the waiver provision deprives the <span id="Page_1127"></span>Board of jurisdiction over this removal appeal. We therefore REVERSE the initial decision. We find that the appellant established his compliance with the LCA insofar as he did not commit an offense requiring discipline. As the alleged violation of the LCA was the sole basis for the agency's action terminating the appellant's employment and, absent the waiver of appeal rights associated with the LCA, this removal action was clearly within the Board's adverse action jurisdiction, we find that the Board has jurisdiction over his removal appeal, and that the agency improperly removed him pursuant to the LCA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Posey v. DOD</span>, 180 Fed. Appx. 931 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), the LCA may preclude a whistleblower case, brought as an Individual Right of Action, to challenge either the last chance agreement or the events leading to it. However, the employee may still attempt to show that the agency acted in bad faith by implementing the last chance agreement to cause the appellant's removal for reasons of whistleblowing reprisal, amounting to bad faith and a breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Posey</span> returned to the Board, was reconsidered by the AJ, and was remanded to the AJ for more complete factfinding on whether whistleblowing factored into the actions complained of by the appellant concerning LCA implementation. <span class="Italic">Posey v. DOD</span>, 106 MSPR 472, 2007 MSPB 203 (2007), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Posey v. DOD</span>, 299 Fed. Appx. 977 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP). <span class="Italic">Hamlin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-0752-15-0696-I-1 (NP 7/15/2016), implied that if it is clear that the LCA was violated by the appellant, e.g., by admission of the charged triggering conduct, a whistleblower defense does not avail the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, although the appellant has alleged that the agency was motivated by retaliatory animus when it removed him pursuant to the LCA, he has not alleged that the agency's purportedly retaliatory actions amounted to an unjustified deprivation of his rights. Specifically, as discussed above, the appellant does not dispute the administrative judge's finding, with which we agree, that he violated the LCA by exhibiting unacceptable conduct and performance on two occasions during the last chance period. Because the appellant violated the LCA, the agency was justified in removing him pursuant to the LCA and it did not act in bad faith by removing him pursuant to the LCA. <span class="Italic">See Lizzio v. Department of the Army</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 442, &#x00B6; 18 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 374 F. App'x 973 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Therefore, we discern no basis to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency breached the LCA or acted in bad faith.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Raising the jurisdictional complexities to the second power are cases involving appeals from removals based on LCAs that lead to another settlement, e.g., a second LCA. For the Board to accept the second agreement, it must have jurisdiction to do so. If the appellant waived appeal rights in the first LCA, and there is the suggestion that the appellant breached the first agreement, the Board may find itself without jurisdiction to consider the second agreement because appellant had no right to initiate the appeal. The AJ is to examine the circumstances of an alleged breach of the first agreement to determine whether the breach results in a waiver of the right to appeal. As a component of that analysis, the AJ may consider argument or evidence that the agency acted in bad faith in negotiating the agreement, a factor "relevant to the applicability of the appellant's waiver of appeal rights to the Board." <span class="Italic">Merriweather v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 59 MSPR 434, 439 n.3 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board elaborated on the jurisdictional intricacies of second-generation settlement agreements in <span class="Italic">Hester v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 149, 152 (1996), involving the settlement through an LCA of a removal based upon an alleged violation of an earlier LCA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]n agreement cannot be entered into the record for enforcement purposes unless the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Shaw v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 586, 594 (1989). In this case, a finding that the Board has jurisdiction requires a finding that the last-chance agreement with waiver of appeal rights is not enforceable because it was involuntarily entered into, was the result of fraud or mutual mistake, or was breached because the agency claimed the appellant had violated the agreement when the appellant had complied with it. <span class="Italic">See Lopez v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 461 (1996). Because the appellant has never asserted that the last chance agreement was invalid for any of these reasons, it is likely that the Board would not have been able to enter the settlement agreement into the record even if both parties had agreed that they wanted it entered into the record.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Merriweather v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 64 MSPR 365, 368-75 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Merriweather v. Dept. of Transp.</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3062), the Board declined to look behind a second LCA to determine whether the proposal removal that motivated the agreement was coercive because it did not provide a "firm choice" to an employee who was about to be removed for alcohol dependency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant facts resulting in this Board appeal are as follows: (1) On August 14, 1992, the agency proposed to remove the appellant from his position of Air Traffic Control Specialist on the charge of alcohol dependency; (2) when the agency gave the appellant the notice of proposed removal, it presented him with a last-chance settlement agreement (the August 14 agreement); (3) on August 31, 1992, the parties entered into a last-chance settlement agreement (the August 31 agreement) providing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant's failure to abide by every condition "will result in [his]removal from the Federal Service," and that, for the next two years, the appellant would waive his appeal rights to the Board in any disciplinary action taken by the agency for a violation of the agreement; (4) the appellant breached the agreement when, on or about December 22, 1992, the West Paces Ferry Hospital recorded his blood alcohol level as .268, and when, on December 28, 1992, he revoked his consent for release of information to the agency; (5) the agency removed the appellant effective January 12, 1993, for violating the August 31 agreement<span class="Italic">. See Merriweather v. Department of Transportation</span>, 59 MSPR 434, 435-37 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 29, 1993, during the pendency of the Board appeal, the parties entered into a settlement agreement (the April 29 agreement) in which the agency agreed to cancel the removal action, and the appellant agreed to enter into another last-chance settlement agreement and withdraw his appeal. The administrative judge entered the settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes upon finding that it was lawful on its face and was freely reached and understood by the parties. The appellant filed a petition for enforcement seeking to obtain the agency's compliance with the April 29 agreement and relief for the agency's alleged breach of that agreement, which he claims resulted in his removal effective June 5, 1993.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 USC &#x00A7; 791 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, prohibits an agency from imposing discipline upon an individual based solely on the individual's status as an alcoholic. The administrative judge concluded that the agency "knew or should have known that the reasons for the threatened removal could not have been sustained." On that basis, she found that the agency's threatened action was purely coercive. She further determined that the appellant could not have freely and voluntarily entered into the August 31 agreement because he would not have been faced with the choice of signing the agreement but for the coercive removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alcohol dependency was the reason the agency proposed the appellant's removal. The administrative judge cited no record evidence, and we could locate no such evidence, to establish that the agency knew or should have known that the reason for the proposed removal could not be substantiated....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether in fact the agency's action could have been sustained under the Rehabilitation Act is an issue that the appellant could have litigated before the Board<span class="Italic">. See Scott</span>, 45 MSPR at 640-44 (Board sustained the agency's action removing the appellant from his position of Air Traffic Control Specialist because of his history of alcohol abuse and his failure to comply with the terms of a rehabilitation agreement). The appellant, however, chose to sign the August 31 agreement rather than allow the proposed action to be effected and file a Board appeal because he believed a Board appeal would have "compounded" his problems.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant knew that he could appeal the removal, if effected, to the Board. Yet, he chose not to do so. In making his choice, the appellant waived his right to have the Board review the facts underlying, and the legal validity of, the proposed removal<span class="Italic">. See Pryor v. Department of the Army</span>, 49 MSPR 590, 593 (1991). Thus, we agree with the agency that the administrative judge erred in adjudicating the merits of the removal action and finding that the action could not be sustained<span class="Italic">. See May v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 43 MSPR 217, 218 (1990) (the appellant could have proceeded with his appeal and obtained a decision on the merits had he not entered into a settlement agreement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's waiver of a statutory right in a settlement agreement is enforceable and not against public policy if the terms of the waiver are comprehensive, freely made, and fair, and the execution of the waiver was not the result of duress or bad faith on the part of the agency<span class="Italic">. See McCall v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 666-67 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Miura v. Department of the Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 663, 668-69 (1989). For the reasons set forth above, we find that the appellant voluntarily entered into the August 31, 1992, last-chance settlement agreement, that he understood that he was waiving his appeal rights to the Board if the agency effected the proposed removal for alcohol dependency based on his noncompliance with the terms of the agreement, and that the agreement was not the product of bad faith or duress. We conclude therefore that the appellant waived his right to appeal the agency's January 12, 1993, removal action to the Board. Accordingly, we must dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See McCall</span>, 839 F.2d at 669.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal, the April 29, 1993, settlement agreement cannot be entered into the record for enforcement purposes<span class="Italic">. See Bays v. Department of the Army</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 469, 470 (1992). Thus, insofar as the appellant is petitioning the Board to enforce the <span id="Page_1128"></span>terms of the April 29 settlement agreement or to address the June 5, 1993, action taken pursuant to the agreement, he has not shown that the Board has the authority to do so<span class="Italic">. See Pelatti v. Department of the Navy</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 33, 36 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an agency's failure to give an employee a firm choice between treatment and removal constitutes handicap discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Harris v. Department of the Army</span>, 57 MSPR 124, 128 (1993). However, the appellant's waiver of appeal rights divests the Board of jurisdiction to review the legal validity of the agency's action<span class="Italic">. See Pryor</span>, 49 MSPR at 593. Absent jurisdiction, we cannot adjudicate the appellant's claim that the agency discriminated against him on the basis of his alleged alcohol-related handicapping condition<span class="Italic">. See Metzenbaum v. Department of Justice</span>, 54 MSPR 32, 36-37 (1992).</p>
