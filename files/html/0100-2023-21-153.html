<p class="Body-Text">"The former spouse of a retired federal employee is entitled to a survivor annuity if and to the extent the retiree expressly provided for one in an election under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3), or in the terms of a divorce decree or any court order or court-approved property settlement issued in connection with the divorce decree. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1)." <span class="Italic">Williams v. OPM</span>, DC-0831-14-1065-I-1 (NP 9/15/2015). Those constructs create a lot of litigation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Summarizing a lot of law, and many changes in the law, OPM's Retirement FAQs briefly summarize the ability to establish a former spouse survivor annuity, <a href="https://www.opm.gov/faqs/QA.aspx?fid=735eda40-61a8-45df-b6ad-47185f4c91a5&pid=fc094d6e-72c9-4a84-bd5c-f489867e5274#:~:text=Search%20by%20keywords%3A-,I%20have%20divorced.,order%20or%20your%20new%20election">https://www.opm.gov/faqs/QA.aspx?fid=735eda40-61a8-45df-b6ad-47185f4c91a5&pid=fc094d6e-72c9-4a84-bd5c-f489867e5274#:~:text=Search%20by%20keywords%3A-,I%20have%20divorced.,order%20or%20your%20new%20election</a>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I have divorced. Is my former husband or wife eligible for a survivor benefit?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The survivor benefit you elected at retirement is no longer payable. A monthly survivor benefit would be payable to your former spouse after death if one is provided by court order or your new election. The following conditions must exist for your former spouse to receive a benefit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">&#x2022; You were married to your former spouse for at least nine months;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">&#x2022; You performed at least 18 months of creditable civilian service;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">&#x2022; Your former spouse to whom you were married less than 30 years has not remarried before age 55.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Your annuity may be reduced if your former spouse was awarded a survivor annuity by a qualifying court order. If you retired on or after May 7, 1985, we will honor the terms of a court order that requires you to provide a survivor annuity for an eligible former spouse for a marriage dissolved on or after May 7, 1985. If you are divorced after retirement from a spouse to whom you were married at retirement, we will honor the court order to the extent that your annuity was reduced at retirement. If you did not elect a survivor annuity for that person at retirement, your annuity will not be reduced.</p> 
<p class="Block-Quote1">If you retired before May 7, 1985, we will honor the terms of a qualifying court order that requires you to provide a survivor annuity for an eligible former spouse in connection with a marriage that was dissolved on or after May 7, 1985, but only if you were married to that person at retirement and elected to provide a survivor annuity at that time or your were married to that person at retirement and elected to provide a survivor annuity before May 7, 1985.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Under current law, if an employee elects a survivor annuity before retirement and divorces after retirement, to provide the survivor annuity for the former wife, who had been designated to receive the annuity as the spouse before retirement, provision for the a survivor annuity must be made as described in <span class="Italic">Price v. OPM</span>, 52 MSPR 35, 37-38 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The former spouse of a Federal employee may be entitled to survivor annuity benefits "if and to the extent expressly provided for in an election under 8339(j)(3) of this title, or in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1). An election must be made "at the time of retirement, or if later, within 2 years after the date on which the marriage of the former spouse to the employee or Member is dissolved...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the court order terminating the appellant's marriage to Mr. Price, nor the associated property settlement, provides for a survivor benefit to the appellant. Nor did Mr. Price take it upon himself to elect a survivor benefit for the appellant as his former spouse. Therefore, the appellant is not statutorily entitled to receive survivor benefits. <span class="Italic">See Bottrell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 338, 342, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 867 F.2d 1421 (Fed. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The same result was described in <span class="Italic">Jones v. OPM,</span> CH-0831-14-0566-I-1 (NP 5/14/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that, because her former spouse continued to receive a reduced annuity following their divorce and because his annuity adjustments as late as January 2013, continued to indicate that his monthly survivor annuity was payable to her, he may have believed that he did not need to take any further action to provide a former spouse annuity. Although Mr. Jones may have believed that the reduction in his annuity established a survivor annuity for the appellant, the reduction was the result of his failure to notify OPM that they had divorced, as was required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3). Thus, even though Mr. Jones erroneously continued to receive a reduced annuity, this does not provide a basis upon which to waive the election requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's case is sympathetic, we agree with the administrative judge that she has cited no law, rule, or regulation that permits a waiver of the election requirement. Accordingly, because the appellant has not met the statutory requirements for a former spouse survivor annuity, the administrative judge correctly affirmed OPM's reconsideration decision. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 416, 434 (1990) (the Board cannot order payment of retirement benefits when the statutory conditions for such benefits have not been met).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The means to establish a former spouse annuity, the OPM notice requirements to retirees, and some of the complexities, later described in this chapter concerning divorce decree amendments that attempt to establish an annuity for a former spouse, were described in <span class="Italic">Beckstead v. OPM,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210107136">842 Fed. Appx. 578</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Beckstead was married to Lynn Beckstead ("Mr. Beckstead") on February 4, 1965. In 1971, Mr. Beckstead became a federal employee covered under the Civil Service Retirement System. In 2007, he applied for retirement and elected a survivor annuity for his spouse, Mrs. Beckstead. Each year after Mr. Beckstead's retirement, the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") sent him an Annual Notice of Survivor Annuity Election Rights ("Annual Notice").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 3, 2009, Mr. and Mrs. Beckstead divorced. A state court in New Mexico issued a Default Decree of Dissolution of Marriage ("Divorce Decree"), which stated in relevant part that Mrs. Beckstead was entitled to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Exactly one half (1/2) of any and all retirement benefits, 401(k) or other retirement account of [Lynn]. Such account(s) to be divided by Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Divorce Decree did not specifically provide for a survivor annuity, and no QDRO was issued while Mr. Beckstead was alive. Following the divorce, Mr. Beckstead did not notify OPM of the divorce and he never made a new election of a survivor annuity for Mrs. Beckstead.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Beckstead died on July 9, 2018, and Mrs. Beckstead applied for survivor annuity benefits thereafter. OPM informed Mrs. Beckstead that her application could not be processed because her Divorce Decree did not include the referenced QDRO. On January 18, 2019, more than seven months after Mr. Beckstead's death, the New Mexico state court issued a QDRO.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 19, 2019, OPM informed Mrs. Beckstead that she was not entitled to survivor annuity benefits because the QDRO was issued after Mr. Beckstead's death. OPM then reconsidered and reversed its decision on the basis that the agency had failed to properly notify Mr. Beckstead of his rights to preserve the survivor annuity benefit after a divorce. Upon further review, however, OPM concluded that Mr. Beckstead had received notices informing him of his rights, but he did not elect a survivor annuity for Mrs. Beckstead after their divorce. Thus, on December 6, 2019, OPM confirmed its initial finding that Mrs. Beckstead was not entitled to former spouse survivor annuity benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4340"></span>By law, Mr. Beckstead's election of a survivor annuity for Mrs. Beckstead terminated upon their divorce. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(A); <span class="Italic">Holder v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 47 F.3d 412, 415 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("Subsequent divorce extinguishes an election made at retirement."). Following the divorce, there were multiple ways in which Mrs. Beckstead could have again become entitled to the survivor annuity, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1), none of which occurred in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, Mr. Beckstead could have expressly elected a survivor annuity for Mrs. Beckstead within two years of the divorce. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3). Although the AJ credited testimony that Mr. Beckstead intended to provide a survivor annuity for Mrs. Beckstead, <span class="Italic">Board Decision</span>, 2020 MSPB LEXIS 1897, at *3 n.3, it is undisputed that Mr. Beckstead did not, in fact, make the statutorily required express election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Mrs. Beckstead would have been entitled to a survivor annuity "if and to the extent expressly provided for...in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.804(a). While there are two court orders that could potentially have entitled Mrs. Beckstead to a survivor annuity, the AJ correctly determined that neither order was sufficient to meet the statutory and regulatory requirements. The Divorce Decree did not "[e]xpressly state that the former spouse is entitled to a former spouse survivor annuity using terms that are sufficient to identify the survivor annuity." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.804(b). The QDRO was not issued until after Mr. Beckstead died, and it was not the first order dividing marital property. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(b); <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at &#x00A7; 838.806(f)(1) (defining the "first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, no election or valid court order granted Mrs. Beckstead a survivor annuity after the original election terminated upon her divorce from Mr. Beckstead. The Board correctly concluded that Mrs. Beckstead failed to prove that she is entitled to a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Beckstead challenges OPM's actions on due process grounds. According to Mrs. Beckstead, her former husband's election of a survivor annuity when he applied for retirement "create[d] a form of vesting, so to speak," of his retirement benefits, and Mrs. Beckstead contends that she thus belongs to a unique class of individuals to whom federal benefits have already been granted. She asserts that OPM "took [her] survivor benefit from her without notice." She acknowledges that current federal law did not require OPM to provide notice to her upon termination of the survival annuity election when she was divorced. But she contends that the law--specifically, Public Law 95-317, which amended the relevant sections in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8339 and 8341--is facially invalid because it violates the Fifth Amendment by failing to require that former spouses be provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only legal authority Mrs. Beckstead cites is <span class="Italic">Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &#x0026; Trust Co</span>., a case in which the Supreme Court addressed the "constitutional sufficiency of notice to beneficiaries on judicial settlement of accounts by the trustee of a common trust fund." 339 U.S. 306, 307 (1950). There, the Court concluded that "[c]ertainly the proceeding is one in which [the beneficiaries] may be deprived of property rights and hence notice and hearing must measure up to the standards of due process." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 313. Here, in contrast, Mrs. Beckstead cannot support her assertion that she has been deprived of a vested property right because she did not satisfy the statutory conditions for entitlement to the claimed survivor annuity; specifically, she was not Mr. Beckstead's "current spouse" at the time of his death. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(A); <span class="Italic">Warren v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 407 F.3d 1309, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("At the time of the divorce, Mr. Pike's survivor annuity was not one of the 'benefits available,' because a survivor annuity would not become available for collection until Mr. Pike's death and then only if Ms. Warren survived him."); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 918 F.2d 944, 946 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ("The present case [involving a survivor annuity], therefore, is different from situations where Congress has expressly caused a right in money to 'vest' automatically on the death of the retiree.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Beckstead insists that if she had been aware that Mr. Beckstead's election had terminated, she could have acted to protect her interest. But, setting aside our sympathy for Mrs. Beckstead in this case, we have held in analogous situations with regard to survivor annuities that "[t]he government is not responsible for providing instructions to each potential annuitant." <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 918 F.2d at 947; <span class="Italic">see also Sandel v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 28 F.3d 1184, 1187 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ("[P]etitioner identifies no provision either in the statute or in the OPM's regulations requiring the OPM to notify former spouses of retirees of their option of applying for survivor benefits."). Thus, consistent with our precedent, we hold that OPM did not violate Mrs. Beckstead's right to due process by failing to provide her with notice of the consequences that the divorce had on her former husband's elected survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, Mrs. Beckstead contends that OPM failed to provide Mr. Beckstead with legally sufficient notice of his rights regarding his survivor annuity election while he was alive. "OPM is statutorily obligated to annually inform each annuitant of such annuitant's rights of election under sections 8339(j) and 8339(k)(2) of Title 5, United States Code." <span class="Italic">Hairston v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 318 F.3d 1127, 1131 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 note). In <span class="Italic">Downing v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., we confirmed that, under our precedent and the relevant statute, OPM's failure to provide notice could result in entitlement to survivor annuity benefits even without a new election after a divorce:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A former spouse may receive survivor annuity benefits in the absence of a new election by the annuitant if (1) the annuitant did not receive the required annual notice of his election rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j), <span class="Italic">see</span> Act of July 10, 1978, &#x00A7; 3, Pub. L. No. 95-317, 92 Stat. 382, amended by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978, &#x00A7; 102, 92 Stat. 3783 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 note (2006) ("Annual Notice to Annuitant of Rights of Election Under Subsecs. (j) and (k)(2) of This Section")), and (2) "there is evidence sufficient to show that the retiree indeed intended to provide a survivor annuity for the former spouse." <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 450 F.3d 1332, 1334-35 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (quoting <span class="Italic">Wood v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 241 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">619 F.3d 1374, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Ultimately, however, we concluded in <span class="Italic">Downing</span> that the first prong of that exception was not met. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377-78. We reach the same conclusion in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Beckstead does not contest the evidence in the record showing that OPM sent its Annual Notice to all annuitants on OPM's computer master annuity roll, and she concedes that Mr. Beckstead received the Annual Notices. Mrs. Beckstead challenges only the "content and form" of the notice that Mr. Beckstead received. She argues that OPM's Annual Notice was misleading because it identified five scenarios that could affect an employee's annuity, and an employee would have difficulty determining which scenario applied. She further argues that, because this case involves an employee who already elected a survivor benefit and may have assumed that no further action was required, the Annual Notice should have been formatted so as to emphasize information that would have alerted Mr. Beckstead that he was required to act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the past, we found OPM's notice of survivor annuity election rights ineffective when it completely failed to mention the need to affirmatively reelect a former spouse survivor annuity after a divorce. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hairston</span>, 318 F.3d at 1131 (finding notice ineffective when "[n]oticeably absent from this notice was any notification of the need to affirmatively elect to provide Ms. Hairston with a former spouse survivor annuity"); <span class="Italic">Simpson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 347 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("The problem was that he did not make that election after the divorce, and OPM's notice did not state that he had to do so again even if he had previously made such an election."); <span class="Italic">Wood</span>, 241 F.3d at 1367 ("The letter received by Mr. Wood from OPM in September of 1986 made no mention of a requirement that he make an election after the divorce."). It is evident, however, that since those cases were decided, OPM has addressed the deficiency in its Annual Notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Annual Notice that OPM sent to Mr. Beckstead each year is less than two pages in length and it contains a category with the heading "3. Survivor Annuity Election for a Former Spouse." Under that heading, the Annual Notice provides information about electing a survivor annuity for a former spouse, and it explicitly states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Please note that a new survivor annuity election is required within 2 years after the divorce if you wish to provide a former spouse survivor annuity, even if at retirement you elected to provide a survivor annuity for that spouse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board found that the Annual Notice was "adequate to inform [Mr. Beckstead] of the Section 8339(j) election requirements." In view of the explicit statements in the Annual Notice, we have no basis to overturn that finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not agree with Mrs. Beckstead's argument that the existence of other categories in the Annual Notice--including the first category, which explicitly notes that it is applicable to the "Current Spouse"--renders the Annual Notice misleading. We also reject Mrs. Beckstead's argument that we should second-guess OPM's formatting decisions about which words in the Annual Notice should be emphasized using underlining, bolding, italicizing, and capitalization. At bottom, OPM provided the relevant information, and we cannot hold OPM responsible for Mr. Beckstead's failure to reelect a survivor annuity after the divorce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is also worth noting that when Mr. Beckstead initially elected a survivor annuity for Mrs. Beckstead, he did so by filling out Standard Form ("SF") 2801 ("Application for Immediate Retirement"). SF 2801 includes a section with the heading "Section F--Annuity Election," in which it explicitly states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An election for your spouse ends if your marriage ends by death, divorce, or annulment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Immediately below that language, the form again states the effects of divorce, this time in specific reference to the survivor annuity that Mr. Beckstead actually elected:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If your marriage ends by death, divorce, or annulment, this election terminates and you must notify the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have held that the combination of the language in SF 2801 and OPM's Annual Notice constitutes legally sufficient notice of survivor annuity election rights under the law. <span class="Italic">Downing</span>, 619 F.3d at 1378. Therefore, because it is not disputed that OPM sent Mr. Beckstead the Annual Notice, we conclude that OPM met the statutory notice requirements in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a deposit is required to establish a former spouse survivor annuity, the deposit cannot be waived based on incorrect advice from a government official. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Negron v. OPM</span>, AT-0831-10-0533-X-1 (NP 5/16/2013) ("Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(0)(2)(A), a change in election '<span class="Italic">shall not be considered effective</span> unless the amount specified...is deposited into the Fund before the expiration of the applicable 18-month period.' <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). OPM and the Board have no discretion to waive statutorily-imposed requirements, and the government cannot be estopped from denying benefits precluded by law even if the claimant was denied benefits because of his reliance on the mistaken advice of a government official.").</p>
