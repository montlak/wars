<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-130"><span class="space">1.</span> Threatened Personnel Action</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Among its jurisdictional features, the WPA provides whistleblowers protection against threats of personnel actions. 5 USC 2302(b)(8) precludes agencies from exercising their personnel authority to take, fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action in reprisal for a covered (whistleblowing) disclosure. Threatened actions (or nonactions) are also prohibited by &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), prohibiting reprisals against individuals who exercise appeal, complaint, or grievance rights, those who assist individuals in such efforts, and individuals who refuse to obey illegal orders. Of principal significance to MSPB jurisdiction are IRA appeals arising under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), or under WPEA, &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), because under those sections, individuals may appeal to the Board matters outside the Board's ordinary appellate jurisdiction (adverse actions, RIFs, performance cases, retirement appeals) if the complaint is based on an allegation of reprisal against a whistleblower. The Board's regulations adopt the statutory structure, defining the scope of whistleblowing appeals to include "any appeal or stay request filed with the Board by an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment where the appellant alleges that a personnel action defined in 5 USC 2302(a)(2) was threatened, proposed, taken, or not taken because of the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity activities." 5 CFR 1209.1 (2022); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR 1209.2(a), 1209.2(b)(1) (2022); 1209.6(a)(5)(i) (2022). To be actionable, the threat must be of a covered personnel action. "Whether a threatened action is actually taken or not does not determine the Board's jurisdiction in an IRA appeal." <span class="Italic">Hoback v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 86 MSPR 425, 431 &#x00B6; 9 (2000) (immaterial that the agency approved a hardship transfer that it earlier threatened to deny). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kagel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 126 F.3d 1455, 1459 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("If Kagel is able to prove that the threat to remove him violates the Whistleblower Protection Act, the Board could fashion a remedy consistent with that statutory authority by, for example, directing that the agency not remove him or threaten to remove him for the reasons given in the August 10 directive, even if Ms. Kagel resumes her activities within the Walla Walla district."). The IRA case involving a threat of a personnel action may proceed on the basis of a challenge to the threat through an IRA appeal; it may also proceed, with a request for a stay of the threatened personnel action. [Stay requests, including threatened or potential personnel actions, are discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-20-229.html#sec13-221">Stays of Personnel Actions.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Early Board commentary on WPA "threat" jurisdiction is taken from two related decisions. <span class="Italic">Gergick v. GSA</span>, 43 MSPR 651, 656-59 (1990), considered jurisdiction, through interlocutory appeal, of the appellant's request for a stay of any personnel action encompassed within a notice (called a "record of inquiry") to the appellant that suggested possible violations of agency standards of conduct or behavior could result in unspecified disciplinary action against the appellant. The notice to the appellant invited the appellant to respond by submitting comments or information. The Board granted the stay as it explained its jurisdiction to do so:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[C]overage of threatened personnel actions was added to section 2302(b)(8) by the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, 103 Stat. 16 (1989), and...in enacting this legislation, both the House and the Senate intended that the term "threaten" be given a fairly broad interpretation.[3] A joint explanatory statement "express[ing] the mutual understanding [of] the Senate and House floor managers of the bill as to the intent of its provisions," 135 Cong. Rec. S2781 (daily ed. Mar. 16, 1989) (statement of Senator Levin), includes a statement that "no actual proposal of a personnel action is necessary to establish a prohibited personnel practice." 135 Cong. Rec. H750 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1989) (statement of Rep. Sikorski). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 135 Cong. Rec. S2784 (daily ed. Mar. 16, 1989) (assertion in joint explanatory statement, which was printed in the Congressional Record at the request of Senator Levin, that "[m]ere harassment and threats, without any formally proposed personnel action, can constitute a prohibited personnel practice under [the] language [of the statute]").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The word "threaten" is not defined specifically in the statute or in the Board's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e note that the term "threaten" has been defined as including the following: "to give signs of the approach of (something evil or unpleasant): indicate as impending: PORTEND (the sky [threatens] a storm)" and "to announce as intended or possible ([threaten] to buy a car)." <span class="Italic">Webster's Third International Dictionary</span> (1971). We find that this definition is consistent with the broad interpretation of the term that, as we have stated above, Congress intended. We therefore adopt it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he content of the record of inquiry in this case supports a finding that that notice constitutes a threat to discipline the appellant. It is true that the document does not include a statement that disciplinary action was being proposed. It also does not include a specific reference to any particular kind of disciplinary action that could be imposed on the appellant. Instead, it includes a statement that the record of inquiry was "to gather facts to aid in making a decision regarding an incident of questionable conduct." As we have indicated above, however, the inquiry made specific reference to certain alleged facts, and it included a statement that those facts appeared to reflect violations that "could result in disciplinary action" against the appellant. The language quoted above indicates that the record of inquiry was intended in part to serve as a notice to the appellant that disciplinary action against him was possible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he record of inquiry was issued only after the agency had conducted an investigation of the appellant's activities, and after it had compiled a substantial file concerning those activities. The fact that the agency was still pursuing the matter, after having spent a substantial amount of time and effort on an investigation, indicates that the record of inquiry reflected more than a passing thought of disciplinary action, and that the likelihood of disciplinary action therefore was not insignificant. This circumstance provides further support for the position that the agency's action is among those for which Congress intended to provide appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find here that any record of inquiry or similar notice, standing alone, necessarily constitutes a "threat[] to take...a personnel action," as that term is used in the Whistleblower Protection Act. In light of the particular circumstances described above, however, including the extensive investigation that preceded the action at issue here, we find that the issuance of the record of inquiry in this case meets the dictionary definition of "threaten" that we have adopted above, and that it does constitute a "threat" within the meaning of the Whistleblower Protection Act. The appellant therefore has met this part of his burden of establishing Board jurisdiction over this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second jurisdictional issue we must address concerns the nature of the action the agency has threatened to take. The Board's regulations provide that a request for a stay of a threatened personnel action cannot be granted in the absence of evidence and/or argument demonstrating that there is a substantial likelihood that the action threatened is a "personnel action," as that term is defined in section 1209.5(a) of those regulations. 5 CFR 1209.15(a)(5)(i)<span class="Italic">. See also</span> 5 USC 1213(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "substantial likelihood" is not defined in the regulations or in the Whistleblower Protection Act. We note that the meaning of that term varies according to the context in which it is used. <span class="Italic">See</span> 83 C.J.S. <span class="Italic">Substantial</span> (1953) ("[t]he word 'substantial'...is of varied meaning, and is susceptible of different meanings according to the circumstances of its use" (footnotes omitted)). We also note, however, that the term generally is said to refer to "something worthwhile as distinguished from something without value or merely nominal"; that it is said to mean "of real worth and importance," "more than 'seeming or imaginary,'" and "not illusive"; and that it is said to "indicate that which is serious as opposed to that which is trivial." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find these definitions appropriate in the context of the Whistleblower Protection Act, and we therefore will apply them in considering whether the appellant has met his burden of proving his entitlement to a stay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1209.5(a) defines a "personnel action" as including an adverse action under chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, "or other disciplinary or corrective action." We note that our review of the nature of the action or actions threatened in this case is complicated by the fact that the agency has not identified specifically the kind or kinds of actions it may take in connection with its record of inquiry. The agency has not denied, however, that it ultimately may effect some kind of adverse action (such as a removal, a demotion, or a suspension of more than 14 calendar days). Furthermore, the agency's reference to a possible violation of its standards of acceptable conduct or behavior indicates that any charges arising from the agency's inquiry may be serious enough in nature to support an adverse action. Finally, as we have noted above the agency stated, in the record of inquiry, that the allegations concerning the appellant's conduct could result in "disciplinary action" against him. We therefore equate the threatened personnel action at issue in this case <span id="Page_3880"></span>with a "personnel action," as that term is defined in 5 CFR 1209.5(a), and we find that the Board has jurisdiction over this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With the stay in <span class="Italic">Gergick</span> in force, the Board issued a related decision concerning its jurisdiction over the appeal on the merits, <span class="Italic">Gergick v. GSA</span>, 49 MSPR 384, 390-93 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency appears to be suggesting that only actions that have been taken or actions that have been proposed may be the subject of an individual-right-of-action appeal. In support of this argument, it notes that 5 USC 1221, which concerns this category of appeals, provides as follows in paragraph (a):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section [which concerns actions that may be appealed directly to the Board under other laws, rules, or regulations] and subsection 1214(a)(3), an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may, with respect to any personnel action taken, or proposed to be taken, against such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8), seek corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1221(a), when read in isolation, does appear to provide that threatened actions cannot be the subject of individual-right-of-action appeals. Section 1214, however, which also was enacted as part of the WPA, and to which section 1221 specifically refers, indicates that those actions may be appealed under section 1221. Paragraph (a)(3) of section 1214 provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Except in a case in which an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has the right to appeal directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board under any law, rule, or regulation, any such employee, former employee, or applicant shall seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before seeking corrective action from the Board. An employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may seek corrective action from the Board under section 1221, if such employee, former employee, or applicant seeks corrective action for a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8) from the Special Counsel and--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)(i) the Special Counsel notifies such employee, former employee, or applicant that an investigation concerning such employee, former employee, or applicant has been terminated....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This section clearly provides that, regardless of the apparently restrictive scope of section 1221, an employee may "seek corrective action from the Board" under the latter section if (1) the matter at issue consists of a prohibited personnel practice described in 5 USC 2302(b)(8), and (2) the employee first seeks corrective action from the Special Counsel. The kind of action alleged to have occurred here--a threat to discipline the appellant in retaliation for making protected disclosures to OSC--is covered by 5 USC 2302(b)(8). Furthermore, the appellant sought corrective action from OSC before filing his appeal with the Board's regional office. We therefore find that this appeal is covered by 5 USC 1221.[13]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;The agency argues, based partly on this section's alleged failure to cover threatened actions, that references in the WPA and in the Board's regulations to threatened actions should be interpreted as references to proposed actions. For two reasons, we find this argument unpersuasive. First, as we have stated above, 5 USC 1221 covers threatened actions. Second, as we indicated in our decision granting the appellant's motion for a stay, Congress clearly intended to cover under the WPA threatened actions that had not actually been proposed....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge...found that...the appellant had failed to demonstrate that he had been affected by a threatened action appealable to the Board. He rejected the appellant's argument that the inquiry constituted a decision concerning the appellant's pay or concerning a change in duties or responsibilities, and he found that neither an inquiry nor an investigation was included among the actions, identified in 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A), that could constitute a "personnel action" covered by the WPA. He also found (1) that the record of inquiry was, at most, an indication that action might be taken or proposed in the future, and (2) that such a "chance" could not constitute a threatened personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not concur in this reasoning. As we noted in our decision of February 28, 1990, concerning the appellant's motion for a stay, the definition of "personnel action" that applies to cases such as this covers "disciplinary or corrective action[s]," including disciplinary or corrective actions that do not constitute adverse actions under 5 USC chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gergick</span>, 43 MSPR at 657-59; 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A); 5 CFR 1209.5(a). Neither the applicable statutory provision defining "personnel action" nor the applicable regulatory provision defining that term restricts coverage to an action affecting an employee's pay, duties, or responsibilities, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A); 5 CFR 1209.5(a), and we see no other basis for finding that the term is restricted in this manner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that the appellant is appealing a threat to take disciplinary action, and not a threat to undertake an inquiry or investigation. Accordingly, the failure of the applicable definition to cover inquiries and investigations does not cause this appeal to be outside the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the agency appears to concur in the administrative judge's statements that there was only an indication or "chance" that an action would be taken, and that this did not constitute a sufficient basis on which to find that a personnel action had been threatened. It argues further that <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> (5th ed. 1971) includes a more appropriate definition of "threat" than the definition on which we relied in our Opinion of February 28.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not concur in these statements and arguments. As we stated in our earlier decision, Congress intended, when enacting the WPA, that the term "threaten" be given a broad interpretation. <span class="Italic">Gergick</span>, 43 MSPR at 656. Furthermore, the agency gives no reasons for its argument that the Board should adopt a different definition of the term. In addition, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the definition provided in <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> is more appropriate than the one we adopted in our February 28 decision, we see no proper basis for concluding that definition is different in any material way from the definition we adopted in our previous decision.[14]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;The agency asserts, citing <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> (5th ed. 1979), that "a threat must involve a declaration of present determination or intent to inflict harm."...One of the sentences included in the cited definition does define the term "threat" in that manner. <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> 1327 (5th ed. 1979). That sentence, however, is followed immediately by the following sentence: "A statement may constitute a threat even though it is subject to a possible contingency in the maker's control." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The definition cited by the agency therefore does not support the view that a statement or action cannot be a threat unless there has been a firm decision to carry out the action threatened. It also does not support the agency's apparent view...that a showing that no formal action has resulted from the record of inquiry establishes that no action was threatened.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Burns v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 293, 297-98 (1990), for the Board to acquire jurisdiction over threatened personnel actions in a WPA case, the appellant must specifically identity the threats:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the appellant's contention that he is entitled to equitable relief of ongoing protection because he is experiencing continuing threats and harassment, we note that the ongoing threats have not been specified by the appellant. Rather, his appeal is based on generalized assertions and fears unsupported by references to any specific matter. Therefore, this allegation does not provide the appellant with the right to appeal to the Board under the Act....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unspecific allegations of perceived current and possible future threats or reprisals were insufficient to sustain Board jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 298 (1990), and in <span class="Italic">Mulherin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 289 (1990). <span class="Italic">Godfrey</span> determined, 45 MSPR at 302-04:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant argues that the appeal remains within the scope of the Board's jurisdiction under the Act because he seeks protection from perceived current and future reprisals. In addition to the disciplinary actions noted previously, he requests that the Board "issue a continuing stay against the Air Force prohibiting any undesired personnel action of any sort being taken regarding the appellant." He has made these assertions in both his response to the agency's motion to dismiss and his petition for review (PFR), as well as in correspondence and submissions both preceding and subsequent to the motion. We find, however, that even now these allegations remain so lacking in specificity that they cannot serve to invoke the Board's jurisdiction under the Act, and thus agree with the administrative judge that they neither prevent the appeal of the reprimand from being moot nor provide an additional basis for appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction under the Act extends to personnel actions that are threatened because of whistleblowing activities. 5 USC 2302(b)(8); 5 CFR 1209.2. Moreover, the Board has recently held that Congress intended a broad interpretation of the term "threatened" when it passed the Act. <span class="Italic">Gergick v. General Services Administration</span>, 43 MSPR 651, 656 (1990). Indeed, as we noted there, the legislative history of the Act states that "[m]ere harassment and threats, without any formally proposed personnel action, can constitute a prohibited personnel practice...." 135 Cong. Rec. S2784 (daily ed. Mar. 16, 1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no evidence in the legislative history, however, that Congress intended to extend the right to bring an Individual Right of Action appeal to the Board under 5 USC 1221 based solely on generalized assertions and fears unsupported by reference to any specific matter. On the contrary, even the broadest interpretation of Congressional intent, as exemplified by the excerpt from the Congressional Record quoted immediately above, strongly suggests that <span class="Italic">some</span> concrete manifestation--(such as) "mere harassment and threat"--is required. Accordingly, for a right of appeal to accrue under the Act, the appellant must cite a threatened, <span id="Page_3881"></span>proposed, taken or not taken "personnel action." That term, defined at 5 USC 2302(a)(2) and 5 CFR 1209.5(a), includes a broad range of actions that may affect an employee, former employee, or applicant, but each is a concrete matter that can be taken or done by an agency, and reviewed (and undone) by the Board. With the exception of the now-cancelled reprimand, the appellant has pointed to nothing that the Board may examine as evidence of a prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the appellant's affidavit, he states that "[t]he documents we have submitted, as well as this affidavit, factually support our belief that [his] supervisors have not only taken retaliatory acts...but hope, plan, and expect to in the future have us fired and/or disciplined etc...." Review of that document, though, as well as of the rest of the record, is unavailing with respect to that basis of "factual[] support." While the appellant submitted statements concerning the degree of discipline meted out to employees who have not been whistleblowers, arguing that he would have been treated more harshly, absent evidence that he was, in fact, so disadvantaged, the Board finds no matter in these generalized contentions that falls within the scope of its broadened jurisdiction under the Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Rebstock Consol. V. DHS</span>, 122 MSPR 661, 667-68 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12, 2015 MSPB 53 (2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellants failed to nonfrivolously allege that an individual with authority threatened to take disciplinary action against them for failing to follow the agency's memoranda and policy directives concerning the enforcement of Federal immigration law. The Board has held that the term "threaten" in section 2302 should be interpreted broadly.<span class="Italic"> Campo v. Department of the Army</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 5 (2002). Applying this broad construction, the Board has found threatened personnel actions where a counseling memorandum warned of possible future discipline, <span class="Italic">id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8, and where a supervisor stated that an employee should not expect the same performance rating he had received the year before, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Hathaway</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 595, 600, 608 (1991),<span class="Italic"> aff'd</span>, 981 F.2d 1237 (Fed. Cir. 1992). An appellant's generalized assertions and fears of discipline, without reference to any specific matter, however, fall below the modest standard for alleging a threatened personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Godfrey v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 298, 303 (1990).[6] <span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The appellants advance on review that the controlling question is whether a reasonable person would believe that the agency threatened to take a personnel action. Although the Board employs a reasonable person standard when considering whether an employee has made a protected whistleblowing disclosure under section 2302(b)(8), this standard does not apply to whether an appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that the agency threatened to take a personnel action in violation of section 2302. <span class="Italic">See Webb v. Department of the Interior</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 248, &#x00B6; 6 (2015); <span class="Italic">Godfrey</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. at 303.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellants have alleged only that they <span class="Italic">believe</span> they will face disciplinary action if they disregard the agency's memoranda. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> CAF, Tab 8 at 35 ("[Appellant] Martin believes that he faces the threat of disciplinary action if he follows federal law...contrary to [the agency's memoranda]."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> CAF, Tab 11 at 8-9 ("I fear that if I follow federal law...I will be suspended and ultimately terminated."). Totally lacking from the appellants' submissions, however, is any reference to a verbal or written statement, admonishment, or notice from the agency that they risk possible disciplinary action if they do not follow the agency's guidance. <span class="Italic">See Godfrey</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. at 303 ("<span class="Italic">some</span> concrete manifestation--(such as) 'mere harassment and threat'--is required") (emphasis in original). The appellants thus have offered nothing to support their claim of threatened discipline other than their own subjective suspicions that they could be disciplined. Abstract concerns about possible disciplinary action, without any evidence that the agency actually has threatened or suggested it would take such action, do not constitute nonfrivolous allegations that the agency threatened to take a personnel action in violation of section 2302. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Daniels v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 248, &#x00B6; 8 (2007) (finding that the agency's suggestion that an employee might not be qualified for her job did not constitute a threatened personnel action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants' assertion, that they fear disciplinary action "based upon official communications to them...from their superiors, past events, and public sources," does not change our conclusion. As the administrative judge acknowledged in his initial decision, vague, conclusory, and unsupported allegations do not satisfy the Board's nonfrivolous pleading standard, <span class="Italic">see Aviles v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, No. 14-60645, 2015 WL 5010031, at *8 (5th Cir. Aug. 24, 2015); <span class="Italic">Linder v. Department of Justice</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 14 (2014); <span class="Italic">McDonnell v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 7 (2008). We concur with the administrative judge that the appellants' assumption, that they may face disciplinary action based upon "past events" and "public sources," does not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that they were threatened with a personnel action. Additionally, the appellants' oblique reference to implied threats of discipline in "official communications," standing alone, fails to nonfrivolously allege that the agency threatened to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See McDonnell</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">see also Rzucidlo v. Department of the Army</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 17 (2006). As the Board's decisions make clear, despite the broad reading afforded to the term "threatened," the agency must take some action signifying its intent to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Gergick v. General Services Administration</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 651, 656 (1990) (adopting the dictionary definition of the term "threaten"). We thus agree with the administrative judge that the appellants failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency threatened to take a personnel action against them.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A cautionary email from a supervisor was not a threat for IRA purposes, <span class="Italic">Skubik v. Dept. of Army</span>, PH-1221-16-0347-W-1 (NP 2/9/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To prevail in his IRA appeal, the appellant must prove that the agency threatened, proposed, took, or failed to take a "personnel action," as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), (b)(9); <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 298, 303 (1990). The term "threatened" is afforded a broad interpretation, such that an agency does not have to state that disciplinary action is being proposed or specifically reference a particular kind of discipline to constitute a threatened personnel action. <span class="Italic">Gergick v. General Services Administration,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. 651, 656-57 (1990). Nevertheless, for a statement to constitute a threat of a personnel action, the agency must take some action signifying its intent to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Rebstock Consolidation v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 661, &#x00B6; 12 (2015).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that his supervisor threatened him with disciplinary action in her January 12, 2015 email; however, the statements to which he refers do not signify the requisite intent to take a disciplinary action. In her email, the appellant's supervisor notified him that she did not view his behavior during their January 7 and 9, 2015 meetings as professional but was "overlooking the behavior this time[.]" She further stated that she expected the appellant to act professionally in the future and that "[a]ny unprofessional behavior will be handled appropriately." The supervisor's decision not to take a disciplinary action for the behavior she deemed unprofessional and issue a general reminder that unprofessional behavior could result in disciplinary action, without more, does not indicate an intent to take a disciplinary action and thus does not constitute a personnel action under the WPEA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lith v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 168 F.3d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table) (nonprecedential) (affirming that a letter of understanding that cautioned the appellant that if he again engaged in certain behavior he could be disciplined in the future was not a personnel action); <span class="Italic">cf. Gergick</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. at 657 (finding that the record of inquiry issued to the appellant constituted a threatened personnel action whereby the document, standing alone, did not necessarily constitute a threat to take a personnel action, but in light of the extensive investigation that preceded the issuance of the record of inquiry, the likelihood of disciplinary action was not insignificant).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument-that the email should be considered a personnel action because it could serve as the basis for future discipline-is not persuasive. A general statement that future misconduct might result in disciplinary action remains a truism for any employee, at any time. <span class="Italic">See Koch v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, 48 F. App'x 778, 787 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (nonprecedential) ("A wide range of agency rules, directives, and counseling measures contain the message, implicit or explicit, that failure to follow those directives or to meet expectations may have adverse consequences...[N]ot all such general statements...constitute actionable 'threats' to take adverse action within the meaning of the Whistleblower Protection Act."). To prevent a supervisor from providing a general reminder to an employee that prospective misconduct could result in disciplinary action would hamper an agency's ability to effectively manage its workforce. <span class="Italic">Cf. Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981) (including the clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated in committing an offense, or had been warned about the conduct in question, in the nonexhaustive list of factors relevant to the penalty determination in adverse action cases). Accordingly, we reject the appellant's argument that a general warning of the consequences of future misconduct, such as the one at issue here, is a personnel action protected under the WPEA.</p>

He implies that the remark in question, that Livengood should not expect to get the same rating as last year (a highly successful), could mean that Livengood could receive one of four other ratings in the five level performance appraisal system, one of those ratings being outstanding. Under the circumstances of daily harassment described by Livengood and credited by the CALJ, it would be unreasonable to construe the remark to mean anything other than an unsatisfactory rating, especially when the remark is considered together with the threat of removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, contrary to respondent's belief, <span class="Italic">Gergick v. General Services Administration</span>, 43 MSPR 651 (1990) does not preclude a finding that a single remark about Livengood's future performance appraisal constitutes a threat. In <span class="Italic">Gergick</span> the Board adopted the dictionary definition of the term "threaten." Under that definition, "threaten" means, among other things, "to give signs of the approach of (something evil or unpleasant)." <span class="Italic">Gergick</span> at 656. Hathaway's statement about Livengood's performance appraisal certainly meets this definition. The fact that the performance rating was mentioned only once does not make it any less a threat.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent also argues that his remark to Livengood about the performance rating could not be viewed as a threat because there was no evidence that he either initiated procedures to start a performance-based action against Livengood or communicated that intent to his superiors. However, as noted in <span class="Italic">Gergick</span>, the legislative history of section 2302(b)(8) of the WPA shows the intent of Congress that the term "threaten" be given a very broad interpretation. <span class="Italic">Gergick</span> at 656. Further, the joint explanatory statement expressing the understanding of the floor managers of the bill as to the intent of the provisions regarding threats, includes the statement that "no actual proposal of a personnel action is necessary to establish a prohibited personnel practice." 135 Cong. Rec. H750 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1989) (statement of Rep. Sikorski). Thus, the Board concludes that respondent's statement regarding the performance rating was a threat.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also finds that Livengood's protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the threatened personnel actions. First, we note that unlike count one, Hathaway was aware of the whistleblowing at the time he made the charged threats. He learned of the disclosures and the substance of them on August 4, 1989.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, Livengood's disclosures were about serious matters--allegedly improper discontinued service retirements--and could well have been a provocation for reprisal. Indeed, respondent showed by his behavior at the August 4th meeting with Livengood and the IG that he was angry about the whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the record shows that during August and September respondent's treatment of Livengood changed following his knowledge of Livengood's protected conduct. Respondent called Livengood into his office on a daily basis where he was subject to harsh criticism. His work was also subject to closer scrutiny. Most notably, respondent's threat to give Livengood an unsatisfactory rating on his next performance appraisal was made while handing Livengood his current rating, "highly satisfactory," which covered a performance period prior to Livengood's disclosures to the IG and before the next appraisal period was completed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the record shows that respondent was reflecting on this protected conduct when he made the threats at issue. Livengood testified that respondent told him that when the Special Counsel "gets through with this" respondent would remove him from federal service. Based on these circumstances, it is clear that Livengood's protected conduct was a contributing factor in the personnel actions threatened in count four.</p>
