<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-197"><span class="space">b.</span> Distinctions Between Successorship and Accretion</h5>
<p class="noindent">The dividing lines between accretion and successorship may be indistinct. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Fleet and Indus. Supply Ctr. and AFGE Local 53</span>, 52 FLRA 950 (1997) ("<span class="Italic">FISC, Norfolk II</span>"), helped to clarify the distinction between successorship and accretion in reorganization cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;if transferred employees are not included in, and constitute a majority of the employees in, a separate appropriate unit, a petition claiming successorship will be dismissed;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;claims of accretion are then considered, and if the transferred employees are functionally and administratively integrated into the gaining organization's pre-existing unit(s), and that adding the transferred employees to the unit(s) would be appropriate under section 7112(a), an accretion will be found and the unit will be clarified;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;if including the transferred employees in an established unit would not be appropriate, any petitions claiming an accretion, as well as the petitions claiming successorship, will be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 53</span> explained, 52 FLRA at 958-64:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Department of the Navy's decision to consolidate and reorganize its purchasing and supply functions, and the resultant representation petitions that were filed in this case, have presented us with an opportunity to clarify how we will analyze reorganization cases in which both successorship principles and accretion principles are claimed to apply to the same employees. Based upon our careful consideration of these principles, as well as the arguments presented, we have concluded that the most expeditious way to resolve such cases is to begin with a determination of whether the transferred employees are included in, and constitute a majority of the employees in, a separate appropriate unit in the new employing entity. We begin our analysis with this determination because, under section 7112(a) of the Statute, it is the first analytic step in resolving <span class="Italic">both</span> successorship and accretion claims. Once this determination has been made, we will proceed to apply either the remaining successorship principles, or the remaining accretion principles, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We, therefore, adopt, and will henceforth apply, the following framework when resolving cases arising from a reorganization where employees are transferred to a pre-existing or newly established organization and both successorship and accretion principles are claimed to apply:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Initially, we will determine whether employees who have been transferred are included in, and constitute a majority of, a separate appropriate unit(s) in the gaining organization under section 7112(a). The outcome of this inquiry will govern whether successorship or accretion principles should next be applied.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;If it is determined that the transferred employees <span class="Italic">are included in a separate appropriate</span> <span class="Italic">unit(s</span>) in the gaining organization under section 7112(a), and if they constitute a majority of the employees in that unit(s), we will apply the remainder of the successorship factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> [<span class="Italic">Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, Port Hueneme,</span> 50 FLRA 363 (1995)] with respect to the unit(s) determined to be appropriate. The outcome of the <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> analysis will determine whether the gaining organization is a successor for purposes of collective bargaining with the labor organization(s) that represented the transferred employees at their previous employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;If it is determined that the transferred employees <span class="Italic">are not included in, and constitute a</span> <span class="Italic">majority of employees in, a separate appropriate</span> <span class="Italic">unit</span> in the gaining organization, we will apply the Authority's long-established accretion principles. The outcome <span id="page_200"></span>of this analysis will determine whether the transferred employees have accreted to a pre-existing unit in the gaining organization.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we examine whether the transferred employees are included in a separate appropriate unit in the gaining organization and if they constitute a majority of the employees in that unit. This step in the analysis corresponds to the first factor set forth in <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>, which requires, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that "the post-transfer unit must be appropriate[.]" <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>, 50 FLRA at 368. Although not expressly stated in <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>, a successorship finding can be made only if the employees at issue are included in a <span class="Italic">separate</span> appropriate unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7112(a) of the Statute, a unit may be determined to be appropriate only if it will: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings with the agency involved; and (3) promote efficiency of the operations of the agency involved. <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency, Aerospace</span> <span class="Italic">Center, St. Louis, Missouri</span>, 46 FLRA 502, 509 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Mapping Agency</span>). In making determinations under section 7112(a), the Authority examines the factors presented on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Air Force</span>, <span class="Italic">Air Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</span>, 47 FLRA 602 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson AFB</span>). In order to be included in a separate appropriate unit, the evidence must demonstrate that the employees at issue have significant employment concerns or personnel issues that are different or unique from those of other employees in the gaining organization. The evidence must also demonstrate that the disputed employees have not been so integrated, either physically or functionally, with other organizational components that the establishment of a separate unit would cause undue unit fragmentation resulting in operational inefficiency and confusion in dealings between labor and management. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example, Defense Logistics Agency</span>, <span class="Italic">Defense Contract Management Command, Defense Contract</span> <span class="Italic">Management District, North Central, Defense Plant</span> <span class="Italic">Representative Office--Thiokol, Brigham City, Utah</span>, 41 FLRA 316 (1991) (<span class="Italic">DPRO Thiokol</span>) (Authority found that disputed employees constituted a separate appropriate unit where: employees had specific local concerns that might result in grievances or bargaining issues unique to the facility; the facility commander had authority to address such grievances and bargaining matters; and the facility commander had responsibility for its day-to-day operations). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Dependents Schools and Overseas Education Association, NEA</span>, 48 FLRA 1076 (1993) and <span class="Italic">General Services Administration, National Capital Region</span>, 5 FLRA 285 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fundamental premise of the first criterion--that employees share a clear and identifiable community of interest--is to ensure that it is "possible for them to deal collectively [with management] as a single group." <span class="Italic">See Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration</span>, <span class="Italic">Southwest Region, Tulsa Airway Facilities Sector</span>, 3 FLRC 235, 237 (1975) (<span class="Italic">Tulsa AFS</span>), citing a task force report to President Kennedy, <span class="Italic">A Policy for Employee-Management</span> <span class="Italic">Cooperation in the Federal Sector</span>, November 30, 1961. In assessing this criterion, the Authority has not specified the particular factors or the number of factors needed to find a clear and identifiable community of interest. <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Region II, New York, New York</span>, 43 FLRA 1245, 1254 (1992) (<span class="Italic">HHS Region</span> <span class="Italic">II</span>). Nevertheless, the Authority examines such factors as whether the employees in the proposed unit: are a part of the same organizational component of the agency; support the same mission; are subject to the same chain of command; have similar or related duties, job titles and work assignments; are subject to the same general working conditions; and are governed by the same personnel and labor relations policies that are administered by the same personnel office. <span class="Italic">See Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, 47 FLRA 602; <span class="Italic">HHS Region II</span>, 43 FLRA 1245. In addition, factors such as geographic proximity, unique conditions of employment, distinct local concerns, degree of interchange between other organizational components, and functional or operational separation may be relevant. <span class="Italic">See Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 46 FLRA 502.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Effective dealings and efficiency of operations must also be examined in any case that raises appropriate unit issues.[6] The criterion of effective dealings pertains to the relationship between management and the exclusive representative selected by unit employees in an appropriate bargaining unit. In assessing this requirement the Authority examines such factors as: the past collective bargaining experience of the parties; the locus and scope of authority of the responsible personnel office administering personnel policies covering employees in the proposed unit; the limitations, if any, on the negotiation of matters of critical concern to employees in the proposed unit; and the level at which labor relations policy is set in the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation, Washington, D.C.</span>, 5 FLRA 646 (1981) (<span class="Italic">DOT); Defense Supply Agency, Defense Contract</span> <span class="Italic">Administration Services Region (DCASR), San Francisco</span>, <span class="Italic">California, et al.</span>, 4 FLRC 669 (1976) (<span class="Italic">DCASR</span>); <span class="Italic">Department of State, Passport Office, Chicago Passport Agency, Chicago, Illinois</span>, 8 A/SLMR 946 (1978) (<span class="Italic">Chicago Passport Agency</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Under prior Authority precedent, there are few decisions that address these criteria with any degree of specificity. Nevertheless, the Authority has always required that any unit found to be appropriate satisfy equally each of the criteria set forth in section 7112(a). <span class="Italic">See, for example, AFGE</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 2004</span>, 47 FLRA at 973 (Authority rejected the agency's argument that the RD had failed to give equal weight to each of the unit criteria). <span class="Italic">See also Tulsa AFS</span>, 3 FLRC 235 (discussing the development of this requirement under Executive Order 11491). Consistent with this standard, we will continue to require that each of the appropriate unit criteria be given equal weight in order to further the statutory goal of a more effective and efficient Government.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The criterion of efficiency of agency operations concerns the "benefits to be derived from a unit structure which bears some rational relationship to the operational and organizational structure of the agency." <span class="Italic">DCASR</span>, 4 FLRC at 681. That is, a unit that bears a rational relationship to an agency's operational and organizational structure could result in economic savings and increased productivity to the agency. Consequently, factors to be examined in assessing efficiency of agency operations pertain to the effect of the proposed unit on agency operations in terms of cost, productivity and use of resources. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Local No. 3, International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, AFL-CIO-CLC</span>, 7 FLRA 626, 627 (1982); <span class="Italic">DOT</span>, 5 FLRA at 653; <span class="Italic">Chicago Passport Agency</span>, 8 A/SLMR at 947-48.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Application of the foregoing criteria to the facts of each case will determine the appropriateness of any proposed unit.&#x2003;If the Authority finds that the transferred employees are included in, and constitute a majority of the employees in, a separate appropriate unit in the gaining organization, we will proceed to determine whether the remaining successorship factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> have been met. Alternatively, if we find that the transferred employees are not included in, and constitute a majority of the employees in, a separate appropriate unit, we will proceed to determine whether the transferred employees have accreted to another bargaining unit, as claimed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon a finding that the transferred employees are included in, and constitute a majority of the employees in, a separate appropriate unit in the gaining organization, the remaining successorship factors enunciated in <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> will be applied. In particular, the following must then be examined: whether the gaining organization has substantially the same organizational mission as the losing entity, with the transferred employees performing substantially the same duties and functions under substantially similar working conditions after the transfer; and whether an election is necessary to determine the representation rights of the transferred employees. <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>, 50 FLRA at 368.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If all of the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> have been met, we will find that successorship exists and, as a result, that the gaining organization must recognize without a secret ballot election the exclusive representative of the transferred employees prior to their transfer. An appropriate certification will, accordingly, be issued and any competing accretion petition(s) for the same group of employees will be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon a finding that the transferred employees are not included in, and constitute a majority of the employees in, a separate appropriate unit, the petition claiming successorship will be dismissed. It is then necessary to consider all claims of accretion and, consequently, determine whether the transferred employees should be accreted to a pre-existing bargaining unit in the gaining organization. If it is concluded that the transferred employees are functionally and administratively integrated into the gaining organization's pre-existing unit(s), and that adding the transferred employees to the unit(s) would be appropriate under section 7112(a), an accretion will be found. <span class="Italic">See, for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, 47 FLRA 602. The unit will then be clarified to include the accreted employees. If including the transferred employees in an established unit would not be appropriate, any petition(s) claiming an accretion, as well as the petitions claiming successorship, will be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deciding questions concerning accretion, it has long been established that the Authority is bound, as in successorship, by the three criteria for determining the appropriateness of any unit set forth in section 7112(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations</span> <span class="Italic">Office, Oak Ridge Tennessee</span>, 15 FLRA 130, 132 (1984).</p>

Meade, Maryland</span>, 32 FLRA 567 (1988), the activity sought a determination as to whether, due to the reorganization of its aviation support facilities, certain support facility employees should be accreted to a bargaining unit represented by NAGE at the facility to which they had been administratively transferred. The employees at issue were physically disbursed throughout four locations in three states and, prior to the reorganization, had been represented in separate units by four AFGE locals. Despite the fact that the transferred employees continued to work in the same locations and under the same immediate supervision <span id="page_201"></span>as before the reorganization and had been represented by other unions, the Authority concluded that they had accreted to the unit represented by NAGE. In so concluding, the Authority specifically noted that the transferred employees had been organizationally and operationally integrated with the employees of the established NAGE unit and were no longer under the command and control of their prior commands. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also HHS Region II</span>, 43 FLRA 1245; <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, New England</span> <span class="Italic">Region</span>, 20 FLRA 224 (1985) (<span class="Italic">FAA); Department of the Navy</span>, <span class="Italic">Naval Supply Center, Oakland</span>, <span class="Italic">California</span>, 5 FLRA 775 (1981).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority has also held that successorship claims should be resolved prior to accretion claims because a finding of successorship permits a union to retain its status as the employees' chosen, exclusive representative, rather than altering the relationship between the employees and their chosen representative by placing the employees in a different unit. <span class="Italic">See United States Department of the Navy, Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Norfolk, Virginia</span>, 52 FLRA 950, 954 (1997) (<span class="Italic">FISC</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with these policies, we hold that, when we are presented with competing successorship claims alleging different appropriate units, we will first consider the appropriate unit claim that will most fully preserve the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>in terms of unit structure and the relationship of employees to their chosen exclusive representative. If we find that a petitioned-for, existing unit continues to be appropriate, then we will not address any petitions that attempt to establish different unit structures, because the Statute requires only that a proposed unit be an appropriate unit, not the most, or the only, appropriate unit. <span class="Italic">See Bremerton, </span>53 FLRA at 183 n.9.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">FISC</span>, the Authority adopted the following framework for resolving cases arising from a reorganization where employees are transferred to a pre-existing or newly established organization (the "gaining organization") and both successorship and accretion principles are claimed to apply:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The first step in this framework "corresponds to the first factor set forth in <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>, which requires, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that 'the post-transfer unit must be appropriate[.]'" <span class="Italic">FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 959 (quoting <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>, 50 FLRA at 368). As stated by the RD, a unit may be deemed to be appropriate under &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute only if it will: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings with the agency involved; and (3) promote efficiency of the operations of the agency involved. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 959-62.

<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first appropriate unit criterion--whether employees share a clear and identifiable community of interest--the Authority examines such factors as geographic proximity, unique conditions of employment, distinct local concerns, degree of interchange between other organizational components, and functional or operational separation. <span class="Italic">See FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 961 (citations omitted). In addition, the Authority considers factors such as whether the employees in the proposed unit are a part of the same organizational component of the agency; support the same mission; are subject to the same chain of command; have similar or related duties, job titles and work assignments; are subject to the same general working conditions; and are governed by the same personnel office. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 960-61.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAGE argues that the Code 975 employees at Point Loma share an identifiable community of interest that is separate and distinct from other FRCSW employees.&#x2003;In this regard, NAGE argues that the Code 975 employees market themselves out as a group with a brochure, that ninety percent of their work comes from sources outside FRCSW, and that viewing these employees as part of the IAMAW and IFPTE units of FRCSW employees "erases their identity as a specialized group. NAGE asserts that Code 975 is "technically sound" and "performs more specialized tasks" than FRCSW.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, considering the factors set forth above that the Authority examines when determining whether employees share a community of interest, the RD found that the Code 975 employees were administratively and organizationally integrated into FRCSW. In this regard, the RD found that the Code 975 now report to the FRCSW Commanding Officer; are subject to the same personnel and general policies set by the FRCSW Commanding Officer; are compensated from the FRCSW budget managed by the FRCSW Comptroller; and are serviced by the same human resources organization, TFM, that services all FRCSW employees.<span class="Italic"> </span>Further, as the RD found, decisions related to personnel and labor <span id="page_202"></span>relations are now handled at the level above Point Loma; disciplinary actions, formal grievances, and negotiations are now handled by TFM, not by local management at Point Loma.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAGE's assertions do not dispute the RD's findings, and do not demonstrate that the RD inappropriately applied the community of interest criterion because they do not establish that Code 975 employees: have duties that are different from those of the other FRCSW employees; report to a different chain of command than other FRCSW employees; are subject to different working conditions, organizational components, or job titles than other FRCSW employees; and support a different mission than other FRCSW employees. <span class="Italic">See FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 960-61.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, NAGE has not demonstrated that the RD failed to apply established law in finding that the Code 975 employees do not share a clear and identifiable community of interest separate and distinct from other FRCSW employees.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;As set forth in <span class="Italic">Military Traffic Mgmt. Command, </span>60 FLRA at 394, all three criteria under &#x00A7; 7112(a) must be satisfied in order to establish that a unit remains appropriate. Here, as the first criterion is not met, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether the proposed unit would promote effective dealings with FRCSW or promote the efficiency of FRCSW's operations. For purposes of this decision, however, we nonetheless analyze the other factors, as set forth below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing the effective dealings criterion, the Authority examines such factors as the past collective bargaining experience of the parties; the locus and scope of authority of the responsible personnel office administering personnel policies covering employees in the proposed unit, the limitations, if any on the negotiation of matters of critical concern to the employees in the proposed unit; and the level at which labor relations is set by the agency. <span class="Italic">FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 961.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth previously, the RD found that NAGE's representation of the Code 975 employees would not promote effective dealings with the FRCSW because the locus and scope of authority for personnel and labor relations is at the FRCSW level, and not at the Point Loma level. In support of this conclusion, the RD found that labor relations policy is set at the FRCSW level and FRCSW and its employees receive additional human resources support from the same entities. Further, the RD found that having Code 975 wage grade employees separate from the other 1300 wage grade employees of FRCSW would not promote effective dealings. Similarly, the RD found that separating the one general schedule employee from the other 470 FRCSW general schedule employees, and the three Code 975 production controllers and shop planners from the other 150 production controllers and shop planners, would not promote effective dealings. Thus, the RD's findings support his conclusion that allowing NAGE to represent a separate unit of Code 975 employees at Point Loma would not promote effective dealings with FRCSW.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAGE alleges that, as it has represented the Code 975 employees for at least 20 years, it is the best qualified Union to represent them. However, NAGE fails to establish that the RD incorrectly applied the elements set forth above for analyzing the effective dealings criteria. Although NAGE may have been involved in collective bargaining with the Code 975 employees in the past, the labor relations functions including human resources, grievances, and negotiations for Code 975 employees at Point Loma are now handled at the FRCSW through TFM and not at the Point Loma level. Thus, the RD's findings support his conclusion that allowing NAGE to represent a separate unit of Code 975 employees at Point Loma would not promote effective dealings with FRCSW.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The efficiency of agency operations criterion concerns the benefits to be derived from a unit structure bearing a rational relationship to the operations and organizational structure of the agency.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 961. NAGE asserts that allowing the Code 975 employees to remain in a separate unit represented by NAGE advances the efficiency of FRCSW's operations because it allows the employees to "maintain their identity as a technically-sound, self[-]sufficient group, rather than forcing them into a larger bargaining unit where their specialized nature is lost. NAGE argues that allowing the Code 975 employees to remain in a separate unit will increase their productivity and save the FRCSW money.<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that a separate unit of only Code 975 employees at Point Loma would not promote the efficiency of FRCSW's operations because it does not bear a rational relationship to the operational and organizational structure of FRCSW. Further, a separate unit determination would not result in economic savings and increased productivity to FRCSW and would result in unwarranted fragmentation. NAGE alleges, without elaboration, that a separate unit of Code 975 employees would result in increased productivity and economic savings for FRCSW. However, this bare assertion is not sufficient to support such a claim nor does it overcome the RD's finding of unit fragmentation. <span class="Italic">See NAVFAC Jacksonville</span>, 62 FLRA at 487-88. Thus, the RD's findings support his conclusion that allowing a separate unit of only Code 975 employees at Point Loma would not promote the efficiency of FRCSW's operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the RD correctly applied established law in determining that the Code 975 employees at Point Loma do not constitute a separate appropriate unit under &#x00A7; 7112. Accordingly, we find that NAGE has not established that the RD failed to apply established law and deny NAGE's application for review.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Having found that the RD did not err in finding that a separate unit of Code 975 employees is not an appropriate unit, we reject NAGE's argument that, under <span class="Italic">Bremerton</span>, its unit need not be the most appropriate. As NAGE's sole assertion that accretion is improper is based on its claim that a separate unit of Code 975 employees remains appropriate, and insofar as we have already rejected that claim, we need not address whether the RD's accretion findings are appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">FISC</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">DLA, Defense Supply Ctr. Columbus, Ohio and AFGE</span>, 53 FLRA 1114 (1998) [following supplemental briefing in 53 FLRA 5 (1997)]. AFGE represented a consolidated unit of 31,000 DLA employees, including 2,110 employees at Columbus. Although AFGE's unit included 212 "specialists," excluded from the unit were 198 specialists represented by IFPTE. A 1994 reorganization placed the specialists on interdisciplinary teams, terminating their separate working environment from the AFGE unit employees. Other reorganizations caused reassignments of the IFPTE specialists and other employees from Dayton to Columbus, triggering an AFGE petition seeking to clarify its consolidated unit at Dayton to include all specialists. IFPTE maintained that a representation petition rather than unit clarification petition was in order. AFGE claimed that the specialists had accreted to its unit in 1994, mooting any necessity for an election. Applying the principles of <span class="Italic">FISC</span>, the Authority determined that it could consider the issue of accretion, without concern as to whether the issue could have been earlier raised. The Authority also decided that when considering issues of successorship arising out of the "transfer" of employees, it would construe "transfer" in a generic sense to encompass any organizational movement of employees within an agency or between agencies, regardless of the method of the reorganization. The result reached by FLRA was that there was no accretion, that the specialists could form an appropriate unit represented by IFPTE or as part of the AFGE consolidated unit, or, alternatively, AFGE could decide to seek representation of the specialists through an independent unit comprising only those employees, 53 FLRA at 1122-35:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue of the effect of the 1996 relocation on the representational status of the AFGE specialists involves competing claims of successorship and accretion.&#x2003;Therefore, we apply the framework developed in <span class="Italic">FISC</span> to these issues.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The first <span class="Italic">FISC</span> factor includes three requirements relevant to this case: (1) at least a portion of a recognized unit must be transferred; (2) the transferred employees must be included in a separate appropriate unit; and (3) the transferred employees must constitute a majority of the new unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that our inquiry into the second of these requirements involves two separate factual issues.&#x2003;In addition to the effect of the 1996 realignment involving the Dayton Supply Center and the Activity on these bargaining units, AFGE presents the argument that the IFPTE specialists had accreted to its unit two years earlier in a reorganization. This argument disputes the underlying appropriateness of the specialist bargaining unit at the Activity and is properly part of the second requirement, which involves an evaluation of the bargaining units in the gaining agency.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We note that severance principles are not applicable to this case. Severance principles apply when a petition is filed seeking an election in a portion of an existing, appropriate unit. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees/Service Employees International Union, Local 5000, AFL-CIO-CLC, and Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO-CLC</span>, 52 FLRA 1068, 1077 (1997); <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Region, II, New York, New York</span>, 43 FLRA 1245, 1255 (1992) (<span class="Italic">HHS, Region II</span>). In this case, AFGE did not file a petition seeking an election to represent the 212 AFGE specialists in a separate unit. Further, AFGE does not allege, and we do not find, that those employees form an appropriate unit separate and apart from other employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We address the effect of the 1994 reorganization separately at the beginning of our analysis because this issue is distinct from the other issues in the case relating to the 1996 realignment, and because a resolution of this issue in the manner argued by AFGE would resolve the case in its entirety. If the IFPTE specialists accreted into the consolidated unit in the 1994 reorganization, then there was no separate bargaining unit consisting of these employees in 1996. If there was no separate bargaining unit, then the 212 AFGE specialists would, like the approximately 758 uncontested employees, simply have remained within the AFGE consolidated unit on changing location. As a practical matter, this accretion would eliminate the need to perform the <span class="Italic">FISC</span> analysis at all, since the AFGE specialists would not be transferred to a successor <span id="page_203"></span>unit, but would simply remain in the same consolidated unit that they were members of in Dayton. With this perspective, we now consider the issue of the appropriateness of the IFPTE unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we reject IFPTE's claim that we cannot examine the effects of the 1994 reorganization because AFGE did not raise the issue in 1994 and, therefore, acquiesced in the continued exclusion of the specialists from its consolidated unit. To support its argument, IFPTE relies on <span class="Italic">United Parcel Service</span>, 303 NLRB 326 (1991) (<span class="Italic">UPS</span>). <span class="Italic">UPS</span> and the D.C. Circuit case which affirmed it, <span class="Italic">Teamsters National</span> <span class="Italic">United Parcel Service Negotiating Committee v. NLRB</span>, 17 F.3d 1518 (D.C. Cir. 1994), hold simply that union acquiescence in the exclusion of employees from a bargaining unit is properly "a factor in determining whether a group of employees was in fact historically excluded from a bargaining unit<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1522. This authority does not impose a rule that the on bargaining units of job changes must be immediately raised or forever waived.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In any event, such a rigid rule would be inconsistent with the Authority's practice of making appropriate unit determinations based on a case-by-case application of the criteria set forth in Section 7112(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">HHS, Region II</span>, 43 FLRA at 1254. Past changes to the work of employees may have an impact on their community of interest and are appropriately taken into account.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to AFGE's argument, we agree with the RD's conclusion that the 1994 reorganization of the work of the IFPTE specialists did not eliminate their status as a separate appropriate bargaining unit. Employees such as these, who are specifically excluded from the unit description in a bargaining certificate, may only be accreted into that unit where there have been "meaningful changes" in the employees' duties, functions, or job circumstances that eliminate the original distinctions between employees and thus warrant their inclusion into the unit. <span class="Italic">Federal Trade Commission</span>, 35 FLRA 576, 583-85 (1990) (<span class="Italic">FTC</span>). In the absence of such a demonstration, an election, with the requisite showing of interest, is required to add the group of employees to the unit. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Air Force, Langley Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Base, Virginia</span>, 40 FLRA 111, 117 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Langley</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record supports the RD's finding that the Activity's reorganization to interdisciplinary teams in 1994 did not substantially change the duties, functions, and job circumstances of the specialists who were excluded from AFGE's unit description. Although those employees worked after the reorganization under a multi-functional supervisor, had increased interaction with other employees, and received multi-skill training to understand the duties of the other employees, the record testimony by managers and employees establishes that they continued to perform the same duties and functions as before the change. Moreover, the reorganization has not resulted in the interchange of jobs among these employees and other employees. In these circumstances, AFGE could not add the IFPTE specialists to its consolidated unit except by an election. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Langley</span>, 40 FLRA at 117.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are additional reasons which support the RD's refusal to find that the specialists accreted to the AFGE consolidated unit as a result of the 1994 reorganization. As the RD found, the IFPTE bargaining unit is a "well-established functional unit" that has a history of stable labor relations with the Activity dating to 1967. "Bargaining history is...an important factor in unit determination" and, like the NLRB, we are "reluctant to disturb longstanding bargaining units,...when bargaining in those units has been successful." Hardin, The Developing Labor Law 455 (3d ed. 1992), <span class="Italic">citing Tool Craftsmen v. Leedom</span>, 276 F.2d 514 (D.C. Cir. 1960), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 364 U.S. 815 (1980); <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Contract Administration Services Region Cleveland, Defense Contract Administration Services Plant Representative Office, Goodyear Aerospace, Akron, Ohio</span>, 15 FLRA 962, 965 (1984) (<span class="Italic">DLA</span>) (past bargaining history and current labor-management dealings used to find proposed units appropriate). There is no evidence that this reorganization, by itself, disrupted the parties' stable labor relations history and we find that the reorganization alone does not justify a change in the unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we agree with the private sector rule that accretion is much more difficult to establish where the employees sought to be accreted are represented by a rival union. <span class="Italic">Lammert Industries v. NLRB</span>, 578 F.2d 1223, 1226 (7th Cir. 1978) (<span class="Italic">Lammert); Seven-Up/Canada Dry Bottling Co.</span>, 281 NLRB 943, 946 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Seven-Up</span>). This rule is intended to guard against the possibility of "an employer favoring one union over the other in violation of the employer's duty of neutrality." <span class="Italic">Lammert</span>, 578 F.2d at 1226. Further, it supports the principle that the accretion doctrine is generally narrowly applied, because it precludes employee self determination. <span class="Italic">Local 144, Hotel, Hospital, Nursing Home &#x0026;</span> <span class="Italic">Allied Services Union, SEIU v. NLRB</span>, 9 F.3d 218, 223 (2d. Cir. 1993). This basic reluctance to short-circuit employee self-determination is enhanced where the employees have, in fact, already exercised their right of self-determination and chosen a representative different from the representative seeking to accrete them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering whether the specialists were "transferred" within the meaning of <span class="Italic">FISC</span>, we look to our own precedent, as well as the experience of the private sector<span class="Italic">. See Port Hueneme</span>, 50 FLRA at 367. For the reasons that follow, we find that the AFGE specialists were transferred and should not be treated as new hires, as found by the RD. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Headquarters, Fort Dix, Fort Dix, New</span> <span class="Italic">Jersey</span>, 53 FLRA 287, 294 (1997) (new employees are automatically included in an existing bargaining unit).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Activity's argument that a determination of whether employees are transferred turns on the nature of the personnel action effected, and that employees technically released from one position and "rehired" under the PPP can not be considered to be transferred. As we explained in <span class="Italic">Port Huemene</span>, the successorship doctrine focuses on "the employees' perspective[.]" 50 FLRA at 372 (quoting <span class="Italic">Fall River</span> <span class="Italic">Dyeing &#x0026; Finishing Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 482 U.S. 27, 43 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Fall River</span>)). The employing agency may have any number of technical personnel options for moving work and employees from one Activity to another such as occurred in this case, and a variety of legal and managerial reasons for choosing one option or another. For example, the agency here employed two different personnel rules for moving these employees to the Activity, first creating a retention register and offering reassignments, and then revoking those reassignments and requiring employees to utilize the PPP. The employees' collective bargaining rights should not depend on which personnel option the agency decides is most appropriate to the occasion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our case law does not specifically describe the situations under which employees will be considered to be transferred for the purposes of establishing successorship.&#x2003;This is because the situations addressed in these cases involved employees who were "relocated" administratively during reorganizations, and no party challenged that the employees were transferred from one entity to another<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Bremerton</span>, 53 FLRA 173; <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, <span class="Italic">District Office, Valdosta, Georgia</span>, 52 FLRA 1084, 1088 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Valdosta); Port Hueneme</span>, 50 FLRA at 365, 374.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the private sector, however, a wide variety of factual situations have been found to involve union successorship, and there is no requirement that the employees of the predecessor employer be formally transferred to the gaining employer. In this regard, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) initially determines whether a majority of the employees hired by the gaining employer were employees of the predecessor. <span class="Italic">See NLRB v. Burns International Security Service, Inc.</span>, 406 U.S. 272, 281 (1972). The NLRB further determines whether the same employees are doing the same work with the same mission and function, an inquiry that we have incorporated as the second factor of the <span class="Italic">Port</span> <span class="Italic">Hueneme</span> successorship test. 50 FLRA at 368; <span class="Italic">see Fall River</span>, 482 U.S. at 43. The particular financial or organizational basis for the transfer of operations between employers has no bearing on such determinations. <span class="Italic">See Golden State Bottling Company, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 414 U.S. 168, 182 n.5 (1973) (NLRB is not required to adopt a distinction based on method of transferring ownership between gaining employer and predecessor, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, whether through merger, consolidation, purchase of assets); <span class="Italic">Capitol</span> <span class="Italic">Steel and Iron Co.</span>, 299 NLRB 484, 487 (1990) (successorship may be found if putative successor is operating predecessor's business in miniature). Thus, for example, in <span class="Italic">Hydrolines, Inc. and TNT Hydrolines, Inc.</span>, 305 NLRB 416 (1991), the NLRB found successorship where the gaining employer assumed only part of the operation of the predecessor and a majority of the unit of the gaining employer's employees was composed of former employees of the predecessor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As in the private sector, we find that the method used to move the employees from the Dayton Supply Center to the Activity has no bearing on the requirement that they be "transferred" for purposes of <span class="Italic">FISC</span>. Thus, the term "transferred employees" set forth in <span class="Italic">FISC</span> is a generic term that refers to any organizational movement of employees within an agency or between agencies, regardless of the method of the reorganization.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, as the AFGE specialists moved from one activity to another through the DOD PPP, they are "transferred employees" within the meaning of FISC, rather than new hires, as found by the RD.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first <span class="Italic">FISC</span> inquiry also requires that the Authority examine whether the transferred employees are included in a separate appropriate bargaining unit. This inquiry involves the application of section 7112(a) of the Statute, which provides that a unit is appropriate if: (1) the employees at issue share a clear and identifiable community of interest; (2) the unit promotes effective dealings with the agency involved; and (3) the unit promotes efficiency of operations of the agency involved. 5 U.S.C. 7112(a); <span class="Italic">FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 959. Determinations as to each criterion are made on a case-by-case basis by balancing the relevant factors<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 960. The Authority has set out a variety of relevant factors for these inquiries, but has not specified the weight of individual factors or a particular number of factors necessary to establish an appropriate unit. <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2004</span>, 47 <span id="page_204"></span>FLRA 969, 972 (1993). Further, what is required under the Statute is an appropriate bargaining unit, not necessarily the only or most appropriate unit. <span class="Italic">Bremerton</span>, 53 FLRA at 183 n.9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining that the Activity was not a successor employer to the Dayton Supply Center, the RD determined that <span class="Italic">FISC</span> did not apply because the former Dayton employees "do not share a community of interest separate and apart from the employees in the IFPTE and AFGE units[.]"...&#8197;Thus, the RD determined that the AFGE employees did not <span class="Italic">constitute</span> a separate bargaining unit at the Activity. The RD did not, as required by the first <span class="Italic">FISC</span> factor, examine whether the AFGE specialists are <span class="Italic">included in</span> a separate appropriate unit at the Activity. In this regard, the RD failed to examine whether the two bargaining units proposed by the parties would appropriately include the AFGE specialists. These two units are: (1) a unit with all of the employees at the Activity, including the AFGE specialists, the IFPTE specialists and other employees as part of the AFGE consolidated unit, or (2) a separate, smaller unit with only the AFGE and IFPTE specialists.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we find that a bargaining unit consisting of the AFGE specialists, IFPTE specialists and the other AFGE employees at the Activity is appropriate. It is evident that specialists and other employees can appropriately be included in one unit that would be part of the AFGE consolidated unit at the Activity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Valdosta</span>, 52 FLRA at 1092. As was noted above, the 212 AFGE specialists were previously included in the AFGE consolidated unit while employed at Dayton.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the IFPTE specialist unit at the Activity predates AFGE's organization of the remainder of the employees at the Activity. Its continued existence does not suggest that the specialists could not have been included in the Activity-wide unit, had they been unrepresented at the time the AFGE unit was created and had they been included in AFGE's petition at that time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">No facts have been presented that indicate that these 410 specialists together have a community of interest so distinct from the rest of the employees at the Activity that including them in the AFGE consolidated unit would be inappropriate.&#x2003;Further, there is no reason that it would be ineffective or inefficient for these employees to be included in the consolidated unit. The past inclusion of specialists in the consolidated unit at the Dayton Supply Center indicates that, as expected, the organizational structure of the Agency is consistent with effectively dealing with specialists in the same unit as other employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 961-62. Further, the consolidated unit bears a rational relationship to the operational and organizational structure of the agency<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons that follow, we also find that a separate unit consisting of the 212 AFGE specialists and the 198 IFPTE specialists together is appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A clear and identifiable "community of interest" exists where the transferred employees have significant employment concerns or personnel issues that are different or unique from those of the employees in the gaining organization. <span class="Italic">FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 960. The employees' interests must also be sufficiently similar that "it is possible for them to deal collectively [with management] as a single group<span class="Italic">." Id.;</span> <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Southwest Region, Tulsa Airway Facilities Sector</span>, 3 FLRC 235, 237 (1975).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AFGE specialists and the IFPTE specialists are in the same two job series.&#x2003;Employees within each of those series share the same skills no matter where they are located within the Activity. There is no opportunity for employees to move from these series to the positions of employees in other job series. The employees thus appear to be sufficiently similar to "deal collectively."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For 18 years the positions encumbered by the specialists at the Activity have been represented as a functional grouping by IFPTE and excluded from the unit description of AFGE.&#x2003;The Authority has long recognized separate appropriate units based on functional groupings of employees in particular positions. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 49 FLRA 100, 108 (1994). A history of bargaining as a separate functional group indicates closely shared terms and conditions of employment among those employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Naval Station, Norfolk, Virginia</span>, 14 FLRA 702, 704 (1984) (<span class="Italic">Naval Station, Norfolk</span>); <span class="Italic">Department of Defense Dependents Schools</span>, 6 FLRA 297, 309 (1981). While the record does not contain specific evidence concerning the nature of the separate bargaining by this unit, the separateness of this unit for this period was stipulated by the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that the IFPTE bargaining unit remained an appropriate unit after the 1994 reorganization, the RD concluded that the duties and functions of these employees had not been sufficiently altered that they had lost their separate community of interest, and that the separate bargaining history of these employees was a significant indication of their separate community of interest....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity asserts, however, that such determinations should not be made "solely" on bargaining history, citing <span class="Italic">Allen Park</span>, 43 FLRA 264, and that the "totality" of the changes made in the 1994 reorganization and the later organizational changes resulting from the consolidation of the Dayton Supply Center with the Activity has eliminated a separate community of interest for the specialists. The Agency points to the fact that the specialists work at the same location as other employees, are governed by the same personnel policies and regulations, work under the same Commander, and are subject to the same working conditions as employees in other positions. AFGE makes the same argument, asserting that these employees are fully integrated into the workforce and citing to many similarities between the working conditions of these employees and the other employees at the Activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the AFGE specialists and the IFPTE specialists together share a sufficiently distinct community of interest.&#x2003;They may be represented in a separate appropriate unit. In this regard, the critical factor which establishes their separate community of interest is the long history of separate bargaining for specialist as a functional grouping of employees at the Activity. The Authority and the NLRB have considered that factor significant in making appropriate unit determinations....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Allen Park</span> case, cited by the Activity, is distinguishable. That case did not concern, as here, the appropriateness of a unit that is structured around a functional grouping of employees. Rather, it concerned the inclusion in a unit of employees who are of a different classification and had been specifically excluded from the unit description. It simply holds that actual bargaining for a group of employees does not overcome a specific exclusion contained in a unit description.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "effective dealings" criterion pertains to the relationship between management and the exclusive representative selected by the proposed unit. <span class="Italic">FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 961. Factors bearing on this criterion include the locus and authority of the office that administers personnel policies affecting the proposed unit and the past collective bargaining experience of the parties. <span class="Italic">id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The office responsible for administering personnel and labor-relations policies is at the Activity. IFPTE has represented specialists in a separate unit at the Activity since 1968. There is no evidence that this separate unit has disrupted the Activity's operations and the Activity has indicated that the record did not show that labor relations had been ineffective with the two separate units. On the basis of these facts, we conclude that a unit consisting of the AFGE specialists and the IFPTE specialists would promote effective dealings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "efficiency of operations" criterion pertains to whether the structure of the bargaining unit bears a rational relationship to the operational and organizational structure of the agency. <span class="Italic">FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 961. In determining the effect of a proposed unit on the efficiency of agency operations, the Authority considers factors pertaining to cost, productivity, and resources. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 962. There were no findings to suggest that a separate unit of specialists would adversely affect the Activity's productivity or resource allocation. Accordingly, we conclude that a unit consisting of the AFGE specialists and the 198 specialists represented by IFPTE would promote efficiency of operations.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;The fact that there would be two units at the Activity does not compel a conclusion that such result would impair effective dealings or efficiency of operations. As the Authority explained in <span class="Italic">Bremerton</span>, the number of bargaining units is not dispositive of the section 7112(a)(1) analysis; as noted, what is required under the Statute is an appropriate bargaining unit, not necessarily the most appropriate unit. 53 FLRA at 183 n.9</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE-represented employees constitute the vast majority in a separate unit consisting of the AFGE specialists, IFPTE specialists, and other employees in the AFGE consolidated unit at the Activity. In addition, the AFGE specialists constitute a majority in a separate specialist unit composed of the 212 AFGE specialists and the 198 IFPTE specialists.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, we conclude that the AFGE specialists are included in, and constitute a majority of, two separate appropriate units at the Activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, consistent with the approach set out in <span class="Italic">FISC</span>, we will apply the remaining <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> factors to determine whether there is a successorship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> factor requires that the gaining entity have substantially the same mission and that the transferred employees perform substantially the same duties under substantially similar working conditions as before the transfer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_205"></span>The mission of the Dayton Supply Center was transferred to the Activity.&#x2003;The RD found, and the Activity asserts, both without explanation, that the AFGE specialists were not necessarily placed in the same positions that they encumbered at the Dayton Supply Center and that they did not always work under the same supervisor....&#8197;Notwithstanding that finding, the record testimony indicates that those employees perform essentially the same duties, and provide the same services as before their transfer. In these circumstances, we conclude that the second factor of <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> has been met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we consider the third <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> factor: whether an election is necessary to determine the representation rights of the transferred employees. We look to our own precedent, as well as the experience of the private sector to determine the necessity of an election. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Valdosta</span>, 52 FLRA at 1090.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the context of an agency realignment of functions, the Authority has ordered an election where the employees at issue could be a part of two petitioned-for appropriate units<span class="Italic">. DLA</span>, 15 FLRA 962. As the Authority held in <span class="Italic">DLA</span>, where "the considerations in favor of each [unit] are evenly balanced, the determining factor should be the desire of the employees themselves." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 966; <span class="Italic">see also Naval Station Norfolk</span>, 14 FLRA at 704-5. In addition, the Authority has indicated that an election may be necessary where, as here, more than one labor organization represents employees transferred into the new unit. <span class="Italic">See Valdosta</span>, 52 FLRA at 1091.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the NLRB has found an election necessary after a reorganization or corporate merger where more than one labor organization has represented employees in the new unit and neither group of affected employees is sufficiently predominant to remove the question concerning overall representation. <span class="Italic">Seven-Up</span>, 281 NLRB at 946; <span class="Italic">Boston Gas Company</span>, 221 NLRB 628, 629 n.5 (1975). On the other hand, the NLRB will not direct an election where it would be a useless exercise or prejudicial to the dominant group. <span class="Italic">Seven-Up</span>, 281 NLRB at 946; <span class="Italic">Boston Gas Company</span>, 235 NLRB 1354, 1355 (1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that an election is necessary to determine the representational rights of the 212 AFGE specialists and the 198 IFPTE specialists.&#x2003;In this regard, both AFGE and IFPTE have represented employees in that unit that are virtually equal in number. There is no evidence that either group is sufficiently predominant to remove the question concerning representation. Thus, we conclude that it has been demonstrated that an election is necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we find that an election is necessary to determine whether to include the specialists in the AFGE consolidated unit at the Activity. Such inclusion would involve changing the specific exclusion of the specialists. As discussed above, in these circumstances, the inclusion in the AFGE consolidated unit at the Activity of the specialists could not be achieved without an election, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's practice is to order a self-determination election where more than one bargaining unit is found to be appropriate, and accretion and successorship are not established. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Labor, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration</span>, 38 FLRA 65, 73 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Pension</span>); <span class="Italic">DLA</span>, 15 FLRA at 966; <span class="Italic">Naval Station</span>, <span class="Italic">Norfolk</span>, 14 FLRA at 704-5; <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, 6th</span> <span class="Italic">Missile Warning Squadron, Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts</span>, 3 FLRA 112, 114-15 (1980). In a self-determination election, the employees are permitted to vote whether they wish to be represented by one union in a larger bargaining unit or by another union in a separate, smaller unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's use of self-determination elections in this situation follows the "<span class="Italic">Armour-Globe</span>" doctrine in the private sector, which "allows employees 'to determine the scope of a unit by allowing them to cast a vote for each of several potential units which the Board has determined are appropriate.'" <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Raytheon Co.</span>, 918 F.2d 249, 251 (1st Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">Raytheon</span>) (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">Globe Machine</span> <span class="Italic">and Stamping Co.</span>, 3 NLRB 294 (1937); <span class="Italic">Armour and Company</span>, 40 NLRB 1333 (1942) (<span class="Italic">Armour</span>). For example, in <span class="Italic">Armour</span>, the NLRB permitted employees who had been historically represented by three separate craft unions to determine whether they would join an existing larger unit, with the three craft units voting separately for inclusion or separate status. <span class="Italic">Raytheon</span>, 918 F.2d at 251.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employees are not permitted to vote on unit appropriateness in the abstract.&#x2003;Employees are permitted to vote on their unit preference only when simultaneously voting on a bargaining representative. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 253, n.2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing authority, we find that the appropriate self-determination election here would offer the 410 specialists at the Activity the opportunity to vote for representation by AFGE in the consolidated unit or by IFPTE in the separate unit. AFGE has not indicated an interest in representing the specialists in a separate unit; rather, it has consistently maintained that they should be accreted into its consolidated unit. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Pension</span>, 38 FLRA at 73; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also Carr-Gottstein Foods Company</span>, 307 NLRB 1318, 1319 (1992). However, AFGE can change its position in this regard on remand. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Pension</span>, 38 FLRA at 73.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the event AFGE desires to represent these employees in a separate unit, the election would have to be a two-step process. The employees would first decide whether they wanted to be in the separate or consolidated unit. A second election would be necessary to determine the representative if a separate unit was chosen. The <span class="Italic">status quo</span> was maintained despite an administrative merger of hospital facilities that continued to maintained operationally identity.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA, Valdosta, Ga. and AFGE</span>, 52 FLRA 1084, 1089 (1997), expanded on <span class="Italic">FISC, Norfolk II and Port Hueneme</span>, 50 FLRA 363, 366-74 (1995), by rejecting the principle in <span class="Italic">DHUD</span>, 8 FLRA 176 (1982), that "an office that has been organizationally integrated into a higher level office will always have its representational status controlled by the representational status of the employees in the higher level office." Additionally, <span class="Italic">SSA, Valdosta</span>, 52 FLRA at 1090-91, explained the necessity of an election in a successorship case when the number of unrepresented employees in the gaining entity exceeds the number of represented employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we consider the third <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> factor: whether an election is necessary to determine the representation rights of the transferred employees. We look to our own precedent, as well as the experience of the private sector, in determining how to evaluate the necessity for an election.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) have found a question concerning representation, and therefore directed an election, in only a limited number of situations in cases where successorship or accretion are otherwise appropriate, none of which are present here. Union majority status among employees in the gaining entity is crucial to such a determination. <span class="Italic">Geo. v. Hamilton, Inc.</span>, 289 NLRB 1335 (1988). Thus, both the Authority and the NLRB have found that an election would be necessary to determine representation after a reorganization or consolidation when the number of unrepresented employees in the gaining entity exceeds the number of represented employees. <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Region II, New York, New York</span>, 43 FLRA 1245 (1992); <span class="Italic">Renaissance Center Partnership</span>, 239 NLRB 1247 (1979). The NLRB also has found an election necessary after a reorganization when more than one labor organization represents employees transferred into the new unit. <span class="Italic">Martin Marietta Co</span>., 270 NLRB 821 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the transferred employees constitute a majority of the employees of the gaining entity, and no other labor organization represents, or seeks to represent, the transferred employees, we conclude that it has not been demonstrated that an election is necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Supply Ctr., Puget Sound and Bremerton Metal Trades Council</span>, 53 FLRA 173, 178-85 (1997), also provides an example of the application of <span class="Italic">FISC, Norfolk II</span>. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Computer &#x0026; Telecom. Area and AFGE Local 1156</span>, 57 FLRA 230, 234-36 (2001) (applying <span class="Italic">FISC </span>and considering, among other factors, authority of local supervisor to negotiate or change working conditions or policies).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy and IAF Local F-121</span>, 60 FLRA 469, 475 (2004), expressed FLRA's preference for an election when an accretion or successorship is not established:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons set forth below, we find that the RD erred in not directing an election in a unit of all nonprofessional general schedule and wage grade employees, including police officers, guards and firefighters, which he found to be an appropriate unit. As stated earlier, the RD found that the scope of the units was in conflict and, relying on <span class="Italic">Norfolk</span>, directed elections in those units that, in his view, would most preserve the existing bargaining unit structure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Norfolk</span>, the Authority was presented with "competing successorship claims alleging different appropriate units[.]" 56 FLRA at 332. The Authority held that, in such circumstances:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">we will first consider the appropriate unit claim that will most fully preserve the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> in terms of unit structure and the relationship of employees to their chosen exclusive representative. If we find that a petitioned for, existing unit <span class="Italic">continues to be appropriate</span>, then we will not address any petitions that attempt to establish different unit structures, because the Statute requires only that a proposed unit be an appropriate unit, not the most, or the only, appropriate unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis in original omitted; new emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the RD did not find that any of the petitioned-for, existing units continued to be appropriate. He specifically found that the three existing firefighter units, for which the IAFF and its locals had submitted petitions were no longer appropriate and, further, that the separate unit of guards at the NRL was no longer appropriate. As a result of the reorganization, the RD found that four completely new units were appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In such a situation, and as discussed in <span class="Italic">DLA, </span>an election should be <span id="page_206"></span>conducted that permits a choice involving all of the units found appropriate. As stated in <span class="Italic">DLA</span>, "[t]he Authority's practice is to order a self-determination election where more than one bargaining unit is found to be appropriate, and accretion and successorship are not established." <span class="Italic">DLA</span>, 53 FLRA 1134. Further, "[i]n a self-determination election, the employees are permitted to vote whether they wish to [be] represented by one union in a larger bargaining unit or by another union in a separate, smaller unit." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Authority's practice in this regard is consistent with long-standing practice in the private sector, in which the National Labor Relations Board permits employees to determine the scope of a unit by allowing them to cast a vote for each of several potential units that are found to be appropriate. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1135, citing <span class="Italic">Raytheon</span>, 918 F.2d 249; <span class="Italic">Globe</span>, 3 NLRB 294; and <span class="Italic">Armour</span>, 40 NLRB 1333.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the RD found that overlapping--all-inclusive and functional--units were appropriate. As such, he should have directed an election in which employees who could be represented in either the all-inclusive or functional units could choose both their unit configuration and representative, consistent with the voting process described in <span class="Italic">DLA</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 53 FLRA at 1135.</p>
<p class="noindent">A union representing employees at one VA hospital did not need to file its own representation petition to maintain its status when the union for the employees at the other facility filed a petition seeking to establish itself as the representative of all the employees of the two newly-integrated facilities, <span class="Italic">VA Conn. Healthcare Sys. and AFGE</span>, 61 FLRA 864, 864-65, 867-70 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is before the Authority on an application for review filed by petitioner American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) under &#x00A7; 2422.31 of the Authority's Regulations. Neither the Agency nor incumbent National Association of Government Employees (NAGE) filed an opposition to AFGE's application.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Regional Director (RD) found that the bargaining unit represented by NAGE at the Agency's Newington facility continues to be appropriate and he dismissed AFGE's petition to be certified as the representative of these employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we deny AFGE's application for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For more than 20 years, AFGE has represented employees at the Agency's hospital in West Haven, Connecticut as part of a consolidated bargaining unit. For a similar period of time, NAGE has represented a unit of employees at the Agency's hospital in Newington, Connecticut as part of a consolidated bargaining unit. Prior to 1995, the two hospitals had separate directors and administrative offices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1995, the Agency conducted an "organizational integration" of the West Haven and Newington facilities that resulted in the creation of the Connecticut Healthcare System (CHCS). According to information submitted by AFGE and not disputed by the other parties, this reorganization resulted in the two facilities sharing a single director, as well as personnel, labor relations, and administrative services.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The RD's application of the Authority's COMNAVBASE standard</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">COMNAVBASE</span> [<span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Commander, Naval Base, Norfolk, Va., </span>56 FLRA 328, 331-32 (2000)], the Authority set out the following standard for addressing competing claims of successorship that arise after an agency reorganization:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[W]hen we are presented with competing successorship claims alleging different appropriate units, we will first consider the appropriate unit claim that will most fully preserve the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> in terms of unit structure and the relationship of employees to their chosen exclusive representative. If we find that a petitioned-for, existing unit continues to be appropriate, then we will not address any petitions that attempt to establish different unit structures, because the Statute requires only that a proposed unit be <span class="Italic">an</span> appropriate unit, not the most, or the only, appropriate unit. <span class="Italic">See [Dep't of the Navy, Naval Supply Center, Puget Sound,]</span> <span class="Italic"> Bremerton</span>, <span class="Italic">[Wa.]</span> 53 FLRA 173, 183 n.9 [(1997) (<span class="Italic">Bremerton</span>)].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">56 FLRA at 332.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE argues that, under this standard, the RD should not have considered whether the existing Newington bargaining unit remained appropriate as a separate unit because neither NAGE nor the Agency filed a petition seeking this unit, and it was thus not a "petitioned-for" unit for the purposes of <span class="Italic">COMNAVBASE</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While AFGE's argument is consistent with a literal reading of <span class="Italic">COMNAVBASE</span>, that decision considered conflicting petitions filed by an agency and union; it did not address any obligations of an incumbent union that seeks to retain its existing bargaining unit, as NAGE does in this case. Moreover, nothing in the Authority's regulations or case law indicates that an incumbent union is required to file a petition to defend its existing bargaining unit from a petition filed by a rival union seeking to represent those employees. In this regard, an incumbent union has automatic party status under &#x00A7; 2422.8(d) of the Authority's regulations, as the RD notified NAGE in this case. <span class="Italic">[S]</span> <span class="Italic">ee also United States Dep't of the Interior, Nat'l Park Serv., </span>55 FLRA 466,<span class="Italic"> </span>468 (1999). In this case, NAGE fully participated in the proceedings, appointing a Senior Counsel from its headquarters as its representative and filing a statement of position arguing that its Newington unit "remains appropriate" and that AFGE's petition "must be dismissed." NAGE also filed an opposition to a motion to transfer the case filed by AFGE and participated in a conference with the parties conducted by the RD. No purpose would be served by requiring NAGE to also file a petition indicating that it desired to maintain its existing unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has routinely considered the continued appropriateness of existing bargaining units without requiring incumbent unions to file separate petitions.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See United Stated Dep't of the Navy, Naval District Washington, </span>60 FLRA 469, 471-72 (2004) (<span class="Italic">Naval District Washington</span>) (considering appropriateness of existing IAM bargaining unit that was not petitioned for); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Naval Supply Center, Puget Sound, Bremmerton, Wash., </span>53 FLRA 173 (1997) (same with respect to AFGE, Local 1931 bargaining unit); <span class="Italic">Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Supply Center Columbus, Columbus, Oh.,</span> 53 FLRA 1114, 1122-32 (1998) (<span class="Italic">DLA, Columbus</span>) (same with respect to IFPTE bargaining unit). There is no indication that <span class="Italic">COMNAVBASE </span>intended to change this practice and the fact that <span class="Italic">Naval District Washington</span> was issued subsequent to <span class="Italic">COMNAVBASE </span>indicates that the practice has not been revised. Further, AFGE has provided no reason why an incumbent union should be required to take this procedural step.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the Authority concludes that that review is not warranted on the ground that the RD erred in applying established law by considering the appropriateness of the separate NAGE unit. To the extent that the decision in <span class="Italic">COMNAVBASE </span>suggests that an incumbent union must file a petition to make an argument that its existing bargaining unit remains appropriate, we clarify that a petition is not required in this circumstance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The RD's evaluation of the appropriateness of the separate Newington bargaining unit</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute, a unit may be determined to be appropriate only if it will: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings in the agency involved; and (3) promote efficiency of the operations of the agency involved. In making determinations under &#x00A7; 7112(a), the Authority has set out relevant factors for each of the three criteria and examines the factors presented on a case-by-case basis, but has not specified the weight of individual factors or the particular number of factors necessary to establish an appropriate unit. <span class="Italic">See FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 960-62; <span class="Italic">DLA, Columbus,</span> 53 FLRA at 1127. In determining whether a unit remains appropriate after an agency reorganization, the Authority focuses on the specific changes caused by the reorganization. <span class="Italic">COMNAVBASE,</span> 56 FLRA at 332.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority has explained, "[t]he fundamental premise of the first criterion--that employees share a clear and identifiable community of interest--is to ensure that it is 'possible for them to deal collectively [with management] as a single group.'" <span class="Italic">FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 960 (<span class="Italic">quoting Dep't of Transportation, Fed. Aviation Admin., Southwest Region, Tulsa Airway Facilities Sector</span>, 3 FLRC 235, 239 (1975)). The Authority examines such factors as whether the employees in the proposed unit are a part of the same organizational component of the agency; support the same mission; are subject to the same chain of command; have similar or related duties, job titles and work assignments; are subject to the same general working conditions; and are governed by the same personnel and labor relations policies that are administered by the same personnel office. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 960-61. In addition, factors such as geographic proximity, unique conditions of employment, distinct local concerns, degree of interchange between other organizational components, and functional or operational separation may be relevant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the changes in the Agency's operations arising from the reorganization were not significant enough to eliminate the established community of interest of the employees at the Newington facility. AFGE contends that the factors it relied on, including the centralization of management and administrative functions for the two facilities, the fact that hiring, orientation, and training are done for all employees together, and that employees sometimes travel between the two facilities outweigh the factors relied on by the RD. However, AFGE does not explain why the fact that there is more administrative centralization between the Newington and West Haven facilities necessarily outweighs the facts relied on by the RD. These facts include the geographic separation of the two groups of employees and that the Newington employees remain subject to the same overall chain of command and have the have same working conditions and duties. Further, in arguing that the factors it relies on outweigh those relied on by the RD, AFGE ignores the "fundamental premise" of the community of interest criteria set out above: the ability to deal collectively with management. <span class="Italic">FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 960. The RD's reliance on the fact that the Newington bargaining <span id="page_207"></span>unit has successfully negotiated with the Agency over local conditions of employment is consistent with this fundamental premise. AFGE has thus not established that the RD erred in finding that the Newington employees shared a community of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The criterion of effective dealings "pertains to the relationship between management and the exclusive representative selected by unit employees" and the criteria of efficiency of operations concerns the "benefits to be derived from a unit structure which bears some rational relationship to the operational and organizational structure of the agency." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 961. AFGE claims that the RD erred in assessing these criteria because the labor relations policy for all of CHCS is set at West Haven, not Newington, and because the volume of labor relations activity conducted by NAGE at Newington has not necessarily been effective. However, the facts relied on by AFGE ignore the important considerations that, in the 10 years between the consolidation and the filing of AFGE's petition, both the NAGE consolidated unit and NAGE Local R-109 bargained and reached agreement with the Agency and that NAGE and the Agency have a 30-year history of bargaining. Similarly, AFGE's focus on the fact that there is one CHCS labor relations office for both West Haven and Newington ignores the fact that both the West Haven and Newington employees are in consolidated bargaining units and, as a result, bargaining over the term agreements does not take place at the local level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE also claims that the RD erred generally by failing to make "affirmative determinations" concerning the three appropriate unit criteria and by giving improper weight to the bargaining history between NAGE and the Agency. With respect to the first point, the RD made specific determinations with respect to each of the three criteria and the fact that some of the RD's conclusion were qualified by such terms as "likely" and "evidently" does not detract from the specificity of these findings. With respect to the second point, under appropriate circumstances, the Authority has considered a long history of bargaining to be an important consideration in evaluating each of the three criterion. <span class="Italic">See DLA, Columbus</span>, 53 FLRA at 1129-32. Thus, AFGE has not established that the RD erred in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, AFGE has not established that review is warranted because the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFGE has not established that the RD's decision not to hold a hearing failed to apply established law and was a prejudicial procedural error.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Section &#x00A7; 2422.30(b) of the Authority's regulations, an RD "will issue a notice of hearing to inquire into any matter about which a material issue of fact exists, and any time there is a reasonable cause to believe a question exists regarding unit appropriateness." <span class="Italic">See also </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b) ("if [the Authority] has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, it shall provide an opportunity for a hearing"). Interpreting these provisions, the Authority has held that RDs have "broad discretion" to determine whether a hearing is necessary. <span class="Italic">United States Environmental Protection Agency, </span>61 FLRA 417, 420 (2005), recons. denied, 61 FLRA 806 (2006) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>); <span class="Italic">see Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service,</span> 52 FLRA 1509, 1516 (1997) (<span class="Italic">FMCS</span>). In particular, "the RD may determine, on the basis of the investigation...that 'there are sufficient facts not in dispute to form the basis for a decision or that, even where some facts are in dispute, the record contains sufficient evidence on which to base a decision.'" <span class="Italic">FMCS</span>, 52 FLRA at 1516 (<span class="Italic">quoting United States Dep't of Agriculture, Forest Serv., Apache-Sitgreaves Nat'l Forest, Springerville, Ariz., </span>47 FLRA 945, 952 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of Agriculture</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE argues that the RD erred in refusing to hold a hearing in this case because there were three questions of fact not resolved by the RD: (1) the appropriateness of AFGE's petitioned-for bargaining unit, (2) the appropriateness of the AFGE bargaining unit at West Haven, and (3) whether the bargaining unit of Newington employees promotes effective dealings and the efficiency of Agency operations. With respect to the first of these questions, once the RD determined that the existing separate Newington bargaining unit remained appropriate, it was unnecessary for him evaluate the appropriateness of AFGE's petitioned-for unit. With respect to the second issue, as no party challenged the appropriateness of AFGE's existing unit at West Haven, there was no reason for the RD to address this issue. With respect to the third matter raised by AFGE, the RD did make specific determinations with respect to the effective dealings and the efficiency criteria, as explained above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE also notes that the RD initially issued a notice of hearing in this case and then determined, after an investigation, that no hearing was necessary. AFGE asserts that, once the hearing was ordered, the RD lacked the discretion to resolve the case without a hearing. The Authority recently addressed this issue, holding that an RD does not commit prejudicial procedural error under the Authority's regulations where, after conducting an investigation, the RD determines that a hearing that was initially ordered is not necessary. <span class="Italic">EPA,</span> 61 FLRA at 420. While AFGE relies on &#x00A7; 7111(b) of the Statute in addition to the Authority's regulations at issue in <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, it provides no reason why the RD does not have similar discretion under &#x00A7; 7111(b) of the Statute, once the RD has conducted an investigation. In this regard, the RD here concluded that "the uncontested facts do not present a question concerning representation" and AFGE has not established that this finding is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, AFGE argues that the RD abused his discretion by not holding a hearing, because the RD did not develop "as complete an evidentiary record as possible[.]" Application at 40 (<span class="Italic">quoting Dep't of Transportation, Federal Aviation Admin., Southwest Region, Tulsa Airway Facilities Sector, </span>3 FLRC 235, 243 (1975). However, as noted above, longstanding Authority precedent requires only that there be "sufficient facts not in dispute to form the basis for a decision[.]" <span class="Italic">FMCS</span>, 52 FLRA at 1516; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of Agriculture, </span>47 FLRA at 952 (overturning decision where RD resolved factual disputes without a hearing, where there was no basis in the record for doing so). AFGE has not established that the Authority should change its current standard and require an RD to create an evidentiary record more complete than is necessary to resolve the case. Further, AFGE has not demonstrated that the RD relied on disputed facts as the basis for his decision, or abused his discretion in any other way.</p>
