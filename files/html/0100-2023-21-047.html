<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-47"><span class="space">a.</span> Waiver; Separation for Medical Reason: Notice Not Provided</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies that have reason to believe that employees being separated by reasons that the agency has reason to believe may be caused by a medical condition should notify an employee of possibility of eligibility for disability retirement. Under the CSRS regulation, 5 CFR 831.1205 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Agency procedures</span>. (1) When an agency issues a decision to remove an employee and not all of the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section have been satisfied, but the removal is based on reasons apparently caused by a medical condition, the agency must advise the employee in writing of his or her possible eligibility for disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the FERS regulation, 5 CFR 844.202 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Agency procedures</span>. (1) When an agency issues a decision to remove an employee and not all of the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section have been satisfied, but the removal is based on reasons apparently caused by a medical condition, the agency must advise the employee in writing of his or her possible eligibility for disability retirement and of the time limit for filing an application.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[The condition referred to in both regulations "described in paragraph (a)" involves agency-initiated disability retirement applications, discussed below in "Agency-Initiated Disability Retirement Application."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no more general, statutory requirement for notice of the right to file for a disability retirement. CSRS establishes no statutory requirement for notice of the application time limit, <span class="Italic">Glaspell v. OPM</span>, 20 MSPR 375, 376 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, appellant contends that good cause exists for waiver of the requirement that a claim for disability retirement must be filed within one year of an employee's separation from the Federal service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b). Specifically, appellant contends that he was not properly separated from the U.S. Postal Service because, at the time of his separation, he was not informed that an application for disability retirement must be filed within one year and that failure to do so would result in loss of survivor annuity benefits. The evidence of record indicates that the agency did, however, inform appellant of his right to file an application for disability retirement and in fact encouraged him to do so. Since there is no requirement upon an agency to inform an employee of the time limit within which he must file a voluntarily-initiated application for disability retirement, we do not find that the agency's failure to do so rendered the separation action invalid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we find that the presiding official correctly found that he did not have discretion to waive the time limit for filing an application for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See generally In re John Shinko,</span> 1 MSPB 327 (1980). The appeal now before the Board is distinguishable from cases where it has been found appropriate to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel against the government. In <span class="Italic">Hansen v. Harris,</span> 619 F.2d. 942 (2d Cir. 1980), the court set forth the circumstances under which the doctrine could be applied. The court limited application of the doctrine "to the situation where (1) a procedural not a substantive right is involved and (2) an internal procedural manual or guide or some other source of objective standards or conduct exists and supports an inference of misconduct by a government employee."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 949. The agency did not provide the appellant with misinformation and in fact apprised him of his right to file an application for disability. We do not find that these circumstances warrant an inference of misconduct on the part of the agency. <span class="Italic">See generally Shelley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 MSPB 228 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Addressed in several decisions is whether the statutory one year filing period for a disability retirement application is waived if the regulatory notice is not provided by the agency to the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4148"></span>The Federal Circuit implied a requirement for OPM to waive the period for filing a disability retirement application when the employee was separated for medical reasons but the agency failed to provide notice of the opportunity to apply for a CSRS disability annuity in <span class="Italic">Johnston v. OPM</span>, 413 F.3d 1339, 1341-1343 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (corrected at 430 F.3d 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2005) [corrections shown in brackets]):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency is required to issue a decision to remove an employee for medical reasons, including advising the employee in writing of possible eligibility for disability retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1205(b)(1). When an agency issues a decision to remove an employee...but the removal is based on reasons apparently caused by a medical condition, the agency must advise the employee in writing of his or her possible eligibility for disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Johnston states that the agency failed to notify him of his changed status, his retirement options, and the time limits. He argues that the one-year deadline did not arise in 1991 in view of these errors and omissions by the agency. He states that, whether on a theory of estoppel, waiver, or equitable tolling, he should not be prejudiced by the agency's failure to comply with its own regulations and advise him of the change in his official employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Precedent supports Mr. Johnston's position. Waiver may lie against the agency when procedural error, in contravention of the agency's established duties, results in derogation of the employee's rights. <span class="Italic">See Simpson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 347 F.3d 1361 (Fed.

Mgmt.,</span> 241 F.3d 1364 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM bears the burden of showing that the requisite notice was sent [by the agency]. <span class="Italic">Brush v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 982 F.2d 1554, 1561 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (to prove that it has met its burden of providing notice, OPM must show that "notice was actually sent" and "offer proof as to the contents" of the notice). Failure to provide notice of a filing deadline may excuse an employee's failure to meet timing provisions that depend on such notice. <span class="Italic">See Casey v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 748 F.2d 685, 686 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (the agency provided tardy notice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b), and the employee's filing was timely when measured from the date of actual notice).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board ignored the burden on OPM to show that notice was given [by the agency], and invoked <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414, 110 S. Ct. 2465, 110 L. Ed.2d 387 (1990) for its holding that a claimant who relied on erroneous advice from a federal employee could not thereby estop the government from denying his claim. That is a misreading of <span class="Italic">Richmond,</span> for the Court did not absolve the federal government of the consequences of agency error, but held that the agency is not estopped from reaching the correct result, even when an agency representative gave incorrect information to an employee. In <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> the claimant sought to rely on an agency's erroneous advice that he was entitled to a certain annuity payment, although he was not in fact so entitled and the agency's advice was "in direct contravention of the federal statute upon which" his claim rested. Thus the Court held that the agency was not estopped, by its employee's error, from determining the correct annuity to be paid. 496 U.S. at 424, 110 S. Ct. 2465. In contrast, Mr. Johnston states that he received no notice or advice, contrary to regulation, although he may in fact have been entitled to disability benefits. <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> does not excuse an agency's violation of its duty, or apply an agency's error in order to deny an employee's just entitlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Statute and regulation embody the congressional intent that federal employees be informed of their rights and entitlements, implementing the federal employer's affirmative duty to "protect an employee's rights." <span class="Italic">Harris v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 142 F.3d 1463, 1470 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (interpreting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(a)). The one-year time period set in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b) arises with the agency's notification to the employee that he has been terminated for medical reasons. The time period for response is measured by the date of actual notice. <span class="Italic">See Casey,</span> 748 F.2d at 686 (measuring the timing of response from the date of the tardy notice). The agency cannot invoke a deadline that passed before notice was given.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that its December 12, 1989 letter requesting medical documentation, quoted <span class="Italic">supra,</span> was the requisite statutory notice. However, that letter contained no determination that Mr. Johnston was deemed medically unable to return to work. The letter requested information for the purpose of ascertaining when and if Mr. Johnston could return to work. It was not a notice of termination, and contained no information or procedures for applying for disability retirement. As held in <span class="Italic">Wood,</span> 241 F.3d at 1367, inadequate or confusing notice does not satisfy the duty of notice of substantive rights. The burden is on OPM to establish [compliance] with the statutory and regulatory requirements of notice. <span class="Italic">Brush,</span> 982 F.2d at 1561.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM relies on <span class="Italic">Deerinwater v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 78 F.3d 570, 573 (Fed. Cir. 1996) and <span class="Italic">Killip v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 991 F.2d 1564, 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Neither of these cases involved a contravention or omission of OPM's statutory and regulatory duties. In <span class="Italic">Deerinwater</span> the employee relied on incorrect advice from an agency representative that an application for disability retirement would be timely if received by the employing agency within one year, whereas the statute and regulation require receipt by OPM within one year; this court rejected the employee's argument that the regulation was confusing and misleading, characterizing the argument as a "smokescreen" and an attempt "to make an end run around <span class="Italic">Richmond." Deerinwater,</span> 78 F.3d at 573. There was no issue in <span class="Italic">Deerinwater</span> of whether a statutory notice had been given.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Killip</span> the question was whether OPM had the authority to allow an election to transfer from the Civil Service Retirement System to the Federal Employee Retirement System, where the statute required that such election be made by June 30, 1988. <span class="Italic">Killip,</span> 991 F.2d at 1568-70. The court held that OPM "lacked the authority" to consider elections made "outside of the carefully defined open season." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1570. In neither <span class="Italic">Deerinwater</span> nor <span class="Italic">Killip</span> was there an allegation that the agency failed to give any notice required by law, and no statutory time period measured by the date of giving such notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, Mr. Johnston's situation is analogous to that of the employee in <span class="Italic">Brush,</span> 982 F.2d 1554, whose former spouse was relieved of her failure to meet a deadline to elect a survivor annuity, because the agency had not met its obligation to provide notice of this election right. Similar agency obligation is present here, for statute and regulation require that the disabled employee be notified of his rights and filing deadlines.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Johnston states that he did not receive the requisite notice stating that his employment had been formally terminated and advising him of his options, and that he was not aware of his possible entitlement until he received OPM's letter of April 1, 2003. The Board stated that it need not consider the credibility of Mr. Johnston's testimony, and made no findings as to whether or when [the agency] sent or Mr. Johnston received the requisite notice. As we have discussed, the Board erred in holding that it was irrelevant whether such notice had been sent and received. We vacate the decision of the Board, and remand for determination of whether such notice was in fact given. In the event that OPM does not meet its burden of establishing earlier notice, the filing deadline is appropriately measured from the April 1, 2003 letter from OPM to Mr. Johnston.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">There are three bases for waiving a filing deadline prescribed by statute or regulation: (1) the statute or regulation specifies circumstances for a waiver; (2) an agency's affirmative misconduct may preclude enforcement of the deadline under the doctrine of equitable estoppel; and (3) an agency's failure to provide a notice of rights and the applicable filing deadline may warrant a waiver of the deadline, if statute or regulation requires that such notice be given. <span class="Italic">Jeter v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 495, 498 (1996). First, although the relevant statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453, provides that waiver of the deadline may be allowed if the employee was mentally incompetent at the date of separation from service or within 1 year thereafter, the appellant does not allege mental incompetence. Second, the appellant does not allege that the employing agency engaged in any affirmative misconduct. He does argue, however, that the third basis for waiver of a filing deadline applies here because the employing agency had a regulatory duty to provide him notice of his disability retirement option but failed to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that, when an agency removes a FERS employee and the removal is based on reasons apparently caused by a medical condition, the employing agency is required to inform him of his possible eligibility for disability retirement and of the time limit for filing an application. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(b)(1). The current record is not sufficiently developed to determine whether the employing agency was required to afford the appellant notice under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(b)(1) or whether it did so. The Board has held, however, that even if the employing agency was required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(b)(1) to inform the appellant of his potential disability retirement option, the agency's failure to do so would not provide a basis to waive the statutory 1-year filing deadline under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453. <span class="Italic">King v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Jeter</span> and <span class="Italic">King</span>, the Board considered the exact issue before us now: whether an agency's failure to notify an appellant of the deadline for filing a disability retirement application, as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(b)(1), provides a basis for waiving the 1-year statutory filing deadline under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453. <span class="Italic">King</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 522, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Jeter</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 498-500. The Board determined that it does not, stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]t is true that OPM's regulation [5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(b)] required the [appellant's employing agency] to inform the appellant of the deadline for filing a disability retirement application and that it did not do so. Accepting this failure to satisfy a notice obligation imposed by OPM as an independent basis for waiver of the statutory deadline, when Congress has already defined the only basis for such waiver, would essentially permit OPM to vary the filing requirements set by Congress in the statute. OPM, however, only has such authority as has been granted or delegated to it under the specific terms prescribed by Congress in the delegating statute. <span class="Italic">See Killip v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 991 F.2d 1564, 1569-70 (Fed. Cir. 1993). When Congress has mandated specific timeliness requirements regarding the filing of an application or election and a particular filing does not meet those requirements, therefore, OPM lacks the authority to consider it. <span class="Italic">See Deerinwater v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 78 F.3d 570, 571-73 (Fed.

This result accords with the well-settled propositions of law that public funds like disability retirement benefits must be spent according to the letter of <span id="Page_4150"></span>the difficult judgments reached by Congress as to the common good, and that agencies may not stretch their jurisdiction to decide questions whose resolution properly lies with Congress. <span class="Italic">Jeter</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 501 (citing <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v.

<p class="Body-Text">In its remand order following OPM's request to the Federal Circuit that the case be returned to the Board, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. OPM</span>, CH-844E-14-0449-M-1 (NP 9/2/2016), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's employing agency, the U.S. Postal Service, removed him on the basis of an absence without leave charge. In or around June 2011, the appellant applied for disability retirement benefits under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). In a March 7, 2014 reconsideration decision, OPM dismissed the appellant's application as untimely filed outside the 1-year statutory time limit established by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453, which requires that an application for disability retirement benefits under FERS must be filed before the employee separates from service or within 1 year of his separation. In support of its finding, OPM explained that the documentation in the appellant's file established that he was separated from his employing agency on February 20, 2010, and that OPM received his disability retirement application on July 25, 2011. OPM further determined that the evidence presented was insufficient to show that the appellant was mentally incompetent during the filing period of February 20, 2010, to February 20, 2011, as to warrant waiver of the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed OPM's reconsideration decision to the Board. In relevant part, he argued that his disability retirement application was not untimely because the agency did not process his removal until August 19, 2010, and, even if his removal were effective February 20, 2010, he was entitled to equitable tolling of the statutory filing period because his employing agency failed to notify him, as required by regulation, of his potential eligibility for disability retirement. The administrative judge affirmed OPM's decision, finding that: OPM correctly determined that the appellant was separated on February 20, 2010; the July 2011 application for disability retirement was untimely filed; and equitable tolling could not be invoked to waive the statutory filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a petition for review, and the Board affirmed the initial decision. The Board noted that the record was not sufficiently developed to determine whether the employing agency was required to afford the appellant notice under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(b)(1) or whether it did so.[2] However, the Board concluded that, even if the employing agency were required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(b)(1) to inform the appellant of his potential disability retirement option, the agency's failure to do so would not provide a basis to waive the statutory 1-year filing deadline under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453. <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, Final Order, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13 (citing <span class="Italic">King v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(b)(1), when an agency removes an employee covered by FERS and "the removal is based on reasons apparently caused by a medical condition, the agency must advise the employee in writing of his or her possible eligibility for disability retirement and of the time limit for filing an application." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(b)(1). The Board has held that the regulation requires the agency to act when it appears that the basis for the removal was caused by a medical condition, regardless of whether the removal was for disciplinary or other reasons. <span class="Italic">King v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 522, &#x00B6; 13 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed the Board's decision to the Federal Circuit. OPM moved for a voluntary remand to the Board to allow the Board to consider, in the first instance, whether equitable tolling was appropriate in this case in light of <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 413 F.3d 1339, <span class="Italic">revised on recons</span>., 430 F.3d 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2005).[3] OPM also moved that, in the event that the court found equitable tolling of the statutory filing deadline was available in this case, the case be remanded for further development of the record regarding whether the appellant received, or should have received, notice pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Although the final order in this case did not discuss <span class="Italic">Johnston</span>, the Board has previously distinguished Johnston from cases such as this one--wherein the employing agency failed to give regulatory notice--on the grounds that <span class="Italic">Johnston</span> involved the employing agency's failure to give statutory notice as well as regulatory notice. <span class="Italic">King</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 522, &#x00B6; 15. In the instant appeal, the court noted that, "[i]t appears that the Board relied on the fact that, here, at issue was the alleged failure of the agency to provide Mr. Johnson regulatory, as opposed to statutory[,] notice. But <span class="Italic">Johnston</span> did not make such a distinction."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a May 24, 2016 order, the court granted OPM's motion in part. In particular, the court found that the "Board erred in its determination that it was barred by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453 from correcting any error on the part of the agency for failing to meet the notice requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(b)(1)," and remanded the appeal for further development of the record to determine whether the employing agency was required to provide the appellant notice pursuant to section 844.202(b)(1).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant contests the administrative judge's finding that her employing agency's failure to inform her of possible eligibility for disability retirement at the time of her removal did not provide a basis for waiving the statutory deadline to apply for disability retirement. In <span id="Page_4151"></span>support of her argument, the appellant cites the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 413 F.3d 1339, 1342-43, <span class="Italic">revised on recons</span>., 430 F.3d 1376 (Fed.

Office of Personnel Management</span>, 449 F. App'x 936, 938-39 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (nonprecedential) (stating that the Board is not barred from equitably correcting a lack of notice of potential eligibility for disability retirement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we need not rely upon the Federal Circuit's decision because the appellant in this case received adequate notice of her potential eligibility for disability retirement benefits. Under the CSRS, when an agency issues a decision to remove an employee and not all of the conditions for an agency to file an application for disability retirement on behalf of an employee are satisfied, but the removal is based on reasons "apparently caused by a medical condition," the agency must advise the employee in writing of her possible eligibility for disability retirement. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1205(b)(1). Here, although the appellant was removed for AWOL, the agency official sustaining the appellant's removal discussed in his decision the appellant's medical condition in connection with her request for reasonable accommodation, concluding that while her absences "may be medically justified," the appellant could not be accommodated and did not dispute the charge of AWOL. The removal decision further notified the appellant that, "If you believe your health condition continues to prevent you from returning to duty, you may wish to explore the option of disability retirement," and provided her with the contact information for human resources staff should she wish to do so. Such notice was sufficient to meet the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1205(b)(1).[5] Thus, OPM properly dismissed the appellant's application for disability retirement as untimely filed.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The parallel regulation applicable to disability retirement under Federal Employees Retirement System further requires the agency to provide notice of the time limit for filing an application for disability retirement; however, under the regulation applicable to the CSRS, no notice of the time limit for filing is required. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1205(b)(1), <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;We also agree with the administrative judge that the employing agency was not required to submit an application for disability retirement on the appellant's behalf. At a minimum, there is no indication that the appellant was institutionalized or incapable of making a decision to file an application for disability retirement at the time of her removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1205(a)(3) (requiring that the employee be institutionalized or that the agency conclude that the employee is incapable of making a decision to file an application for disability retirement before an agency must file a disability retirement application on an employee's behalf).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Law predating <span class="Italic">Johnston</span> and <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> did not find a waiver of the deadline for filing a disability retirement application based on an agency's failure to provide a notice required by OPM regulation. Absence of the notice did not excuse delay without a showing of mental incompetency during the period required for filing the application, <span class="Italic">Jeter v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 495, 498-501 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A claim for disability retirement under FERS may only be considered if the employee or Member filed an application with OPM before separation from service or within one year thereafter. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453. As discussed above, the appellant did not file his application for disability retirement before his termination on March 15, 1991, or within one year thereafter. There are three bases for waiving a filing deadline prescribed by statute or regulation: (1) The statute or regulation specifies circumstances for a waiver; (2) affirmative misconduct by the agency may preclude enforcement of the deadline under the doctrine of equitable estoppel; (3) an agency's failure to provide a notice of rights and the applicable filing deadline may warrant a waiver of the deadline, if statute or regulation requires that such notice be given. <span class="Italic">See Collins v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...An agency must advise an employee covered under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) in writing of his or her possible eligibility for disability retirement if it issues a decision to remove the employee based on reasons apparently caused by a medical condition. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1205(b). That regulatory provision does not impose any obligation on the agency, however, to advise the employee of the time limit for filing a disability retirement application. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In a line of cases involving employees covered under CSRS, then, the Board has found that an employing agency has no duty to inform separated employees of the deadline for applying for disability retirement and that the failure to give such notice thus does not justify waiver of the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Cooley v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 306, 309-10 (1991); <span class="Italic">Glenn</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. at 502; <span class="Italic">Glaspell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 20 M.S.P.R. 375, 376 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, however, an agency must advise an employee covered under FERS in writing of his or her eligibility for disability retirement <span class="Italic">and</span> of the time limit for filing an application if it issues a decision to remove the employee based on reasons apparently caused by a medical condition. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(b) (emphasis added). As noted above, the USCP's decision to remove the appellant cited his alleged psychological unfitness for duty; its decision letter advised him of his eligibility for disability retirement and offered assistance in filing the required documentation, but it did not inform him of the time limit for filing. The appellant thus did not receive notice of the filing deadline as he was entitled to under the applicable regulation. The third prong of the <span class="Italic">Speker</span> test thus might appear to require waiver of the time limit here because a regulatory notice obligation imposed by OPM has not been discharged. <span class="Italic">See Brush v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 982 F.2d 1554, 1560-61 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (failure by OPM to comply with notice requirement would support waiver of time limit for election of survivor benefits); <span class="Italic">Jacob</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 343-44 (employing agency's failure to give required notice to retiring employee of his right to make a deposit for post-1956 military service justified waiver of the deadline for making such a deposit).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the sake of clarity, however, it is important to interpret <span class="Italic">Speker</span> in light of the limitations imposed as a matter of law on OPM's discretion in applying the retirement statutes. In analyzing an agency's construction of a statute which it administers, a two-step inquiry is required. First is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue; if the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter, for the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress must be given effect. Only if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue does the question arise regarding whether the agency has construed the statute in a permissible manner. <span class="Italic">See Brush</span>, 982 F.2d at 1558-59 &#x0026; n.15 (citing <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984)). In <span class="Italic">Brush</span>, then, the court simply effected the will of Congress by enforcing a statutory notice obligation as a basis for waiver of a statutory filing deadline; the timeliness issue thus was properly resolved under the first prong of the <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> inquiry. <span class="Italic">See</span> 982 F.2d at 1558-64. The Board in <span class="Italic">Jacob</span> addressed a situation where OPM and not Congress had defined the filing deadline and the conditions for waiver of the deadline, and it was therefore free to evaluate the reasonableness of OPM's findings on the timeliness issue under the second part of the <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> analysis. <span class="Italic">See</span> 69 M.S.P.R. at 343-44.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, however, the statute specifies that an application for disability retirement must be filed prior to separation or within one year thereafter, and it provides for waiver of this filing deadline on grounds of mental incompetence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453. The statute thus provides for a specific filing deadline and only one basis for waiver of that deadline; that basis has not been established here because the appellant (as noted above) has not met his burden of proof on the issue of mental incompetence. In enacting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453, then, Congress directly spoke to the precise issue of the time allowed for filing a disability retirement application and the circumstances under which that deadline could be waived. The appellant has not established a basis for waiver under the terms prescribed by Congress in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453, and our inquiry here thus must end, because the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress must be given effect. <span class="Italic">See Brush</span>, 982 F.2d at 1558. We therefore cannot find that waiver of the filing deadline is proper here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, it is true that OPM's regulation [5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(b)] required the USCP to inform the appellant of the deadline for filing a disability retirement application and that it did not do so. Accepting this failure to satisfy a notice obligation imposed by OPM as an independent basis for waiver of the statutory deadline, when Congress has already defined the only basis for such waiver, would essentially permit OPM to vary the filing requirements set by Congress in the statute. OPM, however, only has such authority as has been granted or delegated to it under the specific terms prescribed by Congress in the delegating statute. <span class="Italic">See Killip v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 991 F.2d 1564, 1569-70 (Fed. Cir. 1993). When Congress has mandated specific timeliness requirements regarding the filing of an application or election and a particular filing does not meet those requirements, therefore, OPM lacks the authority to consider it. <span class="Italic">See Deerinwater v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 78 F.3d 570, 571-73 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (upholding disallowance of application under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453 as untimely filed); <span class="Italic">Killip</span>, 991 F.2d at 1570 (upholding disallowance of appellant's election where it was made after date prescribed by Congress).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulation notwithstanding, then, the appellant's failure to meet the requirements in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453 for filing an application for disability retirement benefits precludes consideration of his application. This result accords with the well-settled propositions of law that public funds like disability retirement benefits must be spent according to the letter of the difficult judgments reached by Congress as to the common good, and that agencies may not stretch their jurisdiction to decide questions whose resolution properly lies with Congress. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 428 (1990); <span class="Italic">Killip</span>, 991 F.2d at 1570. We therefore affirm OPM's disallowance of the appellant's disability retirement application.</p>
