<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-50"><span class="space">12.</span> Agency-Initiated Disability Retirement Application</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under limited circumstances an agency may initiate a disability retirement application for (or against) an employee. An OPM CSRS regulation provides, 5 CFR 831.1205 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Agency-filed disability retirement applications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Basis for filing an application for an employee.</span> An agency must file an application for disability retirement of an employee who has 5 years of civilian Federal service when all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4158"></span>(1)&#x2003;The agency has issued a decision to remove the employee;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The agency concludes, after its review of medical documentation, that the cause for unacceptable performance, attendance, or conduct is disease or injury;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The employee is institutionalized, or the agency concludes, based on a review of medical and other information, that the employee is incapable of making a decision to file an application for disability retirement;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;The employee has no personal representative or guardian; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;The employee has no immediate family member who is willing to file an application on his or her behalf.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Agency procedures.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;When an agency issues a decision to remove an employee and not all of the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section have been satisfied, but the removal is based on reasons apparently caused by a medical condition, the agency must advise the employee in writing of his or her possible eligibility for disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If the agency is filing a disability retirement application on the employee's behalf, the agency must inform the employee in writing at the same time it informs the employee of its removal decision, or at any time before the separation is effected, that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;The agency is submitting a disability retirement application on the employee's behalf to OPM;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;The employee may review any medical information in accordance with the criteria in &#x00A7; 294.106(d) of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;The action does not affect the employee's right to submit a voluntary application for retirement under this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;When an agency submits an application for disability retirement to OPM on behalf of an employee, it must provide OPM with copies of the decision to remove, the medical documentation, and any other documents needed to show that the cause for removal is due to a medical condition. Following separation, the agency must provide OPM with a copy of the documentation of the separation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">OPM procedures.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;OPM will not act on any application for disability retirement filed by an agency on behalf on an employee until it receives the appropriate documentation of the separation. When OPM receives a complete application for disability retirement under this section, it will notify the former employee that it has received the application, and that he or she may submit medical documentation. OPM will determine entitlement to disability benefits under &#x00A7; 831.1206.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;OPM will cancel any disability retirement when a final decision of an administrative authority or court reverses the removal action and orders the reinstatement of an employee to the agency rolls.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For FERS employees, 5 CFR 844.202 (2022), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Agency-filed disability retirement applications</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Basis for filing an application for an employee.</span> An agency must file an application for disability retirement of an employee who has 18 months of Federal civilian service when all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The agency has issued a decision to remove the employee;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The agency concludes, after its review of medical documentation, that the cause for unacceptable performance, attendance, or conduct is disease or injury;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The employee is institutionalized, or the agency concludes, based on a review of medical and other information, that the employee is incapable of making a decision to file an application for disability retirement;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;The employee has no personal representative or guardian; and</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;When an agency issues a decision to remove an employee and not all of the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section have been satisfied, but the removal is based on reasons apparently caused by a medical condition, the agency must advise the employee in writing of his or her possible eligibility for disability retirement and of the time limit for filing an application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If all of the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section have been met, the agency must inform the employee in writing at the same time it informs the employee of its removal decision, or at any time before the separation is effected, that:</p>

OPM will determine entitlement to disability benefits under &#x00A7; 844.203.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant takes the ensuing agency-initiated retirement to the Board on appeal, the employing agency is the respondent, <span class="Italic">Daley v. OPM</span>, 11 MSPR 601, 603-04 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision the presiding official placed the burden of proof alternately upon OPM to support the action taken, granting the disability retirement, by a preponderance of the evidence, and upon the agency to establish by the preponderance of the evidence that the appellant's mental condition at work adversely affected her performance and rendered her unfit for continued employment. This Board has held, in <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 MSPR 404 (1981), that pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c) it is the employee who bears the burden to prove disability by a preponderance of the evidence in an appeal before the Board from an OPM decision on a voluntarily-initiated application for disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Chavez</span> the Board noted that the manifest intent of Congress, in enacting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c) was to place the burden of persuasion on the party initiating the action. The presiding official here did not have available the Board's ruling in <span class="Italic">Chavez,</span> and assigned the burden of proof to OPM. To assign the burden of proof appropriately in the instant case the Board must decide who is the party initiating the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we will consider the appropriate role of the employee in an agency initiated application. The regulatory scheme governing the processing of the present case prior to its coming within the Board's jurisdiction provides that the employee may participate in the process, and that the employee must be given notice of each step in the process. However, at the same time, the process may be completed without participation by the employee. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1203. In other words the agency, having decided to place an application for disability retirement with OPM for an employee, may carry the process to completion without the employee's involvement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The liberal grant of involvement to the employee in an agency initiated disability retirement application leads the Board to conclude a regulatory purpose to decide as much as possible, in a single proceeding, all questions the determination of which is necessary to completely dispose of the controversy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations also provide the employee who is the subject of an agency initiated disability retirement application the right, after OPM has issued its decision in the matter, to request a reconsideration decision. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1204(c). At this procedural juncture a record sufficient to make an ultimate decision about the propriety of disability retirement for the employee has been developed by the employing agency and OPM. However, the regulations provide the employee at that point with standing which enables him or her to control the future proceedings, and to supplement the record. The employee exercising the right to request a reconsideration decision truly becomes another party to the previously instituted action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once the employee's role in an agency initiated disability retirement application is determined to be that of a party, and noting again that the agency may complete the disability retirement application process, without that party's involvement, it becomes clear that the party initiating the action is the employing agency. The employing agency, therefore, according to <span class="Italic">Chavez,</span> has the burden to prove disability by a preponderance of the evidence. The appeal to the Board by the employee will bring before the Board all the parties to the disability retirement application process, and will subject that process to <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review by the Board. The employing agency may be assisted or opposed by the employee in carrying its burden of proof.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case then, the employee's appeal to the Board also brought the employing agency within the Board's jurisdiction, as a party to the proceeding, as well as OPM. The presiding official should have viewed the employing agency as the initiator of the action and assigned to it the burdens associated with that role. The presiding official should weigh all the evidence presented, regardless of the party presenting it, in order to determine whether the preponderance of the evidence supports a finding that the disability retirement should be granted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board remanded an adverse action appeal to require the agency to file a disability retirement application, <span class="Italic">Timberlake v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 231, 232-37 &#x00B6; 2, 5-19 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from his Mail Processor position based upon the charge of being medically unsuitable to perform the duties of his position. The agency based its decision to remove the appellant on the results of a fitness for duty examination conducted by Dr. Stewart Waddell, a psychiatrist. Dr. Waddell concluded that the appellant suffered from a "personality disorder of the Cluster A type with prominent paranoid features," that the appellant would be unable to interact well with co-workers or supervisors, that he would be at high risk for engaging in disruptive behavior, that he would have difficulty in accepting and complying with supervisory directions, that treatment would provide little help in significantly changing the appellant's behavior, and that the appellant "sees himself as having nothing wrong with him."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the petition has been pending, the Board recognized that the medical evidence and the administrative judge's conclusions raised questions regarding the appellant's ability to work, his competence to file a disability retirement application, and the agency's possible responsibility for filing a disability retirement application on the appellant's behalf. The Board, therefore, ordered the agency to show cause why the Board should not order it to file and prosecute to conclusion an application for disability retirement on the appellant's behalf, and afforded the appellant an opportunity to respond to the agency's submission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, the agency asserts that all of the conditions giving rise to an agency's obligation to file a disability retirement application on an appellant's behalf are not satisfied. It first notes that the appellant is covered by the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), and that the regulations implementing FERS require an agency to file a disability retirement application on an appellant's behalf where the following conditions are met: (1) The agency has issued a decision to remove the employee; (2) the agency concludes, after its review of medical documentation, that the appellant's unacceptable performance, attendance, or conduct was caused by disease or injury; (3) the employee is institutionalized or the agency concludes, based on review of medical and other information, that the employee is incapable of making a decision to file a disability retirement application; (4) the employee has no personal representative or guardian; and (5) the employee has no immediate family member who is willing to file an application on the appellant's behalf. <span class="Italic">Id.; see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency states that, while circumstances 1, 2, and 4 apply to the present case, it was unable to determine whether circumstance 5 applies, and further believes that circumstances 3 does not apply. With respect to circumstance 3, it asserts that the appellant is not institutionalized, <span id="Page_4159"></span>and it believes that he cares for himself, that a guardian or personal representative has not been appointed for him, and that he has competently represented himself in a number of administrative and judicial proceedings before the Board, the EEOC, the NLRB, and in Federal district court. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> It further states that, while it believes the appellant has either children or stepchildren, they do not reside with him, and it has no way to reach them to determine their willingness to file a disability retirement application on his behalf.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant replied to the agency's response, asserting that the Board should require the agency to file a disability retirement application on his behalf. He states that the agency refuses to provide him with the necessary documents for him to file the retirement application on his own, and disagrees with the agency's opinion that he has been able to competently represent himself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we explained in our show-cause order, both the Civil Service Retirement System and the FERS mandate that an agency file a disability retirement application on an employee's behalf where the employee meets the service requirements for a disability retirement annuity and where the following circumstances are met: (1) The agency has issued a decision to remove the employee; (2) the agency concludes, after its review of medical documentation, that the cause for unacceptable performance, attendance or conduct is disease or injury; (3) the employee is institutionalized, or the agency concludes, based on review of medical and other information, that the employee is incapable of making a decision to file an application for disability retirement; (4) the employee has no personal representative or guardian; and (5) the employee has no immediate family member who is willing to file an application on his or her behalf. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8337(a), 8451(a)(1)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1205(a), 844.202(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While there are no formal personnel forms indicating the appellant's length of service in the record below, the agency's submission in response to the Board's show cause order on review establishes that the appellant is under the FERS retirement system, and that his retirement computation date is September 1, 1984. Thus, we find that the appellant meets the 18-month service requirement for a disability retirement annuity under FERS. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(a). We also note that the agency's actions throughout the appeal are consistent with the conclusion that the appellant satisfies the service requirement. It proposed a settlement that included a term that would have held the appellant's removal in abeyance while he pursued disability retirement, and noted in its post-hearing brief that it encouraged the appellant to file for disability retirement on "numerous occasions," but that these efforts were "to no avail."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next two criteria for requiring the agency to file a disability retirement application on the appellant's behalf are also clearly satisfied. They require that the agency has issued a decision to remove the employee, and that the agency concludes, after its review of medical documentation, that the cause for unacceptable performance, attendance or conduct is disease or injury. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(a). As discussed above, the agency has removed the appellant based upon his medical condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next find that, based upon review of medical and other information, the agency should have concluded that the appellant is incapable of making a decision to file a disability retirement application. The agency relied upon Dr. Waddell's diagnosis of the appellant's condition in deciding to remove the appellant. As mentioned earlier, Dr. Waddell concluded that the appellant suffered from a "personality disorder of the Cluster A type with prominent paranoid features," that the appellant would be unable to interact well with co-workers or supervisors, that he would be at high risk for engaging in disruptive behavior, that he would have difficulty in accepting and complying with supervisory directions, that treatment would provide little help in significantly changing the appellant's behavior, and that the appellant "sees himself as having nothing wrong with him. Further, the agency admitted that the appellant refused its "numerous" suggestions that he file a disability retirement application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record developed before the Board further alerted the agency to the conclusion that the appellant is not capable of deciding to file a disability retirement application. Dr. Waddell's hearing testimony reiterated the diagnosis he previously presented to the agency. He testified that the appellant suffers from a personality disorder with prominent paranoid features, and that the appellant, therefore, has a pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others causing him to interpret their motives as malevolent. The administrative judge considered this testimony in concluding that "the very nature of the appellant's personality disorder prevents him from recognizing its existence. Because the nature of the appellant's disorder prevents him from recognizing its existence, it precludes his ability to recognize the need to file a disability retirement application, and the agency should have known that the appellant would not file a disability retirement application on his own behalf. <span class="Italic">See Nowell v. Department of the Army,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 296, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next criterion for requiring an agency to file a disability retirement application on the appellant's behalf, that the employee has no personal representative or guardian, is also satisfied. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.202(a). The appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span> in this appeal, and the record indicates that he also pursued various administrative complaints and court appeals on his own behalf. Further, the agency admits that the appellant has no personal representative or guardian.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The final requirement, that the employee has no immediate family member who is willing to file an application on his or her behalf, is satisfied as well. There is no indication that the appellant has an immediate family member who is willing to file an application on his behalf. Dr. Waddell's June 16, 1999 report of his June 10, 1999 examination of the appellant includes a discussion of the appellant's family history. Dr. Waddell reported that the appellant "reluctantly" provided some past history, stating that he had four brothers and five sisters, that his father is deceased, that his mother is alive and remarried, and that he sees her but he "doesn't know much 'because I don't pry into her affairs.'" The report further indicates that, while the appellant stated that he never married, he said he has two grown sons, though he did not remember their ages or where they live. He also indicated that he was unsure if he has any grandchildren and has no contact with his children.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> He similarly indicated that he was "not close to his siblings," stating "[w]e don't get into each others' lives," that he lives alone and says he has always lived alone, that his "life is my own private thing."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a subsequent November 16, 2000 examination, the appellant contradicted some of the family history he had previously provided. In this later examination, the appellant told Dr. Waddell that he "guessed" he had nine siblings, but indicated that he was "very close" to them and saw them on a "regular basis." When Dr. Waddell asked the appellant how he spent his time, however, the appellant replied that he spent "most" of his time communicating with the agency and "did nothing else." Dr. Waddell testified that the appellant's differing descriptions of his relationship with his siblings was "odd."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this evidence establishes that the appellant does not have an immediate family member willing to file a disability retirement application on his behalf. There is no basis to dispute the appellant's statements that his father is deceased, that he is not close to his mother, that he has never married, and that he has no contact with his children. The appellant's description of his sibling relationships in his first interview contradicts his claim in the second interview that he is "very close" to his siblings, and is belied by his failure to ask any of his siblings to accompany him to his psychological evaluation. Instead, the appellant asked Kay Francis Langford to accompany him. Ms. Langford described herself as a friend of the appellant's mother and grandmother for approximately 15 years, and that she was not particularly close to the appellant. She testified that the appellant asked her to accompany him to the examination because he was concerned about whether the examination would be fair. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We find that the appellant's decision to request Ms. Langford's assistance further supports the conclusion that he does not have an immediate family member willing or able to assist him with a disability retirement application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We, therefore, conclude that the agency is required to file a disability retirement application on the appellant's behalf. Under these circumstances it is appropriate to remand this appeal to the Atlanta Regional Office for the administrative judge to engage in a cooperative undertaking with the agency and OPM to assure that the appellant will not suffer impairment of his rights to disability retirement benefits on account of his incapacity. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 142 F.3d 1463, 1469-71 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Nowell,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 296, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5; <span class="Italic">Dixon v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-6 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we have suspended our consideration of the petition for review pending completion of the non-adversarial process in which we are participating with the employing agency and OPM. <span class="Italic">See Nowell,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 296, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Dixon,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
