<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-589"><span class="space">1.</span> Preferential Consideration of Repromotion Eligibles for Vacancies</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 29 FLRA 380, 391-402 (1987), changed existing law as to Proposal 2, requiring that qualified reemployment eligibles will be reemployed at their former or lower grades by selection in preference to applicants from all other sources. The decision, determining the proposal negotiable, was split, Chairman Calhoun writing the controlling decision. FLRA noted that it would no longer follow earlier contrary decisions of <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3186 and DHHS, Office of Social Security Field Operations, Philadelphia Region</span>, 23 FLRA 230 (1986) (Proposal 3); <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2830 and DOJ</span>, 21 FLRA 1039 (1986); <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 29 and Army Corps of Eng'rs, Kansas City Dist.</span>, 21 FLRA 630 (1986); and <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2677 and DHHS, Office of Community Servs.</span>, 21 FLRA 117 (1986), <span class="Italic">petition for review dismissed</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2677 v. FLRA</span>, 814 F.2d 774 (D.C. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">The principal point of <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32</span> was the significance of the then-controlling FPM Chapter 335 provision, referred to in the Chairman's Opinion as Requirement 4, 29 FLRA at 393:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Selection procedures will provide for management's right to select or not select from among a group of best qualified candidates. They will also provide for management's right to select from other appropriate <span id="page_1055"></span>sources, such as reemployment priority lists, reinstatement, transfer, handicapped, or Veterans Readjustment eligibles or those within reach on an appropriate OPM certificate. In deciding which source or sources to use, agencies have an obligation to determine which is most likely to best meet the agency mission objectives, contribute fresh ideas and new viewpoints, and meet the agency's affirmative action goals.</p>
<p class="noindent">Qualifying Requirement 4 was another provision of the now defunct FPM Chapter 335, subch. 1-5(c), allowing agencies, at their discretion, to except actions from merit promotion plans, including but not limited to selection of candidates from a reemployment priority list for a position at a higher grade than the last one held and repromotion to a grade or position from one lost by demotion. Construing these provisions of the FPM, FLRA determined, in the Chairman's Opinion, 29 FLRA at 391-92, 400-01:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In my opinion, Proposal 2 interferes with the Agency's right to select...but not to an excessive degree....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Although the proposal does not expressly reserve to management the right to decide to fill a position, it is clear from the record that the Union intended this proposal to take effect after management determined to fill a vacancy....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The disputed proposal is to the same effect as proposals previously found to be negotiable or nonnegotiable solely on the basis of whether the bargaining unit employees involved are subject to the Federal Personnel Manual.&#x2003;For employees who are subject to the FPM, proposals like Proposal 2 were found to be nonnegotiable because although they were appropriate arrangements...they were inconsistent with FPM Chapter 335, subch. 1-4, Requirement 4--a Government-wide regulation. For employees who are not subject to the FPM, proposals similar to Proposal 2 have been found to be negotiable appropriate arrangements...because there were no applicable Government-wide regulations to restrict bargaining....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I believe that the situation created by these cases--where collective bargaining obligations involving matters vital to bargaining unit employees differ based only on whether the employees are subject to the FPM--may be the kind of anomalous situation referred to in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>, 803 F.2d 737, 742 (D.C. Cir. 1986), where the court stated the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We leave to another day the anomalous situation which would be created by an OPM regulation, as interpreted by the Authority without resort to OPM, having the effect of limiting the scope of proposals subject to collective bargaining where the proposal concerns a subject matter that Congress clearly intended to be appropriate for bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a result, I have reexamined the relationship among the various portions of the FPM as well as the relationship between the FPM and section 7106(b)(3). I now conclude that proposals such as Proposal 2...are negotiable whether or not the employees involved are subject to the FPM.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In my view, the instant proposal is negotiable for two independent reasons. First, subchapter 1-5(c) of chapter 335 provides discretion for the agency to except the selection of reemployment eligibles from coverage of its merit promotion plan. Under Authority precedent, this discretion may be exercised through negotiations. Second, Requirement 4 constitutes a restatement of the statutory right to make selections under 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. By referring to that "right," Requirement 4 may not be construed as a greater bar to bargaining than the statutory right itself. In addition, I reject the Agency's argument that the proposal is nonnegotiable because it does not concern "employees" within the meaning of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A Government-wide regulation which essentially restates a management right under section 7106 should not constitute a greater bar to bargaining than the statutory right itself. Accordingly, in those circumstances where I find that a proposal is a negotiable appropriate arrangement because it does not excessively interfere with a statutory right, I will not find the proposal to be nonnegotiable because it conflicts with a regulatory restatement of that right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The portion of the FPM of which Requirement 4 is a part contains many rules and regulations governing the promotion and selection of Government employees.&#x2003;My opinion should not be read to find that all of these rules must yield to the obligation to bargain over appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to selection under section 7106. Rather, the sole focus of my opinion is the alleged conflict between the Union's proposal on portions of the provision: the reference in the provision to "management's right to select or not select from among a group of best qualified candidates," and "management's right to select from other appropriate sources[.]" These portions, which allegedly preclude bargaining, add nothing to management's right under section 7106....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute must be construed as a whole in order to effectuate the basic purpose for which it was enacted.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 2096 v. FLRA</span>, 738 F.2d 633, 636 (4th Cir. 1984). Section 7106(a) of the Statute requires the management rights enumerated therein are "[s]ubject to subsection (b) of this section[.]" To find that the Agency's discretion under subchapter 1-5(c) may not be exercised through negotiations deprives section 7106(b)(3) of virtually all effect as it relates to the right to select when the employees involved are covered <span id="page_1056"></span>by the FPM. Since any proposal which interferes with management's right under section 7106(a)(2)(C) would also conflict with Requirement 4, that right would not be subject to appropriate arrangements under subsection (b)(3) when the employees are subject to the FPM.</p>
<p class="noindent">Impediments remained as to some repromotion proposals. A repromotion proposal was nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 29 FLRA 380, 387 (1987) (Proposal 3). The proposal was that repromotion eligibles be selected for positions at higher grades, up to their former grades, by giving the employees preference to applicants from all sources except reemployment eligibles. FLRA determined that the proposal prevented management from determining the qualifications of repromotion eligibles for vacancies. FLRA cited <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1450 and DHUD</span>, 23 FLRA 3 (1986), and <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-87 and Kansas Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 905 (1986), to support its conclusion that the proposal did not permit management to make qualifications determinations before offering positions to employees covered by the proposal. For other cases approving reemployment priority arrangements, refer to <span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg Ass'n of Educators, NEA and Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg Sch.</span>, 30 FLRA 508, 546 (1987) (Proposal 40) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg Dependent Sch.</span>, 28 FLRA 493 (1987) (Provision 7)). Refer to <span class="Italic">NFFE, Forest Serv. Council and USDA, Forest Serv., Region 6, Portland</span>, 46 FLRA 145, 147 (1992), involving Proposal 1, approving as an appropriate arrangement the request that stated, in part, "[w]hen directed reassignments are used to accomplish a workforce reduction, Management will directly reassign from qualified employees on the EISS [list]...."</p>
<p class="noindent">Analysis by FLRA of repromotion proposals involving vacancies is also provided by <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 41 FLRA 795, 845-46 (1991). The negotiable proposal requested repromotion into vacancies being filled, with ties to be broken through retention standing and an unsatisfactory rating to serve as a disqualifying factor:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that this provision is inconsistent with a Government-wide regulation, FPM chapter 335, subchapter 1-4, and, therefore, is nonnegotiable. In support of its position, the Agency relies on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2677 and Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Community Services</span>, 21 FLRA 117 (1986)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union describes Provision 16 as patterned on, and intended to have the same meaning as, Provision 2 in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA 24, which the Authority concluded was negotiable as an appropriate arrangement. The Union disputes the Agency's contention that the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Office of Community Services</span> requires a conclusion that this provision is nonnegotiable. The Union asserts that in accordance with <span class="Italic">KANG</span> and the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2782 and Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C.</span>, 6 FLRA 314 (1981), this provision is negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Union states, this provision is substantially identical to Provision 2 in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, which the Authority concluded was negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Prior to <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, the Authority had found that a proposal that, like Provision 2 in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, required selection of available repromotion eligibles when filling vacancies was nonnegotiable because it was inconsistent with FPM chapter 335, subchapter 1-4, requirement 4; a Government-wide regulation. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2782 and Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C.</span>, 14 FLRA 801 (1984) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of the Census</span>). In contrast, Provision 2 in <span class="Italic">KANG</span> was negotiable as an appropriate arrangement because it applied to National Guard civilian technicians to whom FPM chapter 335 was not applicable. 21 FLRA at 29 n.4. Thus, unlike the employees involved in Bureau of the Census, the provisions of FPM chapter 335, subchapter 1-4, requirement 4 did not apply to the employees who were the subject of the disputed provision in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>. Consequently, a distinction existed in Authority precedent with respect to proposals requiring repromotion, such as those involved in <span class="Italic">KANG</span> and <span class="Italic">Bureau of the Census</span>, based on the applicability of FPM chapter 335 to the employees who were the subjects of the proposals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While this case was pending, the Authority announced that it would no longer follow the approach it had taken with respect to requirement 4 in <span class="Italic">Office of Community Services</span> and like decisions. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 32 and Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 FLRA 380 (1987) (Member Frazier dissenting).... In <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management</span>, the Authority held that where a Government-wide regulation was no more than a restatement of management prerogatives contained in section 7106(a) of the Statute, it could not bar negotiation over appropriate arrangements. The Authority held that because requirement 4 was essentially a restatement of section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute it could not bar negotiation of a proposal that was otherwise negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management</span>, we reject the Agency's argument that Provision 16 is outside the duty to bargain because it is inconsistent with requirement 4 of FPM chapter 335, subchapter 1-4. Further, based on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">KANG</span> we conclude that Provision 16 is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 3 and Dept. of Navy, Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</span>, 51 FLRA 451, 458-59 (1995), was Proposal 3, "When the Employer decides to re-establish and fill a position that had been abolished in a RIF, any qualified and available former incumbent of the position will be reassigned to fill the position":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts and we agree that, by requiring the Agency to fill vacancies with former incumbents, the proposal restricts the "source" from which the vacancies will be filled, thereby "affect[ing] the authority of any management official of any agency...in accordance with applicable laws...with respect to filling positions, to make selections for appointments from...any...appropriate source[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C)(ii). <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Laurel Bay Teachers Association, OEA/NEA and Department of Defense, Stateside Dependents Schools, Laurel Bay Schools, Laurel Bay, South Carolina</span>, 49 FLRA 679, 683 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we find that the wording of the proposal supports the Agency's position that the proposal applies to employees without regard to whether they suffered any adverse effects resulting from RIF-related reassignments. Use of the adjective "any" to modify "former incumbent" implies that the only requirement--other than qualifications and availability--for reassignment under the proposal is that the employee occupied a position that was abolished by a RIF and subsequently reestablished. The Union's assertion to the contrary is inconsistent with the language of the proposal.... Therefore, we conclude that Proposal 3 applies to all "qualified and available former incumbent[s]" of a position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Not all employees affected by a RIF are necessarily adversely affected.&#x2003;For example, because of an employee's seniority, tenure group, and current annual performance rating, he or she may be able to displace another employee in a position equivalent to the one occupied before the RIF. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.701 ("Assignment involving displacement.") Proposal 3 would apply without distinction to both employees adversely affected by RIF-related reassignments and those not so affected. Furthermore, as it is not expressly limited to employees adversely affected by a RIF, the proposal would also apply to employees who voluntarily accepted reassignments for other than RIF-related reasons. In addition, the proposal would cover employees involuntarily removed from the positions based on other than RIF-related grounds. Therefore, the proposal lacks the tailoring necessary to constitute an arrangement under section 7106(b) (3). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 49 FLRA at 184. As Proposal 3 "affect[s] the authority" of management, "in accordance with applicable laws...with respect to filling positions, to make selections for appointments from...any...appropriate source[ ]" and does not constitute an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3), it is nonnegotiable. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent">Before its decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 29 FLRA 380, 385-87 (1987),
<span class="Italic">supra</span>, a proposal was nonnegotiable that required an agency to select, rather than only to consider for selection for any position filled, any qualified repromotion eligible (employees demoted or separated in a RIF and retained or subsequently rehired at a lower grade). The proposal negated the agency right to consider other applicants or use other sources of candidates to fill a vacancy. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2782 and Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census</span>, 7 FLRA 91, 92-93 (1981) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2782 and Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census</span>, 6 FLRA 314 (1981)).</p>
<p class="noindent">On review, the circuit court decided in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>, 702 F.2d 1183, 1187-88 (D.C. Cir. 1983), that FLRA applied an improper test of negotiability under the "appropriate arrangement" exception to management rights found at 5 USC 7106(b)(3). The case was remanded to FLRA to reconsider its decision. The court permitted FLRA to consider an issue that it had not addressed, the problem of whether the union proposal was contrary to government-wide regulation. Following the remand decision, the court again reviewed the case, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>, 803 F.2d 737, 739-41 (D.C. Cir. 1986), on the issue of the effect of the OPM regulation. This time the court affirmed FLRA's determination of nonnegotiability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand, the FLRA reversed course, determining that AFGE's proposal did indeed constitute an "appropriate arrangement" within the meaning of subsection (b)(3). In consequence, the Authority concluded, section 7106 of the statute presented no bar to the issuance of a bargaining order. <span class="Italic">AFGE AFL-CIO Local 2782 and Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census</span>, 14 FLRA 801 (1984). However, the Authority went on to determine that another provision of the statute, section 7117(a)(1), prohibited bargaining over AFGE's proposal. That section removes an agency's obligation to bargain with respect to proposals that are "inconsistent with any federal law or any government-wide rule or regulation."... Specifically, the FLRA concluded that AFGE's proposal was inconsistent with the following provision from chapter 335 of the Federal Personnel Manual:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Selection procedures will provide for management's right to select or not select from among a group of best qualified candidates. They will also provide for management's right to select from appropriate sources, such as reemployment priority lists, reinstatement, transfer, handicapped, or Veterans Readjustment eligibles or those within reach on an appropriate OPM certificate. In deciding which source or sources to use, agencies have an obligation to determine which is most likely to best meet the agency mission objectives, contribute fresh ideas and new viewpoints, and meet the agency's affirmative action goals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Requiring management to retain the option of selecting either from a group of "best qualified candidates" or from "other appropriate sources," this provision of the FPM was thus deemed to conflict directly with AFGE's proposal, which would require management to select solely from a list of "repromotion eligibles."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE's primary contention is that the applicable FPM provision, when properly interpreted, is not inconsistent with its bargaining proposal. The Union argues that while section 1-4...of chapter 335 may indeed conflict with its proposal...section 1-5 specifically permits the type of arrangement that AFGE is seeking at the bargaining table....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1-5 of FPM chapter 335 states in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003;Agencies may at their discretion except other actions from their plans. These include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(6)&#x2003;Repromotion to a grade or position from which an employee was demoted without personal cause and not at his or her request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...AFGE claims that this provision carves out a possible exception to Requirement 4 of the preceding section (1-4), thus rendering the Union's proposal permissible under the FPM.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA, in contrast, interprets section 1-5 of chapter 335 differently. In the Authority's view, section 1-5(c) creates an ability to except "certain personnel actions from the competitive selection procedures of [agency] merit promotion plans."... Upon analysis, we are persuaded that the Authority's interpretation is the more natural one.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a fallback, AFGE argues that the relevant provisions of the FPM do not constitute binding government-wide rules or regulations.... We disagree. The portion of the FPM at issue was promulgated pursuant to a specific federal regulation....</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal involving reversion rights to previously-held positions in a unit during a RIF was nonnegotiable because, even though the employees were not covered by FPM RIF regulations, the proposal interfered with management's right to assign employees. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1603 and Navy Exch., Naval Air Station, Patuxent River</span>, 9 FLRA 1039, 1039-40 (1982). Distinguishing the analysis of <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2782 and Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census</span>, 6 FLRA 314 (1981), FLRA considered nonnegotiable a proposal that required management to select eligible repromotion candidates (individuals demoted without personal fault) for vacancies that would otherwise be filled competitively, absent persuasive reasons for not using the repromotion eligibles. The phrase "persuasive reasons" was construed to preclude management from deciding whether to fill or abolish the vacancy or select a better candidate from any appropriate source.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See NAGE Local R14-52 and Dept. of Army, Red River Army Depot, Texarkana</span>, 9 FLRA 1042, 1043-44 (1982) (proposal interfered with right of management to make selections from any appropriate source when it required that employees reassigned involuntarily to positions without promotion potential be given first opportunity to be placed back into positions formerly held).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA declared nonnegotiable a proposal requiring that qualified employees demoted without fault be selected for the first available vacancy the employer determines to fill. The proposal required management to limit the selections to individuals who had been demoted, infringing management's right to select from any qualified source. <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2830 and DOJ</span>, 21 FLRA 1039, 1042 (1986). A proposal requiring the filling of a vacancy by qualified individuals displaced through reorganization excessively interfered with the agency's rights to hire and assign employees; it interfered with the right of the agency under OPM regulations to fill positions from other appropriate sources. <span class="Italic">DLA Council of AFGE Locals and DOD, DLA</span>, 24 FLRA 367, 372-74 (1986). A provision infringed on management's right to fill vacancies from any appropriate source when it required selection of employees holding retained grade rights during the period of eligibility for retained grade if the vacancy was to be filled at or below the retained grade level and the qualification requirements were otherwise met. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2677 and DHHS, Office of Community Servs.</span>, 21 FLRA 117, 118-19 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA restated its position concerning repromotion rights, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l GSA Council, Local 1497 and GSA Region 3</span>, 24 FLRA 928, 931-32 (1986):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the Union were to present a proposal reflecting its stated intent of obtaining "preference" for employees affected by a RIF in filling vacancies, the following decisions would be relevant to determining whether the proposal would be negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Bureau of the Census</span>, 24 FLRA 801 (1985),...in which the Authority found that a proposal which would require an agency to select qualified repromotion eligibles in filling bargaining unit vacancies was an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3). However, because the proposal conflicted with a Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) provision requiring preservation of management's right to select from other appropriate sources, it conflicted with a Government-wide rule or regulation and was nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA No. 4 (1986), where the Authority found that a proposal similar to that in <span class="Italic">Bureau of the Census</span> was within the duty to bargain as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3). The FPM provision at issue in <span class="Italic">Bureau of the Census</span> did not apply to the employees involved in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2782 and Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C.</span>, 6 FLRA 314 (1981), where the Authority found that a proposal which required only consideration as opposed to selection of repromotion eligibles for vacancies was negotiable as an appropriate arrangement. A proposal limited to consideration did not conflict with the above-mentioned requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Other repromotion cases decided during 1986 suggested a trend toward permitting negotiation of repromotion rights under limited circumstances. Repromotion rights as to vacancies to be filled following a RIF were held negotiable in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-87 and Adjutant Gen. of Kansas</span>, 21 FLRA 313, 315 (1986). <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg Dependent Sch.</span>, 28 FLRA 493, 516-17, 520-22 (1987), considered negotiable a proposal that the agency, if possible, offer qualified employees affected by a RIF positions that become available at a salary level close to the level of those employees prior to the RIF. The proposal was an appropriate arrangement. A proposal was negotiable that required management to return employees noncompetitively to specific locations and positions they lost through a RIF as positions were vacated and filled. Because of the adverse effect of a RIF, even one not involving demotion, caused by relocation of employees to positions elsewhere within the state, the measure constituted an appropriate arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right and, considering the interests of the employer and the employees, the proposal did not excessively interfere with the right of management to fill vacant positions from any appropriate source. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-87 and Dept. of Army, Kansas Army Nat'l Guard, Topeka</span>, 21 FLRA 380, 381-82 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">The law that developed before <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 29 FLRA 380 (1987), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, concerning reemployment eligibility was restated in <span class="Italic">CREA and Library of Congress, Congressional Research Serv.</span>, 25 FLRA 306, 322-23 (1987), involving a proposal for a unit apparently not covered by OPM regulations that the agency hire from the reemployment priority list before seeking outside applicants for appropriate positions coming open before or after a RIF:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Union Proposals 7 and 8 would establish a reemployment priority list of employees separated because of a RIF from which the Agency would offer appropriate positions which it had decided to fill before seeking other applicants.&#x2003;Proposals 7 and 8 are to the same effect as the proposal which the Authority found to be an appropriate arrangement in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees Local R14-87 and Department of the Army, Kansas Army National Guard, Topeka, Kansas</span>, 21 FLRA No. 48 (1986). In that case, we found that a proposal requiring the agency to select employees who were involuntarily downgraded without personal cause to their former positions at their former duty stations if those positions became vacant and the agency decided to fill them did not excessively interfere with the agency's rights to assign employees or fill positions from any appropriate source. Similarly, Proposals 7 and 8 here would benefit employees who lose their positions because of a RIF and would only apply to "appropriate" positions--the Agency retains the discretion to determine whether the position is one for which the affected employee would qualify. Also, the proposals apply only to positions which the Agency has decided to fill. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Department of Army, Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA No. 105 (1986) (Union Proposal 2) where we found that a proposal that would have required the agency to place an employee transferred because of a RIF in a vacant position at the employee's original location regardless of whether the agency elected to fill the vacancy or whether the employee was qualified excessively interfered with the agency's rights....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's contentions that the proposals directly determine conditions of employment of nonunit employees. First, the Union is not seeking to negotiate on behalf of "former employees." Rather, the reemployment priority list is an arrangement for those employees currently employed by the Agency in the event they should be separated because of a future RIF. Second, since the proposals limit reemployment priority to "appropriate" positions, we find that the proposals would not require the Agency to offer employees on the list positions outside the bargaining unit....</p>
