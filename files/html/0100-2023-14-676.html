<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-677"><span class="space">1.</span> Right to Determine Internal Security</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2452 and DHHS, SSA, Dist. Office, Huntington Park</span>, 45 FLRA 1213, 1216-18 (1992), applied an arrangements test to overcome an internal security argument concerning a proposal to provide a union representative with the combination to a lock on an employees' entrance to the activity office:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency's determination of when and how employees gain access to agency facilities is within the agency's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, where that determination is supported by a showing of a reasonable connection to internal security considerations. <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Association and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 41 FLRA 795, 837 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office</span>). Here, the Agency states that it limits dissemination of the employees' entrance combination at the Downey Branch office exclusively to employees of the Downey Office in order to safeguard employees and property. In our view, there is a reasonable relationship between limiting disclosure of the lock combination and the Agency's security concerns. Accordingly, we find that limitation to be within the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal requires the Agency to provide the combination to the Agency employee who is designated by the Union to represent employees at the Downey Office.&#x2003;In this regard, the record indicates that the Union representative "normally assigned to service bargaining unit members in the Downey [Office] is an 'offsite' representative; that is, she or he is employed at another [Agency] office." As the proposal would obligate the Agency to provide an Agency employee not assigned to the Downey Office with the combination, it directly interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. As such, the proposal is not a negotiable procedure under section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deciding whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement, we must determine whether the proposal is: (1) intended as an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right; and (2) appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of that right....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency has exercised its right to determine its internal security practices by limiting disclosure of the entry combination to employees assigned to the Downey Office. The Union representative, who is an Agency employee not assigned to the Downey Office, does not have the combination. According to the Union, the Agency's new security policy adversely affects the representative's access to unit employees, interrupts employees' and supervisors' work by requiring that the representative be admitted by someone in the office, impairs the effectiveness of unannounced Union safety inspections, and creates an unequal status between the Union and management. Accordingly, we find that the proposal is intended as an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether a proposal excessively interferes with a management right, we weigh "the competing practical needs of employees and managers" to ascertain whether the benefit to employees flowing from the proposal outweighs the proposal's burden on the exercise of the management right or rights involved.... In weighing such needs in this case, we note initially that the proposal does not concern the Union representative's admittance to the office but, rather, the method of admittance. It is undisputed, in this regard, that the representative is admitted to the office through the employee entrance whenever he or she so requests. However, currently a Downey Office employee or manager must admit the representative. Accordingly, disclosing the combination to the Union representative would benefit employees by eliminating a need to interrupt their work to admit the representative. Disclosure also would eliminate delays in the conduct of representational functions and would facilitate the representative's ability to make unannounced health and safety inspections of the office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the proposal's burden on the Agency's internal security policy is slight. The Agency would be required to provide the combination only to a single, identified, Agency employee who is not assigned to the Downey Office. Moreover, this employee has a need to conduct business regularly at the Downey Office and currently has access on request through the employees' entrance. In addition, the Agency does not claim that its policy is aimed at monitoring when the Union representative is in the Downey Office or preventing the representative's unescorted access to the office. Furthermore, the Agency does not assert an interest in controlling when the representative may gain access to the office, and it appears from the record that the Agency's security policy is not intended to bar the representative's admittance to the Downey Office during nonduty hours.... Finally, we note that the proposal does not preclude the Agency's changing the combination at any time. For example, the Agency could install a new combination when an employee of the Downey Office is permanently or temporarily reassigned elsewhere, or when the Union appoints a new representative. The proposal requires only that the Union representative for the Downey Office at the time of the change receive the new combination to the employee entrance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, we conclude that the benefits to the employees and the Union representative of providing the representative with the combination to the employees' entrance outweigh the negative effect on management's right to limit disclosure of the combination. Accordingly, we find that the proposal does not excessively interfere with management's right to determine its internal security practices and is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable was Proposal 1 in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2782 and Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census</span>, 49 FLRA 470, 471, 475-76 (1994), that the "Agency will give the Union a card for each secured area using a card key security system..." The proposal interfered with the right of the agency to determine its internal security practices. It was not an appropriate arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Proposal 1 does not constitute an arrangement.&#x2003;In this regard, in <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce</span> [49 FLRA No. 24 (1994)], the Authority agreed with various court decisions that arrangements must be tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects from the exercise of a management right and cannot be so broad as to apply to all employees without regard to whether they are likely to suffer such adverse effects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that some employees may suffer work disruptions resulting from admitting Union representatives into the workplace.&#x2003;To ameliorate these disruptions, the proposal would change the Union's method of access to the two affected work locations. However, there is no basis for concluding that employees are adversely affected, through work disruptions or in other ways, by the existing methods by which the Union gains access to the locations. In this regard, the record reflects that the Union has virtually unlimited access to employees at those locations. In particular, Union representatives may contact the Agency's administrative liaison or a supervisor for admittance during normal working hours and, for admittance at other times, the Union may obtain access through the Agency's security office, Thus, contrary to the Union's contentions, employees are not hampered in seeking assistance from, or communicating with, the Union. Moreover, as it is undisputed that Union <span id="page_1120"></span>representatives may gain admittance to the two locations by contacting nonunit personnel, it is not at all clear that there are or would be any work disruptions to unit employees resulting from such contacts. <span class="Italic">Compare Huntington Park</span>, 45 FLRA at 1217 (agency's policy of limiting disclosure of entrance combination only to employees assigned to a specific work site found to adversely affect employees by, among other things, requiring employees to interrupt their work to admit union representative not assigned to the work site in question).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also asserts that its ability to conduct health and safety inspections is made "more difficult if not impossible" due to the lack of a card key. However, we reject this assertion because it is completely unsupported in the record before us. The parties bear the burden of creating a record on which the Authority can make a negotiability determination. Parties failing to meet their burden act at their own peril....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Union's claim that employees would be subject to "censure" if employees admitted an unauthorized person into the workplace. The proposal concerns the method of access of Union representatives to the affected offices, and it is undisputed that Union representatives are authorized to enter the two locations. Further, even assuming an employee allowed an unauthorized person to enter the workplace, the Union has failed to demonstrate that the proposal addresses that circumstance. Finally, the Union's claim that the Agency's security system has eliminated informal meetings between management and the Union due to the "formalization of all movement" throughout the offices, is unsubstantiated. There is no indication in the record that, after having gained access to the affected locations, Union representatives are unable to meet with Agency officials, formally or informally.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, Proposal 1 is not sufficiently tailored to ameliorate the adverse effects on employees from implementation of a card key system at affected Agency facilities. Accordingly, the proposal does not constitute an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute and is nonnegotiable.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority first examines whether the proposal is intended as an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right.[52] To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the actual effects, or reasonably foreseeable effects, on employees that flow from the exercise of the management right and how those effects are adverse.[53] Proposals that address speculative or hypothetical concerns do not constitute arrangements.[54] That a proposal would provide benefits to employees, by itself, does not mean that the proposal constitutes an arrangement.[55]</p>

<p class="noindent">The Union asserts that the proposal is an appropriate arrangement for employees seeking representation in a grievance or other representational matter by an outside representative. Although the Union describes the security process for representatives entering the Agency's facility, it neither identifies any actual adverse effects, or reasonably foreseeable adverse effects on employees flowing from any existing Agency limitations on access to its facility. In short, the Union's assertions do not explain how the proposal is an arrangement.[58]</p>
<p class="noindent">[58]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Fort Bragg</span>, 49 FLRA at 344–45 (finding that mere assertion by union that proposal would benefit employees because it would afford employees access to representation assistance does not demonstrate that proposal would ameliorate any adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a management right).</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">DOD, Ft. Bragg Dependents Sch. and Ft. Bragg Ass'n of Educators</span>, 49 FLRA 333, 340, 342-44 (1994), was a portion of Proposal 4 requiring that the union have 24-hour access to the union office. The proposal infringed on management's right to establish its internal security practices. Because the proposal did not respond to the exercise of a management right, it did not qualify as a negotiable arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, the right to determine internal security practices includes the agency's right to determine the policies and practices that are necessary to safeguard its operations, personnel, and physical property against internal or external risks.... An Agency's determination of when and how employees may gain access to agency facilities is within the agency's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, where that determination is supported by a showing of a reasonable connection to internal security considerations<span class="Italic">. See, for example, Social Security Administration, Huntington</span> <span class="Italic">Park</span>, 45 FLRA at 1216. Similarly, a determination of when and how non-employees gain access to agency facilities is encompassed within that management right where supported by such a showing. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Environmental Protection</span> <span class="Italic">Agency</span>, 35 FLRA at 707-12.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record in this case does not establish whether the proposal is limited to requiring access by employees or whether it extends to access by non-employee representatives of the Union. In either case, management's right to determine its internal security practices is implicated where a showing is made that a reasonable connection exists between access to agency facilities and internal security considerations. Here, the Agency contends that it has a need to retain the ability to restrict access to its facilities by Union representatives based on concerns for security and personnel safety. Although the Agency provides no further elaboration on this claim, the relationship between the need of a military base to retain the ability to restrict access to its premises and internal security considerations is obvious. Under these circumstances, we find that the Agency's claim establishes a reasonable connection between retaining the ability to restrict access to the military base at Fort Bragg and internal security considerations. By requiring that Union representatives have 24-hour access to a union office that is located on a military base, that portion of Proposal 4 directly interferes with management's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that this portion of Proposal 4 directly interferes with management's right to determine its internal security practices, we turn to the Union's claim that it is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. In <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1987) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>), the Authority established an analytical framework for determining whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement. First, we determine whether the proposal constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. To do this, we ascertain whether the proposal in question seeks to address, compensate for, or prevent adverse effects on employees produced by the exercise of management's rights<span class="Italic">. See National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 243 and Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 49 FLRA No. 24 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office</span>) (Member Armendariz, concurring in part and dissenting in relevant part). The fact that a proposal would provide benefits to employees, by itself, does not mean that the proposal constitutes an arrangement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Council of Prison Locals, Local 3974 and Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution, McKean, Pennsylvania</span>, 48 FLRA 225, 230-31 (1993); <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 45 FLRA 1256, 1258-59 (1992) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Chief Counsel</span>). Second, if we conclude that the proposal is an arrangement, we then determine whether the proposal is appropriate, or inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right. We make this determination by weighing "the competing practical needs of employees and managers" to ascertain whether the benefit to employees flowing from the proposal outweighs the proposals burden on the exercise of the management right or rights involved. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-32.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To support its claim that this portion of Proposal 4 constitutes an appropriate arrangement, the Union contends that it would afford employees "increased access to representation assistance." The Union relies on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, <span class="Italic">Huntington</span> <span class="Italic">Park.</span> There are, however, significant differences in the records of that case and this case. In <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration, Huntington Park</span>, the proposal at issue required that a union representative be given the combination to the lock on the employees' entrance to the agency's Downey Office. The record in that particular case indicated that the union representative designated to represent the employees at the Downey Office was assigned to another work site and that the agency had adopted a new security policy of limiting disclosure of the entry combination to employees assigned to the Downey Office. According to the union in that case, the agency's new policy adversely affected <span id="page_1121"></span>the representative's access to unit employees, interrupted employees' and supervisors' work by requiring that the representative be admitted by someone in the office, impaired the effectiveness of unannounced union safety inspections, and created an unequal status between union and management. 45 FLRA at 1217. Based on those circumstances, the Authority found that the proposal constituted an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. In contrast, there is nothing in the record of this case to support a conclusion, nor is it otherwise apparent, that this portion of Proposal 4 would have the effect of ameliorating, or is intended to ameliorate, the adverse effects on employees flowing from the exercise of a management right.</p>
