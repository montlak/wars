<p class="Body-Text">Fairly strong assertions of bias will not sway the Board unless they are made in the right form and at the right time, as <span class="Italic">Gensburg v. VA</span>, 85 MSPR 198, 204-05 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2000), involving adjudication of a counsel fee petition, noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge was biased in her conduct of the attorney fee proceedings. In support of this assertion, he alleges that, during proceedings below, she stated that the appellant should not be entitled to fees, that his attorneys were abusing the system, that private counsel were overpaid, that the appellant would not get interest on any fees, and that the appellant should accept the agency's settlement offer. In making a claim of bias or prejudice against an administrative judge, a party must overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity that accompanies administrative adjudicators. <span class="Italic">Oliver v. Department of Transportation</span>, 1 MSPB 368, 1 MSPR 382, 386 (1980). The party must show that the bias constitutes extrajudicial conduct rather than conduct arising in the administrative proceedings before him. <span class="Italic">Ali v. Department of the Army</span>, 50 MSPR 563, 568 (1991). The fact that an administrative judge ruled against a party is not sufficient evidence to show bias. <span class="Italic">Rolon v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 53 MSPR 362, 366-67 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant simply alleges that the administrative judge acted improperly, without pointing to any evidence in the record or submitting an affidavit or any other evidence to support his own unsworn statements. This does not suffice to rebut the presumption of the administrative judge's honesty and integrity. <span class="Italic">Lee v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 48 MSPR 274, 282 (1991); <span class="Italic">Oliver,</span> 1 MSPB 368, 1 MSPR at 386. In addition, neither the appellant nor his attorneys raised any objection on the record below to the administrative judge's alleged conduct of the proceedings. A claim of bias must be raised as soon as practicable after a party has reasonable cause to believe that grounds exist for an administrative judge's disqualification on such basis. <span class="Italic">Lee</span>, 48 MSPR at 281-82. A party cannot wait until after the adjudication is complete to object for the first time<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming that a party has a specific allegation of bias, for example, if the AJ makes a remark that suggests bias before the hearing commences, the appellant may not stand silently by awaiting the outcome of the appeal before alleging bias. A party may not suppress his misgivings while anxiously waiting for a favorable decision. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 6 MSPR 324, 326, 6 MSPB 277 (1981) (allegations of bias must be asserted promptly after knowledge of the alleged disqualification); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Stringer v. USPS</span>, 84 MSPR 623 (1999) (Table) (a disqualification motion was procedurally defective because the appellant did not file it as soon as he had reason to believe there was basis for disqualification); <span class="Italic">Bowers v. USPS</span>, 11 MSPR 395, 397 (1982) (appellant failed to timely move for disqualification of the AJ). The PFR is not the appropriate place to raise an initial complaint of bias. <span class="Italic">Cotton v. DOJ</span>, 53 MSPR 397, 403 (1992). Because an appellant should raise an allegation of bias when reason arises to believe there is cause for disqualification, the appellant who waits months to raise the issue raises doubt as to the merit of the allegation. <span class="Italic">Richardson v. DOJ</span>, 11 MSPR 186, 196 (1982). If a remark that the appellant believes demonstrates bias is made by an AJ during a prehearing conference, the appellant should object to the continued participation of the AJ no later than the onset of the hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Faucher v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 517, 519 (1988). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-10-153.html#sec3-153">Disqualification of Judge</a>," concerning the use of an interlocutory appeal as to bias allegations; to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-232.html#sec2-229">Interlocutory Appeals</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">SSA v. Shapiro</span>, CB-7521-11-0024-T-1 (NP 3/4/2014), the time for initiating a bias challenge runs from discovery of information that may be little more than rumor or speculation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the respondent's representative became aware, during the course of the proceedings below, of rumors that Administrative Law Judge Smith had worked for the petitioner. <span class="Italic">Cf. Diliberti v. United States</span>, 817 F.2d 1259, 1263-64 (7th Cir. 1987) (unsubstantiated hearsay and rumors were enough to put plaintiff on notice of a "reason to believe" and impose upon him a duty to inquire into veracity of rumors for purposes of bringing an action under the Privacy Act); <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Department of the Army</span>, 717 F.2d 1391, 1394-95 (Fed. Cir. 1983) ("reason to believe" language set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1203, regarding directing an employee to report for a medical examination, did not require incontrovertible evidence). We find that the respondent had reason to believe of a basis for filing a motion for disqualification based on the rumors he has acknowledged were present, as well as the documentation and testimony described above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party is not permitted to suppress its misgivings about whether an adjudicator should be disqualified from hearing a case while waiting anxiously to see whether the decision goes in its favor. <span class="Italic">Abarr v. Department of Transportation</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 572, 573 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 795 F.2d 1010 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Table); <span class="Italic">see American Public Gas Association v. Federal Power Commission</span>, 567 F.2d 1016, 1069 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (a party may not, knowing facts alleged to taint a proceeding with partiality, seek a favorable result at the hands of the allegedly disqualified agency and then, disappointed with the result, seek to bring about its nullification on the ground of partiality). Here, the respondent had reason to believe there were grounds for disqualification but waited until after the initial decision did not go in his favor in order to raise those misgivings. Moreover, the respondent essentially actively suppressed any misgivings he had about Administrative Law Judge Smith by failing to simply ask the judge whether he had worked for the petitioner. The respondent has also not shown that the information he submits in support of his motion was unavailable below despite his due diligence. Under these circumstances, we deny the respondent's motion as untimely filed. <span class="Italic">See Clarry v. Department of Transportation</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 147, 150 (1983) (finding a motion for a new hearing untimely filed when the appellants had reason to believe during the pre-hearing and hearing stages of the appeal that the presiding official was disqualified due to inexperience and inattention), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 795 F.2d 1016 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Table); <span class="Italic">Angell v. Department of Transportation</span>, 17 M.S.P.R. 503, 504 (1983) (finding motion to disqualify untimely raised on review when the appellant had reason to know that the presiding official was hard of hearing, distracted by outside noise, inattentive, and uninterested in the proceedings); <span class="Italic">Abarr</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. at 573 (finding untimely filed a motion to disqualify when the appellants had reason to believe, nearly 2 months before the issuance of the initial decision, that the presiding official was unqualified to hear the case due to her alleged reliance on the assistance of other Board personnel); <span class="Italic">Bowers v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. 395, 397-98 (1982) (finding untimely a motion to disqualify when the appellant should have known earlier that there was a reasonable likelihood the presiding official would have to be called as a witness in a subsequent hearing but did not take action to disqualify the presiding official prior to the petition for <span id="Page_1435"></span>review); <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Department of Justice</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. 186, 196 (1982) (finding bias claim untimely when the appellant had reason to believe of the alleged basis for disqualification during the final minutes of the hearing, which ended 3 months before issuance of the initial decision); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of the Army</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 324, 326 (1981) (finding bias claim untimely when the appellant allegedly overheard remark by presiding official before the hearing but did not take action until filing the petition for review).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, after the close of the record on review, the respondent filed a motion for leave to amend and supplement its petition for review, and in the alternative, a motion for a new hearing to develop new evidentiary issues. The respondent contends that he has new and material evidence, previously unavailable despite his due diligence, showing that the petitioner engaged in due process violations and committed harmful error by constructively defrauding the respondent and his attorneys in order to gain an unfair advantage in litigation. More specifically, the respondent asserts that, based on the petitioner's response to his motion to disqualify Administrative Law Judge Smith, it appears that the petitioner's representative was aware that Administrative Law Judge Smith had previously been employed by the SSA and did not disclose this information to the respondent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent has not identified any evidence showing that the petitioner's counsel became aware, during the proceedings below, that Administrative Law Judge Smith previously worked for the SSA. The petitioner's response does not include any clear admission in this regard, but merely asserts that information regarding Administrative Law Judge Smith was publicly available and that the respondent otherwise had reason to know of this potential basis for filing a motion to disqualify or could have taken reasonable steps to seek such information from the petitioner or Administrative Law Judge Smith. Moreover, the respondent has not shown that any alleged evidence he wishes to introduce at this time was previously unavailable despite his due diligence, as he has not indicated that he took reasonable steps below, such as asking the petitioner's counsel and Administrative Law Judge Smith whether the judge had previously worked for the SSA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114 (k). Under these circumstances, we deny the respondent's motion to amend and supplement his petition for review.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In denying the respondent's motions, we note that the mere fact that an adjudicator has worked for the agency appearing in a Board proceeding does not warrant disqualification. <span class="Italic">See Morris v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 41, 42-43 (1984). Thus, there was no reason for Administrative Law Judge Smith to have disqualified himself pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.42(a) on that basis alone.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the challenge goes to the comments of the AJ, the Board should be told where in the record those comments can be found (assuming that they were on the record). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vassalli v. FAA</span>, 9 MSPR 640, 643 (1982). <span class="Italic">Booth v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 266, 269 (1987), implied the necessity for specific record citations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant alleges that the administrative judge was rude, loud, and unable to "maintain an emotionally stable temperament" during the hearing; that he would not allow the appellant's representative to ask questions while the agency was examining witnesses, but he interrupted and interfered with the appellant's questioning of witnesses; and that he accepted agency evidence while refusing to accept the same evidence from the appellant. These allegations, however, are vague and nonspecific, and do not provide a proper basis for granting the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considers the specific allegations of bias and the overall conduct of the AJ when it evaluates a challenge to the AJ's impartiality, <span class="Italic">Polite v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 3 MSPR 410, 412, 3 MSPB 486 (1980):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here petitioner made general allegations of bias without stating the specific instances of alleged biased conduct to which he objected. He stated that the presiding official "showed temper," "was very racist," "denied our objections and granted theirs," and "was insulting." There is nothing in the record to support petitioner's allegations. Rather, the record discloses that the presiding official adopted a lenient attitude with respect to the extensive and, in some instances, repetitious, examination of witnesses she permitted the parties. The presiding official went so far as to allow one of petitioner's witnesses, whose testimony she had previously ruled irrelevant, to testify. Further, scrutiny of the record reveals no abuse of discretion or bias on the part of the presiding official. <span class="Italic">See also In the Matter of</span> <span class="Italic">King</span>, 1 MSPB 144, 1 MSPR 146 (1979).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board clarified the procedures it expects to be followed as to bias allegations in an appeal involving an appellant's attack on a settlement agreement that he felt was forced upon him, <span class="Italic">Lee v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 274, 281-83 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party must make a substantial showing of personal bias to overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity that accompanies a hearing officer and to disqualify an administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Matter of King</span>, 1 MSPB 144, 1 MSPR 146, 151 (1979). The fact that an administrative judge has ruled against a party in the past, or mere conclusory statements of bias, do not provide sufficient bases for disqualification. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carnley v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 17 MSPR 523, 525 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1059 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table); <span class="Italic">Oliver v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 1 MSPB 368, 1 MSPR 382, 386 (1980). The bias that may be disqualifying must be extrajudicial conduct, not conduct that arose in a trial setting. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">In re Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</span>, 861 F.2d 1307, 1314 (2d Cir. 1988) (what a judge learns or comes to believe in his judicial capacity is not the kind of matter that results in disqualification), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 490 U.S. 1102, 109 S. Ct. 2458, 104 L. Ed.2d 1012 (1989); <span class="Italic">In re International Business Machines Corporation</span>, 618 F.2d 923, 929 (2d Cir. 1980) (to oust a judge for bias, the bias to be established must be extrajudicial and not based upon in-court rulings).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While not generally applicable to Board proceedings, the disqualification procedures followed under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 USC 551 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> (APA), similarly provide that a party seeking to disqualify a presiding or participating employee has the burden of proof and will be allowed to introduce relevant evidence bearing on the issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 556(b); 4 J. Stein, G. Mitchell, and B. Mezines, <span class="Italic">Administrative Law</span> 35.03[2] (1989). The party must file an affidavit setting forth the grounds for the assertion. The affidavit must be filed in good faith, be timely, and be sufficient to demonstrate personal bias or other disqualification. If the agency finds that the affidavit meets this test for good faith, timeliness, and sufficiency, it must determine the matter as a part of the record and decision in the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> APA at 556(b); 4 J. Stein, G. Mitchell, and B. Mezines, <span class="Italic">Administrative Law</span> 35.03[2] (1989). Should the affidavit not address the issues of timeliness and sufficiency, the grounds of disqualification will be deemed to be waived. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines</span>, 344 U.S. 33, 73 S. Ct. 67, 97 L. Ed. 54 (1952).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A claim of bias, thus, must be raised as soon as practicable after a party has reasonable cause to believe that grounds for disqualification exist. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marcus v. Director, OWCP, Dept. of Labor</span>, 548 F.2d 1044, 1051 (D.C. Cir. 1976) (claim of bias by the administrative law judge was deemed waived because no affidavit articulating the facts and reasons justifying the charge was filed and the charge was untimely because it was not made until after the administrative law judge issued the initial decision in the case); <span class="Italic">American Public Gas Association v. Federal Power Comm'n</span>, 567 F.2d 1016, 1069 (D.C. Cir. 1977), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 435 U.S. 907, 98 S. Ct. 1456, 55 L. Ed.2d 499 (1978) (a party may not, knowing facts alleged to taint a proceeding with partiality, seek a favorable result at the hands of the allegedly disqualified agency and then, disappointed with the result, seek to bring about its nullification on the ground of partiality); <span class="Italic">Abarr v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 572, 573 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 795 F.2d 1010 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Table) (allegation that administrative judge was not qualified to hear case, first made in a petition for review, was untimely).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, upon examination of the affidavit, the Board finds that resolution of the disqualification motion requires findings of fact, it may assign the matter to a different administrative judge to make such findings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp</span>., 486 U.S. 847, 108 S. Ct. 2194, 2197, 100 L. Ed.2d 855 (1988) (a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit properly remanded a motion to disqualify a district court judge to a different judge for resolution of required factual findings).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once confronted with a timely and sufficient affidavit made in good faith, the Board may respond, either by way of directing the submission of affidavits, initially, or by granting discovery in appropriate cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grolier Inc. v. FTC</span>, 615 F.2d 1215, 1222 (9th Cir. 1980) (an agency was required to produce sufficient information to permit it and a reviewing court to determine the extent of an administrative law judge's involvement as an agency attorney-advisor in prior matters involving the petitioning party); <span class="Italic">Grolier Inc. v. FTC</span>, 699 F.2d 983, 987 (9th Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 464 U.S. 891, 104 S. Ct. 235, 78 L. Ed.2d 227 (1983) (since unrebutted sworn statements submitted by the agency adequately demonstrated that the administrative law judge had not been involved in the investigation of the petitioner, further discovery was unnecessary and the petitioning party failed to meet its burden of proof on the disqualification issue).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's assertion that the administrative judge told him, in essence, that he could not win his case should be analyzed as an allegation of bias. However, applying the analytical framework discussed above, we find that the appellant has failed to prove his allegation of bias because he has not overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity that accompanies administrative adjudicators. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Biberstine</span>, 37 MSPR at 256. He simply asserts that the administrative judge acted improperly. He has not pointed to any evidence in the record, or submitted an affidavit or any other evidence to support his unsworn statements. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Singleton</span>, 39 MSPR at 234-35 (Board remanded case to new administrative judge because of the appearance of impropriety where the appellant's attorney submitted an unrebutted affidavit alleging partiality and unfairness on the part of the administrative judge). Moreover, as noted above, the administrative judge's rulings on the appellant's requested continuance provide no basis for a finding of bias both because they were made <span id="Page_1436"></span>during the adjudication of the instant case and because they were an appropriate exercise of the administrative judge's discretion. Thus, we conclude that no further inquiry into the matter is warranted because the appellant failed to raise a timely or sufficient allegation of bias.</p>
