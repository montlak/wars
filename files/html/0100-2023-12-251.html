<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7121(d) of Title 5 of the U.S. Code empowers the Board to review arbitration decisions under certain circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Sadiq v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 450, &#x00B6; 4 (2013). The Board has explained that it has jurisdiction to review an arbitration decision when the subject matter of the grievance is one over which the Board has jurisdiction, the appellant has alleged discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) [2] in connection with the challenged action, and a final decision has been issued. <span class="Italic">See Sadiq</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 450, &#x00B6; 4. The Board's review of an arbitrator's award is limited, and arbitral awards are entitled to a greater degree of deference than initial decisions issued by the Board's administrative judges. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 5. Because of the highly deferential standard accorded to arbitration decisions, an appellant who is dissatisfied with an arbitrator's decision generally may not seek to set aside or modify that decision on a ground not raised before the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Means v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Navy</span>, 898 F.2d 133 (Fed.

Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Service</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 553, 554-55 (1987) (citing Board authority for the proposition that "the Board may review an arbitrator's decision only where prohibited discrimination was raised to the arbitrator."), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 846 F.2d 77 (Fed.

Under this approach, the Board had held that it lacked jurisdiction over a request for review of an arbitrator's decision when an appellant failed to raise a claim of discrimination before the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, however, the Federal Circuit concluded that an employee did not have to raise a discrimination claim before an arbitrator in order to raise such a claim with the Board for the first time when requesting review of an arbitration award. <span class="Italic">See Jones</span>, 898 F.2d at 136.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequent to <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, the Board held that an employee could "raise a discrimination claim for the first time with the Board in an arbitration review proceeding," even if such a claim was not presented to the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">Means</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 115 (citing <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 898 F.3d at 135). The Board articulated the following test for establishing jurisdiction over a request for review of an arbitration decision: (1) the subject matter of the grievance is one over which the Board has jurisdiction; (2) the grievant alleges discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) in connection with the challenged action; and (3) a final decision has been issued. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Colon v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Colon</span>, we expressly noted that "the appellant (although she did not do so before the arbitrator) has alleged in her request for review that the removal action taken against her was the result of discrimination," and we held that such an allegation was properly before the Board on a request for review and could establish the Board's jurisdiction over her request. 73 M.S.P.R. 659, 663.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 7, 2012, however, the Board proposed changes to its regulations <span id="Page_1830"></span>concerning, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the Board's jurisdiction over requests for review of arbitration decisions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). <span class="Italic">See</span> 77 Fed. Reg. 33663, 33669 (June 7, 2012). In its notice of proposed rulemaking, the Board explained that it "was not always the case" that "the Board ha[d] jurisdiction to review arbitration decisions in which an appellant is raising claims of unlawful discrimination, even when the appellant failed to raise the discrimination issue before the arbitrator," and we noted that the "Board had held that its review was limited to discrimination claims that were raised before the arbitrator until the Federal Circuit's contrary ruling in <span class="Italic">Jones</span>[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, to "restore the rule that existed prior to the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Jones</span>," <span class="Italic">id</span>., the Board proposed amending 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.155 as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;Scope of Board Review. If the negotiated grievance procedure permits allegations of discrimination, the Board will review only those claims of discrimination that were raised in the negotiated grievance procedure. If the negotiated grievance procedure does not permit allegations of discrimination to be raised, the appellant may raise such claims before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">77 Fed. Reg. at 33679.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's proposed rule changes became final on October 12, 2012, and went into effect on November 13, 2012. <span class="Italic">See</span> 77 Fed. Reg. 62350, 62360 (Oct. 12, 2012) (explaining that the proposed amendment would take effect and be codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.155(c)). Thus, as the Board explained in both its notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of final rulemaking, the changes in the Board's jurisdictional regulations governing requests for review of arbitration decisions were designed to "restore the rule that existed prior to the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Jones</span>," 77 Fed. Reg. 33663, 33669, and that "[i]f the Board were to adjudicate a claim of discrimination that could have been but was not raised to the arbitrator, it would not be reviewing the arbitrator's final decision with respect to that claim; it would be adjudicating the claim <span class="Italic">de novo</span>," 77 Fed. Reg. 62350, 62360.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Federal Circuit premised its decision in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> on, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the fact that "no statute or regulation...requires an issue of prohibited discrimination...to be first raised before an arbitrator before the board has jurisdiction to consider it on appeal," and that "the regulations of the board governing the procedures involving appeals containing allegations of prohibited discrimination...are dispositive of this question." 898 F.2d at 135. In response to these observations, the Board's revised regulation now expressly provides that a claim of discrimination must be first presented to an arbitrator before it can be raised in a request for review, provided that the governing negotiated grievance procedure allows for claims of discrimination to be presented in arbitration. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.155(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Board's revised regulations, an appellant can establish the Board's jurisdiction over a request for review of an arbitration decision when: (1) the subject matter of the grievance is one over which the Board has jurisdiction; (2) the appellant either (i) raised a claim of discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) with the arbitrator in connection with the underlying action, or (ii) raises a claim of discrimination in connection with the underlying action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) for the first time with the Board if such allegations could not be raised in the negotiated grievance procedure; and (3) a final decision has been issued. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.155(a)(1), (c); <span class="Italic">see also McCurn v. Department of Defense</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 226, &#x00B6; 5 n.4 (2013) ("Under the Board's regulations that became effective November 13, 2012, the Board will only review discrimination claims raised for the first time in a request for review of an arbitration decision if the negotiated grievance procedure did not permit allegations of discrimination to be raised.") (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.155(c)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying this jurisdictional standard, we conclude that the appellant cannot establish Board jurisdiction over her request for review of the arbitrator's decision. The record reflects that the appellant's governing collective bargaining agreement allows for claims of discrimination to be raised in the course of a grievance proceeding. ("Section 11.03--Any aggrieved employee affected by discrimination, a removal, or performance-based reduction in grade, or other adverse action, may, at his/her option, raise the matter under a statutory appeal procedure or under this negotiated grievance procedure, but not both."). The record further reflects that the appellant did not raise a claim of discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) in the course of her grievance proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, because the appellant could have raised her claim of discrimination in the grievance proceeding, but did not, the appellant cannot now raise such a claim for the first time with the Board in connection with her request for review.5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.155(c). The appellant's request for review of the arbitrator's decision is therefore DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit recognized the regulatory change and affirmed its application, <span class="Italic">Jones v. MSPB</span>, 589 Fed. Appx. 972, 976 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jones does not challenge the validity of the Board's new regulation codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.155(c), which the Board expressly acknowledged was designed "to restore the rule that existed prior to the Federal Circuit's decision in" <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Navy</span>, 898 F.2d 133 (Fed. Cir. 1990). <span class="Italic">Jones I</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 480, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 7, n.4; 77 Fed. Reg. 33663, 33669 (June 7, 2012). In that 1990 <span class="Italic">Jones</span> case, we abrogated the Board's then-existing interpretation of the statutory and regulatory scheme as requiring a petitioner to raise the issue of discrimination to the arbitrator under a negotiated grievance procedure in the first instance or else be deprived of review of that issue by the Board for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 898 F.2d at 134-36. We held that nothing in the then-relevant statutory and regulatory framework supported the Board's interpretation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 136. As amended, the Board's regulation now provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Scope of Board Review</span>. If the negotiated grievance procedure permits allegations of discrimination, the Board will review only those claims of discrimination that were raised in the negotiated procedure. If the negotiated procedure does not permit allegations of discrimination to be raised, the appellant may raise such claims before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.55(c) (2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that Jones's governing collective bargaining agreement allowed for claims of discrimination to be raised in the course of a grievance proceeding. <span class="Italic">Jones I</span> at 485. In view of the foregoing, we affirm the Board's finding that Jones did not raise her EEO retaliation claim in the proceeding before the arbitrator as supported by substantial evidence and conclude that the Board did not err in dismissing the request for review under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) for lack of jurisdiction in accordance with its new regulation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board appeared to apply its 2012 regulation, requiring discrimination to be first raised with the arbitrator before the Board will review an award, in <span class="Italic">Brookens v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 120 MSPR 678, 682 &#x00B6; 6, 2014 MSPB 27 (2014). <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Butler v. VA</span>, CB-7121-14-0002-V-1 (NP 7/8/2014) ("The appellant did not raise a claim of discrimination with the arbitrator, and he has not raised such a claim with the Board. We find, therefore, that the Board does not have jurisdiction over the appellant's request for review.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The claim of discrimination must be squarely presented to the arbitrator. Unelaborated reference to discrimination in a brief to the arbitrator was insufficient to provide MSPB jurisdiction to review the award in <span class="Italic">Scanlin v. SSA</span>, 2022 MSPB 10, &#x00B6; 6 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With her request for review, the appellant included her brief to the arbitrator. In it, the appellant alluded to discrimination only by asserting that the issue to be decided was "[w]hether the [a]gency's [a]ctions [v]iolated [f]undamental [d]ue [p]rocess, the [collective bargaining agreement] and [w]ere [d]iscriminatory." The brief contained other substantive and lengthy arguments, including ones concerning due process, harmful error, and the reasonableness of the penalty. However, it did not elaborate on the generic reference to discrimination. With her request for review, the appellant also included the arbitration decision, which recognizes the aforementioned assertion concerning the issues, but similarly fails to address discrimination in any substantive way. The appellant has not identified and we were unable to locate any further details about possible discrimination claims presented to the arbitrator, even after considering the hearing transcript provided by the agency. Therefore, we find that the appellant has failed to meet her burden. The generic posing of the question, "was the removal discriminatory," without more, is insufficient for purposes of proving that she raised a claim of discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) with the arbitrator in connection with the underlying action. <span class="Italic">Cf. Bennett v. National Gallery of Art</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 285, 294-95 (1998) (finding that a general allegation of national origin discrimination prohibited by section 2302(b)(1) was sufficient for purposes of Board jurisdiction over an arbitration decision, irrespective of whether the allegation was nonfrivolous).[3] We find that, because the appellant could have raised a discrimination claim before the arbitrator, but has not proven that she did so, the Board lacks jurisdiction over her request for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Bennett</span> decision relies on an old jurisdictional standard that no longer applies. <span class="Italic">See Bennett</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. at 295. Specifically, the standard applicable at that time merely required that the appellant allege discrimination prohibited by section 2302(b)(1). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The current standard requires that the appellant "raise[ ] a claim of discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) <span class="Italic">with the arbitrator</span> in connection with the underlying action." <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 480, &#x00B6; 8 (emphasis added)</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Many of the decisions that follow were decided before the 2012 regulatory revision. The earlier practice of the Board was to permit employees to obtain review of arbitration awards involving personnel actions otherwise within the Board's jurisdiction even if discrimination was asserted for the first time at the level of Board review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pinegar v. FEC</span>, 105 MSPR 677, 691 &#x00B6; 30, 2007 MSPB 140 (2007), noted the two means for arbitration awards to come to the Board based on discrimination allegations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1831"></span>...Where an appellant raises discrimination for the first time on request for review, <span class="Italic">see Pleasant v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 602, &#x00B6; 6 (2005), or where the appellant raised discrimination before the arbitrator but the arbitrator refused to consider it, <span class="Italic">see Godesky</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 280, &#x00B6; 8, the Board will consider discrimination claims raised before it on request for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under practice before 2012, the EEO claim raised for the first time with the Board could be insubstantial on the face of the appellant's pleading, but that was enough to vest jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Pleasant v. DHUD</span>, 98 MSPR 602, 607 &#x00B6; 6 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the record shows that the appellant did not present a specific claim of discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) to the arbitrator below, and that she has not raised a nonfrivolous claim of discrimination on review, the appellant does make a <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> assertion that the agency's adverse action constituted discrimination based on her race, color, sex, disability, and age. The Board has found that an appellant can establish the Board's jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) by asserting a claim of discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) for the first time on review and that the assertion need not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of discrimination. <span class="Italic">De Bow</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 5 &#x00B6; 4; <span class="Italic">Weaver</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 447 &#x00B6; 6. We therefore have jurisdiction over this request for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the claim of discrimination need not be substantial to vest the Board with jurisdiction to review an arbitrator's award, there must be the claim, <span class="Italic">Nelson v. Dept. of Labor,</span> CB-7121-11-0009-V-1 (NP 8/31/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Our review of the record and the appellant's petition for review, however, reveals that the appellant did not allege discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) in connection with the underlying action either before the arbitrator or in his petition. At best, the appellant asserted before the Arbitrator that the agency's removal action constituted retaliation for prior protected grievance activity, which is a claim under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), not a claim of discrimination cognizable under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, in the absence of an allegation of discrimination as stated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) in connection with the underlying action, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's request for review of the arbitration decision and it must be dismissed. <span class="Italic">Morales v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant is requesting review of a final arbitration decision regarding a removal action within the Board's jurisdiction, we cannot find that she claimed any form of discrimination set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1). The appellant in her response to the proposal notice discussed matters from which the reader might infer that she believed Kalisz had discriminated against her based on marital status and sex. Her grievance, however, simply characterized her removal as "unwarranted, inconsistent, and unfair." Her request for review narrowly addresses the issue of back pay, and she specifically states that she does not challenge the arbitrator's decision except with respect to the remedy determination. Therefore, the Board lacks jurisdiction over her request for review of the decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Russell</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 690, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8; <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1458 v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...5 USC 7121(d) provides in pertinent part:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the provisions of sections 7121(d) and 7702, a claim of prohibited discrimination filed with the board by an aggrieved employee transcends and is an exception to the restriction in 7121(e)(1) on appeal to the board after he has grieved his removal through arbitration, and the board has jurisdiction of the claim and is required by the statutes aforesaid to decide it. Therefore, the board erred in holding that it did not have jurisdiction of petitioner's appeal because he had first proceeded through the negotiated procedure of arbitration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1832"></span>Here the board also held that since petitioner did not raise the issue of handicap discrimination before the arbitrator, the board lacked jurisdiction to review it.

<p class="Body-Text">The 2012 regulatory amendment, discussed earlier in this chapter, and its impact upon the 1990 <span class="Italic">Jones</span> analysis is reviewed in <span class="Italic">Jones v. MSPB</span>, 589 Fed. Appx. 972 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP), <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jones</span> was followed and the salient elements of Board jurisdiction over arbitration awards were restated, <span class="Italic">Benson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 548, 551-52 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish that we have jurisdiction over their request, the appellants must show that: (1) The subject matter of the grievance is one over which the Board has jurisdiction; (2) the alleged discrimination is of the type set forth in the pertinent statute in connection with the underlying action; and (3) a final decision has been issued by the arbitrator<span class="Italic">. See Mawson v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 48 MSPR 318, 322 (1991). The appellants have met these criteria, in that we have jurisdiction over the removal action, the appellants allege that they were discriminated against based on race, and the arbitrator has issued a final decision. We are not persuaded by the agency's arguments to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, the agency offers no support for its assertion that 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d) (providing for Board review of final arbitration decisions) and 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702 (describing "mixed case" processing) are not applicable to this case. Further, the agency's argument that the appellants were obligated to raise their equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint with an agency EEO counselor, and therefore may not now have their claim heard by the Board, is without foundation. The appellants have the right to pursue arbitration, as they did here, and then raise an issue of discrimination before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 898 F.2d 133, 134 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Moreover, in addition to the discrimination issue, an otherwise appealable matter (i.e., the removal action) is also properly before us<span class="Italic">. See Robinson v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 389, <span class="Italic">reconsideration den</span>., 31 MSPR 479 (1986) (citing <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 660-62, 105 S. Ct. 2882, 2889-90 (1985)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As mentioned above, the agency also asserts that the request for review is untimely, arguing that it was filed more than twenty days after the effective date of the removal action. Because the appellant had the right to pursue arbitration and then file a request for review with the Board under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d), the twenty-day filing deadline for bringing an appeal to a regional office of the Board does not apply. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). Under our regulations, the appellants had twenty-five days from the date on which the arbitrator's decision was issued to file a request for review<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154 (d).[*] They timely filed a petition for enlargement of time. The Board granted the appellants an extension until February 7, 1992, when the request for review was filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] Our discussion here refers to our regulations at the time the appellants filed their request for review. The regulations have since been changed to provide a 30-day period for filing an appeal, and 35 days for filing a request for review of an arbitrator's decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 59 Fed. Reg. 31109 (1994) (to be codified at 5 CFR Part 1201).</p>

Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3108) (without mention of <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, the court suggests that the Board lacked jurisdiction to review a grievance decision when the appellant did not raise his discrimination claim first in the grievance proceeding).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Lacking an allegation of a covered prohibited personnel practice, the Board lacks jurisdiction over a request for review of an arbitration decision. <span class="Italic">Reece v.

That the appellant decided to raise an EEO claim through another process, e.g., EEOC federal sector complaint procedures, does not affect jurisdiction to review an arbitrator's award, <span class="Italic">Tekleabib v. Dept. of State,</span> CB-7121-15-0029-V-1 (NP 6/30/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, whether the appellant may assert her discrimination claims in multiple venues under different authorities is not the question before us. Because, as noted above, the appellant's collective bargaining agreement indicates that she may raise a discrimination claim in the negotiated grievance procedure, the jurisdictional question in this matter is whether the appellant raised a discrimination claim in the arbitration proceeding for which she seeks review; only if she did so may she request Board review of the arbitrator's decision, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.155(a)(1), (c). The record clearly reflects that the appellant did not raise a discrimination claim in the arbitration proceeding for which she seeks Board review. We find, therefore, that the Board does not have jurisdiction over the appellant's request for review.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board recently issued two arbitration-review decisions that appear to lead to different jurisdictional outcomes when applied to this case. In <span class="Italic">Colon v.

Applying <span class="Italic">Lepusic</span> to this case would seemingly lead to a finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction. Moreover, neither <span class="Italic">Lepusic</span> or <span class="Italic">Colon</span> discuss each other. Therefore, we <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> address the seeming inconsistency between those two decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d), "[a]n aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under [5 USC &#x00A7;] 2302(b)(1)" may "request [the Board] to review the final [arbitration] decision pursuant to [5 USC &#x00A7;] 7702...in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board[.]" Section 7702(a)(1) provides that, "in the case of any employee or applicant for employment who" appeals an action under, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, 5 USC chapter 75 and who <span class="Italic">alleges</span> that a basis for the action was discrimination...the Board <span class="Italic">shall...decide</span> both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action[.]" (Emphasis added.) Subsections 7702(a)(3) and (b)(1) provide that an appellant who receives a Board "decision" under subsection (a)(1) may petition the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) "to consider the decision" or file an action in court to review "the decision." The statute further provides that EEOC "may refer the case to the Board, or provide on its own, for the taking...of additional evidence to the extent it considers necessary to supplement the record." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(b)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although the appellant did not specifically raise his claim of discrimination based on national origin before the arbitrator, an appellant may raise a claim of discrimination for the first time on review of an arbitration decision under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121. <span class="Italic">Colon</span>, 73 MSPR at 663.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Colon</span>, 73 MSPR at 659, 662, the appellant requested review of an arbitration decision.

The Board found that it had jurisdiction over the request for review based on the appellant's "bare claims" of discrimination that were unsupported by factual assertions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lepusic v. International Trade Commission,</span> 74 MSPR 359, 361 (1997), appellant Lepusic's case was part of a consolidation in which the appellants therein claimed before the arbitrator sex and race discrimination based on disparate treatment in their reduction in force (RIF) and reiterated the disparate treatment claim before the Board in their request for review of the arbitrator's decision. The Board found that appellant Lepusic did not allege "that he specifically was discriminated against in connection with his separation by RIF or was otherwise affected by a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)." Thus, the Board found that it lacked jurisdiction over appellant Lepusic's request for review because he failed to allege facts which, if true, would establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Lepusic,</span> 74 MSPR at 361.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7702 does not, however, distinguish between frivolous and nonfrivolous allegations or between facts sufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination and facts insufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A review of the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978), as amended, Pub. L. No. 96-54, 93 Stat. 381 (1979), codified in pertinent part at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702, reveals no congressional intent as to such distinctions. The section-by-section analysis of the Senate Report on the CSRA refers, with respect to section 7702, to "actions appealed to the Board involving allegations of discrimination[.]" S. Rep. No. 95-969, <span class="Italic">reprinted</span> in 1978 USCCAN 2723, 2785. The Senate Report also provides that, under the civil service reform procedures--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the Board will continue to consider all actions appealable under the other provisions of this bill, even if the appeal also involves issues of discrimination. This will allow the Board to consider, as related aspects of the same case, allegations that there had been violations of the merit system principles implemented by title V, as well as the anti-discrimination laws. In such cases, questions of the employee's inefficiency or misconduct, and discrimination by the employer, will be two sides of the same question which must be considered together.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2775. Further, the Senate Report provides that, when an agency takes an action that is appealable to the Board--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the employee must appeal the action to the Board if it [sic] wishes any administrative review of the agency action.... The appeal must be to the Board whether the employee[ ] alleges only that the agency action was unlawful under the laws prohibiting discrimination, or the employee alleges only that the procedural and substantive protection afforded him under the personnel laws in title V were violated, or he alleges a violation of any combination of these different laws. The Board has jurisdiction whether the employee raises the discrimination laws as a defense or answer to the agency action, or whether the employee files a separate complaint against his employer under the anti-discrimination laws for proposing to take the appealable action against him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">The jurisdiction of the Board is determined entirely by the nature of the personnel action taken, not by the kind of legal or factual arguments raised or the procedures used to raise the discrimination issue.</span></p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with the statute, the Board has treated entitlement to notice of mixed-case appeal rights as a <span class="Italic">substantive</span> right, even where a discrimination claim is found to be frivolous or insufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, thus expressing the Board's view that an appellant is entitled to seek EEOC and district court review of his discrimination claim no matter the extent to which the claim appears to lack merit. Thus, where an appellant has merely alleged discrimination or has failed to state facts which, if proven, would establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, and the administrative judge did not provide notice of mixed-case appeal rights, the Board has provided notice of mixed-case appeal rights so that the appellant's "substantive rights" would not be prejudiced....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In...<span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Navy,</span> 898 F.2d 133, 134-35 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the court held that, under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d), the Board is required to consider a discrimination claim even if it was not raised during arbitration and is raised for the first time before the Board. In <span class="Italic">Jones,</span> 898 F.2d at 134, the appellant alleged for the first time, in his Board appeal, "that the agency failed to consider the medical reasons which caused his frequent absences" and that "he had been discriminated against by [agency] management 'because they overruled qualified medical doctors.'" The court stated that, "under 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(d), [sic] and 7702 an aggrieved employee who is affected by [a] prohibited personnel practice...as defined in 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) and 7702, which is covered by a negotiated grievance procedure, and who has contested the action of the agency through arbitration proceedings...has an absolute right to request the [B]oard to review the arbitrator's decision." <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 898 F.2d at 134....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that EEOC appears to be in accord with the proposition that an employee whose allegations of discrimination are not nonfrivolous is nevertheless entitled to notice of his statutory review rights. In this regard, we note that EEOC has accepted within its jurisdiction cases in which the Board has found that a discrimination claim was frivolous but nevertheless provided notice of mixed-case appeal rights....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Conversely, the EEOC has denied review where the Board found the allegations of discrimination to be frivolous and did not provide notice of appeal rights to EEOC. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., MacTaggart v. West,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03970080 (July 17, 1997). Thus, a Board determination not to provide an appellant with notice of mixed-case appeal rights where the appellant has failed to make nonfrivolous allegations of discrimination may deprive the appellant of EEOC and district court review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find, based on the discussion above, that there is nothing in the plain language of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702, which is referenced in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d), or in the legislative history of the CSRA and its amendments to suggest that an appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation of discrimination before the Board in order to be entitled to EEOC and district court review....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore hold that the Board has jurisdiction to review an arbitration decision in any case in which an appellant alleges discrimination prohibited by 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), irrespective of whether the appellant makes a nonfrivolous allegation of discrimination, and which otherwise meets the jurisdictional requirements for consideration of an arbitration decision under <span class="Italic">Colon</span>, 73 MSPR at 663. Thus, to the extent that <span class="Italic">Lepusic</span> and any other Board decisions hold to the contrary, they are hereby overruled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Bennett v.

[The 2012 regulatory revisions from the Board now require that the allegation of discrimination be raised with the arbitrator unless the negotiated agreement prevents the arbitrator from considering an EEO issue.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not every allegation of discrimination serves to support Board review of an arbitration decision. An appeal based on marital status or political affiliation discrimination that included no other form of alleged discrimination would not support Board jurisdiction to review an arbitrator's award. Covered discrimination was described by <span class="Italic">Confer v. VA</span>, 57 MSPR 401, 403 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's authority to review an arbitration decision is set forth at 5 USC 7121(d) (1988), which provides in pertinent part that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1) of this title which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both.... Selection of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee to request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review the final decision pursuant to section 7702 of this title in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The jurisdictional requirements for review of an arbitration decision under subsection 7121(d) thus incorporate two other statutory provisions--5 USC 2302(b)(1) and 5 USC 7702. Subsection 2302(b)(1) makes it a prohibited personnel practice to discriminate against an employee or applicant for employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicapping condition as prohibited under specified statutes, or on the basis of marital status or political affiliation as prohibited under any law, rule, or regulation. Section 7702 sets out the appellate procedures applicable to cases involving an issue of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicapping condition under the same statutes identified in subsection 2302(b)(1). Unlike subsection 2302(b)(1), however, section 7702 makes no reference to discrimination because of marital status or political affiliation. A case that includes a claim of discrimination because of marital status or political affiliation, but none of the forms of discrimination described in section 7702, therefore does not fall within the purview of that provision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At least in 1998, sexual orientation was not a form of discrimination within the Board's authority to review an arbitration award, <span class="Italic">Morales v. DOJ</span>, 77 MSPR 482, 484 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he only form of discrimination the appellant has described, discrimination on the basis of his sexual orientation, is not among the forms of prohibited discrimination included under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1). Although that section includes discrimination on the basis of sex as prohibited by Title VII, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has <span id="Page_1834"></span>consistently held that prohibition does not apply to cases which raise issues regarding an individual's perceived or admitted sexual preference or orientation. <span class="Italic">See Harmon v.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 72 MSPR 466, 468-69 (1996) ("Because the appellant's alleged disability is his current addiction to illegal drugs, and because such a condition is not a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the appellant has not alleged that the agency has discriminated against him in a way that is prohibited by 5 USC 2302(b)(1). Since there is no allegation in this case of a violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(1), as explicitly required by the text of 5 USC 7121(d), the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal."). A dissent in <span class="Italic">Schulte</span> by Chairman Erdreich pointed out that the appellant was entitled to a decision from the Board on the coverage of the Rehabilitation Act rather than summary rejection of his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. With a decision from the Board, the appellant would have been entitled to review by EEOC of the discrimination issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without an allegation of discrimination, the Board's jurisdiction to review arbitration awards does not extend to allegations that the underlying disciplinary action was taken in reprisal for union activities and in reprisal for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Estes v. Dept. of Army</span>, 62 MSPR 84 (1994). However, if the award is otherwise reviewable because it involves an appealable action coupled with a discrimination issue, the Board will deferentially review the arbitrator's analysis of whistleblowing reprisal claims. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Means v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 60 MSPR 108, 114 (1993). [Refer to Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-20-068.html#sec13-65">Individual Right of Action</a>," for description of the relationship between Individual Right of Action appeals and grievances pursued under negotiated agreements.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Usually the appellant seeks review of an arbitrator's award because the award did not provide the appellant full relief (or any relief). In <span class="Italic">Cantrell v. DHHS</span>, 55 MSPR 600, 603 (1992), the arbitrator reversed the appellant's removal, but also concluded that the appellant did not establish her affirmative defense of race discrimination. The Board declined to accept jurisdiction of the appellant's resulting request for review, declaring (without addressing compensatory damages):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the arbitrator's decision affords the appellant full relief from the removal action, there is no longer a matter in controversy over which the Board has jurisdiction.... In the absence of an otherwise appealable action, the Board does not have jurisdiction over claims of discrimination, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. National Science Foundation</span>, 47 MSPR 159, 164 (1991), and the appeal is not a "mixed case." Accordingly, we must dismiss the request for review for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mackelprang v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 23, 26 (1991) (appeal from arbitration decision dismissed when agency complied with the arbitration award reversing the removal action before the appellant filed his petition for appeal). In light of our dismissal of the matter for lack of jurisdiction, the appellant's case may be processed before the EEOC as a non-mixed case of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mackelprang</span>, 48 MSPR at 26.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 2012 regulatory revisions tying Board review jurisdiction to an allegation of discrimination or reprisal under the civil rights laws made before the arbitrator effectively modified the approach of the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 898 F.2d 133 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (on remand, <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 48 MSPR 117, 120 (1991)), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, determining that an EEO allegation could be first raised in a request for review of the award. The regulation returned the Board to earlier practice: if the employee did not demonstrate that he raised an allegation of discrimination before the arbitrator, the Board lacked jurisdiction to review the appeal filed from an arbitrator's award. <span class="Italic">Berry v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3113); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 10, 12-13 (1989) (relying on <span class="Italic">Salinas v. INS</span>, 34 MSPR 553, 554-55 (1987)); <span class="Italic">Lane v. DOJ</span>, 41 MSPR 650, 652 (1989) (Board lacked jurisdiction over a request for the review of an arbitration decision dismissing a grievance as not arbitrable; no allegation of a prohibited personnel practice was raised in the PFR or before the arbitrator); <span class="Italic">Hinton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 84, 86-87 (1987) (discrimination was not presented at all and was, in fact, expressly disclaimed by the grievant as an issue); <span class="Italic">Steinhauer v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 40 MSPR 503, 505 (1989); <span class="Italic">Berry v. DOJ</span>, 31 MSPR 676, 678 (1986); <span class="Italic">Flanagan v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 18 MSPR 686, 688 (1984). For the issue to be effectively raised in the grievance case, to secure later Board review, the discrimination issue was to have been presented to the arbitrator; it could not be merely mentioned in the grievance and then not pursued through the arbitration hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stickles v. VA</span>, 31 MSPR 264, 266 (1986). The Board was not bound by the agency's statement of issues; rather, it examined the record to determine which issues were actually presented to the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">Armijo v. VA</span>, 40 MSPR 694, 697 n.1 (1989). If the appellant claimed that she was denied effective representation because her union did not properly present or raise discrimination before the arbitrator, she would not be given Board review of the discrimination allegation; instead, she might, according to the Board, have a cause of action for breach of the duty of fair representation. <span class="Italic">Pham v. AFGE Local 916</span>, 799 F.2d 634 (10th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Salinas v. INS</span>, 34 MSPR 553, 555 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916 v. FLRA</span>, 812 F.2d 1326 (10th Cir. 1987)); <span class="Italic">IAM Local 39 and Evans</span>, 24 FLRA 352 (1986). On appeal <span class="Italic">Salinas</span> was affirmed. An allegation of disparate treatment based on prohibited discrimination had to be stated in the record and could not be raised by implication. <span class="Italic">Salinas v. INS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 87-3590). Nor could the appellant secure review indirectly that he could not obtain directly. If, through an election of remedies, the appellant pursued a grievance procedure and filed an untimely request for review of that decision, he could not later seek mixed case review of the same adverse action following an unfavorable decision by an agency on a related EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">Grasty v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 234, 237 (1989); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Wojcicki v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 72 MSPR 628, 642 (1996) (WPA does not provide Board jurisdiction to review the appellant's allegations of errors within the arbitration process).</p>
