<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-162"><span class="space">f.</span> Fear for Safety or Other Harm</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee justifiably refuses to perform a task, under the rule of <span class="Italic">Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall</span>, 444 U.S. 823 (1980), if he reasonably believes that continued work would result in imminent death or serious injury. <span class="Italic">Blocker v. Dept. of Army</span>, 6 MSPR 467, 469, 6 MSPB 395 (1981), declined to credit a <span class="Italic">Whirlpool</span> defense:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that he was not required, in order to avoid a charge of insubordination, to risk serious injury to himself by complying with the orders of his supervisor, and cited <span class="Italic">Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall,</span> 444 U.S. 823, 100 S. Ct. 43, 62 L. Ed.2d 29 (1980), in support of his contention. The Board has previously considered the application of the rule in that case to federal employees and found that "there is no authority which extends the benefits of this rule to the federal sector." <span class="Italic">Parker v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Interior</span>, 4 MSPB 184, 185, 4 MSPR 97, 99 (1980). Nonetheless, in <span class="Italic">Parker,</span> we assumed for the purposes of the adjudication of that case that the rule was applicable, and found that "appellant still must present evidence which demonstrates that he reasonably believed his continued presence at his place of employment would result in his imminent death or serious injury." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, here, appellant would have to show that his performance of the duties assigned would have had that result. We find that he has failed to make such a showing. The orders to take cars through the car wash, wax one, and wipe down the other do not pose the type of threat to appellant's health and well-being, even considering his back condition, which equates to the serious situation which existed in the <span class="Italic">Whirlpool case, supra</span>, or which would excuse his refusal.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In that case, the employees refused to perform maintenance <span id="Page_2646"></span>duties on a wire mesh screen suspended above the plant floor after several employees had fallen through it and one fell to his death.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Parbs v. USPS</span>, 107 MSPR 559, 569 &#x00B6; 19, 2007 MSPB 302 (2007) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Parbs v. USPS</span>, 301 Fed. Appx. 923 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP)) ("he should first have complied with the order and then registered his complaint or grievance since there were no extenuating circumstances such as where obedience would place him in a clearly dangerous situation or where complying with the order would cause him irreparable harm. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cooke v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 401, 407-08, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 73 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency disciplines an employee for insubordination and the employee's response is that he refused an order because of a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> safety concern, the adjudicator must evaluate the agency's response to the employee's concern, including the timing and content of the agency's explanation to the employee of its response<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Larson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 260 F.3d 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (IRA case: remanding an appeal involving an action based on insubordination to the Board for further evidentiary analysis). <span class="Italic">Haymore v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 9 MSPR 499, 504-05 (1982), examined the reasonableness of an appellant's refusal to work, as measured against a defense that the work was unduly hazardous and the opinion, given to appellant, of an industrial hygienist who assured appellant that the safety precautions at the job were adequate:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We agree with the presiding official's reasoning that if the agency did not discipline appellant for his refusal to work lead, then other shipfitter employees might also claim that they did not have to work lead. Furthermore, other employees might believe that they could refuse to perform other jobs on the basis that they might be hazardous to their health, regardless of whether their refusals were based on a reasonable belief that the performance of such duties posed an imminent danger. The presiding official properly determined that such a situation could result in confusion and chaos within the agency. Accordingly, we find that the agency did not commit a prohibited personnel practice when it instituted adverse action proceedings against appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant also argues that he had a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> belief at the time of his refusal that a recent Supreme Court decision, <span class="Italic">Whirlpool</span> <span class="Italic">Corp. v. Marshall,</span> 444 U.S. 823, 100 S. Ct. 43, 62 L. Ed.2d 29 (1980), gave him a legal right to refuse such an assignment. In <span class="Italic">Whirlpool,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> the Court ruled that an employee of a private employer may refuse an assignment which he reasonably believes will subject him to death or serious injury. Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the holding in <span class="Italic">Whirlpool</span> is applicable to situations arising in the course of federal employment, appellant has failed to show that his health concerns were reasonable here.[1] The record reveals that the agency explained its safety procedures to appellant and demonstrated to him that working lead could not have created any danger to his health. In addition, appellant has failed to demonstrate that his refusal to work lead <span class="Italic">under any</span> <span class="Italic">circumstances</span> was reasonable. There was no showing that any of his coworkers had ever damaged their health by working lead. Appellant's sole basis for his claim that working lead would be hazardous to his health was the first paragraph of the Shipyard's Instructions concerning lead handling procedures, in which the agency warned of the dangers of excessive intake of lead. Appellant made no effort to show that the job he was asked to perform would result in an "excessive intake of lead." In fact, an industrial hygienist testified that even with no controls and no protective clothing, the job appellant was ordered to perform would subject him to such a limited amount of lead that it would not constitute a health hazard. Under these circumstances, there is no basis for the appellant's contention that he had a legal right to refuse the assignment, since there was no risk of life or health. Furthermore, in refusing the assignment, appellant showed an unwillingness to listen to agency officials responsible for health and safety or even to read agency safety materials and thus demonstrated that his health concerns were not <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Whirlpool</span> involved an OSHA regulation, 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1977.12(b)(2), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's authority to promulgate that regulations under the OSHA Act of 1970, 29 USC &#x00A7; 651 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> The 1970 OSHA statute does not directly apply to the federal government. Pursuant to Executive Order No. 11807, September 28, 1974, certain of OSHA's standards and procedures were made applicable to the federal government as an employer.

<p class="Body-Text">In limited circumstances, an employee may disobey an order that places him in a clearly dangerous situation. <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 158, 160 (1983). If obeying the order would not put the employee in a dangerous position, his only recourse is to take whatever steps he thinks appropriate to challenge the validity of the order. <span class="Italic">Daniel v.

VA</span>, 18 MSPR 71, 73-74 (1983) (improper refusal of a supervisor to direct a subordinate to change a tire and the refusal to accept verbal directions regarding the maintenance of uniform clothing). If an employee decides to disobey an order because he feels that it places him in imminent danger, the defense will fail if his job description states that the risk is inherent in the position, and if there were other ways that could have been used to avoid the danger and obey the directive. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dinkins v.

<p class="Body-Text">That an employee believes he will not be able to perform a task adequately does not excuse the failure to undertake the assignment if no threat to safety is established, <span class="Italic">Duniya v. AID,</span> DC-0752-15-0590-I-1 (NP 4/12/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the merits of the appellant's arguments, we agree with the administrative judge that none of the reasons why the appellant claims that he refused the instructions at issue show that obeying the instruction would have placed him in a clearly dangerous situation, or caused him irreparable harm. <span class="Italic">See Pedeleose</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 508, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17. The appellant's arguments regarding whether the agency correctly designated him as a COR and the currency of his COR certification both implicate the validity of his actions in that role, and, as he indicates on review, a COR acting in the absence of such authority "may result in an unauthorized/informal commitment" under Federal acquisition regulations. However, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 1.602-3, submitted by the appellant as part of his case below, specifically provides for the ratification of such unauthorized commitments. When the pertinent regulations provide for such a remedy, it cannot be said that the harm from such an unauthorized commitment is irreparable. <span class="Italic">See Pedeleose</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 508, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17. As the administrative judge noted, the record contains no evidence indicating what penalty might be imposed on an improperly credentialed COR, and FAR 1.601(a) places the ultimate responsibility for the lawful administration of Federal contracts on the head of the agency, not the COR. Moreover, the appellant has failed to show, and we perceive no likely circumstance under which he could show, that obeying the instructions at issue would have put him in immediate danger or caused irreparable harm. The same is true of the appellant's assertions that it would be impossible for him to perform the COR duties in addition to his other duties and that such duties were incompatible with his management of the vendor database.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee's failure to attend an investigatory interview was justified based on his incapacitating medical condition, <span class="Italic">Morgan v. DHS</span>, CB-7121-10-0023-V-1 (NP 4/13/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an earlier letter, dated May 21, 2008, Fiora had directed the appellant to provide administratively acceptable evidence to support his claim that he was unable to attend the interview on the scheduled date. Fiora noted that, although the appellant had been on extended sick leave, he had been deposed for his equal employment opportunity complaint in March 2008, and also testified in an arbitration hearing in April 2008. Fiora stated that he was "confused as to why [the appellant] could voluntarily participate in certain interviews but not others," and indicated that the June 19, 2008 interview would not be rescheduled in the absence of a medical diagnosis explaining the "contradiction."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated June 2, 2008, the appellant's physician responded as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Mr. Morgan has been in treatment with me since August 28, 2007, for a depressive condition. The principal features of his condition include anxiety generated by the perception that his work environment is a hostile one, a mild degree of depressive ideation, and understandable apprehension about his future. He has had insomnia some ruminations[,] and an increase in hypertension as his internist will verify.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Mr. Morgan's anxiety, as conveyed to me, is over the perception that he is being subjected to a hostile interrogation rather than a fair hearing, with respect to his EEO complaint. He has told me over many sessions of the various tactics which, by his allegation, are being employed against him to remove him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This process is inappropriate, and I concur with Mr. Morgan that it is not in his best health interests to proceed. Accordingly, I am urging you to defer this interrogation until such time as my patient feels ready to respond fully, completely, and in a relaxed and open way. Otherwise, he is at risk to decompensate, i.e. to get worse and more symptomatic, if he feels he is being rushed into a premature and unbalanced meeting which he perceives as a hostile interrogation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">I assure you that I stand ready to elaborate upon this request and the <span id="Page_2647"></span>reasons for it, as well as to release confidential details of his treatment if and when my patient decides to do so.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Again, please defer any action at this time. I have advised Mr. Morgan to rest at home on medical leave through July 1, 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his June 17, 2008 letter, Fiora denied the appellant's request for sick leave on June 19, 2008, but otherwise granted his request for extended sick leave through July 1, 2008. He rejected the appellant's request to postpone the June 19, 2008 interview on the grounds that Dr. Liles failed to explain why the appellant was unable to appear for that interview when he had participated in similar activities over the past two months.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the arbitrator appears to have accepted Fiora's reasoning, we find that it is illogical for an agency to deny an employee sick leave for a period of hours in the middle of an extended period during which it concedes he is incapacitated for duty. The appellant has adequately distinguished the occasional instances in which he briefly entered administrative leave status to give testimony in other proceedings, explaining that none of them was comparable to an investigative interview that could result in disciplinary action. Where a physician has stated that an employee is suffering from depression and anxiety, has insomnia and an increase in hypertension, and "is at risk to decompensate, i.e. to get worse and more symptomatic" in the face of a hostile interrogation, we find that the employee has presented administratively acceptable evidence that he was incapacitated for duty. Under these circumstances, it was improper for Fiora to order the appellant to attend the interview on June 19, 2008, especially without availing himself of Dr. Liles's offer to provide additional explanation and documentation to support the appellant's absence. Furthermore, because complying with the order would have endangered the appellant's health, he was not obliged to obey the order first and grieve the matter later. <span class="Italic">See Cooke v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 401, 407-08 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 73 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). Consequently, his noncompliance with the order cannot serve as a basis for disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the appellant may incorrectly refuse to obey an order because of an unjustified fear for the safety of a particular task, that fear may still warrant mitigation of a removal imposed as a result of alleged insubordination. Demotion to a position that would avoid the risk, rather than removal from the job that required the risk to be encountered, was the solution in <span class="Italic">Gomez v. USDA</span>, 63 MSPR 36, 37-39 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time of his removal, the appellant worked as a Forestry Technician (Smokejumper), GS-6, for the Forest Service (FS). The duties of a smokejumper include parachuting from airplanes into uncontrolled fire zones. FS smokejumpers are occasionally called upon to participate with Bureau of Land Management (BLM) smokejumpers in joint, "mixed load" operations. These operations are described as "mixed," because FS smokejumpers use FS-12 round canopy parachutes, while BLM smokejumpers use Ram-air canopy parachutes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1991, the FS began testing the suitability of Ram-air parachutes for smokejumping. In May, 1991 a friend of the appellant was killed during a test jump with a Ram-air parachute. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) investigated the incident, and cited the FS for several safety violations. Subsequently, the FS discontinued testing of the Ram-air parachute, and reviewed its policy concerning mixed load jumps. The FS ultimately decided to continue these operations with certain changes in procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In June, 1992, while working as part of a 14-party smokejumper crew in Redmond, Oregon, the appellant indicated to the crew chief that he could not in good conscience participate in mixed load operations. As a result of this conversation, the agency issued a letter of warning to the appellant, informing him that he was expected to take part in officially approved mixed load jumps, and that any refusal to do so would be considered insubordination subject to disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 23, 1992, the appellant refused to jump in a mixed load operation, and the agency subsequently removed him for insubordination. The appellant appealed to the Board, alleging that the agency's removal action was taken in reprisal for the raising of legitimate safety concerns regarding the use of Ram-air parachutes and the practice of mixed load operations. The appellant also alleged that the agency committed procedural error in denying him a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance prior to termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following a hearing, the administrative judge sustained the charge of insubordination, finding that the appellant was not justified in refusing agency instructions to participate in a mixed load operation. The administrative judge further found that the agency, in taking an adverse action against the appellant pursuant to the provisions of 5 USC Chapter 75, was not required to comply with the performance-based procedures cited by the appellant. Finally, the administrative judge found that the penalty of removal was reasonable under the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence establishes that the appellant refused to participate in the August 23 mixed load jump, despite being forewarned that such an action would be deemed insubordination. The evidence further establishes that the appellant had no intention of participating in any future mixed load operations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee does not have the unfettered right to disregard an order merely because there is substantial reason to believe that the order is not proper; he must first comply with the order and then register his complaint or grievance, except in certain limited circumstances where obedience would place the employee in a clearly dangerous situation. <span class="Italic">See Gragg v. United States Air Force,</span> 11 MSPB 546, 13 MSPR 296, 299 (1982), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 717 F.2d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Smokejumping entails certain inherent risks, for which its practitioners receive hazard pay. As the administrative judge correctly found, however, there is no evidence to suggest that the agency's orders regarding mixed load operations subjected the appellant to any dangers above and beyond those inherent to the job. Even assuming that Ram-air parachutes are more dangerous than those customarily used by the agency, it is undisputed that at the time of the events in this case, the agency had already discontinued use of these parachutes, and was therefore not requiring the appellant to use them. The appellant did not establish that the routine use of mixed loads presented any exceptional danger, or that any other smokejumper objected to the practice. Moreover, the agency had previously reviewed its national policy regarding mixed load operations, and implemented changes designed to improve safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that an appellant's subjective and unsupported apprehension of exceptional danger in the performance of his assigned duties does not justify his refusal to perform them. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Haymore v. Dept. of the Navy,</span> 9 MSPB 133, 9 MSPR 499, 504-505 (1982). Accordingly, we find that the agency established its charge of insubordination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, although the appellant's offense was serious, we find that in light of his nearly fifteen years of satisfactory service with the agency, his lack of any disciplinary record prior to the current dispute over the use of Ram-air chutes, and the understandably strong feelings aroused by the death of his friend during a test of the Ram-air, the agency's removal penalty should be mitigated to a demotion to the next lowest graded position which does not require jumping out of airplanes.</p>
