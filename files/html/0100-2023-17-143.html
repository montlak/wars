<p class="noindent">The theme of the nonfact exception applied to factual disputes was summarized, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1941 and Dept. of Army, Ft. McClellan</span>, 51 FLRA 998, 1000 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish that an award is based on a nonfact, the appealing party must demonstrate that the central fact underlying the award is clearly erroneous, but for which a different result would have been reached by the arbitrator<span class="Italic">. U.S. Department of the Air Force, Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, Colorado and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1497</span>, 48 FLRA 589, 593 (1993). The mere fact that the appealing party disputes an arbitral finding does not provide a basis for concluding that an award is based on a nonfact. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923 and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Care Finance Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 51 FLRA 576, 579 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pershing VAMC and AFGE Local 2338</span>, 73 FLRA 67, 70 (2022) (Member Kiko concurring) ("[T]he Authority will not find an award deficient on nonfact grounds based on a party's disagreement with an arbitrator's evaluation of evidence, including the determination of the weight to be accorded such evidence, or interpretation of a collective-bargaining agreement."); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2516 and Army Dental Activity, Ft. Bliss</span> 72 FLRA 567, 568 (2021) ("Because the Union merely disagrees with the Arbitrator's evaluation of the evidence, it fails to demonstrate that a central fact underlying the award is clearly erroneous."); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3369 and SSA</span>, 72 FLRA 158, 159 (2021) ("disagreement with an arbitrator's evaluation of evidence, including the weight to be accorded such evidence, does not provide a basis for finding that an award is based on a nonfact...to the extent that the Union is challenging the Arbitrator's failure to cite all of the evidence upon which he relied in making his findings, such an argument does not demonstrate that the award is deficient"); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 933 and VAMC Detroit</span>, 70 FLRA 508, 509 (2018) ("The Authority will not find an award deficient based on the arbitrator's determination of any factual matter that the parties disputed at arbitration. Claims that an arbitrator's factual findings are not sufficiently supported do not demonstrate that an award is deficient."); <span class="Italic">DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review and NAIJ</span>, 66 FLRA 221, 224 (2011) ("However, the Authority will not find an award deficient on the basis of an arbitrator's determination of any factual matter that the parties disputed at arbitration. In addition, an arbitrator's conclusion that is based on an interpretation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement does not constitute a fact that can be challenged as a nonfact. <span class="Italic">See NLRB</span>, 50 FLRA 88, 92 (1995)."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, NPS and NTEU</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-10.html">70 FLRA 41</a>, 43 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting) ("Thus, the Agency's argument challenges the weight that the Arbitrator accorded this witness' testimony.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VAMC Dayton and AFGE Local 2209</span>, 65 FLRA 988, 992-93 (2011), provides an example of FLRA's denial of exceptions based on a nonfact when the arbitrator's factual recitations were arguably inaccurate, but when those determinations were not central to the outcome of the award:</p>

Sec. Admin., Se. Program Serv. Ctr., Birmingham, Ala.</span>, 64 FLRA 322, 323 (2009); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1984</span>, 56 FLRA 38, 41 (2000). However, the Authority will not find an award deficient on the basis of an arbitrator's determination of any factual matter that the parties disputed at arbitration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Local 1984</span>, 56 FLRA at 41.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's assertion that the award is based on a nonfact because the Arbitrator incorrectly reported and recorded testimony is without merit. Although the Agency discusses several instances where the Arbitrator allegedly misstated testimony, it has not established that the Arbitrator's findings were central facts underlying the award. In this regard, even if the Arbitrator incorrectly recorded and reported testimony, the Agency has not demonstrated that, but for the Arbitrator's mistake, he would have reached a different result; the witness only considered the grievant's master's degree in his hindsight evaluation, and the Arbitrator independently found that, because of the grievant's master's degree and union experience, she qualified at the GS-11 level. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2142</span>, 52 FLRA 739, 744 (1996) (finding that union failed to demonstrate that the arbitrator's determination that the grievant's ten-month detail was education and not training was a central fact underlying the award); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3947</span>, 47 FLRA 1364, 1372 (1993) (denying union's nonfact exception because, even if the arbitrator made an incorrect finding, the union did not demonstrate that, but for this finding, the arbitrator would have reached a different result).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the issue of whether the selectee had prosthetics experience was disputed at arbitration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., </span>Award at 20, 38 (addressing the issue of whether the grievant or the selectee had more prosthetics experience). The Authority will not find that an award relies on a nonfact based simply on the Arbitrator's allegedly erroneous determination of any factual matter that the parties disputed at arbitration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Emps., Serv. Emps. Int'l Union, Local R4-45</span>, 64 FLRA 245, 246 (2009); <span class="Italic">U.S. Gov't Printing Office, Wash., D.C.</span>, 62 FLRA 419, 426 (2008); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1658</span>, 55 FLRA 668, 671 (1999) (finding that, because the parties contested below whether a particular candidate failed to apply for the position or did not apply in a timely fashion, the union's nonfact exception did not provide a basis for finding the award deficient); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 186</span>, 55 FLRA 59, 60 (1999) (determining that union's contention that the arbitrator erroneously evaluated the evidence concerning the grievant's qualifications for other positions failed to demonstrate that the award was deficient as based on a nonfact because the issue was contested at arbitration). Consequently, the Agency's argument does not provide a basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_1919"></span>The evidence may be thin, but the nonfact exception will not likely be granted, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and Dept. of Navy, NAVFAC Washington</span>, 67 FLRA 392, 393 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator made a factual finding, based on his evaluation of the evidence, that the Agency made a determination that the specialists were FLSA-exempt. Relying on the parties' "pre-hearing and post-hearing statements," the Arbitrator "conclude[d] that the Agency's <span class="Italic">determination</span> [of the specialists' FLSA-exempt status] is not deficient." The Union's nonfact exception is based on a claim that this factual finding was not sufficiently supported. Such claims do not demonstrate that a central fact underlying the award is clearly erroneous, but for which the Arbitrator would have reached a different result.[17] Accordingly, we deny the Union's nonfact exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guar. Corp</span>., 64 FLRA 692, 696 (2010); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. DOD Educ. Activity, Arlington, Va</span>., 56 FLRA 836, 842 (2000) (claim that "no evidence has been presented" to support alleged factual finding did not demonstrate that a central fact underlying the award was clearly erroneous, but for which arbitrator would have reached a different result); <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R4-45</span>, 55 FLRA 695, 697, 700 (1999) (noting agency argument that "[n]o evidence" supported finding, and holding that an "absence of facts" does not demonstrate that award is based on nonfact).</p>
<p class="noindent">The nonfact principles "appropriately accord deference to an arbitrator's factual findings because the parties have bargained for the facts to be found by an arbitrator chosen by them." <span class="Italic">DOD, DCA and NAGE Local R4-27</span>, 56 FLRA 855, 858 (2000); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1613</span>, 68 FLRA 128, 130 (2014) ("However, the Authority will not find an award deficient based on the arbitrator's determination of any factual matter that the parties disputed at arbitration. And disagreement with an arbitrator's evaluation of evidence, including the arbitrator's determination of the weight to be given such evidence, provides no basis for finding the award deficient as a nonfact. Further, the Authority has held that an argument that no evidence was presented at arbitration to support an arbitral finding does not demonstrate that an award is based on a nonfact.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-45 and DOD, DCA Oceana,</span> 64 FLRA 245, 246 (2009), the factual issue before the arbitrator was whether the agency had light duty work available for the grievant. The arbitrator denied the grievance. With its exceptions the union supplied affidavits from the grievant and from the union president who, present at the hearing, stated that they heard the supervisor testify that light duty work was available. FLRA denied the exception:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish that an award is based on a nonfact, the appealing party must show that a central fact underlying the award is clearly erroneous, but for which the arbitrator would have reached a different result. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1984</span>, 56 FLRA 38, 41 (2000). Although the finding that no light duty work was available appears to be such a central fact, the Union fails to establish that it is clearly erroneous. The Union bases its claim on the affidavits of the grievant and the local Union president, both present at the hearing, stating that they heard the supervisor say that light duty work was available. However, these affidavits do not demonstrate that the Arbitrator's contrary finding was clearly erroneous. At most, the affidavits submitted by the Union establish that the availability of light duty work is merely a disputed fact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Union's nonfact claim is rejected because the issue of light duty work availability was disputed at the arbitration hearing. The Authority will not find that an award relies on a nonfact based simply on the Arbitrator's allegedly erroneous determination of any factual matter that the parties disputed at arbitration. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In other words, an exception is not a vehicle for relitigating a matter disputed before the Arbitrator. In the instant matter, it is clear that the parties disputed the availability of light duty work during the arbitration hearing. Therefore, the Union's argument does not provide any basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union's nonfact exception disputes the Arbitrator's evaluation of the supervisor's testimony regarding light duty work availability. The Authority has long held that disagreement with an arbitrator's evaluation of evidence and the weight to be accorded such evidence does not provide any basis for finding an award deficient. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3295</span>, 51 FLRA 27, 32 (1995). Here, the Union simply disagrees with the Arbitrator's evaluation of the supervisor's testimony to find that no light duty work was available.</p>
<p class="noindent">A nonfact objection to an award involving interpretation and application of past practice was rejected, <span class="Italic">DLA and AFGE Local 916</span>, 66 FLRA 49, 51-52 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish that an award is based on a nonfact, the appealing party must show that a central fact underlying the award is clearly erroneous, but for which the arbitrator would have reached a different result. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1984</span>, 56 FLRA 38, 41 (2000). However, the Authority will not find an award deficient on the basis of an arbitrator's determination of any factual matter that the parties disputed at arbitration. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. In addition, an arbitrator's conclusion that is based on an interpretation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement does not constitute a fact that can be challenged as a nonfact. <span class="Italic">See NLRB</span>, 50 FLRA 88, 92 (1995). The Authority has long held that disagreement with an arbitrator's evaluation of evidence and testimony, including the determination of the weight to be accorded such evidence, provides no basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3295</span>, 51 FLRA 27, 32 (1995). Further, where the premise of a nonfact exception is erroneous, the Authority denies the exception. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2923, </span>65 FLRA 561, 563 (2011).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is based on a nonfact because, "in order to have found that the Agency violated a past practice, the Union must have carried the burden of proving the elements of the alleged ULP by a preponderance of the evidence." As set forth above, there is no evidence in the record that the Arbitrator found a ULP. Accordingly, the premise of the Agency's claim is erroneous, and we deny it. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2923</span>, 65 FLRA 561, 563 (2011).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent the Agency asserts that the evidence and testimony in the record do not support a finding of a past practice, this constitutes a disagreement with the arbitrator's evaluation of the evidence and testimony, including the determination of the weight to be accorded such evidence. As such, it does not provide a basis for finding the award deficient, <span class="Italic">see AFGE, Local 3295</span>, 51 FLRA at 32, and we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA routinely dismisses nonfact exceptions based on credibility findings, <span class="Italic">VAMC, Ann Arbor and AFGE Local 2092</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v56/56-026.html">56 FLRA 216</a>, 220 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The mere fact that an appealing party disputes an arbitral finding does not provide a basis for concluding that an award is based on a nonfact. <span class="Italic">Federal Employees Metal Trades Council, Local 127 and U.S. Department of the Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Mare Island, California</span>, 51 FLRA 1259, 1261 (1996). It is well-settled that parties choose arbitrators for the purpose of observing witnesses and evaluating their testimony. <span class="Italic">United Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc., </span>484 U.S. 29, 45 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator based his findings on the testimony of witnesses that was elicited on direct examination and ignored all contradictory testimony that was elicited by the Agency on cross-examination. The Agency argues that these findings constitute nonfacts. However, a review of the examples cited by the Agency shows that in each instance, the matter was disputed by the parties before the Arbitrator. Indeed, as the Agency presented no witnesses of its own, its cross-examination served as the primary vehicle for putting matters in dispute. Consequently, the Agency's assertions provide no basis for finding that the award is deficient as based on a nonfact.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA will not find an award deficient based on a nonfact on the basis of an arbitrator's determination on any factual matter that the parties disputed at arbitration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, NAS Joint Reserve Base and AFGE Local 1364</span>, 66 FLRA 3, 5 (2011) ("The Union contends that whether the parties were negotiating in good faith was disputed at arbitration.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the Arbitrator erroneously found that the Agency had not raised its past-practice argument prior to arbitration. But at arbitration, when the Agency raised its past-practice argument, the Union alleged that the Arbitrator should not consider the argument because the Agency had not raised it previously. The Arbitrator found that there was no evidence that the Agency had raised the argument previously and declined to consider it. Consequently, the matter of whether the Agency had previously raised its past-practice argument was disputed at arbitration and, as such, the Agency's exception provides no basis for finding that the award is based on a nonfact. <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 65 FLRA at 173. Accordingly, we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">A nonfact exception was granted in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Great Plains Region and IBEW Local 1759</span>, 68 FLRA 992, 994 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting), determining that the arbitrator made a math error in calculating the hours of "penalty pay" for a grievant.
