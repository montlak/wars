<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-15"><span class="space">a.</span> Specific Allegations Control</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Central to the jurisdictional analysis are specific allegations that a challenged action was involuntary. A broad and unsupported allegation that a resignation or downgrading was involuntary will not do<span class="Italic">. Leggett v. SBA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3189), a forced resignation case, concluded that the appellant's allegations conclusory and insufficient to support jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of racial discrimination. The question of ungodly practices in the workplace. Discrimination outside the department. Discriminating [against] me because of dress (office attire). Discrimination in training. Withholding information about a PMAS. Having me sign before elements were unavailable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wakefield v. VA,</span> CH-0752-14-0729-I-1 (NP 3/12/2015) ("However, he failed to explain, and we are unable to discern, why he believes the agency could not prevail on his proposed removal. Instead, he made bare assertions that the proposal contained misleading statements, and that he was the only one charged despite others being involved. Based upon the nature of the appellant's claims, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant failed to meet his burden of proving, or nonfrivolously alleging, that his retirement was coerced by virtue of an unwarranted proposal to remove him that could not be substantiated. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Briscoe v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 55 F.3d 1571, 1573-74 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (bald allegations standing alone do not meet the nonfrivolous allegation standard).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What is necessary is a statement of the specific circumstances suggesting duress, coercion, mental incapacity, misrepresentation, or other indicia of involuntariness. Under some decisions of the Federal Circuit, affidavits may be needed to establish Board jurisdiction and move the case along to a hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dick v. VA</span>, <a href="https://openjurist.org/290/f3d/1356/dick-v-department-of-veterans-affairs">290 F.3d 1356</a>, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (partially overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-federal-circuit/1143912.html">437 F.3d 1322</a> (Fed. Cir. 2006). Once jurisdictional specifics are provided, a hearing is granted to the appellant and the agency to offer proof through witnesses and documentary evidence, with discovery rights and the procedural trappings of Board litigation. According to <span class="Italic">Aurandt v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 53 MSPR 591, 595 (1992), a nonfrivolous allegation of fact is one that, if proved, would make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that an employee's resignation was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On the jurisdictional issue of how the appellant obtains a hearing after complaining of a resignation forced by an improper personnel action or threat of an improper personnel action, the Board provided an example of the type of allegations meriting a hearing in <span class="Italic">Cartwright v. DHUD</span>, 54 MSPR 338, 342 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Generally, an appellant is entitled to a hearing on the issue of Board jurisdiction over an appeal of an allegedly coerced resignation or retirement if he makes a "nonfrivolous allegation" casting doubt on the presumption of voluntariness.... The Board has held that to establish an involuntary resignation or retirement in situations involving a directed reassignment, the appellant must prove that the reassignment had "no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rayfield v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 26 MSPR 244, 246 (1985). Thus, to establish entitlement to a hearing in such a case, the appellant must furnish specific allegations, that if proven, would demonstrate that the reassignment was without solid or substantial basis under personnel practice and principle....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Cartwright</span>, the appellant contended that he was entitled to appeal because he was forced to resign for declining a geographic reassignment triggered by an alleged need for his services elsewhere, his services were not needed at the other location, and the agency needed him to work at his original location since the agency posted his original job after he resigned.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hawkins v. MSPB</span>, 420 Fed. Appx. 967, 970 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), affirmed dismissal of an involuntary resignation appeal because of the paucity of specific factual allegations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As an initial matter, we note that the record is devoid of sufficient information to find that Hawkins has made a non-frivolous allegation of jurisdiction largely because Hawkins did not respond to the Board's orders to supplement the record. Although Hawkins is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, the Board's orders were clear and unambiguous in stating that it would dismiss Hawkins's appeal unless she submitted additional argument or evidence. <span class="Italic">See Mendoza v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 966 F.2d 650, 653-54 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("The court does not expect a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigant to be made to jump through a confusing array of procedural hoops," but "there was nothing mysterious or incomprehensible in the Show Cause Order"). The burden is on Hawkins to establish jurisdiction, and her failure to respond in the face of such an order, given the paucity of her original submission, substantially impairs her ability to satisfy that burden.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weng v. Dept. of Labor,</span> CB-7121-13-0180-V-1 (NP 3/12/2015), stated the appellant should make specific allegations of a constructive adverse action. The Board will not require an AJ to review a voluminous case file to search out evidence supporting those allegations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant is correct that the administrative judge must consider evidence submitted; however, the appellant has the responsibility to articulate her claims with "reasonable clarity and precision" with substantive details establishing jurisdiction or risk being found to have failed to meet her burden of making a nonfrivolous allegation. <span class="Italic">See Ellison v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1036-37 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (discussing this requirement in the context of an appellant's obligation to prove exhaustion of a complaint of whistleblower reprisal). In addition, it is not the Board's obligation to pore through the record or to construe and make sense of allegations based on various parts of an extremely voluminous case file. <span class="Italic">Keefer v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 476, &#x00B6; 18, n.2 (2002); <span class="Italic">see Corley v. Rosewood Care Center, Inc. of Peoria</span>, 388 F.3d 990, 1001 (7th Cir. 2004) ("[W]e will not root through the hundreds of documents and thousands of pages that make up the record here to make [the plaintiff's] case for him."). The appellant provided a single response to the administrative judge's jurisdictional order but did not direct the administrative judge to where in the voluminous pleadings and corrections the evidence of the appellant's nonfrivolous allegation could be found. The administrative judge had no obligation to go beyond that and review every page to make the appellant's case for her. Therefore, we find no error in the administrative judge's action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The obligation of the AJ considering a constructive adverse action appeal is to analyze nonfrivolous allegations, not to then put the appellant to a burden of proving those allegations by preponderant evidence--a task left to the appellant who makes her way to a hearing, <span class="Italic">Searcy v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 114 MSPR 281, 285-86 &#x00B6; 11, 2010 MSPB 127 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge provided the appellant with the proper jurisdictional notice in her initial order, advising him that, if he was requesting a hearing, he would be granted one only if he made allegations of duress, coercion, or agency misrepresentation supported by facts which, if proven, would establish that his resignation was involuntary. In the ID, the administrative judge opened by finding that, despite his request, the appellant was not entitled to a hearing because he did not raise nonfrivolous allegations of Board jurisdiction. As discussed below, we do not disagree with this initial finding. The administrative judge erred, however, in apparently applying a preponderant evidence standard in analyzing the appellant's assertions and evidence in the remainder of the As noted, she found that the appellant did not establish acts of coercion by the agency, or working conditions so difficult or unpleasant, that would have compelled a reasonable person to resign, and that he did not prove involuntariness.<span class="Italic"></span> Such findings were inappropriate in light of her denial of the appellant's request for a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Burgess</span>, 758 F.2d at 643; <span class="Italic">Green v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 59, &#x00B6; 7 (2009); <span class="Italic">Deines</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 389, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There has been and there remains confusion over how to determine whether a nonfrivolous allegation has been presented and when a hearing is required. AJs have tried to resolve factual disputes on the basis of affidavits that are <span id="Page_1907"></span>submitted to show or rebut the existence of a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness. But the right to a hearing should be controlled by detailed allegations, not necessarily by factual proof. If affidavits are demanded, proof is being reviewed instead of, or in addition to, allegations. Disposition of jurisdictional issues through the evaluation of evidence constitutes summary judgment. It is important that AJs distinguish between the allegations necessary to invoke Board jurisdiction and the evidence necessary to prove the allegations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gleaves v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 558, 560 (1988) (to obtain a hearing, the appellant need only present a nonfrivolous allegation that his resignation was involuntary; the sufficiency of the agency's rebuttal of the appellant's allegation is a matter to be properly determined following a full hearing on the merits; nonfrivolous allegations are not the same as indisputable evidence supporting a position); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Willey v. GSA</span>, 40 MSPR 616, 619 (1989) (AJ's acknowledgment order advised the appellant that production of factual evidence and argument would be necessary to obtain a hearing; "[t]he appellant failed to respond to the order by presenting specific reasons showing the Board's jurisdiction over the appeal"). Even the unchallenged assertions of the appellant's representative can constitute a nonfrivolous allegation raising a factual question on the timeliness, if not the jurisdictional merits, of an appeal from a constructive adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hendricks v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 163, 168-69 (1995). The bottom line: allegations backed by affidavits and documentation are the best way for an appellant to establish jurisdiction; allegations alone, unsupported by a detailed affidavit providing factual information supporting the claim of an involuntary action, will not likely suffice to avoid summary dismissal of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit helped to clarify the distinction between allegations and proof in <span class="Italic">Dumas v. MSPB</span>, 789 F.2d 892, 893-95 (Fed. Cir. 1986), an involuntary resignation or retirement appeal dismissed by the Board without a hearing on the basis of conflicting written factual submissions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dispositive issue is whether Mr. Dumas had made a "non-frivolous allegation" of involuntariness. In deciding this threshold question the presiding official looked at not only Mr. Dumas' allegations, but at the counter-allegations of the agency, all as presented in the documentary record. In sum, the presiding official weighed evidence, resolved conflicting assertions, and found facts, from which the official concluded that involuntariness had not been proven by Mr. Dumas.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, all that was required at that threshold stage was that a non-frivolous allegation be made: that is, did Mr. Dumas allege facts which if proven could make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of involuntariness? <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Stokes v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 685-86 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Such an allegation can, we agree with the agency, be disposed of summarily on a documentary record in appropriate cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Manning v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 742 F.2d 1424 (Fed. Cir. 1984). But, if the alleged facts are sufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of involuntariness, the issue can not be summarily determined adversely; the petitioner is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official concluded that Mr. Dumas had not demonstrated involuntariness by a preponderance of the evidence. However, this conclusion required resolution of conflicting statements as to the advice given. Unlike <span class="Italic">Manning</span>, which held that the petitioner was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of involuntariness when there were no contested issues of fact, Mr. Dumas raised legally sufficient factual issues that required resolution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The right to an evidentiary hearing on the merits of a removal action is established by statute. 5 USC 7701(a)(1). In this matter, where jurisdiction and substance are inextricably intertwined, Mr. Dumas to establish jurisdiction must prove involuntariness on its merits. As stated in <span class="Italic">Burgess</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An involuntary resignation is a removal...and as such the issue of jurisdiction is intertwined with the merits of an action.... It is this connection with the merits of an appeal which prompts the need for a hearing....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed that no hearing is required in a constructive adverse action appeal (brought by an ALJ) when the allegations alone are sufficient to resolve the appeal without a hearing, <span class="Italic">Stephens v. MSPB</span>, 986 F.2d 493, 497 (Fed. Cir. 1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioners in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> had also asserted that they were entitled to a hearing on the jurisdictional issue. 931 F.2d at 859. The court disagreed, stating: "[T]he Board is not required to hold a hearing when facts giving rise to jurisdiction are not properly alleged, even though, as here, its existence may be asserted." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 721 F.2d 355, 357 (Fed. Cir. 1983)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Manning v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 742 F.2d 1424, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1984), this court stated that "it would be appropriate for the MSPB to honor a request for hearing where a petitioner's allegations raise non-frivolous issues of fact relating to jurisdiction which cannot be resolved simply on submissions of documentary evidence." In this case, petitioner's allegations do not raise issues of fact. Nor has petitioner indicated in his appeal brief that he has any additional evidence which should be considered by the Board before a jurisdictional determination can properly be made. Indeed, petitioner merely asserts in his appeal brief that he "is entitled to an opportunity to prove his allegations." As mentioned above, even accepting all of petitioner's factual allegations as true, the Board still does not have jurisdiction because the program and instructional course do not impair petitioner's decisional independence. All of the legal issues relating to jurisdiction can be resolved on the documentary evidence submitted. Thus, petitioner is not entitled to a hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dorrall v. Dept. of Army</span>, 301 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002), <span class="Italic">overruled in part</span>, <span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-federal-circuit/1143912.html">437 F.3d 1322</a>, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006), emphasized the need for evidence to support allegations to establish an issue of fact requiring a hearing in an involuntary retirement appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the merits, Dorrall urges that he was coerced to retire by management. "[T]o establish involuntariness on the basis of coercion, an employee must show that the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee's resignation or retirement, that the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire, and that the employee's resignation or retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency." <span class="Italic">Staats v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (citations omitted). "The Board has jurisdiction over an appeal if the government employee makes nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction supported by affidavits or other evidence." <span class="Italic">Dick v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 290 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002). And the Board may properly consider the government's evidence as well as the employee's. In that respect, the standard is analogous to that for summary judgment. Thus, in this context, the petitioner must show the existence of a material fact issue as to voluntariness to support Board jurisdiction. Non-frivolous allegations cannot be supported by unsubstantiated speculation in a pleading submitted by petitioner. Here Dorrall, who had the burden of proof, has failed to produce sufficient evidence to create a material fact issue as to whether his retirement was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some Federal Circuit decisions tend to interrelate the right to a hearing with well-pleaded allegations (and, perhaps, factual information of record) demonstrating that the allegations are within the jurisdiction of the Board. But at times the Federal Circuit permits the Board to predicate jurisdiction on a nonfrivolous allegation only if the allegation is backed up by some evidence. As to a waiver of adverse action appeal rights, <span class="Italic">Briscoe v. VA</span>, 55 F.3d 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1995), involving an appellant who was terminated following her failure to meet the conditions of a last chance agreement, the issue before the Board (and court) was whether the appellant lacked the mental capacity to enter the agreement, a jurisdictional issue: if the appellant lacked mental capacity to enter the agreement, the waiver in the agreement would be a nullity and the Board would have jurisdiction over appellant's removal. The appellant's unsupported allegation of diminished mental capacity was not, however, enough to carry her forward to the point of a Board hearing. Under <span class="Italic">Dick v. VA</span>, <a href="https://openjurist.org/290/f3d/1356/dick-v-department-of-veterans-affairs">290 F.3d 1356</a>, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (partially overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-federal-circuit/1143912.html">437 F.3d 1322</a>, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006)), involving an Individual Right of Action appeal by a whistleblower challenging a demotion, jurisdiction is established by a combination of allegations and affidavits or other evidence. The Federal Circuit's approach on establishing Board jurisdiction varies depending on the type of case, so the law is not uniform or, more directly stated, the legal analysis often confused. [Refer to last chance agreements in Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-087.html#sec2-86">Adverse Action or Performance-Based Appeal Arising From Last Chance or Other Settlement Agreement</a>," and waivers of appeal rights in Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-160.html#sec2-158">Waiver of Appeal Through Last Chance or Other Preappeal Agreement.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With or without regard to Federal Circuit guidance, the Board often addresses constructive adverse action appeals through jurisdictional rather than merits determinations, <span class="Italic">Anderson v. SBA</span>, 78 MSPR 518, 520-21 n.* (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ, relying on <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 978 F.2d 679, 688 (Fed. Cir. 1992), treated the alleged involuntariness of the appellant's retirement as an issue of whether the appellant stated a claim for which relief can be granted, rather than as a jurisdictional issue. In <span class="Italic">Spruill,</span> the court stated that an appellant's inability to establish the involuntariness of his resignation constitutes a failure to establish "a key factual element of his cause of action" and not a failure to establish the Board's jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. This statement in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> was dicta, however, and has not been followed by the court or the Board, which have subsequently treated the involuntariness of a retirement or resignation as a jurisdictional issue, as required by the court's <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of the Navy,</span> 934 F.2d, 1240, 1248 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (the Board properly dismissed the appellant's appeal of his resignation for lack of jurisdiction when he failed to prove it was involuntary)<span class="Italic">. See Braun v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 50 F.3d 1005, 1008 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 412, 416 (1997). Thus, we find that the AJ should have dismissed for lack of jurisdiction the appellant's claim that his resignation was involuntary....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Distinctions between unfounded claims and lack of jurisdiction aside, the Board now generally accepts the notion that a jurisdictional determination <span id="Page_1908"></span>should not be made on the basis of an evaluation of the agency's evidence rather than an evaluation of allegations by the appellant (best supported by some evidence from the appellant). The appellant's allegations should be specific, calculated to convince the Board that, if true, they lead to the conclusion that the action appealed was involuntary. The Board is better at telling appellants that they are not sufficiently specific in their <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appeals than it is at explaining to these employees how they are supposed to meet the pleading requirements established by Board case law. Typical of Board treatment of constructive adverse action appeals is <span class="Italic">Collins v. DLA</span>, 55 MSPR 185, 188-90 (1992), <span class="Italic">modified in</span> <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329-30 (1994), <span class="Italic">post</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction in this case, the administrative judge considered, at least in part, affidavits from the appellant's supervisor and other agency employees denying the appellant's claim of reprisal and disparaging remarks directed at her. The administrative judge stated that "the agency...presented evidence tending to rebut the assertions made by the appellant that she was forced to resign and the appellant has not challenged this evidence."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge erred in considering the agency's evidence and the appellant's failure to respond to that evidence since, in establishing the right to a jurisdictional hearing, an appellant only has to make a nonfrivolous (allegation) of facts to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of involuntariness, independent of any showing by the agency, or any failure on the appellant's part to respond to the agency's evidence or to submit his own evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dumas v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 789 F.2d 892, 893-94 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Hill v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 796 F.2d 1469, 1472 (Fed. Cir. 1986). This error, however, did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights because the ultimate decision finding no jurisdiction was correct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's petition for appeal included a copy of her unsworn letter of resignation to the agency. That letter stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Pressures resulting from recent conflicts addressed via EEO and AFGE have compounded the normally stressful environment I work in. This has created an atmosphere of such extreme tension that my physical condition has deteriorated alarmingly. This stress has caused gastrointestinal pain and bleeding, migraines, sleep disturbances, and upper respiratory problems, as well as contributing to gall bladder attacks. Inasmuch as I see no relief or protection available and I am in constant fear of reprisal, I feel that my continued employment here can only worsen my condition. Accordingly, I hereby resign my position, effective today, 91 DEC 20, at the end of my normal shift.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also submitted an affidavit with her petition for appeal in which she described retaliation and discrimination allegedly directed at her in response to her testifying at the Board hearing of another employee, Deborah Haines. The appellant averred that the day after her testimony her supervisor started retaliating against her. According to the appellant, she requested a transfer to another supervisor, and although she was promised assignment to a different supervisor, she was assigned to Haines's former supervisor, who also treated her unfairly, including downgrading her performance. In her affidavit, the appellant avers that she resigned because of the harassment she was experiencing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's affidavit did not reiterate the allegations in her letter of resignation that she resigned because of health concerns. Nor, although given ample opportunity to do so, did she make any specific allegations before the administrative judge linking her health claims with the alleged harassment or showing the severity of her claimed ailments. Further, the appellant did not make allegations specifying particular acts of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation directed toward her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has failed to allege sufficient specific facts which, if true, would show that she had no alternative to resignation. We therefore conclude that the appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that her resignation was involuntary. Accordingly, the administrative judge properly dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction without affording the appellant a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Collins</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Garcia v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 4, 7 (1993), determining there was no harmful error in the AJ's dismissal of the appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Because an appellant need only make a nonfrivolous <span class="Italic">allegation</span> of fact to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over his involuntary resignation, the administrative judge's jurisdictional determination must be made independent of any evidence submitted by the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dumas v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 789 F.2d 892, 894 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Collins</span>, 55 MSPR at 189. Such allegations by an appellant may be disposed of summarily on a documentary record in appropriate cases. <span class="Italic">Dumas</span>, 789 F.2d at 894; <span class="Italic">Manning v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 742 F.2d 1424, 1427-28 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge here erred because he considered the agency's evidence opposing the appellant's arguments concerning the Board's jurisdiction over this appeal. However, we also find that, in determining that the appellant failed to cast sufficient doubt on the voluntariness of his resignation to entitle him to a jurisdictional hearing, the administrative judge did not rely upon the agency's arguments concerning jurisdiction but cited the weakness of the appellant's jurisdictional arguments as the basis for his finding. Further, while the administrative judge improperly cited to the agency's response to the petition for appeal as the source of the November 9, 1992 SF-52 and the August 17, 1992 "Memorandum of Understanding" in finding that the appellant's resignation was voluntary, the appellant had submitted the identical evidence into the record with his petition for appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we find that the administrative judge's determinations in the initial decision are supported by the appellant's pleadings and evidence, and that the administrative judge would have made the same jurisdictional determination if he had properly limited his consideration to the appellant's evidence and argument. Thus, the administrative judge's error in considering the evidence submitted below by the agency did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights and provides no basis for reversal of the initial decision in this appeal. <span class="Italic">Collins</span>, 55 MSPR at 188-90; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Panter v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329-30 (1994), an AJ may examine uncontroverted evidence from the agency bearing on jurisdictional issues other than voluntariness of the constructive adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary evidence which tends to show that the appellant has no right to appeal to the Board. In <span class="Italic">Manning</span>, 742 F.2d at 1428, for example, the administrative judge properly considered the agency's unrebutted evidence that Manning was not on forced leave for a period of 14 days or more. Similarly, where an appellant makes a nonfrivolous allegation that his resignation was involuntary due to coercion, the administrative judge may consider the agency's uncontradicted documentary evidence that the appellant was a probationary employee who would not be entitled to appeal rights absent a nonfrivolous claim of marital status or partisan political discrimination. To the extent that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Collins v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 55 MSPR 185, 189 (1992), held that the agency's evidence may not be considered at all, we modify it here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 412, 418 (1997) (AJ erred by weighing agency evidence and resolving conflicting assertions of the parties on the voluntariness of the resignation allegedly induced by the agency's refusal to accommodate the appellant's disability); <span class="Italic">Yaksich v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 71 MSPR 355, 363 (1996) (interpreting <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>: "Although the Board may consider an agency's documentary submissions in determining whether an appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation entitling her to a hearing, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the Board may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties, and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive.").</p>
