<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-219"><span class="space">b.</span> Arbitrary or Capricious Restoration Effort</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 353.301 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Partially recovered</span>. Agencies must make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty. At a minimum, this would mean treating these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. (See 29 U.S.C. 791(b) and 794.) If the individual fully recovers, he or she is entitled to be considered for the position held at the time of injury, or an equivalent one. A partially recovered employee is expected to seek reemployment as soon as he or she is able.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chism v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 436, 439-42 &#x00B6; 5-12 (2000) (partially overruled, <span class="Italic">Chen v. USPS</span>, 97 MSPR 527 (2004), <span class="Italic">post</span>), considered what restoration efforts are required for the partially recovered employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A partially recovered employee is one who has recovered sufficiently to return to less physically demanding work. <span class="Italic">Leach v. Department of Commerce</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 8, 15 (1994). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d), agencies are required to "make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty." Where an individual is entitled to seek and does seek restoration as a partially recovered employee, the agency is continuously obligated to make restoration efforts, to include searching throughout the agency but within the local commuting area for vacant positions to which he could be restored and to consider him for such vacancies. <span class="Italic">Leach,</span> at 15-16, 19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Jurisdiction</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who is partially recovered from a compensable injury may appeal to the Board "for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). In order to establish Board jurisdiction over such an appeal, the appellant must show that: (1) he was separated from his position due to a compensable injury; (2) he partially recovered from the injury; (3) he requested restoration within certain limitations; and, (4) the agency denied that request. <span class="Italic">See As'Salaam v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 MSPR 76 &#x00B6; 14 (2000); <span class="Italic">Besemer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 260, 264 (1998). We need not further discuss the first element, since it is undisputed that the appellant was separated from his EAS-17 Maintenance Supervisor position due to his compensable injuries. In order to resolve the jurisdictional question, however, we must address each of the other elements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant established that he partially recovered from his injuries</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102 defines partially recovered as follows: "An injured employee, though not ready to resume the full range of his or her regular duties, has recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements." In the instant case, the record contains a letter from one of the appellant's physicians, dated May 15, 1991, that indicates that the appellant was able to work 8 hours per day within specified restrictions. There are similar letters from physicians, dated from 1994 through 1997, that also indicate that the appellant was ready to return to work. However, the record also contains a November 4, 1995 Medical/Rehabilitation Status Questionnaire in which the appellant indicated that he could not work at that time due to a "total knee replacement." In addition, a witness from the Department of Labor testified that the appellant's status as a partially recovered employee dated only from June 2, 1997. Finally, an agency Human Resources Specialist indicated on an April 8, 1998 form requesting the appellant's Official Personnel File (OPF) that the appellant was "able to return to work." The AJ found that the appellant had partially recovered from his compensable injuries "at some point." We agree that the record evidence cited above clearly establishes that the appellant partially recovered from his injuries, but also that it is unclear when the partial recovery occurred. Accordingly, although we find that the appellant satisfied this element of his jurisdictional burden, since we are remanding this appeal for adjudication on the merits we leave it to the AJ to further develop the record as necessary and to determine the date on which the appellant was partially recovered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has shown that he requested restoration</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that he began to seek restoration as early as 1991, and that he periodically spoke with a number of agency employees about returning to duty, both over the phone and in person, between 1991 and 1999. The agency does not dispute that the appellant requested restoration, and, in fact, other record evidence supports it. Nevertheless, again, as above, it is unclear when the appellant first requested restoration, and whether he was partially recovered at that time. The AJ must also make these determinations on remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency denied the appellant restoration</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the AJ based his dismissal of the appeal on his finding that the appellant had failed to demonstrate that the agency "expressly denied" the appellant restoration. The AJ further stated that he could not "review the appellant's claim that the agency's conceded delay in restoring him constituted a constructive denial of restoration."<span class="Italic"></span> The appellant argues on review that the AJ's holding would allow an agency to divest an employee of Board review by indefinitely ignoring restoration. For the reasons discussed below, we agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we note that neither the statute nor the regulations covering restoration rights state a specific form in which a denial of a restoration request must be made in order to trigger a former employee's Board appeal rights. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b); 5 C.F.R. part 353. Nor has the Board ever specified that such a denial must be formal, or in writing. In contrast, in fact, the Board has held that an agency's delay in restoring a partially recovered employee may constitute a denial of restoration. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 479, 483 (1996). In <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, because the record was insufficiently developed, the Board was unable to decide whether the agency had delayed the appellant's restoration to such an extent that it was tantamount to a denial. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In the instant appeal, however, although we cannot determine the exact dates on which the appellant was first partially recovered and requested restoration, even the agency does not dispute that <span class="Italic">at the latest</span>, those conditions were fulfilled by April, 1998. In fact, there is some support for a finding that the appellant may have been partially recovered and may have requested restoration much earlier. Moreover, an agency employee admitted that, in 1998, he told an OWCP official that the agency would not restore the appellant to duty because doing so would be too expensive. Under these circumstances, we find that the agency's extensive delays in restoring the appellant, coupled with its admission that, at least as of 1998, it had no plans to attempt to do so, were sufficiently equivalent to a denial of restoration to bestow jurisdiction over this appeal upon the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Merits</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have found that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal, we must remand the appeal to the regional office for further adjudication on the merits, including a full evidentiary hearing. We instruct the AJ to determine when the appellant was partially recovered from his compensable injuries and when he first requested restoration, and then to determine whether the agency's subsequent denial of restoration was "arbitrary and capricious." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). If the AJ finds that the denial was arbitrary and capricious, he should order the agency to pay the appellant back pay and benefits as appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Discrimination Claims</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we have found that the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal, the AJ should also adjudicate the appellant's claim that the agency's denial of his restoration rights was the result of disability and age discrimination....</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Swapsy v. USPS</span>, CH-0353-13-0311-I-2 (NP 9/13/2022), provided some clarity to the agency's restoration requirements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleged that the agency denied her request for restoration when it offered her a limited-duty assignment on April 12, 2012. Partially recovered employees may not appeal an improper restoration to the Board; they may only appeal to the Board to determine whether the agency's actions were arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Trembly v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who rejects a suitable offer of restoration cannot show that the agency's offer was so unreasonable as to amount to an appealable denial of restoration because OWCP, by finding the offer suitable, necessarily determined that it was reasonable. <span class="Italic">Trembly</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 297, &#x00B6; 6 (finding that, when OWCP found the agency's restoration offer suitable, the Board was precluded from finding that the offer was so unreasonable that it amounted to a denial of restoration). Decisions on an offered position's suitability are within the exclusive domain of OWCP and it is OWCP, not the employing agency and not the Board, which possesses the requisite expertise to evaluate whether a position is suitable in light of that employee's particular medical condition. <span class="Italic">New v.

Because the appellant rejected a suitable offer of employment, she has not shown by preponderant evidence that the agency denied a request for restoration.

<p class="Block-Quote1">"An individual who is partially recovered from a compensable injury may appeal to the MSPB for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). To establish Board jurisdiction over a restoration claim as a partially recovered employee, an appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that: (1) She was absent from her position due to a compensable injury; (2) she recovered sufficiently to return to duty on a part-time basis, or to return to work in a position with less demanding physical requirements than those previously required of her; (3) the agency denied her request for restoration; and (4) the agency's denial was "arbitrary and capricious." <span class="Italic">Chen v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's documentary submissions themselves are insufficient to satisfy the fourth jurisdictional criterion, the agency's documentary submissions are sufficient to render nonfrivolous the appellant's allegation that the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">See Baldwin v.

The Office of Personnel Management's regulations provide:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Agencies must make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty. At a minimum, this would mean treating these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). As discussed in <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> the reassignment obligation under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which mandates reasonable accommodation for persons with disabilities, is not necessarily limited geographically to the local commuting area. 2010 MSPB 121, &#x00B6; 18. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d), however, an agency's responsibility in the restoration context is limited to the local commuting area. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board has interpreted this regulation as requiring agencies to search within the local commuting area for vacant positions to which an agency can restore a partially recovered employee and to consider him for any such vacancies. <span class="Italic">See Sapp v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 189, 193-94 (1997). "For restoration rights purposes, the local commuting area is the geographic area in which an individual lives and can reasonably be expected to travel back and forth daily to his usual duty station." <span class="Italic">Hicks v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 9 (1999). It includes any population center, or two or more neighboring ones, and the surrounding localities.<span class="Italic"> Sapp,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 193. The question of what constitutes a local commuting area is one of fact. The extent of a commuting area is ordinarily determined by factors such as common practice, the availability and cost of public transportation or the convenience and adequacy of highways, and the travel time required to go to and from work. <span class="Italic">See Beardmore v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 761 F.2d 677, 678 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (defining "local commuting area" in the context of reassignment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency's documentary submissions show that its job search was limited to installations within a single district. Because the agency limited its search to a single district, whether it searched the entire commuting area remains an unanswered question of material fact. <span class="Italic">See Sanchez,</span> 2010 MSPB 121, &#x00B6; 14. Evidence that the agency failed to search the commuting area as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration.<span class="Italic"> See Barachina v.

Rather, in a case like this one where the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious for lack of a proper job search, the Board has found that the appropriate remedy is for "the agency to conduct an appropriate search within the local commuting area retroactive to...the date of the appellant's request for restoration, and to consider her for any suitable vacancies." <span class="Italic">Sapp v.
