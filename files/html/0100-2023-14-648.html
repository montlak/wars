<p class="noindent-1">Once an employee's reviewing official(s) has (have) acted upon the written evaluation of performance and recommendations by the employee's appraising official(s), derived a summary rating, and conferred a rating of record, <span class="Italic">the employee shall be provided copies of the appraisal documents prepared by the appraising and reviewing officials</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[Only the [emphasized] sections of the proposal are in dispute. Bracketed material above is in the original.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Of these provisions, FLRA determined in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 42 FLRA at 1316-24:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2, which consists of three parts, concerns the preparation of employee performance evaluations and the communication of those evaluations to unit employees. Section (b)(1) of the proposal would require an employee's appraising official to: (1) prepare a written independent evaluation of the employee's performance; (2) recommend in that evaluation specific performance standard ratings for each of the employee's critical and noncritical elements; and (3) forward this evaluation to the employee's designated reviewing official. Section (b)(1) also provides that this evaluation will not contain a summary rating nor constitute a rating of record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second part of the proposal, Option 1, would require the employee's appraising official to provide a copy of the performance evaluation prepared pursuant to section (b)(1) to the employee and to discuss this evaluation with the employee before forwarding it to the appropriate reviewing official. The last part of Proposal 2, option 2, is to be considered only if Option 1 is found to be nonnegotiable. Option 2 would require management, after the reviewing official has acted upon the appraising official's evaluation and conferred a rating of record, to provide the employee with copies of the evaluation prepared by the appraising official pursuant to section (b)(1) and the appraisal document prepared by the reviewing official.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union submitted Proposal 2 to address concerns related to the current appraisal process.&#x2003;The record reveals that under the current process the regional director of a regional office is the designated higher-level reviewing official. During the appraisal process, neither the employee's performance rating nor anything that will divulge that rating is given to the employee. The employee's performance rating is not disclosed in any manner to an employee until the appraising official(s) and the reviewing official discuss the appraisal and the rating, come to a consensus about the rating of record, and the rating is approved by the final reviewer, the regional director. Once the regional director approves the appraisal, a copy is furnished to the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.203, a rating of record is "the summary rating required at the time specified in the Performance Management Plan," and the summary rating is "the written record of the appraisal of each critical and non-critical element and the assignment of a summary rating level." Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(c) "[r]atings of record may not be communicated to employees prior to approval by the final reviewer." Section 430.206(c), however, does not "preclude communication about appraisal of performance between a supervisor and an employee prior to the determination of the rating of record." Section 430.206(c) is part of the regulations prescribed by OPM for performance appraisal systems for General Schedule employees to implement and supplement the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301-4305....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now address the specific parts of Proposal 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section (b)(1</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, for the reasons expressed below, that section (b)(1) is not inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(c). Moreover, although section (b)(1) directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work, it is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section (b)(1), as noted above, would require an employee's appraising official to prepare an independent evaluation of the employee's performance, including specific performance standard ratings for each of the employee's critical and noncritical elements, and forward this evaluation to the designated reviewing official. The Union asserts that Proposal 2 is intended to provide for an independent evaluation of an employee's performance by the appraising official. That is, under section (b)(1), an appraising official would not communicate with the reviewing official prior to preparing this evaluation, but would prepare the evaluation and then forward it to the reviewing official. The proposal also provides that the "independent evaluation" will not contain a "summary rating" and does not constitute a "rating of record."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find nothing in this part of the proposal that is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(c). By its terms, section (b)(1) would not require disclosure of the independent evaluation to the employee prior to review by the reviewing official. We will consider the issue of the disclosure of the independent evaluation to the employee in our disposition of Option 1, the second part of Proposal 2 below....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, however, that the wording of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(c) suggests that performance appraisals and performance-based personnel actions prepared or taken under this section are forwarded to the appropriate official at a higher level for review and approval. Section (b)(1), by its terms, would require that the independent evaluation prepared pursuant to this section be forwarded to the reviewing official. Moreover, we note that, as worded, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(c) would not preclude the independent evaluation that is required by section (b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also asserts that by directing that an appraising official prepare a written, independent evaluation addressing the performance standards for each critical and noncritical element, section (b)(1) directly interferes with management's right to assign work. The Agency further contends that this section directly interferes with its internal deliberative process under section 7106(a) of the Statute because it would prevent any discussions between the appraising and reviewing officials prior to the appraising official's preparation of the recommended appraisal or rating on each critical and non-critical element. We find, for the reasons expressed below, that section (b)(1) directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section (b)(1) of the proposal limits management's right, under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute, to evaluate employees by restricting management's internal deliberations concerning employees' appraisals. The Authority has consistently held that management's rights enumerated in section 7106 of the Statute encompass not only the right to act but also the right to discuss and deliberate concerning the relevant factors upon which decisions as to the exercise of those rights will be made. Specifically, proposals that limit management's deliberations concerning employee evaluations directly interfere with management's right to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the Union's statement of intent concerning Proposal 2, we find that section (b)(1) is intended to prevent any discussions between the appraising and reviewing officials prior to the appraising official's preparation of the "independent evaluation"; that is, the recommended appraisal or rating on each critical and non-critical element. Section (b)(1) would, in effect, prevent an appraising official from discussing the "independent evaluation" prepared pursuant to this section with the reviewing official prior to it being forwarded to that official. Therefore, section (b)(1) would directly interfere with the deliberative process associated with management's evaluation of employees pursuant to its rights to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's argument that section (b)(1) directly interferes with management's right to assign work because it requires the appraising official to prepare a written evaluation. The proposal would not dictate the particular individual to whom management would assign this responsibility. Rather, the proposal preserves management's right to designate the appraising official and would take effect pursuant to that designation. Moreover, because the appraisal of employees is a duty inherent in the responsibilities of an appraising official, the proposal does not add duties to the functions already performed by the appraising official.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's claim that the proposal is contrary to management's right to assign work because it would determine when an appraisal would be provided to an employee. Matters concerning the timing of performance appraisals constitute procedures under section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we have found that section (b)(1) directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute, we reject the Union's contention that the proposal constitutes a negotiable procedure under section 7106(b)(2).... [A] proposal that directly interferes with a management right does not constitute a negotiable procedure under section 7106(b)(2). Accordingly, we conclude that section (b)(1) does not constitute a negotiable procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that section (b)(1) constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. We find that the Union intends section (b)(1) of its proposal to constitute an arrangement for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its right to evaluate employees' job performances through its performance management system. More particularly, section (b)(1) is intended to ensure that employees, whose careers could be adversely affected depending on the evaluation they receive, will be evaluated objectively and fairly by Agency officials performing that function.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1092"></span>Having concluded that section (b)(1) is an arrangement, we now consider whether it is appropriate within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3). To determine whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of a management right, we weigh "the competing practical needs of employees and managers" to determine whether the benefit to employees afforded by the proposal outweighs the burden placed by the proposal on the exercise of the management right or rights involved....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, section (b)(1) is intended to ensure that employees will be evaluated objectively and fairly by Agency officials performing evaluations. According to the Union, under the current process, "various appraising officials tailor their assessments" of an employee's performance to that of the reviewing official. Section (b)(1) would prevent that result by ensuring that the appraising official, at least during this evaluation, would provide a written record of his or her own independent judgment of an employee's performance on each critical or noncritical element. This section would, therefore, ensure that an employee's performance will be objectively considered by managers and/or supervisors involved in the appraisal process. Therefore, we find that section (b)(1) affords a benefit to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, this section prevents the appraising official from discussing the evaluation prepared pursuant to this section prior to submission to the reviewing official. We find, however, that the negative impact on management's rights to direct employees and assign work caused by the requirements of section (b)(1) is minimal. In this regard, section (b)(1) only amplifies 5 C.F.R., Part 430 which already requires management to appraise an employee's performance under the Agency's performance management plan. Also, although this section prevents initial discussions between the appraising official and the reviewing official, it would not preclude management from discussing the appraising official's reindependent evaluation" with that official after receipt of the document and prior to any final action. Management would still be able to engage in internal deliberations and could, after doing so, reach a different assessment of the employee's performance. Thus, the burden imposed by section (b)(1) on management's rights to direct employees and assign work is minimal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that, on balance, the benefit to employees outweighs the burden placed on the Agency. Consequently, we find that section (b)(1) does not excessively interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work and is a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Option 1</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Option 1 is nonnegotiable because it is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(c), a Government-wide regulation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Option 1 requires an employee's appraising official to provide a copy of the independent evaluation, prepared pursuant to section (b)(1), including "specific performance standard ratings" on critical and noncritical elements, to the employee and to discuss this evaluation with the employee before forwarding it to the reviewing official. We must consider whether Option 1 is consistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(c), which, as noted above, provides that a "rating of record" may not be communicated to an employee until it has been approved by the reviewing official.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we discussed above, a rating of record under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(c) includes the ratings on each critical and noncritical element as well as an overall summary rating that is derived from the ratings on the individual elements. We find that the clear intent of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(c) is to preclude the disclosure to employees both of the ratings on each critical and noncritical element and the overall summary rating prior to the approval of the reviewing official. We note that disclosure of the ratings on individual elements would effectively constitute disclosure of an overall summary rating as well because the overall summary rating is derived from the ratings on the individual elements. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.204(g).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, if 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(c) were interpreted as allowing disclosure of ratings on individual elements, the portion of section 430.206(c) that permits "communication about appraisal of performance" before determination of the rating of record would be unnecessary. Clearly, that exception is intended to allow supervisors to discuss performance appraisals with employees without communicating specific ratings on critical or noncritical elements, or an overall summary rating, to those employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(c) is intended to preclude the disclosure of any part of the rating of record prior to approval by the reviewing official. Because disclosure of the independent evaluation to an employee prior to approval by the reviewing official would require the disclosure of specific ratings on individual critical or noncritical elements, and thus would disclose one component of the rating of record, we conclude that Option 1 is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(c), a Government-wide regulation, and nonnegotiable under section 7117(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we find that Option 1 is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(c), we need not address the Union's contention that Option 1 is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Section 7106(b)(3) does not make negotiable a matter that is inconsistent with a Government-wide regulation....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Option 2</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Option 2 would require that after a reviewing official has acted upon an appraising official's written "independent evaluation" and approved the ratings on the critical or noncritical elements and the summary rating, the Agency must provide an employee with copies of the appraisal documents prepared by the appraising and reviewing officials. We find that Option 2 is negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proper inquiry with respect to union proposals that require agencies to provide general information to employees is whether: (1) the information concerns conditions of employment of unit employees; and (2) disclosure of the information violates any law or applicable regulation. <span class="Italic">POPA</span>, 39 FLRA at 813. It cannot be contested that information concerning the evaluation of employees' work for the purpose of determining employees' performance ratings concerns conditions of employment. Further, we find nothing in 5 C.F.R. Part 430, in particular 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(c), that would preclude the release of appraisal documents prepared by the appraising and reviewing officials to the affected employee after an appraisal has been approved by the appropriate reviewing officials and a rating of record/summary rating conferred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the language of option 2 in no way restricts management in the exercise of its rights under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. Option 2 requires no specific individual to provide employees with copies of appraisal documents.... Unlike section (b)(1), Option 2 would not interfere with management's deliberative process. Moreover, we have held that the deliberative process associated with the exercise of management's section 7106 rights does not prohibit the disclosure of information relied on in exercising those rights or information that is the product of deliberations involving the exercise of those rights.... Option 2 would require the Agency to release the appraisal documents after the appropriate higher officials had acted on the appraisal and a rating of record had been determined. Accordingly, we find that option 2 would not directly interfere with management's rights under section 7106(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we conclude that Option 2 is negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit declined to enforce FLRA's bargaining order in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>. The court concluded that the proposals were not sufficiently tailored to remedy the adverse impact of management actions on individual employees to meet the test for an appropriate arrangement. [<span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 2 F.3d 1190 (D.C. Cir. 1993), is discussed in Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-13-057.html#sec5-58">Appropriate Arrangements</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-13-061.html#sec5-62">Tailoring the Proposal to Suit the Harm; Overbroad Proposals; Minerals Management</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 46 FLRA 696, 744-45 (1992), found FLRA in agreement that Provision 22 was negotiable, requiring supervisors to prepare narratives with examples of performance, to rate employees on observed or documented facts, and to rate each element separately. Negotiable in <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 10, 49 (1993), was Provision 18, requiring that "[w]henever a performance standard involves a time period for an action which requires the sequential cooperation of multiple employees, management shall document the separate contributions of each employee." The proposal did not require management, upon developing the information, to either modify standards or to use the information in the rating process.</p>
