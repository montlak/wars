<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA and NWSEO</span>, 67 FLRA 356, 358 (2014), said of the significance to FLRA of Comptroller decisions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that decisions of the Comptroller General are not binding on the Authority.[37] In that regard, "[a]lthough a Comptroller General opinion serves as an expert opinion that should be prudently considered," it is not one to which the Authority must defer.[38] Nevertheless, in cases where the parties and the arbitrator have examined Comptroller General precedent to address legal questions raised by a grievance, the Authority has assumed the applicability of that precedent when assessing contrary-to-law exceptions to the resulting arbitral award.[39] We follow this approach in assessing the Agency's exception regarding the award's consistency with &#x00A7; 6322.</p>

<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">DHS, CIS and AFGE Local 3928</span>, 73 FLRA 82, 84-85 (2022), involving an award of retroactive career ladder promotions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously stated that decisions of the Comptroller General are not binding on the Authority.[31] The Authority has noted that although a Comptroller General opinion serves as an expert opinion that should be prudently considered, it is not one to which the Authority must defer.[32] However, in cases where the parties and the arbitrator have examined Comptroller General precedent to address legal questions raised by a grievance, the Authority has assumed the applicability of that precedent when assessing contrary-to-law exceptions to the resulting arbitral award.[33] Here, the parties extensively cited Comptroller General precedent to the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator cited Comptroller General precedent and relied on Authority cases analyzing Comptroller General precedent, and the Agency and Union both cite Comptroller General precedent in the exceptions and opposition, respectively. Accordingly, we will examine and apply the relevant decisions of the Comptroller General in resolving the Agency's contrary-to-government-wide-regulation exception to the award.[35]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 250.101, when an agency takes a personnel action authorized by that chapter, it must comply with, among a number of things, the instructions OPM has published in the GPPA.[36] Section 250.101 also provides that an agency must follow the instructions in the GPPA when taking a personnel action resulting from, for example, a decision of the Authority or an arbitral award under a CBA.[37] As noted above, the GPPA states, as relevant here, that "no personnel action can be made effective prior to the date on which the appointing officer approved the action."[38] Although this is generally true, numerous Comptroller General decisions analyzing the legality of retroactive promotions make clear that this is the general rule <span class="Italic">in the absence of</span> any nondiscretionary agency regulation, policy, or CBA provision concerning promotions.[39] Countless Comptroller General decisions on this point have recognized that certain CBA provisions may constitute nondiscretionary agency policies, and that retroactive promotions may be appropriate when an agency's delay in promotion or failure to promote violates such a nondiscretionary CBA provision or agency policy.[40] Authority decisions concerning retroactive promotions have analyzed Comptroller General precedent on this point and have reached the same conclusion.[41]</p>

<p class="noindent">An interesting twist in the usual evolution of exceptions to arbitration awards occurred in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA and Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees Org</span>., 68 FLRA 976, 976-80 (2015) (recon. den., 69 FLRA 256 (2016)), when, after exceptions were filed, the agency requested a Comptroller General decision on the legality of expenditure of government funds on "disposable dining wear." The ensuing Comptroller General opinion was relied on by FLRA to set aside the arbitrator's award requiring the agency to adhere to an agreement to purchase the disposable cups, plates and utensils:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Arbitrator's Award </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance that went to arbitration, where the stipulated issues before the Arbitrator were, in relevant part: (1) whether the Agency violated the MOU when it stopped purchasing disposable dining ware; if so, then (2) whether the Agency's violation of the MOU was an "unfair labor practice" in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute; and, if so, then (3) "what shall the remedy be?"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At arbitration, the Agency argued that it "lawfully repudiated" the MOU because the MOU required the Agency to "expend funds for items [that] were of personal benefit to employees" in violation of appropriations law. Before the Arbitrator, both parties cited the "necessary[-]expense" doctrine, which provides that where an appropriation does not specifically provide for a particular item, its purchase may be authorized as a "necessary expense" if there is a "reasonable relationship between the object of the expenditure and the general purpose for which the funds were appropriated."[10]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">In re Use of Appropriated Funds to Purchase Kitchen Appliances</span>, B-302993, 2004 WL 1853469, at *2 (Comp. Gen. June 25, 2004) (<span class="Italic">Appliances</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under this doctrine, the Comptroller General "recognizes an agency's discretion in using its appropriation to fulfill its purposes," but "[i]f the primary beneficiary of an expenditure of public funds is the individual, <span id="page_1978"></span>not the agency or government, the well-established rule is that such expenditures are personal in nature and hence not an authorized use of appropriated funds." In this regard, the Agency argued that it could not lawfully spend appropriated funds to provide disposable dining ware because these items "can only be viewed as personal items" that benefit the employees as individuals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, the Union argued that the parties intended that the provision of disposable dining ware under the MOU would help avoid absenteeism and ensure continued operations of the Agency by preventing the spread of illness "from use of common dishware and utensils." Thus, the Union argued that the expenditure is lawful under the necessary-expense doctrine. Alternatively, the Union argued that the expenditure is authorized under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7901, which authorizes agencies to spend appropriated funds on health-service programs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her award, the Arbitrator discussed the Comptroller General decisions cited by the parties, including the statement in <span class="Italic">In re Use of Appropriated Funds to Purchase Kitchen Appliances</span> that the purchase of items arguably viewed as personal is permissible where "the primary benefit of the expenditure accrues to the agency[,] notwithstanding a collateral benefit to the individual." The Arbitrator discussed several ways in which the Agency benefited from employees' use of disposable dining ware. In particular, the Arbitrator found that because sharing utensils and plates might spread illness, the Agency could supply disposable dining ware "as a reasonable way to curb the spread of disease."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator concluded that the provision of disposable dining ware under the MOU was "of primary benefit to the Agency, not the employees," and that "the provision of [disposable dining ware] was necessary to the efficient operation of [the Agency's] offices and was not in contravention of appropriation laws." Accordingly, she rejected the Agency's argument that it could not lawfully comply with the MOU, and found that the Agency violated the MOU.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of her finding that the Agency could authorize the purchase of disposable dining ware under the necessary-expense doctrine, the Arbitrator found it unnecessary to address the Union's argument that the expenditures at issue were also authorized as part of a "health[-]service[&#8197;] program" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7901. However, she stated that "any reading of [&#x00A7; 7901] to include the provision of [disposable dining ware] as a 'program' appear[ed] to be rather strained."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Arbitrator examined whether the Agency's breach of the MOU constituted repudiation. The Agency defended its actions "on the basis that the [MOU] was illegal." But the Arbitrator rejected that argument, and found that the Agency's breach of the MOU constituted a repudiation in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a remedy, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to resume providing disposable dining ware.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency filed exceptions to the award, and the Union filed an opposition to the Agency's exceptions. The Agency also filed a request with the GAO for a formal opinion on "the legality of purchasing the disposable items in question."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Comptroller General Decisions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, the General Counsel of the GAO issued <span class="Italic">In re Department of Commerce--Disposable Cups, Plates, and Cutlery</span> (<span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span>),[26] in which she concluded that "appropriated funds are not available" to pay for disposable dining ware for Agency employees.[27] (As the Authority has referred to decisions by the General Counsel of the GAO as "Comptroller General" decisions in the past,[28] and there is no claim that this decision should be treated otherwise, we consider <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span> to be a decision of the Comptroller General.)</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span>, the Comptroller General reviewed the Arbitrator's award and the Agency's request for an opinion, and found insufficient "empirical evidence" to support the assertion that the purchase of disposable dining ware "would directly advance [the Agency's] statutory mission or that the benefit accruing to the government through the provision of such items outweighs the personal nature of the expense."[29] Rather, the Comptroller General stated that "[t]here can be no doubt that disposable [dining ware] are personal items, and that the benefit of their use (and thus the cost of acquiring them) inures to the individuals who use them."[30]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[30]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In particular, the Comptroller General considered--and rejected as unsupported--the Arbitrator's finding that the provision of disposable dining ware benefited the Agency by preventing the spread of illness. Specifically, the Comptroller General noted that neither the Agency's nor the Department of Health and Human Services' guidance on preventing the spread of influenza recommend the use of disposable dining ware to prevent the spread of disease. "Consequently," the Comptroller General stated that there was "no legal basis on which to conclude that [the Agency's] appropriations are available to provide free disposable [dining ware] to [Agency] employees."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency then filed a supplemental submission asking the Authority to defer to the Comptroller General's decision in <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span> and grant the Agency's exceptions. In response, the Union filed a motion asking the Authority to "give no weight or consideration" to <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Authority had an interest in determining whether <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span> represented the Comptroller General's "final determination" in the matter, the Authority issued an order asking the Union to clarify whether it had requested--or would be requesting--reconsideration of <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span>. In this regard, the Authority noted that "it would not be an efficient use of administrative resources for the Authority to continue to process [the Agency's] exceptions while the [Comptroller General] simultaneously engage[d] in an ongoing examination of [the] matter." The Union filed a response, with the Authority, stating that it had filed, with the GAO, a request for reconsideration of <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span>. And the Agency filed a response, with the Authority, stating that it had filed, with the GAO, a reply opposing the Union's request for reconsideration. Accordingly, the Authority placed the case in abeyance and ceased processing the Agency's exceptions pending resolution of the Union's request for reconsideration of <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, the Comptroller General denied the Union's request for reconsideration of <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span> (the denial). The Union filed, with the Authority, the denial. Consequently, the Authority took the case out of abeyance, and resumed processing of the Agency's exceptions to the Arbitrator's award.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The award is contrary to law. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that decisions of the Comptroller General are not binding on the Authority.[48] In that regard, "[a]lthough a Comptroller General opinion serves as an expert opinion that should be prudently considered," it is not one to which the Authority must defer.[49][50] Nevertheless, in cases where the parties and the arbitrator have examined Comptroller General precedent to address legal questions raised by a grievance, the Authority has assumed the applicability of that precedent when assessing contrary-to-law exceptions to the resulting arbitral award.[51]</p>

Member Pizzella notes that he would adopt instead the approach of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims which accords "persuasive weight" to decisions of the Comptroller General and GAO and recognize them as experts in matters concerning fiscal issues, appropriations law, and federal employee salary, benefits, and reimbursements. <span class="Italic">Hawaiian Dredging Constr.

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the parties cited Comptroller General precedent to the Arbitrator, who relied upon that precedent in her award. Similarly, in the Agency's exceptions to that award, and the Union's opposition to those exceptions, the parties both cite Comptroller General precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted previously, following the Comptroller General's issuance of <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span>, the Union argued, in a supplemental submission, that the Authority "should give no weight or consideration to" that decision. In particular, the Union emphasized that the Comptroller General decided <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span> based on only the documents that the Agency submitted to the GAO. However, subsequently, the Union filed a request for reconsideration of <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span> with the GAO, and the Comptroller General denied that request. Thus, <span id="page_1979"></span>both parties have now had an opportunity to make submissions to the Comptroller General--whose decisions both parties previously conceded should determine the legality of the expenditures at issue. Accordingly, consistent with our precedent, because "the parties and the [A]rbitrator have examined Comptroller General precedent to address legal questions raised by [the] grievance," we assume the applicability of Comptroller General decisions, generally--and <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span>, in particular--in resolving the Agency's contrary-to-law exceptions to the Arbitrator's award.[58]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[58]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NOAA</span>, 67 FLRA at 358.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, in <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span>, the Comptroller General found "no legal basis on which to conclude that [the Agency's] appropriations are available to provide free disposable [dining ware] to [Agency] employees."[59] In this regard, the Comptroller General found that disposable-dining-ware items "are personal items,"[60] and rejected the Arbitrator's conclusion that the benefits to the Agency from employees' use of disposable dining ware justified the expenditure under the necessary-expense doctrine.[61] Accordingly, because we have assumed the applicability of <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span>, the Arbitrator's conclusion that the necessary-expense doctrine authorized the expenses at issue is contrary to law.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In addition to arguing that the expenditures at issue are authorized under the necessary-expense doctrine, the Union argues that the Agency may use appropriated funds to purchase disposable dining ware as a "health[-]service program" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7901. Under &#x00A7; 7901, agencies may use appropriated funds to establish certain types of health-service programs to "promote and maintain the physical and mental fitness of employees."[64] In particular, the Union argues that the provision of disposable dining ware should be considered a "preventive program[&#8197;] relating to health" under &#x00A7; 7901(c)(4).[65] For support, the Union cites Comptroller General decisions authorizing the use of appropriated funds to pay for employees' "access to private health and fitness facilities" and routine influenza immunizations.[66] Thus, according to the Union, &#x00A7; 7901 provides "an additional or alternative basis upon which to affirm [the Arbitrator's] award."[67]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Because the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency could purchase disposable dining ware under the necessary-expense doctrine, she did not reach the Union's &#x00A7; 7901 argument. However, she stated that "any reading of [&#x00A7; 7901] to include the provision of [disposable dining ware] as a 'program' appear[ed] to be rather strained." Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Disposable Dining Ware</span>, the Comptroller General rejected the idea that the expenditure could be justified because disposable dining ware might prevent the spread of illness.[73] In that regard, the Comptroller General noted that neither the Agency's nor the Department of Health and Human Services' guidance on preventing the spread of influenza recommend the use of disposable dining ware to prevent the spread of disease.[74] Thus, although the Comptroller General did not address &#x00A7; 7901 specifically, the Comptroller General clearly rejected any rationale for the expenditure at issue that relied on the alleged health benefits to employees of using disposable dining ware. Accordingly, &#x00A7; 7901 provides no basis for upholding the award.</p>
