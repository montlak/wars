<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-15_1"><span class="space">h.</span> VA Employees' Appeals From Actions Under 38 USC 714</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The expedited system for processing appeals from actions taken against VA employees under 38 USC 714 becomes less expedited if the appellant starts out by challenging the action through the EEO process, that is, under takes a mixed-case approach to the appeal, ultimately requesting an MSPB hearing. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 7, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-25 (2022), considered the timing of the appeal and determined that mixed-case processing, with 30 days to file an appeal rather than the ten days allowed under &#x00A7; 714, was permissible under the statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency took the instant action under the VA Accountability Act, which was enacted on June 23, 2017, and which authorizes the agency to "remove, demote, or suspend" "covered individual[s]."[3] Pursuant to that Act, an employee may appeal to the Board a removal, demotion, or suspension of greater than 14 days, but such appeal "may only be made...not later than 10 business days after the date of" the action. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(4). Thus, pursuant to the plain language of the statute, because the agency effected the appellant's demotion on December 10, 2017, an appeal under section 714(c)(4) was due on or about December 22, 2017. The appellant's November 14, 2018 appeal appears to be nearly 11 months untimely filed under the time limit set forth at section 714(c)(4)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;A "covered individual" includes all individuals occupying positions at the agency, except for individuals who are in the Senior Executive Service, appointed under certain title 38 appointment authorities, still under a probationary or trial period, or political appointees. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(h)(1). The appellant occupies a position at the agency that does not fall under any of the exceptions to the above definition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 714, however, is silent as to the procedures and filing times for a Board appeal in which, as here, an appellant seeks review of a matter within the Board's appellate jurisdiction and also raises a claim of discrimination or retaliation in violation of EEO statutes, known as a mixed case. <span class="Italic">See Miranne v. Department of the Navy</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 235, &#x00B6; 8 <span id="Page_3330"></span>(2014) (explaining that a mixed case arises when an appellant has been subject to an action that is appealable to the Board, and he alleges that the action was effected, in whole or in part, because of discrimination). Congress extended title VII statutory protections to Federal employees with the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 (EEO Act), Pub. L. No. 92-261, &#x00A7; 717, 86 Stat. 103, 111-13 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16). The intent of the EEO Act was to eliminate discrimination from Federal employment. H.R. Rep. No. 92-238, at 2141 (1971), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2137, 2158-60.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's processing of mixed cases subsequently was addressed in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub. L. No. 95-454, title II, &#x00A7; 205, 92 Stat. 1111, 1140-43 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702) (1978). An appellant has two options when filing a mixed case: (1) he may initially file a mixed-case EEO complaint with his employing agency followed by an appeal to the Board; or (2) he may file a mixed-case appeal with the Board and raise his discrimination claims in connection with that appeal. <span class="Italic">Miranne</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 235, &#x00B6; 8. An employee may file either a mixed-case complaint or a mixed-case appeal, but not both, and whichever is filed first is deemed an election to proceed in that forum. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The CSRA provides, at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702, as relevant here, that an employee may file an EEO complaint in a mixed case, which an agency "shall resolve...within 120 days." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(2). If the agency fails to issue a final decision within 120 days, the employee's right to file a Board appeal vests and he may appeal to the Board "at any time" thereafter. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(2), (e)(2); <span class="Italic">Miranne</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 235, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">see</span> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1717, at 141 (1978), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2860, 2874 (stating that a "final agency action must occur within 120 days after" an employee files an EEO complaint and that, "[a]fter these 120 days, the employee may appeal to the Board" if the employing agency has not yet issued a final decision). The Board's regulations implementing the statute also reflect this rule, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.151(a)(1), .154(b)(2), as do the regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(d)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the CSRA, in mixed cases the Board "shall...decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures under section 7701 of [title 5]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). A Senate Report by the Governmental Affairs Committee stated that "[a]ny provision denying the Board jurisdiction to decide certain adverse action appeals because discrimination is raised as an issue would make it impossible for the Government to have a single unified personnel policy which took into account the requirements of all the various laws and goals governing Federal personnel management." S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 53 (1978), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2775. Thus, under the CSRA, when an employee elects to file an EEO complaint first, he retains his right to later Board review of the agency's adverse action and the discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn now to the impact of the newly enacted 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 on the processing of mixed cases under the CSRA. This case is not the first time that a tribunal has confronted how a newly enacted statute affects related laws that it does not reference. For example, in <span class="Italic">Morton v. Mancari,</span> 417 U.S. 535, 537-39, 545 (1974), the U.S. Supreme Court addressed the alleged inconsistency between a prior act providing an employment preference for qualifying Native Americans in the Bureau of Indian Affairs with the later enacted EEO Act requiring that Federal employment decisions be free from discrimination. The Court declined to find that the EEO Act repealed the preexisting statute by implication. <span class="Italic">Morton</span>, 417 U.S. at 549-50. Rather, in the absence of an affirmative showing of an intent by Congress to repeal the prior statute, it read the statutes as permitting the employment preference for Native Americans to continue along with the "general rule prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of race." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 550. In so finding, the Court observed that repeals by implication are disfavored. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 549-51. "When there are two acts upon the same subject, the rule is to give effect to both if possible." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 551 (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. Borden Company</span>, 308 U.S. 188, 198 (1939)). An intention by Congress to repeal a statute "must be clear and manifest." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Court concluded that, "when two statutes are capable of co-existence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 551; <span class="Italic">see Isabella v. Department of State</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 12 (2008) (same); <span class="Italic">see also Von Zemenszky v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 663, 668-69, 673-74 (1999) (holding that, if Congress had intended to exempt Veterans Health Administration (VHA) health-care professionals appointed under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(1) from the preexisting reduction in force rules of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 when it created the VHA, it would have done so in explicit terms).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court recognized factors that might lead to a repeal by implication, although it found them inapplicable in <span class="Italic">Morton</span>. 417 U.S. at 550-51. These included when the statutes at issue are "irreconcilable," or when the older statute is broader in scope than the newer, more specific statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Todd v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 55 F.3d 1574, 1577-78 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (stating that repeal by implication is appropriate only when statutes are irreconcilable or "the enactment so comprehensively covers the subject matter of the earlier statute that it must have been intended as a substitute"; a statute addressing a "narrow, precise, and specific subject is not submerged by a later enacted statute covering a more generalized spectrum"); <span class="Italic">Bergman v. Department of Transportation</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 6 (2006) (holding that specific statutory language aimed at a particular situation ordinarily controls over general statutory language). We find that neither situation is presented here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(4)(B) includes a 10-business-day time limit for filing a Board appeal that is specific to covered employees of the agency, it is nevertheless silent regarding the procedures and time limits applicable when such employees file mixed-case complaints of discrimination followed by appeals to the Board. Those procedures and time limits are addressed in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702. Thus, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 does not reveal a clear and manifest intent to repeal the time limits and procedures of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702. Moreover, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 is not the more specific statute when it comes to the time limits and procedures for filing appeals that include discrimination claims; rather, the relevant provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 are more specific. The above canon of statutory construction does not, therefore, indicate that the section 714 deadline controls in this case. <span class="Italic">See Morton</span>, 417 U.S. at 550-51 (declining to find that a specific statute was implicitly repealed by one of more general application).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion is supported by a recent order issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) in <span class="Italic">Gates v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, No. 2020-2187, slip op. (Fed. Cir. Feb. 2, 2021), addressing a similar issue. In <span class="Italic">Gates</span>, the court confronted the issue of whether the VA Accountability Act expanded its jurisdiction to include review of Board decisions in mixed-case appeals arising under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714. <span class="Italic">Gates</span>, No. 2020-2187, slip op. at 3-4 (interpreting 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(d)(5)(A)). Such cases previously fell within the province of the Federal district courts pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2). <span class="Italic">Gates</span>, slip op. at 3. The court concluded that the VA Accountability Act did not give it authority over mixed cases. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 4. The court reasoned, as relevant here, that if Congress intended such a significant change to the avenues of judicial review established by the CSRA, as codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703, "it presumably would have made such intention clear from the face of the text" of the VA Accountability Act. <span class="Italic">Gates</span>, slip op. at 4. We find the court's reasoning equally applicable here.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Board may rely on unpublished decisions of the Federal Circuit if it finds the court's reasoning persuasive, as we do here. <span class="Italic">Mauldin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 513, &#x00B6; 12 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find the statutes are reconcilable and capable of coexistence. If an appealable action is taken pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 against a "covered individual" who has not filed a formal complaint of discrimination with the agency, the 10-business-day time limit set forth at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(4)(B) would apply.[5] If, however, such an individual has first filed a formal discrimination complaint with the agency from such an action, and the agency has not issued a decision within 120 days, then the time limit set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(e)(2) applies to any subsequent Board appeal. Thus, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(4)(B) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(e)(2) are capable of coexistence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We do not address in this case which time limit would apply if a "covered individual" directly filed a Board appeal from an action taken pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 and alleged before the Board that the action was based on discrimination. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(4)(B) (setting forth a 10-business-day time limit), <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(a) (setting forth a 30-day time limit).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we decline to read 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 to stymie an employee's right to a hearing before the Board. Doing so would be inconsistent with the intent of the EEO Act and the CSRA to eliminate discrimination in Federal employment and ensure the Board's jurisdiction over mixed cases. The Board has held that, regardless of whether an employee elects to first file a mixed-case complaint with the agency or proceed directly to the Board, the employee's only right to an evidentiary hearing in such cases is before the Board, not the EEOC. <span class="Italic">Hess v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 40, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11, 18 (2016). Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701(a)(1) and 7702(a)(1), an appellant is entitled to a hearing in any appeal brought before the Board under any law, rule, or regulation, and to have the Board decide the merits of any claim of statutorily prohibited discrimination raised in such an appeal. <span class="Italic">Sabio v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 24 (2017); <span class="Italic">see</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 53, <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2775. Thus, the Board cannot decide a cognizable discrimination claim without first holding an appellant's requested hearing. <span class="Italic">Hess v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 4, 9-10 (2016).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no indication that Congress intended, through enacting the filing deadline set forth at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(4)(B), to effectively eliminate the right to an evidentiary hearing for agency employees who choose to first file a formal complaint of discrimination with the agency before coming to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Wassenaar v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 21 F.3d 1090, 1092 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (observing that "statutes must be construed <span id="Page_3331"></span>in light of their purpose. A reading of them which would lead to absurd results is to be avoided when they can be given a reasonable application consistent with their words and legislative purpose" (citations omitted)). Rather, the VA Accountability Act reflects the continued importance of the right to a hearing before the Board. Section 714(c)(4)(A) of title 38 requires to Board to "refer" an appeal filed under the VA Accountability Act "to an administrative judge pursuant to section 7701(b)(1) of title 5." The assigned administrative judge must then "expedite any such appeal under section 7701(b)(1) of title 5." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(d)(1). Thus, the procedures of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(1), as "expedited," apply to the administrative judge's adjudication of an appeal filed under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714. Section 7701(b)(1) cross references, as one such procedure, an appellant's "right to a hearing for which a transcript will be kept." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1), (b)(1); <span class="Italic">see Crispin v. Department of Commerce</span>, 732 F.2d 919, 922 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (interpreting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1) as preventing the Board from issuing summary judgment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the legislative history of the VA Accountability Act does not specifically address the issue of the right to file a formal complaint of discrimination with the agency followed by a mixed-case appeal to the Board, there is some support for finding that section 714(c)(4)(A) was not intended to eliminate preexisting employee rights in general. For example, the legislative history reveals that Senator Tester said of the bill that later resulted in the VA Accountability Act that it "does not trample on workers' rights," but "keeps all the existing due process protections under current law." 163 Cong. Rec. S3261-01, S3268 (daily ed. June 6, 2017) (statement of Sen. Tester); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 163 Cong. Rec. H4867-07, H4868 (daily ed. June 13, 2017) (statement of Rep. Buck that the legislation was needed "not because all the employees at the [agency] have problems," but rather because "there are bad apples," and that "[t]he bill also bolsters protection for whistleblowers"); 163 Cong. Rec. H4863-02, H4864 (daily ed. June 13, 2017) (statement of Rep. Roby that a prior law "didn't go far enough to protect whistleblowers" and "most [agency] employees care a great deal about veterans and work very hard to provide the best service"). Such an intent to retain the existing protections for employees is consistent with the more limited stated purpose of the VA Accountability Act, which is to "improve the accountability of employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs," Pub. L. No. 115-41, 131 Stat. 862, not to change the established processes for filing mixed-case complaints and appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The silence of the VA Accountability Act as to mixed-case complaints and appeals is in stark contrast to the language set forth therein pertaining to grievances. If an employee elects to grieve an action through a collective bargaining agreement, the "timeliness and procedures," including the 10-day time limit, under subsection (c) nonetheless "shall apply." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(d)(10). There is, however, no comparable provision for employees who file a mixed-case complaint followed by a Board appeal, thereby suggesting that Congress did not intend to alter the time limits for mixed-case appeals set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702. <span class="Italic">See Graves v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 13 (2016) (under the <span class="Italic">maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius</span> ("the expression of one thing is the exclusion of the other"), it should not be assumed that other things that could have been listed in a statute were meant to be included; rather, the specific mention of certain things implies the exclusion of other things).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion is further supported by the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702. "Notwithstanding any other provision of law," such as the VA Accountability Act, in the case of an employee who has been affected by an action that the employee may appeal to the Board and who alleges that a basis for the action was certain prohibited discrimination, the Board "shall...decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action."[6] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). This "notwithstanding" language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 signals an intent to override conflicting provisions and to supersede other laws. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of the Army</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 638, &#x00B6; 6 (2008); <span class="Italic">see also Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group</span>, 508 U.S. 10, 18 (1993) (noting that "notwithstanding" statutory language generally overrides "all other laws," and that "[a] clearer statement is difficult to imagine" (citations omitted)); <span class="Italic">Coster v. United States</span>, 485 F.2d 649, 651-52 (Ct. Cl. 1973) (recognizing that "language such as ‘notwithstanding the provisions of this or any other law' covers the waterfront regarding the operational scope of the statute"). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(e)(2), if, after the 120th day following the filing of a mixed-case complaint with an agency, there is no final agency decision, the employee may appeal the matter to the Board under section 7702(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The relevant statutory language provides more specifically that, "[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, and except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection," the Board shall decide the issue of discrimination and the appealable action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). Section 7702(a)(2), in turn, provides that an affected employee may first bring those same matters before an agency, as occurred in this case, which shall resolve the matter within 120 days. The decision of the agency shall be judicially reviewable unless the employee appeals the matter to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), which the appellant did in this case. Thus, because subsection 7702(a)(2) contemplates a possible Board appeal of an agency decision under subsection 7702(a)(1), we find that the "and except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection" language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) does not negate the "notwithstanding" clause of that subsection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant timely filed his appeal pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(e)(2), which was not foreclosed by the time limit set forth at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(4)(B). Having found that the applicable laws provide for this appeal to the Board following the filing of a mixed-case complaint, even when the action is taken under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714, we further find that election of remedy principles also apply under these circumstances. As previously indicated, when an appellant has been subjected to an action that is appealable to the Board and alleges that the action was effected in whole or in part because of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or age, he may initially file a direct Board appeal or an EEO complaint with his agency, but not both, and whichever is filed first is deemed to be an election to proceed in that forum. <span class="Italic">Dowell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 250, &#x00B6; 6 (2010); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a); <span class="Italic">see also Lang v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 219 F.3d 1345, 1347-48 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (concluding that a removed Federal employee timely filed a mixed-case appeal with the Board after 120 days had passed without a final agency decision on his formal EEO complaint, even though he improperly received an EEOC hearing on the same complaint). The appellant timely filed his formal EEO complaint regarding his proposed removal on or about September 21, 2017, timely amended the complaint to include his reduction in grade on November 30, 2017, and filed his Board appeal challenging that action on November 14, 2018. Thus, he elected to first proceed through the agency's EEO process before filing a Board appeal, and the procedures and time limits of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(e)(2), 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(2), and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(d), which we have found have been satisfied by the appellant, apply in this case.</p>
