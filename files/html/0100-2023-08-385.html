<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-377"><span class="space">b.</span> Mootness; Review of Agency-Initiated Reconstruction Effort</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">After the appellant files a complaint with the Labor Department and later initiates a Board appeal, the agency may recognize an error applying veterans preference and reconstruct the appointment process without awaiting a Board order. Should the appellant be dissatisfied with his subsequent nonselection, the appeal remains viable; the AJ must consider objections by the appellant to the reconstruction process. <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. DOD</span>, 113 MSPR 376, 378-82 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4, 8-14, 2010 MSPB 47 (2010) (USERRA challenged discussed in <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. DOD,</span> CH-4324-08-0709-B-1 (NP 4/29/2011), in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-315.html#sec1-308">Failure <span id="Page_743"></span>to Consider Employee for Vacant Positions; Manipulation or Abolition of Positions</a>"), provides an example of incorrect dismissal of an appeal as moot based on the AJ's view that it was unnecessary to review the substance of the reconstruction process that the agency undertook on its own following the initiation of the Board appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a preference eligible with a 30% service-connected disability, applied under Vacancy Announcement NS-0091-07 for the position of Supervisory Accountant with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). On June 20, 2007, DFAS notified the appellant that his application was not referred to the selecting official. The appellant contacted DFAS, asserting that his rights as a veteran had been violated. On July 7, 2007, the appellant filed a complaint with the Department of Labor (DOL), claiming that DFAS violated his veterans' preference rights. On September 20, 2007, DFAS advised the appellant that, because he is a 30% disabled veteran, it made an administrative error by failing to refer his application and that he would be given priority consideration for a similar job posting. He was not selected for the similar position. On December 11, 2007, DOL concluded that DFAS violated the appellant's rights by failing to refer him to the selecting official, and it indicated that the appropriate remedy for the violation was to reconstruct the selection process. When DFAS did not reconstruct the selection process, DOL notified the appellant on January 18, 2008, that it was closing its investigation and was unable to resolve his complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a timely appeal with the Board. In April 2008, while the appeal was pending, DFAS reconstructed the selection process, adding the appellant's name (as a 30% disabled veteran) to the list of candidates referred to the selecting official. As she had done before, the selecting official referred the list to a panel that rated and scored the candidates. Based on the scores assigned to each candidate, the panel determined that the appellant would not have been on the list of eight candidates that the panel originally recommended to the selecting official. The selecting official confirmed her original selection for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge (AJ) dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. He recognized that, under VEOA, if an agency action is not directly appealable to the Board, the appellant must first show that he exhausted his remedy with DOL before he files an appeal with the Board. The AJ found that the appellant's DOL complaint was based on DFAS's failure to refer his application to the selecting official and that while his appeal was pending DFAS reconstructed the selection process. He thus found that the basis of the appeal was rendered moot and that, because the Board never ordered DFAS to reconstruct the selection process, the Board did not have the authority to review whether the selection process was properly reconstructed. He further found that the refiled appeal concerned whether the agency violated a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference in the manner in which it conducted the reconstructed selection process, but that the appellant failed to file a complaint with DOL alleging that DFAS committed such a violation when it reconstructed the hiring process. Therefore, the AJ found that the appellant had not exhausted his remedy with DOL with respect to this allegation and that accordingly the Board lacked jurisdiction over his appeal with regard to DFAS's alleged violation of a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference during the reconstructed selection process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant is a preference eligible veteran with a 30% service-connected disability who is covered by section 3304(f), and that the nonselection at issue took place after December 10, 2004. We further find that the appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations that the agency violated the appellant's right to compete for the Supervisory Accountant position under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) by failing to consider him for that position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that allegations of a VEOA violation should be liberally construed. <span class="Italic">See Weed v. Social Security Administration,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 323, &#x00B6; 12 (2009). In cases of nonselection under VEOA, the Board typically determines whether an appellant has exhausted his remedy with DOL based on whether the appellant submitted a complaint to DOL asserting that the agency violated his rights in connection with a specific position or vacancy announcement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Roesel v. Peace Corps,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 366, &#x00B6; 16 (2009); <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 16 (2008); <span class="Italic">Heckman v. Department of the Interior,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 133, &#x00B6; 8 (2008), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Garcia v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 371 (2009). Because Board precedent requires that VEOA allegations be broadly construed and because the appellant filed a complaint with DOL essentially alleging that the agency violated his right to compete in connection with Vacancy Announcement NS-0091-07, we find that the appellant has exhausted his remedy with DOL. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Weed,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 323, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Heckman,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 133, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ, however, found that the appeal was rendered moot because the agency reconstructed the selection process and referred the appellant's application to the selecting official while his Board appeal was pending. The AJ also found that, because the Board never entered an order directing the agency to reconstruct the selection process, the Board did not have jurisdiction to review whether the agency properly reconstructed the selection process. On review, the appellant asserts that the agency agreed to reconstruct the selection process while his appeal was pending only to avoid an order instructing it to do so. He further asserts that he is entitled to a lawful reconstruction and that his original appeal remains unresolved until then. He argues that the reconstructed selection process was a "sham" and that an agency official admitted that the agency did not reconstruct the whole process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The mootness doctrine, which stems from the "case or controversy" requirement of Article III of the Constitution, is jurisdictional in nature. <span class="Italic">See Nasatka v. Delta Scientific Corp.,</span> 58 F.3d 1578, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Although the Board is not an Article III court, it is governed by an analogous statutory provision that prohibits it from issuing advisory opinions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h). A case is moot when the issues presented are no longer "live" or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the case. <span class="Italic">Powell v. McCormack,</span> 395 U.S. 486, 496 (1969); <span class="Italic">Horner v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 815 F.2d 668, 670-71 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">see Occhipinti v. Department of Justice,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 504, 507 (1994). Mootness can arise at any stage of litigation, and an appeal will be dismissed as moot when, by virtue of an intervening event, the Board cannot grant any effectual relief whatever in favor of the appellant, viz., when the appellant, by whatever means, obtained all of the relief he could have obtained had he prevailed before the Board, and thereby lost any legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Calderon v. Moore,</span> 518 U.S. 149, 150 (1996); <span class="Italic">Perisho v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 55, 58 (1995); <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Department of Justice,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 439, 441 (1995); <span class="Italic">see also Gingery,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Put another way, once Board jurisdiction has attached, it cannot be extinguished based on mootness unless the appellant has received all of the possible relief he sought before the Board, i.e., unless it is impossible for the Board to grant any further effectual relief. <span class="Italic">See Nasatka,</span> 58 F.3d at 1580; <span class="Italic">see also Dalton v. Department of Justice,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 429, 434 (1995). The available remedy need not be "fully satisfactory" to avoid mootness: a partial remedy is sufficient. <span class="Italic">Calderon,</span> 518 U.S. at 150. Thus, the availability of even a partial remedy is sufficient to prevent a case from being moot. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gingery,</span> the Board held that DOL's resolution of the appellant's complaint, based on the agency's agreement to provide him with a tentative employment offer if he passed a Telephone Assessment Program test, did not provide the appellant with all the relief that he could have received if his VEOA appeal had been adjudicated and he had prevailed before the Board. <span class="Italic">Gingery,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6, 17. It indicated that, under <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Army,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 18 (2006), the proper remedy under the VEOA for violation of the appellant's rights is the reconstruction of the selection process for the position consistent with law. <span class="Italic">See Gingery,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 17. The AJ therefore erred in finding, without addressing the appellant's arguments regarding the accuracy of the reconstructed selection process, that the appellant's claim that the agency violated his rights had been rendered moot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Board has held that its jurisdiction is determined by the nature of an agency's action against a particular appellant at the time an appeal is filed with the Board. <span class="Italic">See Himmel v. Department of Justice,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 484, 486 (1981). An agency's unilateral modification of its adverse action after an appeal has been filed cannot divest the Board of jurisdiction unless the appellant consents to such divestiture, or unless the agency completely rescinds the action being appealed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, at the time the appellant filed his appeal, he made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency violated a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference by denying his right to compete when it failed to submit his application to the selecting official. As we discussed above, the Board clearly had jurisdiction over this appeal at the time it was filed. Accordingly, our finding that the AJ should have determined whether the appellant received all the relief he would have been provided if the Board had adjudicated his VEOA appeal and he had prevailed is consistent with the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Himmel</span> that jurisdiction is determined by the nature of the agency's action at the time an appeal is filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mr. Wheeler did not request a hearing. The Board had enough evidence to show that he would not have been selected were the reconstruction process properly evaluated by the AJ. The Board dismissed the case as moot. The appellant obtained through the agency's reconstruction process all the relief he could obtain on his VEOA claim. <span class="Italic">Wheeler, supra,</span> 113 MSPR at 384 &#x00B6; 18.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mosley v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> CH-3330-10-0783-I-1 (NP 4/1/2011), following <span class="Italic">Wheeler</span>, although with a different result, remanded an appeal when AJ dismissed the case as moot based on the agency's promise to reconstruct the action; the record was insufficient to determine the proper result:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant was entitled to veterans' preference, had exhausted his remedy before the Department of Labor, and had therefore established jurisdiction <span id="Page_744"></span>over his appeal. The administrative judge noted that the proper remedy for the violation of veterans' preference rights at issue is reconstruction of the selection process. Because the agency had agreed to do so, the administrative judge determined that the appellant had received all the relief that he could have obtained before the Board and therefore dismissed the appeal as moot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once Board jurisdiction has attached, as it has in the instant matter, it cannot be extinguished based on mootness unless the appellant has received all the possible relief he sought before the Board. <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. Department of Defense</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 376, &#x00B6; 12 (2010). The agency's assertion that it would reconstruct the selection process did not provide the appellant with all the relief that he could have received if his VEOA appeal had been adjudicated and he had prevailed before the Board. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, &#x00B6; 13 (citing <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6, 17 (2008)). In <span class="Italic">Wheeler</span>, the Board found that the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appeal as moot without addressing the appellant's arguments regarding the accuracy of the reconstructed selection process. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency had not completed its reconstruction of the selection process when the administrative judge dismissed this appeal as moot, the administrative judge implied that the appellant would not likely be selected. However, regardless of the appellant's likelihood of success, the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appeal as moot before the agency completed the reconstructed selection process and without addressing the appellant's arguments regarding that process. <span class="Italic">See Wheeler</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 376, &#x00B6; 13. Further, the appellant in the instant matter requested a hearing and the record is insufficient to address the appellant's claims regarding the selection process. Accordingly, we DENY the appellant's petition for review, REOPEN the appeal on our own motion under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118, VACATE the initial decision, and REMAND the appeal for consideration on the merits.</p>

Accordingly, it is impossible for the Board to grant any further effectual relief as to vacancy announcement STL-T38H-13-911450. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nasatka</span>, 58 F.3d at 1580; <span class="Italic">Wheeler v.

The appeal is therefore moot.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency makes a selection process error constituting a VEOA violation but no selection is ultimately made, the Board denies the request for corrective action for lack of an available remedy. <span class="Italic">Kopec v.
