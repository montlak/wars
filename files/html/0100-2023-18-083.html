<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-84"><span class="space">1.</span> Proof of Harm; Failure to Consider a Reply; Due Process</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sweeney v. Dept. of Transp</span>., DC-0752-15-0060-I-1 (NP 9/23/2016), provides a definition of due process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Due process is a fundamental principle of law that ensures that legal proceedings will be fair and that citizens will be given notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard before the Government deprives them of life, liberty, or property. The U.S. Constitution guarantees due process and applies to the property interest of public employment in which the Government has demonstrated that there is cause to remove or suspend an employee. <span class="Italic">See Gilbert v. Homar</span>, 520 U.S. 924, 935-36 (1997) (suspension); <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 541 (1985) (removal)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Through 2012, if there was an error in the reply process, the Board tended to apply a harmful error standard, requiring the appellant to prove the negative impact of the error. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Gilmartin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 27 MSPR 568, 569 n.* (1985), suggested that under the Reform Act's harmful error standard, the denial of an oral reply will not suffice to reverse an adverse action if the appellant submits a written reply and fails to show harm resulting from the denial of the oral response. Then, in <span class="Italic">Alford v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ALFORD_LEROY_DC_0752_09_0770_I_4_OPINION_AND_ORDER_757739.pdf">118 MSPR 556</a>, 559-60 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7, 2012 MSPB 110 (2012), the Board placed agency errors that deprive the appellant of a reply opportunity into the realm of a constitutional due process, with the effect of reversing the agency action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The February 20, 2009 proposal notice afforded the appellant 15 calendar days in which to respond, in writing, in person, or both. The appellant requested an extension of the time period in which to respond, which the agency granted. The appellant submitted both a written and an oral response. On June 26, 2009, the agency issued an "Update: Notice of Proposed Removal." The agency indicated that the deciding official was reviewing additional materials relating to the proposed removal before rendering a final decision, specifically, a complete set of documents identified as Agency Hearing Exhibits Volumes I-III in another of the appellant's appeals, and a memorandum for the record drafted by the individual who rated the appellant's performance "Unacceptable," which was attached for the appellant's review. In the June 26, 2009 proposal, the agency afforded the appellant 2 weeks from the date he received it in which to provide a written reply and to request an oral reply relative to the additional materials, and it advised him to direct any questions, an amended written reply, or a request for an oral reply to Anita Willis, Human Resources Specialist. The appellant, who was on administrative leave, received the updated proposal notice by Federal Express on Monday, June 29, 2009. Exactly 2 weeks later, on Monday, July 13, 2009, he sent a letter requesting an oral reply by certified mail correctly addressed to Ms. Willis at the address provided by the agency in the June 26, 2009 updated proposal notice. According to documentation from the U.S. Postal Service provided by the appellant, the letter was delivered on Friday, July 17, 2009, but Ms. Willis did not sign for it until the following Monday, July 20, 2009. By this time, the agency had already issued its July 15, 2009 decision letter removing the appellant from his position effective that day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Due process under the Constitution requires that a tenured federal employee be provided "written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story." <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). The Court has described "the root requirement" of the Due Process Clause as being "that an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing <span class="Italic">before</span> he is deprived of any significant property interest." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 542 (emphasis in original). This requires a "meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of the decisionmaker" before the personnel action is effected. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 543.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In rejecting the appellant's due process claim, the administrative judge found that it was "through no fault of the agency" that the appellant's request for a supplemental oral reply was received after the decision letter was issued. The record, however, shows otherwise. As noted above, the June 26, 2009 updated proposal notice afforded the appellant 2 weeks from his receipt of the letter in which to file a written response and/or request an oral reply. By providing the address to which the response and/or request should be sent, the agency indicated that the appellant could do either by mail and that, if he chose to do so, the timeliness of his response would be measured from the date he deposited his response in the mails. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, No. 2011-3162, 2012 WL 2337347, at *2-3 (Fed. Cir. June 20, 2012). Based on the date the appellant received the letter, June 29, 2009, and the date he mailed his request for an oral reply, July 13, 2009, the request he submitted was timely under the agency's own terms, and the agency was obligated to wait a reasonable time for its delivery. By failing to do so, the deciding official issued a decision without allowing the appellant to make an oral reply to the agency's updated proposal notice, thereby violating his right to minimum due process. Accordingly, the agency's action must be reversed.[4] <span class="Italic">Blank v. Department of the Army,</span> 247 F.3d 1225, 1228 (Fed.

The removal decision was issued a few days later without the reply having been scheduled:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency proposed the appellant's removal on January 10, 2012. The agency gave her 14 days in which to respond. The appellant, who was represented by her union, sought and received a 14-day extension ending February 7, 2012. The human resources specialist assisting the deciding official notified the union representative, instructing him to "[please ensure you are on [the deciding official's] calendar NLT COB <span id="Page_3230"></span>on 7Feb12." On February 3, 2012, the appellant informed the deciding official that she would be represented by a private attorney, Lance Miller, Esq. On February 7, 2012, Miller emailed the deciding official. He asked for a member of the deciding official's staff to contact him to schedule an oral reply. The deciding official did not do so, and instead, on February 21, 2012, issued a decision sustaining the charge and removing the appellant. As the appellant had not submitted a written reply, the deciding official did not consider any response from her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found no violation of the appellant's right to due process. The administrative judge explained that the agency "afforded the appellant with numerous opportunities to respond to the charges," but she did not do so, and that the agency did not owe her another extension of time in which to respond, when on February 7, 2012, Miller presented his letter of representation and asked to schedule an oral reply. The administrative judge found the appellant's reliance on <span class="Italic">Alford v. Department of Defense</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 556 (2013), to be misplaced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not agree with the administrative judge's conclusion, and although the circumstances are not identical, we find that <span class="Italic">Alford</span> nonetheless applies. In <span class="Italic">Alford</span>, the agency notified the appellant that the deciding official intended to rely on new materials beyond those cited in the proposal notice. <span class="Italic">Alford</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 556, &#x00B6; 5. The agency afforded the appellant 2 weeks from the date he received the proposal notice in which to provide a written reply and to schedule an oral reply regarding the new materials. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Exactly two weeks after receiving the notice, the appellant sent a letter requesting an oral reply. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Two days after he mailed the letter, and before it was received, the agency issued the decision letter. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The administrative judge found that it was "through no fault of the agency" that the appellant's request for a supplemental oral reply reached the agency after the decision letter had been issued. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 7. The Board rejected such reasoning, explaining that "the June 26, 2009 updated proposal notice afforded the appellant 2 weeks from his receipt of the letter in which to file a written response and/or request an oral reply" and "the timeliness of his response would be measured from the date he deposited his response in the mails." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. By failing to wait for (and thus consider) a response that was timely by the agency's own terms, the agency violated the appellant's right to minimum due process. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the circumstances here are different because the appellant had already received an extension of time in which to file. We find, however, that the appellant and her representative reasonably surmised from the circumstances that she could request an oral reply by February 7, 2012. We start, as the Board did in <span class="Italic">Alford</span>, with the representations made in the agency's notice of proposed removal and find that it allowed the appellant to request an oral reply until the final day of the original response period. <span class="Italic">See Alford</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 556, &#x00B6; 7. Additionally, the appellant could request until the final day of the original response period an extension of the time in which to respond. The proposal notice states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Should you decide to respond, your written response, <span class="Italic">or request to provide an oral response</span> must be received by the agency within 14 calendar days of your receipt of this notice. If more time is required for you to formulate your response, you may request an extension of this deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). When the appellant's union representative requested an extension, the human resources specialist assisting the deciding official responded that, for purposes of offering an oral response, the representative should "ensure you are on [the deciding official's] calendar NLT COB on 7Feb12." An instruction to be "on [the deciding official's] calendar" by February 7, 2012, implies that February 7 was the new deadline for filing a written response <span class="Italic">or for requesting an oral reply</span>. If, as the agency now argues, February 7 was the deadline for <span class="Italic">completing</span> an oral reply, the agency should have so stated explicitly when issuing the extension. Without an explicit statement of the agency's expectations, the appellant and her representative reasonably concluded that the terms set forth in the proposal notice--the appellant had to submit a written response or request an oral response within 14 days of the notice--applied to the extension period. The agency's current assertion that the terms for the extension period differed from those of the original response period, is not convincing, especially in light of the following.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the agency initially asserted that the appellant's response was untimely in part because the deciding official did not read Miller's email until February 8, 2012. The agency later retracted that claim. The agency's argument then shifted to defining the human resources specialist's intent when she instructed the union representative to be "on the calendar" by February 7, 2012. Second, the human resources specialist's actions, as reflected in the email record, suggest that the agency itself was uncertain as to whether February 7 was the deadline for offering an oral response, or for scheduling one. Some of her actions, moreover, may have even prevented the scheduling of the appellant's oral reply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a representation form on February 3, 2012. Miller asked to schedule an oral response at 3:15 <span class="small">P.M</span>. on February 7, 2012. Yet, the human resources specialist waited until 4:57 <span class="small">P.M</span>. that day to ask the union if the appellant had been "released" from exclusive representation. The union's executive vice president responded at 8:08 <span class="small">A.M</span>. on February 8, 2012, and explained that the appellant "was entitled to a representative of her choice," and the union was not required to release her. At 12:34 <span class="small">P.M</span>. that day, the human resources specialist again emailed the union, asserting that the appellant lacked the right of representation by counsel until the agency issued a final decision. At 12:54 <span class="small">P.M</span>., the union's executive vice president replied and reasserted that the union did not need to release the appellant from representation. Meanwhile, at 12:49 <span class="small">P.M</span>., the human resources specialist warned the deciding official not to contact Miller because such contact before the union released the appellant might create "drama." After receiving the union's second email disavowing a requirement to release the appellant, the human resources specialist inaccurately told another agency official that the union "didn't release [the appellant] to obtain outside representation until the day after the extension to her reply had already expired." Even though the appellant's representative waited until the afternoon of February 7, 2012, to request an oral reply, the agency knew that the appellant had retained outside counsel on February 3, 2012. The human resources specialist's failure to contact the union until close of business on February 7, 2012, and her failure to believe the union's initial response, created the delays that the agency claims barred the appellant from offering an oral reply. Because we find that the agency violated the appellant's due process rights, she "is entitled to a new constitutionally correct removal procedure." <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999). We thus reverse the removal action. <span class="Italic">See Alford</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 556, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Flowers v. VA</span>, NY-0752-16-0288-I-1 (NP 1/31/2023) (Member Leavitt dissenting) (removal reversed when the agency knew appellant wanted to present a reply, rescinded and reissued the removal proposal and then issued a decision without providing for the reply; <span class="Italic">citing Schibik v. VA</span>, 98 MSPR 591, &#x00B6; 10 (2005)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The analysis and result differed when the appellant was unable to deliver an oral reply but could have mailed a written reply, <span class="Italic">Strickland v. Dept. of Navy,</span> AT-0752-13-7164-I-1 (NP 5/20/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that he was denied constitutional due process because he was at sea when he received the notice of proposed furlough and was told his written response had to be mailed or hand-delivered and his oral response had to be delivered in person, neither of which was possible. An agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives him of his property right in his employment constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant received the notice of proposed furlough on June 4, 2013, as indicated by his signature and acknowledgement on the proposal notice. The proposal notice informed him that he had 7 days from receipt of the letter to respond orally and/or in writing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. While the appellant may not have been able to respond in person, he has offered no evidence in support of his contention that he could not submit a written response, nor has he provided any evidence indicating that he made a reasonable effort to respond. Accordingly, under the circumstances in this case, we find that the appellant has not established that the agency violated his constitutional due process rights. <span class="Italic">See Kinsey v. Department of the Navy</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 226, 229 (1993) (where an agency has provided an employee with an opportunity to make a written reply to a notice of proposed adverse action, its failure to afford him an opportunity to make an oral reply does not violate his right to minimum due process); <span class="Italic">see also Flores v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 11 (2014) (in the absence of any indication that the appellant made a reasonable effort to assert his opportunity to respond, or that the agency denied him his right to respond through action, negligence, or design, the appellant was not denied due process).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency's conduct did not constitute a constitutional violation, we still must decide whether the agency committed a harmful procedural error. <span class="Italic">See, e</span>.<span class="Italic">g</span>., <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1281-83 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A), the Board will not sustain an agency decision if the appellant "shows harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at such decision." A procedural error is harmful where the record shows that the error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have <span id="Page_3231"></span>reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Pumphrey v. Department of Defense</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 186, &#x00B6; 10 (2015); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3). To the extent the agency did send the appellant the proposal notice while he was at sea, the record does not support a finding that the agency committed a procedural error in doing so. Further, even assuming that the agency's actions did constitute procedural error, the appellant has failed to demonstrate that any such error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">See Pumphrey</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 186, &#x00B6; 10. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has failed to meet his burden of proving harmful error. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (the appellant bears the burden of proving harm).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant failed to convince the Board of constitutional due process denial or harmful error when he was denied an oral reply but submitted a written reply in <span class="Italic">Maroney v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-15-0594-I-2 (NP 8/4/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the agency violated the appellant's due process rights and that he was therefore entitled to a new removal proceeding, the administrative judge cited and based her decision on the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985), and two Board cases, <span class="Italic">Massey v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 226, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2013), and <span class="Italic">Alford v. Department of Defense</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 556, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2012), both of which relied on <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> to reverse employees' removals when they were denied the right to reply to the deciding official regarding the actions proposed against them. The administrative judge stated that an employee cannot be said to have had a meaningful opportunity to present his side of the story and invoke the deciding official's discretion if the deciding official did not hear the appellant's oral reply to the proposal notice. The administrative judge found that, in the appellant's written reply to the notice of proposed removal, he requested the opportunity to reply orally and that, because the agency failed to afford him an oral reply, it therefore violated his due process rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the agency argues that the appellant, in fact, received all the due process to which he was entitled under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and that the Board cases upon which the administrative judge relied to reverse the agency's action do not support a contrary conclusion. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, the Supreme Court clarified that, if a tenured public employee is entitled to a full post-decisional hearing, such as a hearing before the Board, a pre-decisional trial-type hearing is not required and fundamental due process requirements under the Constitution are satisfied if the employee has a pre-decisional opportunity to present, either in person or in writing, reasons why the proposed action should not be taken. <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 546. In other words, the employee is entitled to notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, "and an opportunity to present his side of the story." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the appellant submitted a substantive written reply to the proposal notice in which he explained why he believed the agency's action was unwarranted and included a number of positions he felt he could perform, despite his physical limitations. Moreover, the deciding official considered all facets of the appellant's written response. The appellant not only had the opportunity to, but in fact did, in his written reply, "present his side of the story" regarding the agency's allegations in support of his removal. <span class="Italic">White v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 405, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-20 (2013); <span class="Italic">Spentzakis v. Department of the Army</span>, MSPB Docket No. DE-0752-12-0126-I-1, Final Order at 4 (Nov. 20, 2013). Therefore, even if the appellant requested an oral reply but was denied one, the agency did not violate his right to minimum due process under the Constitution, and the administrative judge's contrary finding was in error.[2] <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 546; <span class="Italic">cf. Hodges v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 591, &#x00B6; 6 (2012) (reversing the appellant's reduction in grade based on the agency's denying his due process rights upon finding that he did not have a meaningful opportunity to present his side of the story and to invoke the deciding official's discretion when the deciding official did not provide for an oral response and did not read the appellant's written response to the proposal notice before issuing his decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Alford</span>, the Board reversed the appellant's removal based on the agency's violating his right to minimum due process when, not having submitted a written reply, he timely requested an oral reply but the agency failed to wait a reasonable time for its delivery, instead issuing its decision, thereby denying him a meaningful opportunity to present his side of the story and invoke the deciding official's discretion. <span class="Italic">Alford</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 556, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Massey</span>, the Board reversed the appellant's removal based on the agency's violating his right to minimum due process when, not having submitted a written reply, his representative requested an oral reply on the last day provided for such, but the deciding official did not respond, instead issuing a decision letter. <span class="Italic">Massey</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 226, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10. In both of these cases, unlike the instant case, the appellants were denied minimum due process under the Constitution when the deciding officials issued decisions in their cases without having considered either their written or oral replies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant did not establish that the agency committed harmful procedural error regarding his right to reply</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency's conduct did not constitute a constitutional violation, we still must decide consider whether the agency violated the appellant's rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(c)(1) to respond to the proposal notice both orally and in writing. Here, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant requested to make an oral reply when, at the conclusion of his written reply, he asked that his response "receive full disclosure to the 37th Training Wing Commanders" and that he be afforded "the ability to respond verbally." The administrative judge considered, but rejected, the agency's claim that the brief conversation the appellant had with the deciding official when he submitted his written reply constituted an oral reply. She found that the deciding official failed to mention any such reply in her decision letter, that the agency failed to make a summary of the conversation and furnish it to the Board as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(e) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.406(c), and that the agency did not argue that the appellant had given an oral reply at that time until it made its final submission on the date the record closed below. The agency has not shown error in these well-supported findings, and we therefore agree that the appellant requested to make an oral reply, that the deciding official did not convene one, and that her failure to do so constituted procedural error in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(c)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's harmful error standard applies in the review of an agency's failure to comply with a statutory procedure provided in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. <span class="Italic">See Baracco v. Department of Transportation</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 112, 119-23 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Adams v. Department of Transportation</span>, 735 F.2d 488 (Fed.

Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 685 (1991). Reversing an action for harmful error is warranted when the procedural error, whether regulatory or statutory, likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency. <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 681. Harmful error cannot be presumed, and the burden of showing harmful error lies with the appellant. <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 685; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(1).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not shown, or even argued in his response to the agency's petition for review, that he suffered any harm by not having an opportunity to reply orally to the proposal notice. Nor did he argue or show harmful error below. As noted, he submitted a substantive written reply in which he explained why he believed the agency's action was unwarranted and included a number of positions he felt he could perform, despite his physical limitations, and the deciding official considered all aspects of that reply. In the absence of a showing by the appellant that, if he had been afforded an oral reply, the agency would likely have reached a different conclusion regarding his removal, he has not shown harmful procedural error, and the administrative judge erred in reversing the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 7513(b)(2) provides the right for both an oral and written adverse action reply. Under <span class="Italic">Cynor v. USDA</span>, CH-0752-20-0574-I-1 (5/31/2022), if the employee's written reply is not fully considered, but she's made an oral reply, there may be harmful error, but there is not a constitutional due process violation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submitted a written response, consisting of 7 parts, 1 of which was a supplemental exhibit file, roughly 91 pages in length, containing exhibits supporting her claims and statements. She sent the documents to the agency via email, except for the supplemental exhibit file, which she sent via Federal Express to the Minneapolis office. The appellant also participated in an oral reply, during which the deciding official took detailed notes that were provided to the appellant, and to which she submitted corrections. Regarding the exhibits sent to the agency's Minneapolis office, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency had limited staffing in the office, and the HR specialist, who the supplemental exhibit file was sent to, was not physically present in the office and did not retrieve the supplemental exhibit file until October 2020, after the appellant had been removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After reviewing the other 6 parts of the appellant's written reply, as well as the information provided during the oral reply, the deciding official issued a decision on August 13, 2020, mitigating the proposed removal to a 30-day suspension. The appellant filed a timely Board appeal, and during a status conference, it came to light that the deciding official had not reviewed the appellant's supplemental exhibit file prior to issuing the agency decision. Because due process is a threshold issue, the administrative judge bifurcated the appeal to address the potential due process violation first, and the parties submitted briefing on that issue. After reviewing the parties' submissions, the administrative judge issued an initial decision reversing the agency action, finding that the deciding official's failure to consider the appellant's supplemental exhibit file deprived her of a meaningful opportunity to be heard and therefore constituted a due process violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding a constitutional due process violation, the administrative judge reasoned that the appellant did not receive a meaningful opportunity to respond because the deciding official failed to consider her supplemental exhibit file, which contained "highly relevant" documents "intended to bolster what would otherwise be naked allegations." He also explicitly <span id="Page_3232"></span>rejected the agency's argument that it satisfied due process requirements because it considered all of her other submissions, both oral and written, noting that in the proposal notice the agency invited the appellant to present documentary evidence, and thus the appellant was "entitled to have that evidence considered and afforded the proper weight in the deciding official's deliberations before a decision is rendered."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's reasoning is flawed. An agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response to an agency action that deprives her of a property right in employment constitutes an abridgement of her constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v.

However, constitutional due process, as articulated in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, does not require that an employee have an opportunity to respond in writing <span class="Italic">and</span> orally--it requires one or the other. In other words, due process requires that an employee have "[t]he opportunity to present reasons, either in person <span class="Italic">or</span> in writing, why proposed action, should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has interpreted minimum due process to require an opportunity to respond either orally or in writing. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Kinsey v. Department of the Navy</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 226, 229 (1993), the appellant sent his written reply, which contained a request for an oral reply, before the expiration of the reply period, but it was received by the agency after the reply period had ended. The deciding official considered the appellant's written reply, but did not afford him the opportunity to present an oral reply as he requested. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board determined that any error by the agency in failing to provide the appellant with an oral response was a procedural error, subject to the harmful error standard, and not an "error[ ] of a constitutional dimension warranting reversal of the action for failure to provide the appellant with minimum due process." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thereafter, the Board has relied on Kinsey for the proposition that, when an agency has provided an employee with an opportunity to make a written reply to a notice of proposed adverse action, its failure to afford her with an opportunity to make an oral reply does not violate her right to minimum due process. <span class="Italic">Ronso v. Department of the Navy</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 391, &#x00B6; 13 (2015) (relying on <span class="Italic">Kinsey</span> for the stated proposition); <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 635 &#x00B6; 13 (1999) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, minimum due process is satisfied when an employee is afforded with an opportunity to present either a written response or an oral response--it does not require both. Here, it is undisputed that the appellant presented an oral reply, which was considered by the deciding official. Therefore, regardless of any errors in the agency's consideration of her written reply, the agency met minimum due process requirements because it provided the appellant with an oral reply. Accordingly, the administrative judge erred in finding that the agency violated the appellant's due process rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">On remand, the administrative judge should consider whether the agency's failure to review the supplemental exhibit file constitutes harmful procedural error</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the deciding official's failure to review the supplemental exhibit file does not constitute a violation of due process, it may constitute harmful procedural error. <span class="Italic">See Kinsey</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 226, 229-30 (applying the harmful error standard when the agency denied the appellant an oral reply but offered him an opportunity to submit a written reply). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A), the Board cannot sustain an agency's decision if the employee "shows harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at such decision." <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681 (1991). Reversal of an action for harmful error is warranted where the procedural error, whether regulatory or statutory, likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the record has not been fully developed on this issue, remand is required. On remand, the administrative judge should determine whether the deciding official's failure to consider the supplemental exhibit file constitutes harmful error. In order to prove harmful error under the statute and the Board's regulations, an appellant must "prove that any procedural errors substantially prejudiced [her] rights by possibly affecting the agency's decision." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 661 (1985)). Harmful error cannot be presumed and the appellant bears the burden of showing that the procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence of the error. <span class="Italic">Mattison v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants assert on review that, given certain assumptions and the sheer number of employee responses to the proposal notices, the deciding official would have had only approximately 5 to 7 minutes to consider each response. A deciding official's complete failure to consider an appellant's written response to a proposal notice before issuing a decision constitutes, in and of itself, a violation of minimum due process of law. <span class="Italic">Hodges v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 591, &#x00B6; 6 (2012). The administrative judge found, however, that the deciding official credibly testified that he reviewed each response individually. The administrative judge held that this testimony was corroborated by a labor relations specialist who was the project leader for the oral and written reply process, and who testified that she forwarded the replies to the deciding official, the deciding official confirmed that he had reviewed the summaries, and the deciding official sometimes worked until 9:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> to review the summaries from that day. <span class="Italic">See Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987) (to resolve credibility issues, an administrative judge must consider such factors as the consistency of the witness's version of events with other evidence). The Board must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing; the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The appellants have not identified sufficiently sound reasons for overturning the administrative judge's credibility findings in this case. In any event, the Board has held that, in furlough cases such as this, an agency makes certain policy and spending decisions and typically directs the furlough action at the appellants' positions, not at any conduct, characteristics, qualifications, or reputations of the appellants as individuals. <span class="Italic">See Gajdos v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 361, &#x00B6; 22 (2014). Given these circumstances, even assuming that the deciding official spent only a brief period of time reviewing the responses to the proposal notices, the appellants have not shown a violation of due process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">IRS Miller Consolidation</span> relegated to a harmful error analysis that the agency failed to keep a transcript of the oral replies, as required by a labor contract:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants also reiterate the claim of harmful error they raised below, alleging that the agency did not provide them and the deciding official with verbatim transcripts of their oral replies as required by a collective bargaining agreement. The administrative judge found that, although the agency committed a procedural error in this regard, the agency installed a "safe-guard" to ensure that the substance of the oral replies was memorialized by providing a separate note-taker for each oral reply and allowing the appellants and their representatives to review the summary and to make changes before it was finalized and forwarded to the deciding official. The administrative judge held that the appellants did not show that the error was harmful because they did not show that the agency denied requested changes or that the deciding official likely would have issued a different decision if transcripts had been provided. The appellants have not shown on review that the administrative judge erred in finding that the error was not harmful. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)] (harmful error is error by the agency in the application of its procedures that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a matter of constitutional due process, the issue is whether the appellant had notice of the charges and an opportunity to make a reply that was considered by the agency, even if the individual who heard the response was an official who made a recommendation to the deciding official. As a matter of harmful error, the agency's use of the incorrect official to receive the reply that was actually considered at the proper level is an error that will affect the outcome only if it can be shown that the error likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency. <span class="Italic">Cox-Vaughn v. USPS</span>, 100 MSPR 246, 252-53 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 &#x0026; n.3. (2005).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Alford,</span> there was plenty of law relegating reply errors to the harmful error analysis. Under <span class="Italic">Graham v. USPS</span>, 2 MSPR 213, 217, 2 MSPB 377 (1980), the failure to consider a reply to charges against an employee violated 5 CFR 752.404(c) and constituted a procedural error. On the particular facts, however, no harmful procedural error was demonstrated. There was no question that the written reply was received; the issue was whether it was considered. The reply letter requested an oral reply and one was scheduled. The Board inferred that the contents of the letter were considered from the fact that the oral reply was held and that the letter was received. The decision determined that there is no regulatory or judicially imposed requirement that the agency decision make a finding on any of the defenses raised in the reply, citing <span class="Italic">Erenreich v. United States</span>, 164 Ct. Cl. 214, <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> 379 U.S. 857 (1964). Pre-<span class="Italic">Alford,</span> if an agency denied the appellant the right to present an oral reply, the appellant must have shown prejudice under the harmful error standard. <span class="Italic">Hockman v.

USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 471, 474-75 (1997), "an opportunity to present a reply, however, is distinguishable from a presentation in fact." If the employee was given the opportunity to present a reply but, through misadventure, the agency issued a decision before a reply is reviewed (or received), the Board determined if there was harmful error. The Board would not reverse the action for procedural reasons if agency officials testified that a postdecision response <span id="Page_3233"></span>was considered but would not have changed the agency's decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Green v.

Dept. of Treasury</span>, 9 MSPR 200, 207 (1981) (no harmful error when the person taking the oral reply did not, as required by agency regulations, provide a written report on the reply; the hearing official and deciding official met and the hearing official then orally presented his recommendations); <span class="Italic">Jenkins v.

<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant complains that an agency unreasonably failed to extend a reply period so that he could obtain additional documentation to prepare his defense, he must show that the agency's decision not to extend the reply period precluded a meaningful response to the charges with the information at hand. <span class="Italic">Dorrance v.

<p class="Body-Text">An allegation that an appellant did not have enough time to submit reply materials to the agency is refuted if the appellant fails to supply materials to the Board showing that she was harmed by an error of the agency. <span class="Italic">Cephas v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-2347).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency committed harmful procedural error by not providing him a synopsis of his oral reply. The administrative judge noted that there was no synopsis of the oral reply in the agency file. However, there is no statutory obligation on the part of an agency to transcribe an appellant's oral reply. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(2). Nor is there any other such requirement. <span class="Italic">See Melnick v.

The appellant failed to set forth what additional information or evidence he provided at the oral reply (which he admits he had and which the deciding official indicates he considered), that would have caused the agency to reach a different result in this case. Thus, the appellant has failed to establish his claim of harmful procedural error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Townes v. USPS</span>, PH-0752-13-0095-I-1 (NP 7/18/2014), rejected a claim of harmful error when, contrary to agency regulations, the deciding official was not properly identified, the proposing official received the written reply, but the written reply was provided to the deciding official who fairly considered it, and no oral reply was requested:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency named the proposing official as the deciding official, which was a violation of the agency's regulations, and did not inform the appellant of the identity of the person who ultimately acted as the deciding official until the actual decision letter, which was also a violation of the agency's regulations. Initial Appeal File (Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM) &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 651.73, 651.75). Further, the decision letter did not inform the appellant of her appeal rights to the Board, and her subsequent inquiries to the deciding official on the matter resulted in additional misinformation about her appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (ELM &#x00A7; 651.75). Thus, we find that the agency clearly violated its own regulations as to improperly identifying the proposing official as the deciding official, failing to notify the appellant of the deciding official until the decision letter, and failing to inform the appellant of her Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, the appellant has not demonstrated that the agency's errors were harmful. Harmful error cannot be presumed; an agency's error is harmful only when the record shows that the procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">See Canary v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 12 (2013). The record reflects that the appellant submitted a lengthy written reply and supporting documentation to the proposing official. Her response was provided to the deciding official for his consideration. The deciding official referenced her response in his decision letter. The deciding official also testified that he reviewed and considered her written response, in addition to the contents of the proposed adverse action file, prior to making his decision to sustain the adverse action. Thus, as the administrative judge found, the deciding official fully considered the appellant's reply to the notice of proposed adverse action. Further, we find unpersuasive the appellant's mere assertion that the deciding official would have come to a different conclusion had she presented him with an oral response. <span class="Italic">See Helms v. Department of the Army</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7 (2010) (finding no harmful procedural error when the agency replaced a deciding official, after the appellant submitted his response but before a decision was reached, in order to comply with its policy). Consequently, the appellant has not demonstrated that the outcome would have been different had the agency properly identified the deciding official prior to the decision letter. <span class="Italic">See Canary</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 10. We also find that the appellant has not proven harmful procedural error regarding the agency's failure to properly notify her of her Board appeal rights because she fully exercised those rights despite the lack of notice and she has not alleged any harm in that regard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lofton v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-0752-12-0582-I-1 (NP 1/24/2014), set aside a removal for harmful error when significant medical information bearing on an AWOL charge was submitted to the agency but not considered by the deciding official:</p>

Reversal of an action for "harmful error" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) is warranted only where the procedural error likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency. <span class="Italic">Tom v.

We find that the appellant met her burden of proving that the agency's error was harmful.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the hearing, the deciding official testified that he considered the appellant's 5-week absence, from January 20 through February 27, 2012, to be "extremely serious," that the appellant "had not provided medical documentation pertaining to the dates in question," and that any medical documentation she submitted "certainly would have been considered as part of the decision." The deciding official also testified that he did not receive the March 14, 2012 FMLA certification. In response to the question of whether it would have changed his decision, he testified, "To be honest, I would just need more time to consider that." Further, the deciding official informed the appellant during her oral reply that he would consider changing her AWOL to leave without pay (LWOP) if he received medical documentation to support her absences. Yet, due to the agency's error, the deciding official did not have the opportunity to review a document within the agency's possession that arguably provided some medical explanation concerning the appellant's absences from January 20 through March 5, 2012, which constitute the majority of the specifications supporting the AWOL charge. Based on the above, we find that the agency's omission of the FMLA certification, which contained information concerning the appellant's pregnancy-related complications during the relevant dates, likely affected the agency official's decision to sustain the AWOL charge and his decision to impose the penalty of removal. Thus, we find that the agency's error had a harmful effect on the outcome of the case, and we affirm the administrative judge's decision to reverse the removal based on harmful procedural error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If it is not clear how the decisional process actually worked, the Board may look at the result, that is, at the decision, to determine whether the appellant's reply was considered. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sigler v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The broad issue presented by this appeal is whether petitioners' constitutional rights were abridged because the FAA did not give them "an explanation of the employer's evidence and an opportunity to present their side of the story" basing their arguments on <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v.

"Their side of the story" includes the specific arguments made to the MSPB which presumably would have been made to the agency including adequacy of the notice of the proposed removal, failure of the FAA to prove the striking was still going on when they were AWOL, that the facility would not have permitted petitioners to work if they had tried, and the fact the FAA made a mistake in sending out a form letter saying they had made no reply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, the United States Supreme Court stated that "[T]he opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why proposed action [to remove a public employee] should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement."...

<p class="Block-Quote1">..."The tenured public employee is entitled to[1] oral or written notice of the charges against him,[2] an explanation of the employer's evidence, and[3] an opportunity to present his side of the story."...

<p class="Block-Quote1">Both petitioners replied in writing to these notices within the seven-day period. Unfortunately, the replies were not received by the agency until after the expiration of the seven-day period and after issuance of the removal letters. However, the agency reviewed the replies and determined and advised petitioners that they contained nothing to alter the removal decision. Hence the petitioners were afforded an opportunity to present their side of the story at the agency level and any errors committed by the agency were in the nature of procedural errors and were not errors of constitutional dimension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the context of criminal cases, the Supreme Court has stated that the constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not a perfect one.... Similarly, in the context of federal employee cases, the Supreme Court stated:</p>

Thus, the perhaps premature issuance of the removal letters in the context of this case, where the written replies by the petitioners were not considered by the agency after the fact and do not on their face give any indication that receipt of the replies prior to issuance of the removal letters could have affected the agency's underlying factual conclusion, was harmless error. Moreover, petitioners had a full opportunity to present their additional defenses at their <span class="Italic">de novo</span> hearings before the board.

Relying upon <span class="Italic">Baracco v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 112, 119 (1983), the court determined that there was no showing that the denial of the statutory reply right was harmful.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e are in accord with the board's analysis. We would add only that paragraphs (A) and (C) are not directed to the same end. Harmful error in procedures (paragraph A) raises the question: Did the wrongful procedure harm the employee in the presentation of his defense so that a different result might have been reached? Paragraph (C), on the other hand, is directed <span class="Italic">to the decision</span> itself. Was the decision in its entirety in accordance with law? The harmful error provision is part of the law and, thus, negates a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule with respect to any procedural error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner made no effort to show or even argue that, had he made an oral reply, it would have benefited his case, e.g., he would have better understood the charges against him, or would have offered some additional evidence, or perhaps altered the presentation of his case from that in his written reply. Having failed to show that in some way an oral reply would have possibly affected the agency's decision, petitioner is not entitled to prevail. It is insufficient simply to show that a statutory procedure was not followed at the agency level. Harmful error must be shown.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee who was given advance notice of a proposed removal, but who was not given a reply right, received constitutional due process when he presented a grievance challenging the removal, amounting to what the court believed to be the equivalent of a reply, before he filed his MSPB appeal. <span class="Italic">Griffin v. USPS,</span> 183 Fed. Appx. 945, 949 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Kays v. FAA</span>, 15 MSPR 62, 70 (1983), harmful error was shown by an employee in a labor strike case who was given less than one day to submit documentary evidence in support of a written answer to amended adverse action charges. The employee was attempting to establish the defense that he had been incapacitated by illness during the period he was charged with striking; the error was harmful, constituting the basis for reversal. Another employee had dissuaded the agency from adverse action for strike participation by demonstrating hospitalization and incapacitation for illness during the relevant period. The Board found that the agency might have also exonerated the appellant had he been given the opportunity to provide medical evidence of such conditions. The regulatory definition of harmful error when <span class="Italic">Kays</span> was decided used the "might have" analysis, since abandoned in favor of the more rigorous standard now in 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)] ("Error by the agency in the application of its procedures that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. The burden is upon the appellant to show that the error was harmful, i.e., that it caused substantial harm or prejudice to his or her rights.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before revisions in Board law in 2012, lack of the opportunity to present a reply to a deciding official was, without more, insufficient to set aside a removal on either due process or harmful error grounds, <span class="Italic">Harris v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Harmful error under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) cannot be presumed; an agency error is harmful only where the record shows that the procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Stephen v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991). While it is clear that the agency issued the appellant conflicting instructions about who the deciding official in her case would be, we agree with the AJ that the appellant has not shown that the procedure that the agency employed was harmful. At the hearing, the appellant testified that, had she presented her reply to the deciding official before she was removed, she would have stated that she did not strike the customer but merely put her hand up defensively when the customer brushed past her, and that her prior admissions to the contrary should be disregarded because of her state of mind when she made those admissions. As the AJ found, the appellant's version of events is not credible and it is extremely unlikely that, had the appellant presented her incredible version of events to the deciding official, this would have caused the agency not to remove her. Therefore, as the AJ correctly found, the appellant has not shown that the agency's purported error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a different conclusion, and she did not prove her affirmative defense of harmful error. <span class="Italic">See Campbell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 185, &#x00B6; 10 (2003) (the appellant bears the burden of proving that a procedural error was harmful).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3235"></span>The appellant also contends that she was denied minimum due process. The AJ appears to have treated the appellant's harmful error and due process claims as one and the same. Harmful error and due process claims are distinct theories of recovery that require different modes of analysis, although there is often overlap between them, and the AJ should have adjudicated the appellant's due process claims separately. <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 389, &#x00B6; 8 (2004). Nevertheless, it is clear that the appellant received minimum due process. She received notice of the charge, an explanation of the agency's evidence, and a pre-decisional opportunity to tell her side of the story before the effective date of the removal (although she elected mediation instead), which are all that minimum due process requires. <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 680 (1991)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, under then-controlling law, lack of a reply opportunity was not harmful error, <span class="Italic">Gilmore v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GILMORE_IDA_M_AT_0752_05_0325_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_247240.pdf">103 MSPR 290</a>, 298-99 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-22, 2006 MSPB 267 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the agency erred when it issued its decision notice only 4 days after the appellant received the mediator's notice. Although the proposal notice indicated that the appellant was entitled to submit a response to the deciding official, and although the decision notice was not issued until nearly 3 months after the appellant received the proposal notice, the proposal notice also indicated that the appellant's right to submit a response at that time was dependent on her waiving her right to request mediation. The appellant chose to request mediation, and she accordingly did not have an opportunity to respond until after mediation efforts ended, i.e., until December 30, 2004, when she received the mediator's notice advising her of her right to respond. Because the decision notice was issued only 4 days later, she did not receive the 7-day response period provided in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perhaps more important, the response period the appellant received following her receipt of the mediator's notice was shortened without warning by the agency's issuance of a decision notice 6 days before her response was due. The appellant therefore was deprived of her opportunity to have the deciding official consider any response she otherwise would have presented during the last 6 days of the reply period. <span class="Italic">Cf. Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 271, 273-74 (1986) (the agency showed good cause for its late filing of a response to a motion by showing that it had relied on a Board regional office employee's statement that it would have 10 days after receiving a certain order that would be issued, and by showing that the order to which the employee referred was never issued).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have indicated above, however, a procedural error does not preclude the sustaining of an action when the appellant fails to show, by preponderant evidence, that the error is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. The appellant in this case has made no such showing. She has not even alleged that she would have presented a response during the last 6 days of the notice if the decision notice had not been issued before then. In addition, when asked by the agency to "[d]escribe in detail how the Agency would have likely reached a different conclusion regarding [her] demotion had it not" issued the notice of decision before the response deadline, she stated only, "Agency did not furnish documents they allegedly relied upon to support actions against me. The agency did not meet with me and/or my representative to allow discussion of specifications."[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;As the administrative judge noted, the proposal notice was unsigned, and the official whose name appeared below the signature space was no longer acting as the appellant's supervisor by the time the notice was issued. The appellant has neither alleged nor shown that these irregularities likely affected the outcome of this case before the agency, however. Moreover, we agree with the administrative judge that they do not support a finding that the action was not in accordance with law and therefore not sustainable. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(C). Although the Board has held that an action is not in accordance with law when the deciding official lacked authority to take the action, it relied in doing so on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, which authorizes only "the agency" to take an adverse action. <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 486, 488 (1993). That section includes no similar provision regarding authority to propose an action; instead, it simply provides that an employee is entitled to advance written notice of the proposal--notice that the appellant in this case received. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is presumed that a deciding official considers mitigating factors raised in the course of a written reply if the official states he read the response. <span class="Italic">Bruch v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-1019). If the agency provides too little time for a reply, but the appellant files a reply after the deadline and the reply is considered by the deciding official, there is no harmful error. That the appellant cannot make an oral reply does not establish harmful error without a showing of what information or argument the appellant would have presented during an oral reply. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morton v. SSA</span>, AT-0752-14-0806-I-1 (NP 5/27/2015) ("Where an agency has given an employee the opportunity to make a written reply to the notice of proposed adverse action, its failure to afford him an oral reply does not violate his right to minimum due process. <span class="Italic">Kinsey v. Department of the Navy,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 226, 229 (1993)."); <span class="Italic">Kinsey v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 226, 230 (1993), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. USPS</span>, 84 MSPR 635, 641 &#x00B6; 13 (1999) (as to the appellant's argument that he had been ejected from the agency premises and could not make a reply, the Board implied that the opportunity to make a written reply was sufficient). According to <span class="Italic">Graham, supra</span>, the absence of a proper summary of an oral reply is not harmful procedural error if it appears from the record that the agency deciding official did consider the matters raised during the oral reply.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency is presumed to have considered replies if it refers to them in its decision letter and submits summaries of them as part of the agency response to the appeal<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Franks v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 502, 505 (1984). No harmful error was committed by an agency deciding official who failed to consider recommendations by the official who took the oral reply from appellant, as long as the deciding official considered the appellant's responses. The oral response summary contained the recommendations from the reply officer, so the opinion is unclear as to whether the Board held that the recommendations were immaterial, whether they were presumptively considered, or whether, assuming they were material and were not considered, there was an absence of a showing of harmful error under Board criteria. <span class="Italic">Lebeau v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 17 MSPR 160, 167 (1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the agency deciding official should consider a reply, the decision letter need not apply Board burdens of proof. The agency need only determine that an adverse action promotes service efficiency. The AJ or the Board, not the agency deciding official, determines whether reprisal tainted the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gores v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 100, 112 (1995). But, more recently, for actions involving VA employees, <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. VA</span>, 8 F.4th 1290 (Fed. Cir. 2021), determined that the deciding official in an action under 38 USC 714 must determine the disputed facts, that is, the official must decide whether to uphold charges in the proposal, based on preponderant rather than substantial evidence. Contrary internal VA guidance was incorrect. The court did not suggest how a deciding official was to meaningfully articulate, other than through incantation of a legal term, the distinction between substantial and preponderant evidence (a requirement not imposed on deciding officials in typical Chapter 75 adverse actions). [As to the impact upon the agency's choice of a penalty of the failure of agency deciding officials to articulate their consideration of mitigating factors, refer to Chapter 7, "<a href="0100-2023-14-040.html#sec7-41">By Agency; Decision Notice</a>"; refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-18-087.html#sec11-88">Extension Request</a>."]</p>
