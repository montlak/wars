<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-56"><span class="space">q.</span> Provision Unlawful or Contrary to Public Policy</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant (or agency) challenges a settlement as unlawful, that challenge should be raised through a PFR, not through an enforcement petition (although, as will be seen below, public policy considerations may also prevent enforcement, and potentially lead to rescission, of an agreement during compliance litigation). <span class="Italic">West v. Dept. of Army</span>, 96 MSPR 531, 534 &#x00B6; 9 (2004), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not previously argued that the settlement agreement was unlawful, and the Board will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence<span class="Italic">. Mullins v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 206, 210 (1998). Moreover, if the appellant wanted to challenge the validity of the agreement, the appropriate method would have been through a PFR of the decision dismissing the appeal as settled, which she has not filed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The parties may include provisions, particularly involving pay and allowances that, when retrospectively examined, prove to be unauthorized by or in violation of laws and government-wide regulations establishing pay and benefits. The appellant may desire enforcement of the contested provisions, and the Board is left with the problem of determining how to deal with what really constitutes a unilateral mistake by agency officials who believed that they could provide the negotiated benefit. The Board's approach toward an unlawful provision varies. Some specificity in pleading is required. A bare assertion that an agreement is not legal on its face, unsupported by argument or evidence, will not invalidate the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Guinn v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 91 MSPR 144, 146 (2002).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming proof of invalidity, the Board may declare that the parties mutually erred by accepting the provision as lawful, or the Board may dispense with a constructive error approach, declare the provision unenforceable, and leave to the appellant the option of rescinding the agreement or accepting what is left of the agreement. To reach issue of unlawfulness, the provision must be one of substance. Although "an agency may not lawfully undertake in a settlement agreement to provide an appellant with benefits which the agency lacks authority to provide," <span class="Italic">Farrell v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 86 MSPR 384, 387 &#x00B6; 8 (2000), the Board will not credit a "mere allegation that [a] provision is unlawful and unconstitutional." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 84 MSPR 580, 583 &#x00B6; 5 (1999). When a material term of a settlement agreement, involving calculation of an overtime pay rate, was determined to be unlawful, the Board set aside the agreement as a result of mutual mistake. The case was remanded for adjudication on the merits. Left unsaid was how the parties were to treat benefits already received by the appellant under the agreement. <span class="Italic">Farrell v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 86 MSPR 384, 387-88 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12 (2000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will consider evidence from other agencies of government <span id="Page_4840"></span>concerning the propriety of terms in settlement agreements. If a settlement agreement incorporates provisions that are later found objectionable by the employing agency's fiscal officers, the Board may request an opinion from the Comptroller General and adopt the opinion into its decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 288, 290 (1986) (GAO opinion obtained by the Board concerning a living quarters allowance entitlement). If OPM objects to a settlement implementation based upon its effect on the retirement system, it has been implied that MSPB may determine whether a settlement properly invoked the waiver authority that OPM could grant. <span class="Italic">Cortez v. VA</span>, 27 MSPR 648, 650 (1985). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-223.html#sec16-222">Annuity Issues</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Miller v. DOD</span>, 45 MSPR 263, 266-68 (1990), the parties settled by agreeing on, among other things, a lengthy period of administrative leave for the appellant. The agency petitioned to set aside the agreement because, in retrospect, it determined that it lacked authority to expend appropriated funds to grant the appellant administrative leave for the extended period required by the agreement. The Board sought an advisory opinion from the Comptroller General, who declared that the administrative leave was unlawful. Of all this, the Board said:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We...find that both parties acted under a mutual mistake as to the lawfulness of the provision at issue and that the mistake was with regard to a material provision of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of any authority that agencies are empowered to grant administrative leave for extended periods of time...we find that provision 4 of the settlement agreement is unlawful. As detailed above, this provision is...clearly material to the agreement and was relied upon by the parties before the Board. Under these circumstances, where the parties to an agreement were mutually mistaken as to the lawfulness of a material provision, the Board will set aside the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Townsel v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 33 MSPR 456 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the initial decision is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the Denver Regional office for reinstatement of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Miller</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">McDavid v. Dept. of Army</span>, 46 MSPR 108, 111 (1990), setting aside on the basis of mutual mistake another settlement agreement incorporating a provision for administrative leave of a duration longer than what the Comptroller General considered to be permitted by law. The original appeal was reinstated because the administrative leave provision was "clearly central to the agreement and affected other provisions that were dependent upon it." In <span class="Italic">McDavid</span>, the appellant sought enforcement of another provision of his agreement having no apparent relation to the administrative leave provision. The Board set aside the agreement on its own initiative.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before setting an agreement aside because of an unlawful provision, the Board must be convinced that the provision is, indeed, unlawful. <span class="Italic">Benton v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 69 MSPR 461, 465 (1996), declined to set aside an agreement (and, upon appellant's petition, enforced it), despite the agency's argument that it was barred by EEOC regulations or law from accepting the EEO complaint it agreed to process after the appellant withdrew an adverse action appeal based on that agreement. The agency had authority to accept the EEO complaint. There was, the Board decided, no impediment to enforcement of the settlement. <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 371, 374 (1997), determined that a nondisclosure agreement did not invalidate a settlement as violation of First Amendment rights.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, the Board's inquiry into the propriety of a settlement agreement extends only to whether the agreement is "lawful on its face." <span class="Italic">See Stewart v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 104, 107 (1997). Here, the settlement agreement purports to reinstate the appellant with back pay, under a time-limited appointment, in a newly-created position in the office of one of the NMB members. This arrangement does not appear problematic "on its face."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, for the reasons set forth below, we are reopening these appeals on our own motion pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118. The settlement agreement that the parties executed during the petition for review process specifically states that it will be effective when accepted by the Board for purposes of enforcement, but, because it is plain that the parties are misusing the IPA program to create a package of compensation and benefits that is contrary to law, the Board declines to accept the parties' settlement agreement for enforcement purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...While the Board acknowledges that retroactive actions taken pursuant to settlement agreements are sometimes tinged with artificiality, it is plain that the parties are attempting to misuse the IPA program for a purpose for which it was not intended. While the parties are free to settle an appeal under terms they desire, the Board has the discretion not to accept a settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes where, as here, the agreement is designed to provide the appellant with a combination of pay and benefits not authorized by law. <span class="Italic">See Day v.

The appellant sought to set aside the agreement for alleged mutual mistake concerning a provision relating to use of leave or LWOP. The Board determined the agreement was invalid, but for another reason. The settlement, without altering the underlying charge, reduced the penalty to a five-day suspension. The vehicle misuse statute carries a mandatory 30-day suspension minimum penalty. The settlement did not survive:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1349(b), the agency is required to impose a penalty of no less than a 1-month suspension for the appellant's offense of willfully using a Government vehicle for other than official purposes. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Givens</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 360, 362 n.2. (1985). The settlement agreement does not rescind the charge of willful misuse of a Government vehicle for nonofficial purposes in violation of 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1349(b). Because the statute imposes a mandatory minimum penalty for the appellant's offense, the agency could not lawfully agree to reduce the penalty for the charged offense below a 30-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Fields v.

Thus, the settlement agreement was not lawful on its face.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement must be set aside if it is tainted with invalidity either by fraud practiced upon a party or by a mutual mistake under which both parties acted. <span class="Italic">Fields</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 384, &#x00B6; 8. Under the circumstances, we find that both parties acted under a mutual mistake as to the lawfulness of agency's agreement to suspend the appellant for less than 1 month for the sustained offense, that the mistake concerned a material provision of the agreement, and that the agreement must be set aside. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Stipp v.

<p class="Body-Text">Controversy over settlement provisions that are argued to be illegal or contrary to public policy may arise in direct challenges through PFRs contesting their validity after AJs accept the settlements through initial decisions, or problems may surface during enforcement proceedings, when one party is seeking to enforce the agreement or set the agreement aside because the other party failed to abide by the agreement.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We start with the well-settled proposition that "[I]t is customary, where Congress has not adopted a different standard, to apply to the construction of government contracts the principles of general contract law." <span class="Italic">Priebe &#x0026; Sons, Inc. v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 332 U.S. 407, 411, 68 S.

(citing <span class="Italic">Priebe &#x0026; Sons Inc</span>., 332 U.S. at 411, 68 S. Ct. 123). In short, the "principles of general contract law," <span class="Italic">Priebe &#x0026; Sons, Inc.,</span> 332 U.S. at 411, 68 S. Ct. 123, which become federal common law, govern our construction of the settlement agreement at issue on this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is equally well-settled in the principles of general contract law that courts may not enforce contracts that are contrary to public policy. In <span id="Page_4841"></span><span class="Italic">McMullen v</span>. <span class="Italic">Hoffman,</span> 174 U.S. 639, 19 S. Ct. 839, 43 L. Ed, 1117 (1899), for example, two bidders for a municipal government contract submitted separate bids without revealing that they had agreed to share the work equally if one of them was awarded the contract. One of the parties secured the contract and the other sued to enforce their agreement to share the work. The Supreme Court found that agreement unenforceable as contrary to public policy:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]o permit a recovery in this case is in substance to enforce an illegal contract, and one which is illegal because it is against public policy to permit it to stand. The court refuses to enforce such a contract and it permits defendant to set up its illegality, not out of any regard for the defendant who sets it up, but only on account of the public interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 669, 19 S. Ct. 839.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court have applied this principle to declare unenforceable United States government contracts. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States v. Mississippi Valley Generating Co.,</span> 364 U.S. 520, 563, 81 S. Ct. 294, 5 L. Ed.2d 268 (1961) (approving cancellation of government contract for violation of federal conflict-of-interest statute, now codified at 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 208, because "the sanction of nonenforcement is consistent with and essential to effectuating the public policy embodied" in that statute); <span class="Italic">United States v. Acme</span> <span class="Italic">Process Equip. Co.,</span> 385 U.S. 138, 146, 87 S. Ct. 350, 17 L.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has also refused to enforce private contracts on grounds of public policy. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Continental Wall</span> <span class="Italic">Paper Co. v. Louis Voight &#x0026; Sons Co.,</span> 212 U.S. 227, 262, 29 S. Ct. 280, 53 L. Ed. 486 (1909) (declining to enforce private contract "not for the benefit of the defendant, but because public policy demands that it should be denied without regard to the interests of individual parties"); <span class="Italic">Hurd v.</span> <span class="Italic">Hodge,</span> 334 U.S. 24, 34-35, 68 S. Ct. 847, 92 L. Ed. 1187 (1948) (declining to enforce racially restrictive covenant because, in part, "[t]he power of the federal courts to enforce the terms of private agreements is at all times exercised subject to the restrictions and limitations of the public policy of the United States.... Where the enforcement of private agreements would be violative of that policy, it is the obligation of courts to refrain from such exertions of judicial power.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This doctrine was summarized in <span class="Italic">Hurd,</span> which recognized that enforcement is denied when such enforcement would be contrary to the "public policy of the United States as manifested in the Constitution, treaties, federal statutes and applicable legal precedents." 334 U.S. at 35, 68 S. Ct. 847. However, <span class="Italic">Hurd</span> and these other public policy cases conflate two distinct concepts. First, there is the rule that the federal courts should refrain from enforcing both United States government and private contracts when such enforcement would be contrary to the "public policy of the United States as manifested in the Constitution, treaties, [and] federal statutes..." <span class="Italic">Hurd</span>, 334 U.S. at 35, 68 S. Ct. 847. While the government suggests that the Status of Forces Agreement signed by the United States and Germany required the reporting here, that is disputed, and we will assume that the Constitution, statutes and treaty obligations of the United States are not implicated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, as <span class="Italic">Hurd</span> recognized in the same passage quoted above, the federal courts will refuse to enforce contracts where the public policy is reflected in "applicable legal precedents." 334 U.S. at 35, 68 S. Ct. 847. In other words, the federal courts, as a matter of contract law, will not enforce an agreement if the agreement would require violation of established public policy norms, even if enforcing the agreement would not violate a specific federal statute, treaty or constitutional requirement. This principle has particular force in cases involving United States government contracts where federal contract law is applied, <span class="Italic">see Boyle v. United Technologies Corp.,</span> 487 U.S. 500, 512, 108 S. Ct. 2510, 101 L. Ed.2d 442 (1988), and it is this latter concept that is implicated on this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To declare a contract unenforceable on public policy grounds, however, courts must first determine that the public policy at issue is "well defined and dominant." W.R.<span class="Italic"> Grace &#x0026; Co. v. Local Union 759,</span> 461 U.S. 757, 766, 103 S. Ct. 2177, 76 L. Ed.2d 298 (1983) (upholding arbitrator's interpretation of collective bargaining agreement, but recognizing that if that interpretation "violates some explicit public policy, we are obliged to refrain from enforcing it"). That determination is to be made "by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 766, 103 S. Ct. 2177 (quoting <span class="Italic">Muschany v. United States,</span> 324 U.S. 49, 66, 65 S. Ct. 442, 89 L. Ed. 744 (1945)). We accordingly must ascertain the existence and scope of the public policy implicated by the construction of the settlement agreement urged by the petitioner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We assume, as noted above, that there is no federal statute, treaty or constitutional requirement mandating the referrals to the German law enforcement authorities. We nonetheless conclude that the public policy interest at stake the reporting of possible crimes to the authorities is one of the highest order and is indisputably "well defined and dominant" in the jurisprudence of contract law. <span class="Italic">W.R. Grace &#x0026; Co.,</span> 461 U.S. at 766, 103 S. Ct. 2177.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Supreme Court has noted, "[c]oncealment of crime has been condemned throughout our history. The citizen's duty to raise the 'hue and cry' and report felonies to the authorities was an established tenet of Anglo Saxon law at least as early as the 13th century." <span class="Italic">Roberts v. United States,</span> 445 U.S. 552, 557, 100 S. Ct. 1358, 63 L. Ed.2d 622 (1980) (internal citations omitted). In <span class="Italic">Branzburg v. Hayes,</span> 408 U.S. 665, 92 S. Ct. 2646, 33 L. Ed.2d 626 (1972), for example, the Court held that a journalist's agreement to conceal the criminal conduct of his news sources did not give rise to a testimonial privilege under the First Amendment. In reaching that decision, the Court reasoned, in part, that "it is obvious that agreements to conceal information relevant to commission of crime have very little to recommend them from the standpoint of public policy." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 696, 92 S. Ct. 2646. Noting that the first Congress had enacted a statute defining the common-law crime of misprision of felony (currently codified at 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4)[8], the Court concluded that "[i]t is apparent from this statute, as well as from our history and that of England, that concealment of crime and agreements to do so are not looked upon with favor." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 697, 92 S. Ct. 2646.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;That statute provides that "[w]hoever, having knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the United States, conceals and does not as soon as possible make known the same to some judge or other person in civil or military authority under the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both." It has been construed to require "both knowledge of a crime and some affirmative act of concealment or participation." <span class="Italic">Brawburg</span>, 408 U.S. at 696 n.36, 92 S. Ct. 2646 (1972).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the magnitude of the public policy interest here, it is not surprising that contracts barring the reporting of crimes are held to be unenforceable. For example, in <span class="Italic">Lachman v. Sperry-Sun Well Surveying Co.</span>, 457 F.2d 850 (10th Cir. 1972), the defendant informed a third party of the plaintiff's possible misappropriation of certain oil and natural gas deposits belonging to the third party. The plaintiff sued for breach of a non-disclosure agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 851. The trial court dismissed the action on the basis that public policy "'will never penalize one for exposing wrongdoing...'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 852. The Tenth Circuit affirmed. That court declined to enforce the parties' contract, noting that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is public policy in Oklahoma and everywhere to encourage the disclosure of criminal activity, and a ruling here in accordance with the argument advanced by appellant would serve to frustrate this policy.... By holding that appellee breached its contract we would, in effect, be placing others similarly situated in a precarious position. A party bound by contract to silence, but suspecting that its silence would permit a crime to go undetected, would be forced to choose between breaching the contract and hoping an actual crime is eventually proven, or honoring the contract while a possible crime goes unnoticed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 853-54.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As counsel for the petitioner conceded at oral argument, the dilemma described in this quotation from <span class="Italic">Lachman</span> is precisely the dilemma that would result from the petitioner's construction of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, it is a long-standing principle of general contract law that courts will not enforce contracts that purport to bar a party--here, the United States Army--from reporting another party's alleged misconduct to law enforcement authorities for investigation and possible prosecution. We have no doubt that a contract provision requiring the United States to conceal possible crimes from state or foreign authorities would be contrary to public policy and unenforceable in most circumstances, whether or not the enforcement of that provision would violate a federal statute, treaty or constitutional requirement. The construction of the settlement agreement urged by petitioner must accordingly be rejected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We wish to make clear, however, that there are limits on the rule we recognize and apply today. We do not decide whether this rule will apply if there is no allegation of a crime that would violate United States law if committed in the United States, or if the punishment imposed would not be of the same type as could be constitutionally imposed in the United States. Nor do we decide if this rule would apply if the alleged wrongdoer were not appropriately subject to the jurisdiction of the foreign sovereign. This case does not fall within the areas of any of these possible exceptions. Here forgery and use of forged documents for unauthorized residence are crimes under United States law, and the punishment of imprisonment would not be unconstitutional. Petitioner was also subject to the jurisdiction of the German authorities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4842"></span>Moreover, while certain international agreements may obligate the United States to refer its citizens' alleged violations of a foreign government's criminal laws to that government, we are aware of no principle of contract law that requires the United States to make such referrals. The question presented is whether the United States can contractually bind itself to not refer such alleged misconduct and therefore place in the hands of the alleged wrongdoer the ability to decide whether to make such referrals. We conclude that the United States may not do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that in referring Ms. Fomby-Denson to the German law enforcement authorities, it is of course appropriate for the Army to provide all details reasonably thought necessary for those authorities to make their decisions regarding the investigation and possible prosecution of Ms. Fomby-Denson. Absent a clear abuse, we will not second-guess the Army's decision as to the quantum of information provided to the German authorities regarding the forgery allegations and the existence of and terms of the settlement agreement. We find no such clear abuse here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Fomby-Denson</span>, <span class="Italic">Gizzarelli v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GIZZARELLI_JOYCE_L_DC_0752_95_0447_C_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249902.pdf">90 MSPR 269</a>, 271-80 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-33 (2001) (Chairman Slavet dissenting), determined that the Board "will not read a settlement agreement to preclude OPM, by virtue of its statutory and regulatory authority to investigate candidates for federal employment, from obtaining police or criminal records as part of a background check or suitability determination where OPM and the employing agency determine, based on the appropriate risk factors, that such records are needed to assess the suitability of an applicant for a federal job":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[Appellant] argues that the agency breached the settlement agreement by sending to OPM a copy of a Military Policy report and a Commander's Report of Disciplinary and Administrative Action. The appellant relies on the agreement's provision allowing the release of only the information described in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 293.311(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agreement states that, when asked for employment information about the appellant, the agency "will not disclose any information to prospective employers which would indicate that the appellant was removed," but instead "will provide only that information which is permitted under 5 C.F.R. section 293.311(a)." The information that can be released under section 293.311(a), which governs the release of certain information "to the public" under the Freedom of Information Act, consists of an employee's name, present and past position titles and occupational series, grades, annual salary rates, duty stations, position descriptions, and performance elements and standards. The agency asserted below and contends on petition for review that this term in the settlement agreement does not prohibit the release of criminal history files maintained in law enforcement channels.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the Crime Records Center sent the Military Police report and the Commander's report to OPM. The question is whether the agency breached the settlement agreement by sending those records to OPM because they were not among the kinds of information listed in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 293.311(a), or whether it would have been against public policy to have denied those records to OPM. On public policy grounds, we find that a settlement agreement should not be construed in such a way as to force an agency to withhold criminal history files from OPM, where OPM has a legitimate need and a legal right to obtain those files.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin our inquiry with the recent decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Fomby-Denson v. Department of the Army,</span> 247 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In that case, our reviewing court found that public policy concerns prevailed over the terms of a settlement agreement where the settlement agreement inhibited the release of information related to criminal activity. Specifically, the court held that, as a matter of public policy, an agreement between an agency and a former employee in settlement of an appeal from an adverse action cannot be construed as barring the United States from making criminal referrals based on the underlying conduct<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1377-78.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that <span class="Italic">Fomby-Denson</span> dealt with the referral of alleged criminal activity to the appropriate authorities for a decision on whether to initiate prosecution, while the instant case involves the release of criminal history records to the appropriate agency for a decision on suitability for employment. Nonetheless, the court's reasoning is instructive for the resolution of this case because the court found that the disposition of Ms. Fomby-Denson's appeal did not depend on the language and history of the agreement; rather, it depended on whether it would be against public policy to construe the agreement as prohibiting the agency from referring Ms. Fomby-Denson to the proper authorities for criminal investigation of the conduct that resulted in the settlement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1373. The court held that the contract was unenforceable in that situation because it is against public policy to bar one party to a contract from reporting the other party's alleged misconduct to law enforcement authorities for investigation and possible prosecution. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377-78.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Federal Circuit stated in <span class="Italic">Fomby-Denson,</span> it is "well-settled in the principles of general contract law that courts may not enforce contracts that are contrary to public policy." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1374. As further explained by the court, to declare a contract unenforceable on public policy grounds, a tribunal must first determine that the public policy at issue is "well defined and dominant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1375, quoting <span class="Italic">W.R. Grace &#x0026; Co. v. Local Union 759</span>, 461 U.S. 757, 766, 103 S. Ct. 2177, 76 L. Ed.2d 298 (1983). This principle is incorporated in the Restatement (Second) of the Law of Contracts which, in section 178, provides that a term of an agreement is unenforceable on grounds of public policy if "the interest in its enforcement is clearly outweighed in the circumstances by a public policy against the enforcement of such terms." The Restatement explains that in weighing a public policy against enforcement of a contract term, account should be taken of the strength of the policy as manifested by legislation or judicial opinions, the likelihood that a refusal to enforce the contract term will further the public interest, the seriousness of any misconduct, and the directness of the connection between that misconduct and the term. Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 178(3)(a)-(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the public policy at issue in the case at bar is "well defined and dominant" and that, under the principles discussed above, the agreement here should not be construed to prevent the disclosure of criminal history records to OPM. In the Federal Torts Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2674 n.21, Congress expressed the "strong public policy to protect citizenry from torts committed by public servants." By imposing liability on agencies for the tortious conduct of their employees committed within the scope of employment, the Act is intended to help improve the hiring and screening process for positions of public trust in the federal government. <span class="Italic">See Red Elk v. United States,</span> 62 F.3d 1102, 1108 (8th Cir. 1995) (stating that the imposition of "justified liability" under the Act on federal officials who abuse their positions of authority "may help improve hiring and supervision" of employees who hold positions of trust). Hence, it is a concern of Congress that agencies carefully select persons who will occupy positions of trust. OPM regulations are in accord.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.302(a) requires that agencies evaluate the risk level of every competitive service position in terms of the adverse impact from the misconduct of an employee in that position. Under the regulation, employees may be subjected to background investigations, the scope of which is dictated by the risk level. Thus, persons applying for positions of public trust are subject to background checks. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 118 F.3d 786, 788 (C.A.D.C. 1997). "A public trust position is one involving 'access to or operation or control of...financial records, with a relatively high risk for causing grave damage or realizing a significant personal gain.'" <span class="Italic">Id., quoting</span> 61 Fed. Reg. 398.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant accepted a position with SSA, which is entrusted with disbursing and accounting for money deposited by taxpayers into the social security retirement fund. SSA determined that the nature of the appellant's position required, as part of the selection and hiring process, a background investigation to determine her suitability for that position. Accordingly, it asked OPM to conduct such an investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is OPM's unique responsibility in the area of federal-sector employment to conduct background investigations of the type requested by SSA. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 736.201(a) ("Unless provided otherwise by law, the investigation of persons entering or employed in the competitive service...is the responsibility of OPM."). The Board has recognized that among the specific factors on which a suitability for employment decision may rest is "criminal or dishonest conduct related to the duties to be assigned to the appellant or appointee." <span class="Italic">Leibowitz v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Justice,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 635 &#x00B6; 11 (2001). It was therefore entirely proper for OPM to have sent a request for background information on the appellant directly to the agency's Crime Records Center to see if she had engaged in any "criminal or dishonest conduct" related to the duties she would be assigned at SSA. OPM's need to review such background information is supported by the clear and dominant public policy described above. The dissent places private agreements over public policy in this situation. We, however, find that public policy overrides the terms of the settlement agreement under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lest there be any confusion, we wish to plainly state that we are not finding that OPM can obtain personnel records related to misconduct or performance where a settlement agreement prevents the release of such personnel records. Nor are we finding that any agency can get the appellant's criminal investigative file for any purpose. Rather, we are limiting our holding to a finding that we will not read a settlement agreement to preclude OPM, by virtue of its statutory and regulatory authority to investigate candidates for federal employment, from obtaining police or criminal records as part of a background check or suitability determination where OPM and the employing agency determine, based on the appropriate risk factors, that such records are needed to assess the suitability of an applicant for a federal job. Thus, our holding is narrowly tailored to fit circumstances such as the one presented here and is not intended to implicate cases such as <span class="Italic">Thomas, Pagan or King.</span> <span class="Italic">Cf. Thomas,</span> 124 F.3d at 1442 (recognizing that "the truth <span id="Page_4843"></span>about [his] <span class="Italic">performance</span> at [his former agency] was the major benefit that Thomas received in exchange for agreeing to resign from his position") (emphasis added)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the appellant on petition for review and the Chairman in her dissent rely on <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of the Army,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 430 (1987), and <span class="Italic">Kramer v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. 187 (1990), in asserting that all agency records, including criminal investigative records, are subject to a settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Rose,</span> the Board found that files kept by the agency's criminal investigative division were not exempt from a provision in the settlement agreement requiring the agency to expunge, from the appellant's personnel file and all other files in the agency's control, "any and all" information, reports and investigations relating to the removal action. 33 M.S.P.R. at 434. In <span class="Italic">Kramer</span>, the Board found that records kept by the agency's Naval Investigative Service were subject to the provisions of a settlement agreement that required the agency to delete and destroy "any and all" reports, information and investigations relating to the removal action from the appellant's personnel file and all other files under the agency's control. 46 M.S.P.R. at 190-91.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, initially, that there is nothing in the decisions in either <span class="Italic">Rose</span> or <span class="Italic">Kramer</span> indicating that the Board considered the specific public policy issues addressed at length in this opinion. In addition, there is nothing in either of those opinions suggesting that the records at issue were generated by a police department which found probable cause to conclude that crimes had been committed. More importantly, the agency here did not agree to expunge, delete or destroy any part of the Military Police records or the Commander's report. Thus, unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Rose</span> and <span class="Italic">Kramer</span> and the Federal Circuit cases discussed above <span class="Italic">(Pagan, Thomas</span> and <span class="Italic">King</span>), the agreement here was not a "clean record" agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit's decisions in <span class="Italic">Pagan v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 170 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Navy,</span> 130 F.3d 1031 (Fed. Cir. 1997), and <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 124 F.3d 1439 (Fed. Cir. 1997), provide examples of "clean record" agreements. The court in <span class="Italic">Pagan</span> read the term "clean record" in the settlement agreement "to mean that Mr. Pagan's personnel record was to be restored to its former state," that is, to the way it was before he was removed. 170 F.3d at 1371. To that end, the court found that Pagan's "'fully successful' and 'highly successful' ratings [must be] uncontroverted by <span class="Italic">any</span> evidence of charges or the related removal action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Thomas,</span> the agreement required that <span class="Italic">"all</span> documentation relating to the relevant adverse action <span class="Italic">proposal</span> and decision would be <span class="Italic">removed</span> from Thomas's [OPF]," and that "there will be <span class="Italic">no</span> reference, directly or indirectly, by coding or any other manner, to the fact that an adverse action was initiated or taken." 124 F.3d at 1440 (emphasis added). Similarly, the agency in <span class="Italic">King</span> expressly agreed to <span class="Italic">"purging</span> of the records that show the prior adverse action." 130 F.3d at 1033 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agreement here, in contrast, states that the agency would replace the SF 50 documenting the appellant's removal with an SF 50 showing that she resigned "after receipt of notice of proposed adverse action." Thus, unlike the agreements in <span class="Italic">Pagan, King</span> and <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, the appellant's OPF would continue to contain documentation referring to a "proposed adverse action." Further, unlike the agreements in both <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> and <span class="Italic">King</span>, no term in the settlement agreement here provides for the expungement or removal of any documents relating to the adverse action or the criminal investigation that led to that action, other than the replacement of the SF 50 showing that the appellant was removed with one showing that she resigned in the face of a proposed adverse action. The administrative judge therefore correctly found that this is not a "clean record" agreement. Since there is no "clean record" agreement here and there is no question of expungement of the criminal investigative record, <span class="Italic">Rose</span> and<span class="Italic"> Kramer</span> as well as <span class="Italic">Pagan, Thomas</span>, and <span class="Italic">King</span> are not helpful in resolving this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent states that one of the charges brought in <span class="Italic">Pagan</span> was "possibly criminal in nature." Nothing in the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Pagan</span> shows or indicates that a police organization had conducted an investigation and found probable cause to conclude that laws had been broken. Speculation that the police may have found probable cause to believe that Mr. Pagan had engaged in criminal behavior is far different from record evidence showing that a duly-authorized police unit had actually investigated and found probable cause to believe that criminal activity had taken place, as happened in the appellant's case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the appellant applied for a position in which she would be responsible for handling and accounting for money deposited by the public into the social security retirement fund. To carry out its obligation to gather material showing whether the appellant could be retained in that position of public trust, OPM had a lawful need for the Military Police report which revealed probable cause to believe that she had, while employed by another federal agency, committed the crimes of receiving stolen government property, as well as embezzling from and perpetrating fraud on the government. Under these circumstances, we find that it would contravene public policy to enforce the settlement agreement by compelling the agency to conceal the Military Police report from OPM. Although we do not reach this decision lightly, we nonetheless are compelled to find that the public's interest in having OPM oversee the hiring of suitable candidates for positions of trust in the federal government outweighs any expectation on the appellant's part that she could occupy a position of trust with the SSA and have her criminal investigative record withheld from OPM. We therefore dismiss the appellant's petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gizarelli</span> cited a private sector case involving settlements precluding contracting employees from assisting other employees in EEOC investigations, <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Astra USA, Inc</span>., 94 F.3d 738, 744 (1st Cir. 1996). The First Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the nonassistance clauses:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We build on bedrock. "[A] promise is unenforceable if the interest in its enforcement is outweighed in the circumstances by a public policy harmed by enforcement of the agreement." <span class="Italic">Town of Newton v. Rumery</span>, 480 U.S. 386, 392, 107 S. Ct. 1187, 1191, 94 L. Ed.2d 405 (1987). In performing that balancing here, we must weigh the impact of settlement provisions that effectively bar cooperation with the EEOC on the enforcement of Title VII against the impact that outlawing such provisions would have on private dispute resolution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress entrusted the Commission with significant enforcement responsibilities in respect to Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(a). To fulfill the core purposes of the statutory scheme, "it is crucial that the Commission's ability to investigate charges of systemic discrimination not be impaired." <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Shell Oil Co</span>., 466 U.S. 54, 69, 104 S. Ct. 1621, 1631, 80 L. Ed.2d 41 (1984). Clearly, if victims of or witnesses to sexual harassment are unable to approach the EEOC or even to answer its questions, the investigatory powers that Congress conferred would be sharply curtailed and the efficacy of investigations would be severely hampered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What is more, the EEOC acts not only on behalf of private parties but also "to vindicate the public interest in preventing employment discrimination." <span class="Italic">General Tel. Co. v. EEOC</span>, 446 U.S. 318, 326, 100 S. Ct. 1698, 1704, 64 L. Ed.2d 319 (1980). In many cases of widespread discrimination, victims suffer in silence. In such instances, a sprinkling of settlement agreements that contain stipulations prohibiting cooperation with the EEOC could effectively thwart an agency investigation. Thus, any agreement that materially interferes with communication between an employee and the Commission sows the seeds of harm to the public interest. <span class="Italic">See Cosmair</span>, 821 F.2d at 1090 (stating that "an employer and an employee cannot agree to deny to the EEOC the information it needs to advance this public interest").</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">It thus appears from the record that SSA indeed has removal-related documents in the appellant's current personnel file, but it is unclear whether, from whom, and how SSA obtained such documents from the agency. Since it appears from the record that SSA might have obtained the documents from OPM after the agency released them to OPM in the course of a suitability investigation, we note that the Board has stated that an agency may not disclose employment records to OPM in the course of a suitability investigation, where a settlement agreement prohibits the disclosure of such records. <span class="Italic">Gizzarelli</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 269 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15, 23.[3] It also appears from the record that the agency might have released the derogatory documents from its litigation file after expunging them from the appellant's personnel file. CF, Tab 8 (the documents purported to be from the appellant's personnel file at SSA include Board documents related to her appeal regarding her removal). The Board has stated in <span id="Page_4844"></span>this regard that, even where a settlement agreement does not provide for expungement of the litigation file, the agency must nevertheless "observe appropriate safeguards so as not to injure the appellant's employment prospects or otherwise affect the confidentiality of the MSPB appeal file." <span class="Italic">Baig v.

If the appellant provided OPM with a specific release authorizing OPM to obtain information from the agency beyond that retained in her personnel file, she would have waived her right to nondisclosure under the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hosey v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Allen v. VA</span>, 420 Fed. Appx. 980, 87-88 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), indirectly disapproved of a settlement provision that precluded the agency from reporting the nature of the appellant's separation from the agency to DOL concerning a workers compensation application. The court reasoned that incorrect information provided to another federal agency could implicate the criminal strictures of the False Statement Act, 18 USC 1001:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Allen additionally argues that the Board erred in concluding that the agency's disclosure of removal-related information to the OWCP did not breach the settlement agreement. Of particular relevance to this issue is the following provision of the agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The agency will] change [Mr. Allen's] removal to voluntary resignation, and make the following changes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">a.&#x2003;SF 50-B Notification of Personnel Action. Removal, dated May 26, 2007, will be canceled and removed, and VA will substitute a form SF 50-B Notification of Personnel Action [indicating Mr. Allen's resignation].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">b.&#x2003;SF-50-B Notification of Personnel Action. Suspension, dated August 28, 2006, will be cancelled [sic] and removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found, and the agency does not dispute, that, under <span class="Italic">Conant v. Office of Personnel Mgmt.</span>, 255 F.3d 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001), it was required to read the above provision as "broadly prohibiting the agency from disclosing removal-related information to <span class="Italic">any</span> third party." <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2009 MSPB 238 &#x00B6; 18 (emphasis in original); <span class="Italic">see</span> Resp. Inf. Br. at 13-14 ("Generally, a settlement agreement with a clean record provision implicitly requires agency communications with third parties to reflect the amended OPF."). The Board also noted that, were its breach analysis based solely on that provision and "the agency's admitted disclosure of removal-related information to OWCP, then under <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, the agency would have materially breached" the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 16. Based on its reading of a separate provision of the settlement agreement, however, the Board distinguished <span class="Italic">Conant</span> and concluded that the parties intended to permit the agency to disclose removal-related information whenever such disclosure is "required by law." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraph 12, on which the Board relied, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he Agency agrees that Human Resource Officer Jeanette Anderson, or her successor(s)..., if contacted for any employment inquiry or reference for the Appellant will provide the information contained in Exhibit "C," and will truthfully respond regarding those matters required by law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on this language, the Board concluded that the parties intended to carve out an exception to any implied promise of non-disclosure where disclosure of removal-related documents is required by law. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2009 MSPB 238 &#x00B6; 19. ("Based on <span class="Italic">Felch</span> and the parties' inclusion of express language that permits the agency to respond as required by law, we find that the parties intended to permit disclosure of removal-related information as required by law."). We agree.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Even without such a provision in the agreement, it would appear to be contrary to public policy for a government agency to attempt to contract out of an obligation required by federal law. <span class="Italic">See Fomby-Denson v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1366, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (holding that a contract barring an agency from reporting criminal behavior would be against public policy).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only reasonable reading of the paragraph is that it creates an exception to any implied promise of non-disclosure as to any matter for which the law requires truthful responses. Consequently, the breach inquiry turns on whether the agency was required by law to disclose the removal-related information Ms. Anderson submitted to OWCP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board observed, several statutes and regulations impose disclosure obligations on agencies in connection with an OWCP inquiry. Notably, 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.16, which specifically addresses statements made in connection with FECA claims, cites a number of statutes that make it a crime to "file a false statement" or "conceal a material fact" in connection with a FECA claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.16 (citing 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 287, 1001, 1920, and 1922); 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1001 ("[w]hoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of [any] branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully...falsifies, conceals, or covers up...a material fact" or "makes any materially false...statement or representation...shall be fined [or] imprisoned."); 18 U.S.C. 1922 ("Whoever [is] charged with the responsibility for making the reports of the immediate superior [for FECA benefits, and] willfully fails, neglects, or refuses to make any of the reports, or knowingly files a false report...shall be fined...or imprisoned....") Thus, in connection with its response to OWCP's inquiry, the agency was required by law to disclose material facts and to respond truthfully. The question which remains is whether Ms. Anderson needed to disclose removal-related information to respond truthfully or to avoid concealing a material fact.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As part of its examination of Mr. Allen's workers' compensation claim, OWCP specifically asked the agency to describe any performance or conduct issues:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Was this employee generally able to perform required duties in accordance with expectations? Were there any performance or conduct problems? Please describe.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, Ms. Anderson explained that, "[a]s a result of Mr. Allen's failure to comply with the provisions of [his] leave restriction, Mr. Allen was charged with over 100 hours of absences without leave (AWOL) for 15 separate incidents of AWOL, and 12 incidents of failure to follow Instructions, as well as failure to participate in an OIG investigation." She further noted that, based on these issues, Mr. Allen's supervisor proposed his removal, and the agency decided to terminate Mr. Allen as of May 21, 2007.<span class="Italic"></span> She also submitted copies of Mr. Allen's Proposed Removal and Removal Decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the nature of OWCP's request, we cannot say that the Board's finding that the agency was required by law to disclose removal-related information was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Information regarding Mr. Allen's removal was material to OWCP's inquiry because, among other things, it spoke to the gravity of Mr. Allen's conduct problems--i.e., it showed that Mr. Allen's issues were sufficiently serious to warrant termination. Consequently, we find no error in the Board's conclusion that the agency did not breach the agreement when it disclosed removal-related information to OWCP.</p>

The agreement provided, as relevant here, that it "‘constitute[d] a full, complete, and final settlement of all differences and controversies,'" the appellant's official personnel file would be purged of all records relating to her removal, and the terms of the agreement would not be "‘publicized or divulged..., except as reasonably necessary to administer its terms.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting the agreement). After the agency referred some of the conduct underlying the appellant's <span id="Page_4845"></span>removal and revealed some of the terms of the agreement to local law enforcement authorities for investigation and possible prosecution, the appellant petitioned for enforcement of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1369-71. She asserted that the criminal referral breached the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1371-72. Alternatively, she sought to rescind the settlement agreement based on the alleged breach and reinstate her Board appeal of her removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1372.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge denied the appellant's petition for enforcement, the Board denied her petition for review of that initial decision, and the appellant appealed the Board's final decision to the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1371. The court noted the well-settled doctrine that contracts that violate public policy are unenforceable, and that the appellant's interpretation of the agreement would contravene public policy because it would bar a party from reporting possible crimes of another party to law enforcement authorities. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1373-78. The court did not rescind the agreement, however, but found that the agreement would be construed to permit the agency to make such criminal referrals. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1368, 1378.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Kavanagh v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 414 F. App'x 269 (Fed. Cir. 2010). There, in a settlement agreement of an IRA appeal, the appellant agreed that any claim stemming from his employment was resolved by the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 270. The agreement also included confidentiality provisions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. After the administrative judge dismissed the case as settled, the appellant filed a petition for review asserting that the agreement was unlawful. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. He claimed, in pertinent part, that the agreement prevented him from reporting fraud and other crimes against the United States. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board denied the petition for review, and the court affirmed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 269-70.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court rejected the appellant's contention that the agreement was unlawful because it prohibited him from reporting crimes to appropriate officials and entities. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 271. To avoid any public policy concerns such a prohibition would raise, it read the agreement as permitting such disclosures. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court reasoned that "[a] potentially ambiguous provision...does not automatically render the entire agreement unlawful and does not require rescission of the entire agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It therefore affirmed the dismissal of the case as settled. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 271-72.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant construes the agreement as preventing him from making certain whistleblower disclosures. Even assuming that this construction is correct and that it is against public policy, we find that the proper remedy in such a situation would not be to invalidate the agreement, but instead to interpret any offending provisions in a way that they would not violate public policy, consistent with the reasoning set forth in <span class="Italic">Fomby-Denson</span> and <span class="Italic">Kavanagh</span>. Thus, we find no basis to invalidate the settlement agreement based on a determination that any of its provisions violated a public policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having found that there is no basis for invalidating the settlement agreement, we turn to the scope and applicability of the waiver of appeal rights in the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Rhett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 178, &#x00B6; 17 (2010). The agreement provides, in relevant part, that in exchange for the promises made by the agency, the appellant "agrees not to institute a law suit under...the Whistleblower Protection Act." It also provides that the appellant "[w]aives, releases, and forever discharges the Agency...from any claims, complaints, demands, causes for actions, and damages arising out of his employment with the Agency." The agreement states that the appellant "agrees not to file any new complaints, claims, grievances, proceedings, appeals, or lawsuits in any judicial or administrative forum whatsoever (including the Merit Systems Protection Board...) against the Agency...arising out of his employment with the Agency, and all related matters." Finally, the settlement agreement provides that "no future claims or complaints of any kind arising out of Employee's past employment with the Agency will be pursued by Employee...except for the purposes of enforcing this agreement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As found by the administrative judge, the appellant has challenged in this IRA appeal personnel actions that occurred before he entered into the settlement agreement, during the 3-month extension of his appointment after he entered into the agreement, and after his separation from the agency. We first agree with the administrative judge that the agreement precludes him from challenging personnel actions that occurred before he entered into the agreement. This includes his claims that his supervisors extended his initial 3-year appointment by only 2 years and 1 year, respectively, publicly and privately mocked him and threatened him with adverse actions, asked him to leave senior staff meetings, told him that his appointment would not be renewed, revoked his access to NDU facilities and blocked him from sending emails using his agency account, changed his duties, downgraded his performance evaluation, attempted to initiate an ethics inquiry against him, and required him to sign the agreement. The agreement precludes the appellant from filing claims or complaints of any kind "arising out of [his] past employment with the Agency." Thus, he is precluded from challenging the actions listed above. <span class="Italic">See Vogel v. Department of the Navy</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 8 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not address the application of the agreement to incidents occurring after it was executed but before the appellant's employment ended due to the expiration of his final 3-month appointment. We find that the agreement precludes him from challenging personnel actions that occurred during this period. The agreement specifically precludes the appellant from filing an appeal with the Board "arising out of his employment with the Agency." The agreement contemplated that the appellant's "employment" would last until March 31, 2012. "[C]"ontract provisions must be read as part of an organic whole, according reasonable meaning to all of the contract terms." <span class="Italic">Lockheed Martin IR Imaging Systems, Inc. v. West</span>, 108 F.3d 319, 322 (Fed. Cir. 1997). "Such an interpretation must assure that no contract provision is made inconsistent, superfluous, or redundant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the agreement references both the appellant's "employment" and his "past employment." Giving effect to both of these terms, we find that the appellant's contention that the agency initiated a sham investigation of his allegations of wrongdoing after the agreement was signed, but before his employment with the agency ended, is similarly precluded by the settlement agreement waiver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming, however, that the waiver of Board appeal rights did not cover such alleged personnel actions, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant did not nonfrivolously allege that an investigation that the agency undertook during this period was a personnel action. While a retaliatory investigation may be a basis to grant additional corrective action if raised in connection with a covered personnel action, it is not itself a covered personnel action that may serve as the basis for an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Sistek v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 955 F.3d 948, 953-55 (Fed. Cir. 2020). Here, the appellant did not allege that he was the subject of the investigation such that disciplinary action could result (i.e., the investigation did not concern wrongdoing on the part of the appellant) or that the investigation resulted in a covered personnel action. Accordingly, he fails to meet his burden on this claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A settlement agreement was not unlawful when it did not include an OWBPA revocation clause. There was no age discrimination claim in the appeal that led to the settlement in <span class="Italic">Park v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-14-0275-I-1 (NP 11/3/2014). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-029.html#sec16-30">Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has not squarely addressed the effect of a conflict between a private settlement and a union contract, but in <span class="Italic">Goins v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 67 MSPR 211, 214 (1995), the agency should not have declined to implement a RIF called for by an agreement because the RIF arguably violated a union contract. Instead the agency should have instituted the RIF and followed the applicable procedures called for by the contract. The Board remanded the <span class="Italic">Goins</span> case to the region to determine what harm the appellant had suffered when her appointment was extended in lieu of operation of the RIF mandated by the settlement.</p>
