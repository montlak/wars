<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-98"><span class="space">b.</span> Probationary Supervisor</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A probationary supervisor or manager serves a probationary period as a supervisor and may during that time be demoted for poor performance to the nonsupervisory position held prior to the promotion (usually a downgrade). 5 USC 3321 provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Competitive service; probationary period</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The President may take such action, including the issuance of rules, regulations, and directives, as shall provide as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant for a period of probation--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;before an appointment in the competitive service becomes final; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;before initial appointment as a supervisor or manager becomes final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An individual--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;who has been transferred, assigned, or promoted from a position to a supervisory or managerial position, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;who does not satisfactorily complete the probationary period under subsection (a)(2) of this section,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">shall be returned to a position of no lower grade and pay than the position from which the individual was transferred, assigned, or promoted. Nothing in this section prohibits an agency from taking an action against an individual serving a probationary period under subsection (a)(2) of this section for cause unrelated to supervisory or managerial performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply with respect to appointments in the Senior Executive Service or the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration Senior Executive Service, or any individual covered by section 1599e of title 10.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Office of Personnel Management regulations implement the statutory scheme and define an MSPB appeal right for competitive service probationary managers and supervisors removed from those positions during probation. Under 5 CFR Part 315, Subpart I (2021):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 315.901 <span class="Italic">Statutory requirement</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. 3321 provides for "a period of probation...before initial appointment as a supervisor or manager becomes final." It also says that a supervisor or manager "who does not satisfactorily complete the probationary period...shall be returned to a position of no lower grade and pay than the position from which the individual was transferred, assigned or promoted." This subpart contains OPM regulations implementing those requirements of law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 315.902 <span class="Italic">Definitions</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this subpart <span class="Italic">supervisory position</span> and <span class="Italic">managerial position</span> have the meaning given them by the General Schedule Supervisory Guide.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 315.903 <span class="Italic">Coverage</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This subpart applies to appointments and positions without time limitation in the competitive civil service. Agencies may, at their option, apply these provisions to time-limited appointments and positions. This subpart does not apply to appointments or positions in the Senior Executive Service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 315.904 <span class="Italic">Basic requirement</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An employee is required to serve a probationary period prescribed by the agency upon initial appointment to a supervisory and/or managerial position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An employee is required to complete a single probationary period in a supervisory position and a single probationary period in a managerial position, regardless of the number of agencies, occupations, or positions in which the employee serves. However, an agency may by regulation provide for exceptions to the probationary period for managers who have satisfactorily completed a probationary period for supervisors when justified on the basis of performance and experience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Employees who, as of the date this requirement is effective, are serving or have served in Federal civilian supervisory or managerial positions without time limitation, or in time-limited supervisory or managerial positions under an official assignment exceeding 120 days, are exempt from its provisions, except that supervisors who are assigned to managerial positions may, according to agency regulations, be required to serve a probationary period for managers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 315.905 <span class="Italic">Length of the probationary period.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The authority to determine the length of the probationary period is delegated to the head of each agency, provided that it be of reasonable fixed duration, appropriate to the position, and uniformly applied. An agency may establish different probationary periods for different occupations or a single one for all agency employees.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An employee who is reassigned, transferred, or promoted to another supervisory or managerial position while serving a probationary period under this subpart is subject to the probationary period prescribed for the new position. Service in the former position counts toward completion of the probationary period in the new position. If the former position was supervisory and the new position managerial, service counts in the manner prescribed by agency regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Service on detail, temporary promotion, or reassignment to another supervisory or managerial position while serving probation is creditable toward completion of probation. Service in a nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial position is not creditable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Absence in nonpay status while on the rolls (other than for compensable injury or military duty) is creditable up to a total of 22 workdays. Absence (whether on or off the rolls) due to compensable injury or military duty is creditable in full upon restoration to Federal service. Nonpay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the probationary period by an equal amount.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Service during a probationary period from which an employee was separated or demoted for performance or conduct reasons does not count toward completion of probation required under a subsequent appointment.

However, the administrative judge seems to have erroneously relied on the rules for an initial appointment to the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b).

The regulation requires completion of a supervisory probationary period. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.904(b).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without mention of <span class="Italic">Dressler</span>, the Federal Circuit arrived at a similar result in <span class="Italic">Moulton-Miller v.

Under 5 USC 7512, adverse action procedures do not apply to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(C)&#x2003;the reduction in grade of a supervisor or manager who has not completed the probationary period under section 3321(a)(2) of this title if such reduction is to the grade held immediately before becoming such a supervisor or manager...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Applying the statute, <span class="Italic">Moulton-Miller</span> determined the Board lacked jurisdiction over placement of a competitive probationary supervisor into a nonsupervisory position despite the appellant's argument that prior service as an excepted service supervisor should count toward completion of the competitive service supervisory position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7512 provides a list of agency actions that fall within the Board's statutory jurisdiction, including, for example, "removal," a "reduction in pay," and a "reduction in grade." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Crucially for this case, &#x00A7; 7512(C) excludes from that list "the reduction in grade of a supervisor or manager who has not completed the probationary period under section 3312(a)(2) of this title if such reduction is to the grade held immediately before becoming such a supervisor or manager." Thus, for Ms. Mouton-Miller's demotion to be an agency action subject to Board review, she must have completed the probationary period referred to in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3312(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As described <span class="Italic">supra</span>, &#x00A7; 3312(a) permits the President to provide for a probationary period before appointments to the competitive service and to supervisory or manager positions become final. It expressly refers to the "competitive service" in both its title and in &#x00A7; 3312(a)(1) when describing the type of appointments for which the President may prescribe a probationary period. The accompanying regulations to &#x00A7; 3312 are found at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.901-315.909. These regulations state that employees who are "reassigned, transferred, or promoted to another supervisory or managerial position" while in the process of completing a probationary period may count "[s]ervice in the former position...toward completion of the probationary period in the new position." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.906(a). Thus, the regulations generally permit tacking when an individual is reassigned to a second supervisory role after beginning an initial supervisory probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But the regulations also explain that &#x00A7; 3312 applies to "appointments and positions without time limitation in the <span class="Italic">competitive</span> civil service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 315.903 (emphasis added). This provision, in conjunction with the title and language of &#x00A7; 3312 referring to the "competitive service," expressly limit tacking to two supervisory roles held in the competitive service, and exclude supervisory roles held in the excepted service. All positions in the Postal Service fall within the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See Van Skiver</span>, 9 M.S.P.R. at 381-82; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2102(a)(1)(A); 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 201, 1001. Thus, Ms. Mouton-Miller cannot tack her former supervisory position at the Postal Service onto her second supervisory position at Homeland Security for purposes of calculating her probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Mouton-Miller's reliance on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span> is therefore misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span>, as the Board noted, the plaintiff alleged that he was an "employee" under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii) because "current continuous service" included service in both the excepted and competitive service. <span class="Italic">See Fitzgerald</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. at 624-26. The Board concluded that--because "the language of the statute itself" contained no modification limiting "service"--"current continuous service" included both competitive and excepted service for the purpose of determining "employee" status under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 625-27.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, however, the question is not Ms. Mouton-Miller's "employee" status. It is whether Ms. Mouton-Miller completed her required supervisory probationary period under &#x00A7; 3321(a)(2), such that her non-retention in the supervisory position was an "adverse action," which depends on that agency action being outside the exclusion stated in &#x00A7; 7512(C). In non-precedential decisions, we have recognized that the interpretation of "current continuous service" under &#x00A7; 7511 is "irrelevant" to determining whether an individual is "subject to an appealable agency action" under &#x00A7; 7512. <span class="Italic">Koller v. Merit Systems Protection Bd</span>., 250 F. App'x 312, 314-15 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">see also Currie v. Merit Systems Protection Bd</span>., 679 F. App'x 995, 997 (Fed. Cir. 2017) ("We are unpersuaded that the Board has jurisdiction over [Currie's] appeal simply because he satisfied the definition of 'employee' under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii)."). We do so again here. Ms. Mouton-Miller completed less than the required one year of competitive service in her supervisory role with Homeland Security; she is thus excluded from seeking review before the Board under &#x00A7; 7512(C). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(C); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.908 (employees assigned to "a nonmanagerial or nonsupervisory position" who do not allege that their reassignment was based on marital status or partisan political affiliation have "no appeal right").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Mouton-Miller relies on this court's decision in <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002). But that decision is not helpful to her argument. <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> involved only the question of "employee" status under &#x00A7; 7511, not the question of the exclusion from "adverse action" review in &#x00A7; 7512(C). <span class="Italic">See McCormick</span>, 307 F.3d at 1341-43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.905 grants broad discretion to agencies to "determine the length of the probationary period." But Homeland Security has stated that it has no separate policy governing the supervisory probationary periods of its employees. Thus, we have no occasion to consider whether a separate agency policy permitting tacking between supervisory roles with the excepted service and the competitive service would be permissible under the applicable statutes and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because it is undisputed that Ms. Mouton-Miller spent less than one year in her supervisory position at Homeland Security and that her previous role at the Postal Service was in the excepted service, we conclude that she has not satisfied the required supervisory probationary period under &#x00A7; 3312 and that the Board therefore has no jurisdiction to review the agency's action, which comes within the exclusion stated in &#x00A7; 7512(C).</p>
<p class="Body-text"><span class="Italic">Cf. White v. DHUD</span>, DC-315I-16-0852-I-1 (NP 5/19/2022) ("We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's service at DOT does not count toward the supervisory probationary period here because she did not transfer to the Supervisory Budget Analyst position directly from her supervisory position at DOT. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.906(a)...the agency did not have a policy to make the service in the appellant's prior incomplete supervisory probationary period creditable for tacking that service to her most recent service for the purpose of completing her supervisory probationary period.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit was disinclined to extend tacking rights to probationary supervisors unless agency regulations require tacking, Hardy v. MSPB, 13 F.3d 1571, 1573-74 (Fed. Cir. 1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Hardy argues that the 117 days in which he acted as chief of the division prior to his official appointment to that position should be applied toward his probationary period. Office of Personnel Management regulations governing probation on initial appointment to a supervisory or managerial position refer to the Federal Personnel Manual for the conditions under which prior service is counted toward completion of a probationary period. 5 CFR 315.906 (1993). Chapter 315 of the FPM covers career and career conditional positions generally, and subchapter 8 of that chapter governs probation. In turn, subchapter 8 refers to Appendix A for the rules applicable to prior service in connection with a probationary period. See FPM Ch. 315, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8-2a, 8-2f (Sept. 19, 1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hardy argues that the board should have applied the test derived from Appendix A, and found that his prior service was creditable because it was rendered immediately preceding his official appointment, was with the same agency and was "in the same line of work." See FPM Ch. 315, App. A-3c (Sept. 19, 1989). However, we believe the provisions of <span id="Page_141"></span>Appendix A are not applicable to Hardy. Subchapter 9 of chapter 315 specifically covers probation on initial appointment to a supervisory or managerial position. While subchapter 8 refers to Appendix A for determining when service may be credited, subchapter 9 makes no reference to Appendix A, but provides its own rules for the crediting of prior service. See FPM Ch. 315 &#x00A7; 9-8 (Sept. 27, 1985). Because subchapter 9 carves out a special set of rules for probation on an initial appointment to a supervisory or managerial position, its provisions govern in this case, and the more general ones in subchapter 8 and, by reference, Appendix A, are inapplicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 9-8 deals with crediting service toward completion of the probationary period and provides in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;Temporary service prior to probation. (1) Agency policy may provide for the crediting of temporary service in a supervisory or managerial position under temporary appointment, promotion or reassignment. Prior service under detail may be credited only when a detail to a supervisory or managerial position is made permanent without a break.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FPM Ch. 315 &#x00A7; 9-8d. Under section 9-8d then, whether temporary prior service may be credited toward the probationary period following initial appointment to a supervisory or managerial position is a matter of agency policy. Assuming that service in an acting capacity is "temporary service" within the meaning of section 94d, Hardy offers no evidence that agency policy allows the crediting of his service. To the contrary, the government submitted evidence that under agency policy, his prior service should not be counted because it was not in excess of 120 days and was in an acting capacity. We see no error in the board's agreement that Hardy's prior service should not be counted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit considered the Board's review authority as to the return or demotion of a probationary supervisor to a nonsupervisory position at a lower grade, <span class="Italic">Currie v. MSPB</span>, 679 Fed. Appx. 995, 996-97 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3321(a)(2), an agency may set a period of probation for a newly appointed supervisor before that initial appointment as a supervisor becomes final. For an individual who has been transferred, assigned, or promoted from another federal position to a supervisory position, and who has not satisfactorily completed the probationary period, the agency may return the individual to a position of no lower grade and pay than the position from which the individual was transferred, assigned, or promoted. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3321(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.907(a). The regulations further provide that an employee who is subject to such a demotion may not appeal that demotion to the Board, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.908(a) (2015) ("An employee who, in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, is assigned to a nonmanagerial or nonsupervisory position, has <span class="Italic">no appeal right</span>." (emphasis added)), unless the employee alleges that the demotion was based on partisan political affiliation or marital status, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 315.908(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the record shows, and the Board correctly found, Currie was promoted from a nonsupervisory position to a supervisory position, subject to a one-year probationary period, which began on December 15, 2014. On November 10, 2015, due to his failure to satisfactorily complete the probationary period, he was demoted to the nonsupervisory position that he had held prior to his promotion, at the same grade and step level. Thus, Currie was demoted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3321 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.907(a). Furthermore, it is undisputed that Currie did not allege to the Board that his demotion was based on partisan political affiliation or marital status, and thus 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.908(b) does not apply to his appeal. Accordingly, the Board correctly concluded that &#x00A7; 315.908(a) precludes Currie from appealing his demotion to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are unpersuaded by Currie's argument that the Board had jurisdiction over his appeal simply because he satisfied the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). As indicated <span class="Italic">supra</span>, Currie was demoted under &#x00A7; 3321(a)(2) and (b) during a period of probation before his initial appointment as a supervisor became final. Such demotions are specifically excluded from the list of actions that an employee may appeal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(C). Consequently, even if Currie satisfied the definition of "employee" under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), the Board still lacks jurisdiction over his appeal because &#x00A7; 7512(C) precludes him from appealing his demotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we agree with the Board that our decision in <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> does not compel a different outcome. In <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, the employee appealed her <span class="Italic">removal</span> from federal employment, not a demotion under &#x00A7; 3321(a)(2) and (b) as in Currie's appeal. 307 F.3d at 1340-41 ("<span class="Italic">Removal</span> from employment is an appealable action where the individual qualifies as an 'employee' at the time of her removal by the agency." (emphasis added)). Here, as we have explained, &#x00A7; 7512(C) precludes Currie from appealing his demotion under &#x00A7; 3321(a)(2) and (b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, we find that the Board properly declined to consider Currie's arguments that the agency's reasons for demoting him were false or unjustified. Those arguments challenge the merits of the agency's demotion, which is beyond the jurisdiction of the Board....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The jurisdictional ramifications of an appeal from the termination of a probationary supervisor were also explored in <span class="Italic">Koller v. MSPB</span>, 250 Fed. Appx. 312, 314-16 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The scope of the Board's jurisdiction is defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a), which provides that an employee, or applicant for employment, may submit an appeal to the Board from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1327. Accordingly, the Board's jurisdiction is not plenary but is limited to those areas specifically granted by law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> For example, the Board has not been granted jurisdiction over the reduction in grade of a supervisor who has not completed a supervisory probationary period if the reduction is to the grade held immediately before becoming a supervisor. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(C); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.908(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are two types of probationary periods in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3321. The first type occurs upon initial appointment to a competitive position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3321(a)(1); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801. During initial probationary periods, agencies are free to terminate new hires who fail to demonstrate the qualifications for continued employment beyond the probationary period. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.804(a). The second type occurs upon initial appointment to a supervisory or managerial position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3321(a)(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.901. During supervisory probationary periods, agencies are not free to terminate first-time supervisors who fail to demonstrate the qualifications for continued employment in a supervisory position beyond the probationary period. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3321(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.907. Instead, agencies must return the first-time supervisors to "a position of no lower grade and pay than the position from which the individual was transferred, assigned, or promoted." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3321(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.907. Employees demoted during a supervisory probationary period have no appeal right to the Board unless they allege that the agency action was based on partisan political affiliation or marital status. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.908; <span class="Italic">Hardy v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 13 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Koller does not allege that his demotion was based on partisan political affiliation or marital status. Instead, Mr. Koller argues that he is entitled to appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) because he meets the definition of an "employee" as provided in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i) or (ii). Mr. Koller argues that he satisfies subsection (i) because he was not serving a probationary period under an initial appointment at the time of the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i). In the alternative, Mr. Koller argues that he satisfies subsection (ii) because he had completed one year of current continuous service at the time of the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). Mr. Koller cites <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Dep't of Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002) for the proposition that subsections (i) and (ii) are alternative methods for meeting the definition of an "employee" entitled to appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is irrelevant whether Mr. Koller satisfies the definition of an "employee" under section 7511 and <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> because he was not subject to an appealable agency action. Mr. Koller's arguments with respect to sections 7511 and 7513 overlook intervening section 7512, entitled "[a]ctions covered." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Section 7512(C) expressly provides that the subchapter containing sections 7511 and 7513 does not apply to "the reduction in grade of a supervisor or manager who has not completed the probationary period under section 3321(a)(2) of this title if such reduction is to the grade held immediately before becoming such a supervisor or manager." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(C). It is undisputed that the Agency reassigned Mr. Koller to the grade held immediately before becoming a supervisor. Thus, because we find that he did not complete his one-year supervisory probationary period at the time of the reassignment, Mr. Koller was not subject to an appealable agency action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Koller argues that he completed his supervisory probationary period based on the following facts: 1) he was serving a probationary period as a new hire under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315 Subpart H when the Agency promoted him to a supervisory position; 2) he concurrently served the probationary period as a new hire under Subpart H and a probationary period as a supervisor under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315 Subpart I; 3) he subsequently completed the probationary period as a new hire under Subpart H; and 4) 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.909(a) provides that where an employee concurrently serves probationary periods under Subparts H and I, completion of Subpart H fulfills the requirements of Subpart I. Thus, according to Mr. Koller's reasoning, he completed both probationary periods on May 16, 2006, approximately four months after his promotion to the supervisory position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Koller's reasoning, however, is based on a misunderstanding of Subpart I. Generally, "[s]ervice in a nonsupervisory or no[n] managerial position is not creditable" toward completion of the supervisory probationary period. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.906(b). Section 315.909(a) modifies this general rule under one particular circumstance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"If an employee is required to concurrently serve both a probationary period under this subpart and a probationary period under Subpart H of this part, the latter takes precedence and completion of the <span id="Page_142"></span>probationary period for competitive appointment and [sic] fulfills the requirements of this subpart."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This section applies where the two probationary periods are entirely concurrent, i.e., where an individual's initial appointment in the competitive service is to a supervisory position. It allows agencies to terminate new supervisors, rather than demote them to non-supervisory positions they never actually held. Mr. Koller cannot invoke this section to arbitrarily shorten his supervisory probationary period merely because a portion of it overlaps with his probationary period as a new hire. Such an interpretation would deprive agencies of a full probationary period to assess the performance of first-time supervisors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a final argument, Mr. Koller directs the court's attention to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(a), which limits the probationary period to one year that may not be extended. Mr. Koller argues that section 315.802(a) limits the aggregate of all career-conditional probationary periods, such that completion of a first career-conditional probationary period (e.g., for a competitive position) precludes imposition of a second career-conditional probationary period (e.g., for a supervisory position). [Applying] section 315.802(a), Mr. Koller concludes that both probationary periods ended on the one-year anniversary of his initial appointment to a competitive position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Koller's reasoning, however, confuses Subparts H and I. Section 315.802(a) is contained within Subpart H, which addresses probation on initial appointment to a competitive position. Section 315.802(a) is not contained within Subpart I, which addresses probation on initial appointment to a supervisory position. Accordingly, section 315.802(a) restricts the probationary period served by new hires, but it does not restrict the probationary period served by new supervisors. Thus, Mr. Koller cannot invoke this section to arbitrarily shorten his probationary period as a new supervisor merely because he completed a one-year probationary period as a new hire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we find that Mr. Koller has not met his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he had completed his one-year supervisory probationary period when the Agency reassigned him to his last previously held position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The former FPM precluded tacking of supervisory service during a detail prior to an individual's appointment as a probationary supervisor. Julius v. Dept. of Army, 35 MSPR 130, 133-35 (1987). Julius was qualified, as to probationary supervisor appeals, by Collins v. Dept. of Transp., 51 MSPR 697, 699 n.1 (1991), noting that the referenced FPM provisions (Subch. 9-4(b)(1) and (2)) concerned probationary periods only of employees serving in supervisory positions as of August 11, 1979.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A detail may not always be, in fact, a detail. If a collective bargaining contract has the effect of converting a detail to a temporary promotion, for example, the AJ must analyze the effect of the contractual provision on completion of the probationary period. <span class="Italic">Brushel v. VA</span>, 52 MSPR 49, 51 (1991) (concerning completion of a supervisory probationary period).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For earlier service to avoid a probationary supervisor period in the current position, the appellant must have completed a prior probationary supervisory position, <span class="Italic">Ellis-Smith v. DOD</span>, DC-315I-13-0266-I-1 (NP 7/10/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's own description of her previous federal service thus indicates that her service as a supervisor during the 13-month period from April 2009 to May 2010 in Afghanistan was done on a detail or temporary promotion, while her position of record remained as a Senior Contract Specialist in Wiesbaden, Germany.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute, OPM's implementing regulations, and the agency's regulations do not merely require that an individual have previously served as a supervisor in order to avoid a supervisory probationary period in a new appointment to a supervisory position; they require that the individual have successfully completed a probationary period in that previous service as a supervisor. The appellant has submitted no evidence indicating that she completed a supervisory probationary period during her service as a supervisor in 2009-2010, as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3321, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.904, and the agency's regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may be faced with an appeal presenting the question of whether a person classified by the agency as a probationary supervisor even needs to serve probation, i.e., whether a prior job entailed supervisory responsibilities and eliminated the requirement for a probationary supervisory appointment. It is then necessary to examine the totality of the circumstances to determine the nature of the appellant's former position. <span class="Italic">Ginocchi v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 62, 71 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The probationary supervisor who is not also in his or her first year of federal service is subject to involuntary return for poor performance during the first year of supervisory performance. But the Board accepts the case under its ordinary appeals procedure if the agency demotes the otherwise tenured probationary supervisor through ordinary adverse action procedures; it is immaterial that the agency arguably could have "returned" the employee as a probationer to the lower-level position held before promotion, <span class="Italic">Hoag v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 56 MSPR 449, 451 n.1 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addressing the reasonableness of the penalty, the administrative judge mentioned that, because the agency was going to return the appellant to his former position, it could arguably have processed its action against him under 5 CFR Part 315, Subpart I. These regulations provide that a probationary supervisor who, "for reasons of supervisory or managerial performance, does not satisfactorily complete the probationary period, is entitled to be assigned,...to a position in the agency of no lower grade and pay then the one the employee left to accept the supervisory or managerial position." 5 CFR 315.907(a). Absent an allegation of discrimination based on partisan political affiliation or marital status, such an employee does not have an appeal right to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 315.908. While an agency may not confer jurisdiction upon the Board where it does not otherwise exist, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Alvarez v. VA</span>, 49 MSPR 682, 686 (1991), it may choose to take an action against a probationary supervisory under either Chapter 43 or Chapter 75 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code, for reasons other than supervisory or managerial performance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 686, 694 n.5 (1992). Here, while the appellant's charged misconduct might arguably be related to his performance as a supervisor, the charge and underlying specifications are not performance-based. Instead, the agency charged the appellant with misconduct, invoked Chapter 75 procedures, and originally proposed to remove, rather than demote, the appellant. Accordingly, the administrative judge correctly found that this appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction as a Chapter 75 action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, if the agency follows the OPM regulatory procedures designed to return a probationary supervisor to his prior grade, the agency may do so irrespective of whether the supervisor's shortcomings are characterized as deficiencies in supervisory performance or conduct, <span class="Italic">De Cleene v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 71 MSPR 651, 654-56 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency reiterates that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal because probationary supervisors who, for failure to satisfactorily complete their probationary period, are returned to positions of no lower grade and pay than those from which they were promoted, have the right to Board review only if they allege that the agency actions against them resulted from discrimination based on partisan politics or marital status, and the appellant admittedly did not make such an allegation. It asserts that there is no legal authority for finding that an appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction as a "constructive" chapter 75 action where the agency proceeded, as here, under 5 CFR part 315, subpart I. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute that provides for a supervisory probationary period is 5 USC 3321(a)(2). Section (b) of that statute states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An individual--(1) who has been transferred, assigned, or promoted from a position to a supervisory or managerial position, and (2) who does not satisfactorily complete the probationary period under subsection (a)(2) of this section, shall be returned to a position of no lower grade and pay than the position from which the individual was transferred, assigned, or promoted. Nothing in this section prohibits an agency from taking an action against an individual serving a probationary period under subsection (a)(2) of this section for cause unrelated to supervisory or managerial performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of this statute is set out in the accompanying Senate Report. That report explained that, under the previous law, a person initially promoted to a supervisory position could be removed only through formal adversary proceedings. It stated that the reason for this amendment was to allow the removal of such a person if he or she did not satisfactorily complete the period of probation. It also provided that the person would be returned to a position of no lower pay and grade than the position occupied prior to the supervisory assignment. It noted that, although an individual may be serving subject to such a probationary period, "an agency may still institute adverse action proceedings for cause unrelated to supervisory or managerial performance and [that] the individual [would] have full appellate rights in those circumstances." S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 66 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, 2723, 2788.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory provision was implemented by regulations set forth at 44 Fed. Reg. 44,811 (1979) (codified at 5 CFR 315.901-.909). In its comments accompanying the regulations, the Office of Personnel Management acknowledged a suggestion that employees be permitted to appeal actions returning them to nonsupervisory positions to the Board. It stated, however, that "[g]ranting these probationers appeal rights to MSPB would defeat the basic program of the probationary period and would be inconsistent with the regulations covering other probationers under 5 CFR subpart H." 44 Fed. Reg. 44,811. Accordingly, under 5 CFR 315.908, employees reassigned under the provisions of subpart I have no appeal right to the Board unless they allege that the agency's action is based on partisan political affiliation or marital status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory provision and its legislative history demonstrate that, in changing the law, Congress specifically intended to provide for a supervisory probationary period. They reveal that Congress intended to protect an employee from being removed from federal employment simply because he did not perform well as a supervisor. They also make <span id="Page_143"></span>clear, however, that Congress intended to make it easier for an agency to remove an employee from a supervisory position during his probationary period if he failed to "satisfactorily complete" the probationary period. Indeed, this balance between guaranteed employee protection and increased management authority is the cornerstone of 5 USC 3321(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the statute nor the legislative history clearly states, however, that "supervisory or managerial performance" necessarily refers to the concept of "performance" that is embodied in an unacceptable performance action under 5 USC chapter 43. The word "performance," unless otherwise defined, has a common definition that can include many forms of "conduct," including misconduct that might normally be thought of as misconduct under 5 USC chapter 75. No statutory mandate requires the Board to make a firm distinction in these supervisory probationary cases between "misconduct" and "performance." Indeed, the Board has long held that an employee who engages in misconduct may be held to a higher standard if he encumbers a supervisory position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Sublette v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 68 MSPR 82, 90 (1995). It would impose an unnecessary difficulty on an agency to require it to isolate a probationary supervisor's misconduct from his status and performance as a supervisor. Such a technical requirement would serve no legitimate purpose and provide no necessary employee protection. The protection for the employee serving in a probationary supervisory status is in the "penalty" that Congress has established in the case of failure to satisfactorily complete the probationary period<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC 3321 (b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we hold that in cases such as this, in which the agency specifically invokes its authority under 5 USC 3321 to return an employee to a position at the grade level and pay from which he was promoted, the Board will not go behind that determination to evaluate whether the employee actually engaged in "misconduct" or unsatisfactory "performance." If the agency relies on this statutory authority, and the action involves only returning the employee to his prior grade level and pay, the Board will recognize the action as a supervisory probationary action and not fault the agency for not using chapter 75 or 43 procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, the only way the Board could consider the appellant's appeal would be if he had made a nonfrivolous allegation of discrimination based on partisan politics or marital status....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee is terminated from a probationary supervisor status, she may still be treated as a probationer under an initial appointment if the employee was promoted from but did not complete probationary under an immediately preexisting initial appointment, <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Army</span>, 119 MSPR 391, 398 &#x00B6; 16, 2013 MSPB 29 (2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The gravamen of the appellant's argument is that her promotion to supervisory Installation Transportation Officer somehow ended her initial appointment probationary period, which she began serving as a Training Technician 5 months earlier. It is not entirely clear whether the appellant is contending that she was no longer serving under "an initial appointment" or whether she is contending that an initial appointment probationary period cannot run concurrently with a supervisory probationary period. In either case, however, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant remained subject to her initial probationary period despite her subsequent promotion. The Office of Personnel Management's regulations explicitly address this situation: "A person who is...[p]romoted, demoted, or reassigned; before he completed probation is required to complete the probationary period in the new position." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801(b). There is simply no authority to support the proposition that supervisory and initial appointment probationary periods are mutually exclusive or that an employee cannot serve both types of probationary periods concurrently. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Flowers v. Department of the Navy</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 167, 171 n.5 (1993) (an employee appointed to a supervisory position may serve concurrent periods of probation, one on the initial appointment and one on the appointment to a supervisory position, with the former taking precedence).</p>
