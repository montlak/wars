<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-203"><span class="space">1.</span> Separation for Reason Other Than Result of Injury or Illness</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Miller v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 336, 337 (1980):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal employees entitled to restoration to their former or equivalent positions under 5 U.S.C. 8151 (b), upon recovery from a compensable work-related injury, include those who were "...separated or furloughed from a position without time limitation as a result of a compensable injury...." 5 C.F.R. 353.103(c) (1). Thus, an employee who was removed for cause has no right to restoration simply because he or she received disability compensation subsequent to removal. The separation or furlough had to have resulted from the compensable injury alone in order for restoration rights to accrue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit noted the significance of removal for cause on restoration rights, <span class="Italic">Cox v. MSPB</span>, 817 F.2d 100, 100 (Fed. Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cox seeks restoration to his former or equivalent position on the ground that he was "separated or furloughed from a position without time limitation as a result of a compensable injury." 5 C.F.R. Sec. 353.103(c)(1) (1986). Cox proffered as evidence of his compensable injury his receipt of Office of Workers Compensation Programs (OWCP) benefits for the period of August 1, 1981, to July 1, 1985. The existence of a compensable injury is not enough, however, to bring Cox within section 353.103(c)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Be definition, separation as a result of a compensable injury excludes a valid removal for cause unrelated to the employee's compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Personnel Manual, ch. 353 at 2-6(a)(1) (1978). Effective September 5, 1981, Cox was removed from his air traffic controller position for striking against the federal government. In his appeal from the removal, the board rejected his defense that he was sick and unable to work during the period of the strike. <span class="Italic">Allmon v. Department of Transportation, FAA,</span> 18 M.S.P.R. 569, 572 (1984). That he later was able to obtain temporary workman's compensation benefits for his disability does not override the previous adjudication that he was an active striker. The OWCP decision is not the result of an adversarial adjudication, and, in any event, does not bind the board. <span class="Italic">Accord Miller v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. 210, 213 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Cox relied solely on the OWCP decision and offered no evidence in support of his assertion that his removal was related to his disability, he failed to carry his burden of proof under 5 C.F.R. Sec. 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)] to show that his separation resulted from or was substantially related to his compensable injury. Accordingly, the board correctly determined that it lacks jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Muhleisen v. VA</span>, DE-0353-16-0067-I-1 (NP 3/2/2023), noted some inconsistencies in the law concerning the connection between a compensable injury and the reasons for the employee's service separation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]lthough the restoration regulations speak only in terms of an employee separated "as a result of a compensable injury," the Board has interpreted this to mean that the separation was "substantially related to" a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mobley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 6 (2000); <span class="Italic">Wright v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 122, 128, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 42 F.3d 1410 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); <span class="Italic">Brown-Cummings v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 627, 630 (1989).[5]...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;However, as the administrative judge pointed out in the initial decision, 0067 ID at 11, a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision suggests that the Board should apply a more stringent standard, in which the appellant's compensable injury must be the "sole cause" of the absence from his or her position for purposes of a partial restoration case. <span class="Italic">Walley v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Walley v. VA</span>, 279 F.3d 1010, 1016 n.6 (Fed. Cir. 2002), cited in <span class="Italic">Muhleisen, supra,</span> was equivocal on MSPB's interpretation of the causation standard:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have noted in previous decisions of this court, the Board has broadly read this regulation to allow an employee who fully recovers after more than one year to claim priority consideration for restoration when the individual's removal is for reasons "substantially related to" her compensable injury, even though the regulation only provides for priority consideration when the individual is separated "because of a compensable injury." <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">New</span>, 142 F.3d at 1261; <span class="Italic">Wright v. United States Postal Serv</span>., 62 M.S.P.R. 122, 128, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 42 F.3d 1410 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (table). We accept this broad interpretation for the present case, without holding whether or not it is the proper interpretation of the regulation. However, this expansive reading does not alter the requirement that the separation be solely attributable to the compensable injury.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Payton v. DHS</span>, 113 MSPR 463, 465-67 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11, 2010 MSPB 61 (2010), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Payton v. DHS</span>, 403 Fed. Appx. 496 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>, stressed the significance of removal for cause unrelated to a compensable injury in a reemployment rights appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who has been separated is entitled to the reemployment priority rights described above if her separation either resulted from, or was substantially related to, a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Chamberlain v. Department of the Navy,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 626, 631 (1991); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.103(b), 353.108. However, an employee who has been removed for cause, other than for a compensable injury, is not entitled to restoration, and cannot appeal any failure of restoration to the Board. <span class="Italic">Frye v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6; 9 (2006); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.302. A valid reason for separation, unrelated to a compensable injury, precludes restoration rights, even if the separation was also related to a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">Mobley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 7 (2000) (citing <span class="Italic">New v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 142 F.3d 1259, 1265 (Fed. Cir. 1998)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have indicated above, the appellant's 2004 removal was based on four charges in addition to the AWOL charge mentioned above. That is, it was based in part on charges that the appellant recklessly disregarded the safety of others, was insubordinate, failed to follow instructions, and engaged in unprofessional conduct. Although, as noted above, the <span id="Page_4445"></span>appellant alleged that the AWOL charge was related to her compensable injury, she did not claim in the instant appeal that any of the four other charges on which her removal was based were related to that injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has asserted that the agency "bogusly" removed her after she was injured, implying that the charges on which the agency stated that it was removing her were not the real reasons for the action, and that the agency instead removed her because it did not want to retain an injured employee. However, as noted above, the charges on which she was removed were sustained on appeal, i.e., found to be proper and adequate bases for her removal. Moreover, any attempt by the appellant to challenge the charges or the removal itself would be precluded under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. <span class="Italic">See Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995) (<span class="Italic">res judicata</span> precludes parties from relitigating issues that were, or could have been, raised in the prior action, and is applicable if: (1) the prior judgment was rendered by a forum with competent jurisdiction; (2) the prior judgment was a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the same cause of action and the same parties or their privies were involved in both cases).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we find that the appellant's assertions, even if substantiated, would not establish that her removal was based only on reasons related to her compensable injury. Accordingly, we concur in the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant has failed to establish jurisdiction over her appeal. The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Payton v. DHS</span>, 403 Fed. Appx. 496, 497-98 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), affirmed the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee whose separation is the result of a compensable injury, and whose full recovery takes longer than one year from the date she became eligible for compensation, is entitled to priority consideration for restoration to the position she left, or an equivalent one, provided she applies for restoration in a timely manner. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b). Such an employee who has been denied restoration may appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 353.304(b). However, where an employee has been removed for cause, unrelated to the employee's compensable injury, she is not entitled to restoration, and thus cannot appeal any failure to restore. <span class="Italic">New v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 142 F.3d 1259, 1265 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">see also Minor v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 819 F.2d 280, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Cox v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 817 F.2d 100, 101 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Where removal is based on multiple charges, some of which relate to a compensable injury, the employee is not entitled to restoration if the remaining charges are not related to the injury. <span class="Italic">New,</span> 142 F.3d at 1265.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While Payton argues that two of the charges upon which her removal was based are related to her compensable injury, she does not claim that the remaining charges relate to that injury. Final Order, 113 M.S.P.R. at 466. We agree with the Board that "[Payton's] assertions, even if substantiated, would not establish that her removal was based only on reasons related to her compensable injury." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 466-67. Because Payton's removal was in part based on charges unrelated to her compensable injury--namely failure to follow instructions and reckless disregard for the safety of others--she is not entitled to restoration, and thus possesses no right of appeal to the Board. As the Board correctly held, she cannot at this stage challenge the decision affirming removal, as that decision was sustained in the earlier Board proceeding. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The concept of the substantial relation between a compensable injury and the reason for separation from the federal service was developed in <span class="Italic">Mobley v. USPS</span>, 86 MSPR 161, 164-67 &#x00B6; 5-12 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To have any restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. part 353 based on a compensable injury, an individual must first establish that he was "separated or furloughed from an appointment without time limitation...<span class="Italic">as a result of</span> a compensable injury...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.103(b) (emphasis added). Thus, such a nexus between a compensable injury and the employee's separation or furlough is the primary jurisdictional requirement in a restoration appeal such as this. <span class="Italic">See Cox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 817 F.2d 100, 101 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The appellant has the burden of proof to establish the Board's jurisdiction over his appeal. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(I) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A "compensable injury" is a medical condition accepted by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) to be job-related and for which medical or monetary benefits are payable from the Employees' Compensation Fund. <span class="Italic">See Bartol v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 106, 108-09 (1995); <span class="Italic">Brumley v.

The phrase "as a result of a compensable injury" has been interpreted by the Board to mean that the separation (or furlough) was "substantially related to" the compensable injury. <span class="Italic">Wright v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 122, 128, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 42 F.3d 1410 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); <span class="Italic">Ruppert v.

Regarding the meaning of "substantially related," the court in <span class="Italic">New</span> described <span class="Italic">Cox</span>, 817 F.2d at 101, as standing for the proposition that an employee's "receipt of workers' compensation benefits is not conclusive proof that [his] removal is substantially related to his compensable injury" and that the employee must "demonstrate that no cause aside from his compensable injury precipitated his removal." <span class="Italic">New,</span> 142 F.3d at 1264.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant here held an EAS-15 position of Address Management Systems Specialist at the time of his disability retirement in 1994, and the record shows he filed numerous OWCP claims. In 1982, he filed a claim for "stress" which OWCP denied. In 1989, he filed a claim for "major depression" which OWCP denied. In February 1993, the appellant filed a claim for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and back problems, which OWCP accepted for "cervical strain, upper back strain, lower back strain, myofascial pain syndrome, headaches, left shoulder strain, bilateral elbow strains and bilateral wrist strains. The AJ found "it...clear that the [carpal tunnel syndrome] for which the appellant ultimately retired was, at one time, determined to be job related. However, contrary to the AJ's finding, OWCP never accepted carpal tunnel syndrome itself as a compensable condition, and only accepted the lesser condition of bilateral wrist strains. OWCP paid medical benefits for these accepted conditions, and in March 1993, the agency placed the appellant on limited duty, with typing restrictions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 2, 1993, the appellant stopped working and filed an OWCP claim, asserting that his inability to work was due to the conditions previously accepted as compensable. OWCP denied the claim. OWCP noted that the appellant suffered from "pre-existing diabetes, hypertension, chronic achilles and heel spurs, irritable bowel syndrome, depression, tension and fibromyalgia" and that the evidence showed that his inability to work was due to his noncompensable hypertension rather than due to any compensable condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant returned to work in January 1994, but stopped working again soon thereafter, and filed another OWCP claim; he claimed that he suffered a traumatic psychiatric injury on January 25, 1994, due to a verbal altercation with a co-worker. OWCP also denied this claim, noting that the medical evidence established that the appellant suffered from major depression with anxiety since 1990, but did not establish that his psychiatric condition was caused by the employment incident.<span class="Italic"></span> After the appellant stopped working due to the verbal altercation at work, the agency ordered him to undergo a psychiatric fitness-for-duty examination. He failed to report for a fitness-for-duty examination scheduled in July 1994. He subsequently retired on disability in August 1994, as noted above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reviewed that part of the record containing portions of the appellant's disability retirement application; it does not contain any determination by OPM regarding the basis on which it granted disability retirement. The appellant did not submit the portion of his disability retirement application explaining why he was applying for disability retirement. On his application for disability retirement, his supervisor certified on July 1, 1993, that "his inability to perform keyboard assignments" had "an adverse effect on the productivity of this unit." Another agency official indicated on the appellant's disability retirement application that the appellant could not be accommodated due to the severity of his medical conditions, and referred to various medical reports including those by Robert Pinkus, a Licensed Clinical Social Worker who treated the appellant's psychiatric conditions, and by a Dr. Lomis, who treated him for his hypertension. In fact, the appellant stated, in his letter requesting reinstatement, that he retired on disability not only because of his carpal tunnel syndrome, but also because of "hypertension and diabetes," as well as "severe manic depression. And on review, he contends that he retired because the agency told him in a letter that his failure to attend the scheduled medical examination could result in his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the AJ's finding, the record does not show that the appellant's compensable bilateral wrist strain, or any other compensable condition, was the primary, or even a particular, cause of his disability retirement. Rather, it appears from the record that the reasons for his retirement included other serious medical conditions, including hypertension and psychiatric illness, as well as his desire to avoid being removed for refusal to undergo a fitness-for-duty examination. Under these circumstances, it cannot be stated, as the AJ did, that "it is clear that the injury for which the appellant ultimately retired was, at one time, determined to be job related. Nor can it be stated that "no cause aside from his compensable injury precipitated" his separation, <span class="Italic">New,</span> 142 F.3d at 1264, or that there were no reasons for his separation other than those related to his compensable injury, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1265. We therefore conclude that the appellant failed to meet his jurisdictional burden of establishing that his separation by disability retirement was substantially related to any compensable injury. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.103(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4446"></span><span class="Italic">Koshy v. USPS</span>, DA-3443-21-0311-I-1 (NP 5/5/2022), noted the need for reasonably specific allegations relating medical difficulties with separation from employment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant seemingly argues that he suffered a compensable injury, i.e., "significant hardships and mental trauma due to the unlawful decisions" of agency human resources personnel. Federal employees, including Postal Service employees, who suffer on-the-job compensable injuries enjoy certain rights to be restored to their previous or comparable positions. <span class="Italic">See Tat v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 562, &#x00B6; 9 (2008); 5 C.F.R. part 353. To be entitled to any such rights, an employee must have been "separated or furloughed from an appointment without time limitation...as a result of a compensable injury." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.103(b). Here, however, the appellant's vague references to hardships and mental trauma do not confer jurisdiction on the Board or otherwise warrant a different outcome. Indeed, the appellant does not discernably allege that he suffered an on-the-job injury; rather, he ostensibly alleges that he experienced mental hardship and trauma when agency human resources personnel removed him from his position. Thus, we agree that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the matter.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">This is a petition for review of a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB" or "Board"), filed pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703. The Board's decision affirmed the United States Postal Service's ("USPS" or "Postal Service") refusal to restore petitioner to employment after he recovered from a job injury more than one year from the commencement of compensation benefits. Petitioner requests that the decision be set aside as contrary to section 22(b)(2) of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2). The petition is granted, for we find that the Board's decision is "not in accordance with law," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703. Accordingly, the decision is vacated and the Board is directed to order petitioner reinstated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I.&#x2003;BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner John Raicovich worked at the Hialeah, Florida Post Office for eighteen years between 1954 and 1972. On September 28, 1972, he sustained a disabling injury in the course of his official duties. He was retained on the Postal Service rolls on "Leave Without Pay" status and began receiving disability compensation. Because of his continued absence exceeding one year, he was removed from the Postal Service rolls on December 28, 1973, but continued receiving disability benefits until December 5, 1979.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 18, 1979, petitioner wrote to the Postmaster at Hialeah, Florida, John Anderson, to inform the Postal Service that a recent medical examination indicated fitness for reemployment and to request reinstatement. Petitioner renewed his request for reinstatement on December 3, 1979. It is undisputed that vacancies then existed and that those vacancies were ultimately filled by new employees. However, on January 17, 1980, the Miami Sectional Center Director of Employee and Labor Relations advised petitioner that reinstatement was "not automatic" and that "after a careful review" of petitioner's previous work record, reinstatement was denied. Postmaster Anderson offered clarification shortly thereafter. He explained that a "careful review" of petitioner's "work performance while an employee" indicated that petitioner's reinstatement was "not...in the best interests of the Postal Service." Postmaster Anderson also advised petitioner of his right to appeal to the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner appealed to the MSPB and a Presiding Official conducted a hearing on March 21, 1980. The Postal Service's case was based upon its understanding that applicants such as petitioner were merely entitled to "priority consideration" (or, as termed in the USPS's response to petitioner's application, "careful review") and that such consideration was properly informed by a former employee's previous work record. Thus, Fred Valdez, Delivery Supervisor, and Postmaster Anderson testified that petitioner had been subject to three disciplinary suspensions (a two-day suspension, effective December 6, 1969; a fourteen-day suspension, effective June 21, 1971); and a thirty-day suspension, effective January 8, 1972), and that petitioner had ten job-related accidents. There was also testimony about petitioner's use of sick leave. On cross-examination, it was conceded that there were no charges pending against petitioner at the time of his disabling injury, that there had been no effort to remove him prior to that time, that there was no evidence that the ten accidents were willful, and that there was nothing to suggest that petitioner abused sick leave. Moreover, petitioner argued that consideration of his previous work record was improper. The Presiding Official, however, affirmed the Postal Service's decision not to reinstate petitioner. In affirming, the Presiding Official stated that petitioner did not have "an absolute right to reemployment"; that he was "entitled only to priority consideration"; and that "the decision whether to reemploy...may be based upon any valid, work-related considerations," including an employee's previous work record. The Presiding Official rejected the notion that a previous work record could be considered only when a disciplinary action which might lead to removal was pending at the time of the compensable injury. "The more reasonable standard," said the Presiding Official, "is whether the agency can reasonably expect the recovered employee to be competent and effective. To the extent that a...previous work record aids...that determination, it may be considered." The Presiding Official concluded that petitioner's previous work record justified the agency's refusal to reemploy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision of the Presiding Official was affirmed by the Board, which relied only upon petitioner's three disciplinary suspensions-especially the last which occurred within nine months of the compensable injury-as a basis for denying restoration. The Board found it unnecessary to consider whether non-disciplinary aspects of petitioner's previous work record could properly be taken into account. The case was then brought here for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;The Statute and Implementing Amendments</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 1974 Amendments to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act were designed "to modernize and update" the federal compensation system so that it would continue to serve as "a model of efficient and equitable compensation for workers injured in the performance of their duties." 120 Cong. Rec. 13399 (1974) (remarks of Rep. Daniels). <span class="Italic">See also id.</span> at 27673 (remarks of Sen. Williams); H.R. Rep. No. 1025, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 1-2 (1974) (hereinafter H.R. Rep.); S. Rep. No. 1081, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 1-2 (1974) (hereinafter S. Rep.), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News, p. 5341. A "key provision" of the Amendments established certain job retention rights for federal employees, including Postal Service employees. Cong. Rec. 27674 (1974) (remarks of Sen. Williams). That provision states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;Under regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management-</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;the department or agency which was the last employer shall immediately and unconditionally accord the employee, if the injury or disability has been overcome within one year after the date of commencement of compensation or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States, the right to resume his former or an equivalent position, as well as all other attendant rights which the employee would have had, or acquired, in his former position had he not been injured or disabled, including his rights to tenure, promotion, and safeguards in reductions-in-force procedures, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span id="Page_4447"></span>(2)&#x2003;the department or agency which was the last employer shall, if the injury or disability is overcome within a period of more than one year after the date of commencement of compensation, make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing, the employee in his former or equivalent position within such department or agency, or within any other department or agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b). The provision guarantees an injured employee who recovers within a year from the commencement of compensation "the right to return to his former position or an equivalent one." 120 Cong. Rec. 13399 (1974) (remarks of Rep. Daniels). For a former employee such as petitioner, whose disability exceeds one year, "the employing agency or department is to accord...priority in employment...." <span class="Italic">Id. See, also id.</span> at 13402 (remarks of Rep. Gaydos), 27674 (remarks of Sen. Williams), 27675 (remarks of Sen. Javits); H.R. Rep. at 10; S. Rep. at 4, 12. "(A)ll reasonable efforts" to reemploy such former employees must be made. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(c) (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> made generally applicable to Postal Service employees).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no legislative explanation of "all reasonable efforts" or "priority to placing (the applicant)...in his former or equivalent position." Clearly, (b)(2) applicants are not guaranteed reemployment, as are (b)(1) applicants. The continued absence of an injured employee for over a year might naturally require the employing agency to replace him permanently. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. Postal Service Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM), Part 545.91, reprinted in Postal Bulletin, RB-21215 (Oct. 22, 1979) (extended leave policy; separation from service authorized if an employee is not likely to return to work). In such a case, the statute would, however, require the agency to make "all reasonable efforts to place" the former employee in an equivalent position or in any future vacancy, and in so doing, to "accord (him) priority."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1978, OPM was charged with implementing the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Adm. News 2723. In fulfillment of its charge, OPM has provided that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee who was separated because of a compensable injury and whose recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to priority consideration for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of cessation of compensation. (See Parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for more information on how this may be accomplished for the excepted and competitive services, respectively.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.07 (emphasis added). Under this regulation, an application for reemployment by a former employee whose disability exceeds one year is entitled to "priority consideration." "Priority consideration" is, in a case involving the Postal Service (an excepted service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8101(1)(A)), defined by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302. Section 302.202 requires agencies to establish "qualification standards such as those relating to experience and training, citizenship, minimum age, physical condition, etc., which shall relate to the duties to be performed." The standards established must be a matter of public record, available to all applicants, and must be applied uniformly. In addition, section 302.203 allows the agency to adopt disqualifying factors, which may include:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Dismissal from employment for delinquency or misconduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;Criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;Intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d)&#x2003;Habitual use of intoxicating beverages to excess;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(e)&#x2003;Reasonable doubt as to the loyalty of the person involved to the Government of the United States;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(f)&#x2003;Any legal or other disqualification which makes the individual unfit for the service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(g)&#x2003;Lack of United States citizenship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service implemented the OPM regulations in Part 546.1 of the ELM. This provision simply reiterates the restoration rights of disabled employees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.307 by guaranteeing reemployment to those who overcome their job injury within one year, Part 546.121, and by requiring the USPS to give "priority consideration" to those who overcome their job injury after one year, Part 546.131. For the latter group, a reemployment list is established. That list is divided into two categories: category one includes those entitled to a ten-point veterans' preference; category two includes all other recovered former employees. Recruitment must begin with the veterans group. Next, members of the second group must be considered. And only after that, can those without previous Postal Service association be considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government also commends our attention to Part 313.5 of the Postal Service's Personnel (P-11) Handbook, which states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">.51 General. An eligible may be omitted from consideration for employment because of previous unsatisfactory service. This may include postal, private sector, or other agency employment, including debarment by the Office of Personnel Management. The service must have been long enough to be considered a full and fair trial, and the character of the service must have been such that the eligible is unlikely to be able to perform satisfactorily in the new position....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">.522 Excessive tardiness or absence, or poor conduct in previous postal employment (even though no disciplinary action was taken at the time of resignation), could justify eliminating an eligible from consideration, if the service was recent and there is no indication that the individual has improved work habits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government points to this provision as a disqualifying factor, promulgated pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.203. However, this provision of the Handbook applies only to routine applications for employment. Applications by former employees seeking restoration under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b) are covered by Part 218.2 of the Handbook, which refers to the statute, the OPM regulations and subchapter 540 of the ELM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Former employees who have been receiving compensation for job-related injury or illness incurred during their postal employment are granted, upon recovery, certain restoration rights by 5 USC 8151, and implementing regulations in 5 C.F.R. Part 353. Basically, the statute provides that the former employee must be immediately and unconditionally restored to the former or equivalent position if fully recovered within one year of the commencement of compensation. If the employee fully recovers more than one year after the commencement of compensation, the USPS will make all reasonable efforts to place (and give priority to placing) the employee in the former or equivalent position. <span class="Italic">See</span> ELM 540.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.202 expressly requires agencies to establish and publish qualification standards for the reemployment of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2) applicants and to apply them uniformly. The Postal Service satisfied that requirement by promulgating Part 546 of the ELM. Part 313.5 of the Postal Service Personnel Handbook does not satisfy the OPM requirement because it was not published pursuant to &#x00A7; 302.202 and because it appears to allow <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span>, rather than "uniform(&#8197;)," decisions on the basis of past work performance to be made regarding employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Administrative Interpretation of the Statute and Regulation</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The basis of the Board's final decision to reject Raicovich's application for reemployment was a history of three disciplinary actions over an eighteen year period of service. The Board supported its decision with a recent precedent, <span class="Italic">Thompson v. United States Postal Service,</span> MSPB Docket No. DA035399002 (March 26, 1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Thompson</span> also involved an application for reinstatement by a former USPS employee who recovered from a work injury after one year from the commencement of compensation. The Postal Service had denied Thompson's application because his previous work performance and conduct indicated that reemployment would "not be in the best interest of the agency." On appeal to the MSPB, the agency claimed, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that Thompson "had had a series of disciplinary problems, beginning in April of 1972 and culminating with a fourteen-day suspension that was issued but not served because (Thompson) incurred his back injury and went on disability" before the suspension could be served. The Presiding Official found that the agency failed to afford Thompson priority as required by the statute and OPM regulations. The Board reversed and remanded, relying upon 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b), 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 302 and 353.307, and, significantly, Part 313.5 of the Postal Service's Handbook, finding that the Presiding Official had "erroneously" failed to consider Thompson's previous unsatisfactory service. Under Part 313.5 of the Handbook, concluded the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">previously unsatisfactory service may be deemed a proper disqualifying factor under the following circumstances: (1) the kind of work-related behavior that may be encompassed by that factor must be limited to behavior of such a nature as to warrant disciplinary action; (2) the agency must have taken or not had sufficient time to take reasonably prompt action against such behavior; and (3) the incidence of the behavior warranting disciplinary action must have been not long prior to the date on which the former employee began receiving disability compensation, so as to indicate that the former employee had not reformed or improved his or her behavior with respect to the performance of the duties of his or her former position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, slip op. at 11-12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that, for all relevant purposes, <span class="Italic">Thompson</span> is <span id="Page_4448"></span>indistinguishable from the present case. Although the final suspension was not served in <span class="Italic">Thompson,</span> it had been imposed. Had Thompson not been injured, he would only have been suspended for two weeks. Thus, even though Raicovich had served his final thirty-day suspension eight months before his injury, his situation is substantially similar to Thompson's. Therefore, by vacating the agency's decision here, we also signal our disagreement with <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>: Part 313.5 ought not have been consulted; an agency may not take account of previous unsatisfactory service in cases such as <span class="Italic">Thompson</span> and this one where that service would not have resulted in dismissal had the injury not occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;Raicovich's Petition</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner argues that the Board's decision is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute, the legislative history and implementing regulations. We agree. The statute requires agencies to "make all reasonable efforts to place" former employees who have required over one year to recover from a job injury and, in so doing, to "accord (them) priority." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b) (2). Neither statutory obligation was fulfilled by the agency: after examining his previous employment record, no effort was made to place petitioner in his former or an equivalent position; and moreover, petitioner's application for reinstatement was denied while other applicants with no prior USPS association were being hired. It would be a perversion of the statute, indeed, were we to agree with the government and to allow an agency to disregard its statutory obligations because of an applicant's past misconduct which did not result in dismissal.[7] To do so would be tantamount to permitting double punishment for the same misdeed in the guise of implementing a statute enacted to confer additional benefits on injured workers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Counsel for the government acknowledged at oral argument that petitioner could not have been dismissed at the time of his injury on the basis of the three disciplinary incidents. Moreover, he acknowledged that had petitioner recovered and sought reinstatement within a year of the disabling injury, restoration would have been mandatory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2) is not especially illuminating. The House and Senate Reports do little more than repeat the plain language of the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. at 3-4, 10; H.R. Rep. at 4, 12. Similarly, those who expressed themselves during the floor debates added little to the statutory language. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 120 Cong. Rec. 13397-402, 27672-76 (1974). However, it appears in general that by enacting the 1974 Amendments to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, Congress sought to do everything feasible to compensate and reinstate federal employees injured in the line of duty: during the period of their disability they were to incur no loss of benefits; if they recovered within a year, reemployment was guaranteed; and if their recovery took longer, all reasonable efforts were to be made to place them in their former job or an equivalent position, and priority was to be accorded them in securing a position. In short, Congress sought to accord injured workers treatment equal to that which they would have received but for their injury. They are not to be accorded greater rights than they would have had had employment been continuous, but certainly they are not to suffer any loss of rights or benefits because of an injury received in the course of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 120 Cong. Rec. 13400 (remarks of Rep. Esch). Thus, it would be totally inconsistent with the statutory purpose to refuse to rehire a recovered former employee on the basis of prior conduct for which he was not dismissed. On the other hand, if during the period of compensation, a former employee engaged in conduct which would have resulted in expulsion from service had he then been employed, we agree that that would be an appropriate matter of consideration on an application for restoration. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.203. Similarly, if the former employee engaged in conduct shortly before his injury which would have resulted in dismissal but for the intervening injury, that too may be considered a disqualifying factor. Here, however, petitioner's previous misconduct did not rise to a level requiring expulsion, but, in fact, produced only disciplinary suspension ranging from two to thirty days.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Even if the last sanction for misconduct had not yet been served because of an intervening injury, as in <span class="Italic">Thompson,</span> punishment upon application and reentry could be no greater than that which would have been imposed had service been continuous. (In <span class="Italic">Thompson,</span> petitioner should have been subjected to no more than a two week suspension, not refusal to restore.) In this case, vacancies existed, petitioner was an employee in good standing at the time of his injury, and nothing occurring before or after the injury has since come to light to disqualify petitioner. Therefore, refusal to restore was not in accordance with the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The actions of the Postal Service are also alleged to be contrary to OPM's regulations implementing the statute. Although the regulations, interestingly, speak of "priority consideration" rather than "priority in placing," if we are to interpret them in a manner consistent with the statute, they are not satisfied by according merely procedural priority rather than substantive priority. Thus, the government's suggestion at oral argument that the regulations could be satisfied by according "prompt," "special," "individual" or even "careful"-to use the word appearing in the USPS letters to Mr. Raicovich--consideration, where such consideration includes prior unsatisfactory service, cannot be accepted. To comport with the statute, priority consideration requires that a former employee in good standing at the time of his injury, who has not engaged in egregious behavior of the sort enumerated in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.203, must be placed on an appropriate priority employment list and reemployed when vacancies arise. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 302.303 and 302.304 (Maintenance of employment lists; Arrangement of ratings). A 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2) applicant may only be disqualified from restoration for the same conduct that would have justified his discharge if he were continuously employed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, the petition is granted, the decision of the Board is set aside, and the Board is directed to order petitioner reinstated to his former or equivalent position with all attendant benefits, and to make him whole for all losses suffered since termination of compensation benefits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Raicovich</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board had a different approach as to factors that could disqualify an employee from the exercise of restoration rights. <span class="Italic">Thompson v. USPS</span>, 5 MSPR 228, 231-39 (1981) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Thompson v. USPS</span>, 18 MSPR 175 (1983), <span class="Italic">post</span>), discussed in <span class="Italic">Raicovich,</span> provided the Board's analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Factual Background</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was employed as a Distribution Clerk with the agency when he incurred an on-the-job back injury in September of 1975. After receiving disability compensation pay for some months as a result of that injury, the appellant applied for and was granted disability retirement, effective December 17, 1976. He then received a disability retirement annuity in lieu of disability compensation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated August 30, 1978, the appellant was notified that his disability compensation under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. 8108, <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> was being terminated as of July 7, 1978, because medical evidence indicated he was no longer disabled for his usual occupation. Subsequently, by letter dated January 8, 1979, the appellant was notified that his disability retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement Act would be terminated on November 6, 1979, or earlier if he were re-employed before that date, because a recent medical examination indicated full recovery. The appellant's personal physician released him for return to work at his normal duties on February 8, 1979, and by letter dated February 12, 1979, he requested that the agency reinstate him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency responded by letter dated February 22, 1979, advising the appellant that reinstatement of a former postal employee was at the discretion of the Postmaster. After consideration of the appellant's previous work performance and conduct, the Postmaster's delegatee[sic] had concluded that the appellant's re-employment would not be in the best interest of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition on appeal, the appellant alleged that his work performance and conduct were not unsatisfactory, and that the actual reason for the denial of his request for re-employment was his activities as executive vice-president and union steward for the Dallas Area Local of the American Postal Workers' Union. The agency responded that the appellant's application for reinstatement was denied solely on the basis of his work history. The agency claimed that the appellant's official personnel folder reflected that the appellant had received no quality increases in salary, no performance awards or commendation letters, and that the appellant had had a series of disciplinary problems, beginning in April of 1972 and culminating with a fourteen-day suspension that was issued but not served because the appellant incurred his back injury and went on disability retirement in December of 1976.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The copies of letters attached to the agency's response indicated that on February 13, 1976, the agency had issued a five-day suspension of the appellant for "unsatisfactory performance" in that he repeatedly failed to follow supervisors' instructions. The letters indicated, further, that on March 19, 1976, the agency had issued the appellant a "letter of warning" for continued unsatisfactory attendance, listing two incidents of counseling with supervisors regarding "attendance deficiencies" and "excessive use of sick leave," and one incident of applying for sick leave on a day when he was later seen by two supervisors in the agency building, talking with another employee. The latter incident allegedly went unexplained upon confrontation of the appellant by a supervisor a few days later....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the hearing before the presiding official on May 14, 1979, the agency presented no witnesses but did introduce into evidence excerpts from the agency's personnel handbook providing that the installation head or appointing officer is responsible for making the final decision in determining fitness for employment (section 311.51) based on "specific eligibility factors" (section 312) including "work history" (section 313.5):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4449"></span>An eligible may be omitted from consideration for employment because of previous unsatisfactory service. The service must have been sufficiently long to be considered a full and fair trial and the character of the service must have been such that the eligible is unlikely to be able to perform satisfactorily in the new position. Situations which may fall in this category are: termination of appointment in the same or another post office for unsatisfactory service; repeated scheme failure, when ability to learn a scheme will be required; or misconduct on the job. Excessive tardiness or absence, or poor conduct in previous post office employment, although no disciplinary action was being taken at the time of resignation, could justify eliminating an eligible from consideration, if the service was recent and there is no indication that the individual has improved his or her work habits....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Discussion and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rights of a Federal employee with regard to re-employment by the Government upon recovery from a physical injury sustained while on duty are based on the Federal Employees' Compensation Act at 5 U.S.C. 8151(b), which provides in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management...the department or agency which was the last employer shall, if the injury or disability is overcome within a period of more than one year after the date of commencement of compensation, make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing, the employee in his former or equivalent position within such department or agency, or within any other department or agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with this statutory provision, the OPM issued the following regulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee who was separated because of a compensable injury and whose recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date compensation began..., is entitled to priority consideration for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of cessation of compensation. (See Parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for more information on how this may be accomplished for the excepted and competitive service, respectively.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. 353.307. There is, therefore, a definite deadline for applying for reappointment--within thirty days after compensation has been terminated--in order to be entitled to priority consideration, as argued by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory provision establishing the right to priority consideration does not define the extent of that right, saying only that the former department or agency must "make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing..." the qualifying former employee. 5 U.S.C. 8151(b)(2). The legislative history of that provision contains but one pertinent reference:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">For those employees whose disability extends beyond one year, the employing agency or department is to give priority in employing to the injured worker upon recovery.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 93-1081, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1974); and H. R. Rep. No. 93-1025, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1974).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The most significant factor for purposes of interpretation of the meaning of priority consideration, or more correctly, "priority to placing," is that the right is distinguished in the same statutory provision from the absolute right to re-employment to be afforded a former employee who recovers from a compensable disability within one year's time. 5 U.S.C. 8151(b)(1). One right is absolute, while the other appears to be conditional. The statute and its legislative history do not explain the conditions of the latter, however. By the terms of the statute quoted above, Congress has delegated that responsibility to OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Part 353 of the OPM regulations coins the term "priority consideration" for the right of "priority to placing" at 5 C.F.R. 353.307, and refers to Part 302 "...for more information on how this may be accomplished for the excepted service...," which in this context would include the appellant as a former federal employee not in the competitive service. Part 302 of the OPM regulations then provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Each agency shall follow the provisions of this part relating to examination, rating, and selection for appointment of an applicant when a qualified preference eligible or person entitled to priority consideration applies for appointment to a position covered by this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. 302.104. The regulations continue to provide that each agency shall establish a re-employment list including:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The name of each former employee of the agency who has been furloughed or separated due to compensable injury sustained under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 81, Subchapter I, and who is eligible for priority consideration under this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. 302.303(b)(3). Non-veterans like the appellant may remain on the re-employment list for a maximum of one year after disability compensation ceases, whereas veterans may remain for two years. 5 C.F.R. 302.303(c)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a memorandum filed in connection with two other appeals involving similar issues, OPM has urged that priority consideration for re-employment, as developed by its regulations, means that an agency cannot hire persons who are not already federal employees, with certain limited exceptions, as long as a qualified person is available on a re-employment list. OPM has posited further that, while an agency may consider the employment history of a former employee entitled to priority consideration, the Board has no authority to order appointment of such a person on the grounds that the former employee's record was improperly evaluated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not accede to this limitation on the right to priority consideration for re-employment or on the Board's jurisdiction to adjudicate appeals from the denial of that right. Although OPM has been delegated the authority to promulgate the legislative rules in Part 302 of the regulations which give effect to the right to priority consideration, as well as grant the Board jurisdiction over appeals involving the denial of that right, we are not bound by an interpretation of the regulations by OPM which we find unreasonable. <span class="Italic">See National Distributing Co., Inc. v. U.S. Treasury Department,</span> 626 F.2d 997, 1019 (D.C. Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Floyd S. Pike Electrical Contractor, Inc. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission,</span> 576 F.2d 72, 75 (5th Cir. 1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Part 353 of OPM's regulations relating to restoration rights under 5 U.S.C. 8151(b) includes a provision requiring that agencies "make every effort to restore..." a former employee who has partially recovered from a compensable injury. 5 C.F.R. 353.306. This regulatory language parallels the statutory language requiring that an agency "make all reasonable efforts to place..." a former employee who has fully recovered from a compensable injury more than one year after compensation began. 5 U.S.C. 8151(b)(2). We find that it would be patently unreasonable to construe the right to priority consideration for re-employment, upon <span class="Italic">full</span> recovery more than one year after disability compensation began, as a lesser right than the right to restoration upon <span class="Italic">partial</span> recovery. Reading the rule providing for restoration upon partial recovery, 5 C.F.R. 353.306, together with the rule providing for priority consideration upon full recovery, 5 C.F.R. 353.307, leads us to conclude that an agency must make every reasonable effort to restore a former employee possessed of either right. <span class="Italic">Cf. United Mine Workers of America v. Andrus,</span> 581 F.2d 888, 892 (D.C. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom. Carbon Fuel Co. v. Andrus,</span> 99 S. Ct. 313 (1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an agency concludes that a former employee entitled to priority consideration is disqualified for re-employment, it must be prepared to support that conclusion by the preponderance of the evidence in the event that the employee appeals to the Board from an alleged denial of priority consideration. 5 U.S.C. 7701(c)(1). The Board's jurisdiction to hear such appeal under 5 C.F.R. 302.501, upon a showing that the appellant was denied restoration rights because of the employment of another person, would be rendered meaningless if we lacked the authority to consider the validity of the reasons given by an agency for not hiring a former employee entitled to priority consideration, and fashion an appropriate remedy, where the reasons are found to be invalid, by ordering that the former employee be hired by the agency in his or her former or an equivalent position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 1205(a)(1) and (2), 8151(b)(2); <span class="Italic">Meier v. Department of the Interior,</span> 3 MSPB 341, 3 MSPR 247, 257 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulations provide that an applicant entitled to priority consideration may be found disqualified for a variety of reasons:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The qualification standards established by an agency or by an administrative level or subdivision of an agency may provide that certain reasons disqualify an applicant for appointment. The following, <span class="Italic">among others,</span> may be included as disqualifying reasons:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(a)&#x2003;Dismissal from employment for delinquency or misconduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(b)&#x2003;Criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(c)&#x2003;Intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(d)&#x2003;Habitual use of intoxicating beverages to excess;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(e)&#x2003;Reasonable doubt as to the loyalty of the person involved to the Government of the United States;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(f)&#x2003;Any legal or other disqualification which makes the individual unfit for the service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(g)&#x2003;Lack of United States citizenship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency may not disqualify an applicant solely because of his retired status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. 302.203 (emphasis added). This regulatory provision indicates <span id="Page_4450"></span>that the disqualifying reasons listed are not the only disqualifying reasons that may be included in a particular agency's qualification standards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the case on appeal, the agency's personnel handbook provided at section 313.5, quoted above, that any applicant for employment with the agency could be excluded from consideration on the basis of previously unsatisfactory service, including prior incidents of misconduct or excessive absence. This disqualifying reason, although perhaps less egregious than those listed in the OPM regulations at 5 C.F.R. 302.203, appears to be within the discretionary parameters imposed upon the agency by that provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official made no reference in his initial decision to the disqualifying reasons provided under the OPM regulations, while discussing other provisions of Part 302. The presiding official erroneously concluded that the agency could not consider the appellant's work history in acting upon his application for re-employment since he was entitled to priority consideration, and that priority consideration meant the appellant should have been offered the first Distribution Clerk position to become available after the agency's receipt of his application. Thus, the decisions of the presiding official and the administrative law judge to exclude testimony and documentary evidence on the question of the appellant's work history, based on findings of irrelevance, were also erroneous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that the presiding official should have considered whether the agency's reasons for not offering the appellant a position, upon processing his application within a few days of its receipt, were consistent with the OPM regulations, including the types of factors that may disqualify an applicant for re-employment. The Board finds, further, that previously unsatisfactory service may be deemed a proper disqualifying factor under the following circumstances: (1) the kind of work-related behavior that may be encompassed by that factor must be limited to behavior of such a nature as to warrant disciplinary action; (2) the agency must have taken or not had sufficient time to take reasonably prompt action against such behavior; and (3) the incidence of the behavior warranting disciplinary action must have been not long prior to the date on which the former employee began receiving disability compensation, so as to indicate that the former employee had not reformed or improved his or her behavior with respect to the performance of the duties of his or her former position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's response and attached submissions in connection with the appellant's original petition for appeal tend to support the agency's contention that such unsatisfactory service was reflected in the appellant's employment records. However, the agency was given no opportunity to establish that fact, in order to show by the preponderance of the evidence that it properly accorded the appellant priority consideration under Part 302 of the OPM regulations, and the appellant had no opportunity to refute it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Raicovich,</span> the result in <span class="Italic">Thompson</span> was reversed in <span class="Italic">Thompson v. USPS</span>, 18 MSPR 175, 179 (1983), determining that the appellant's prior work performance issues did not constitute the type of egregious behavior allowing the agency to deny a former excepted service employee restoration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Knight v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 424, 427-28 (1998), involving an agency's assertions that restoration would not occur because the employee allegedly provided incorrect information in support of claims for OWCP benefits and during a Title VII action, focused the <span class="Italic">Raicovich</span> analysis on whether the conduct violated basic OPM or agency regulatory qualification standards:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under regulations issued by OPM, an agency shall, if an injury is overcome within a period of more than one year after the commencement of compensation, make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing, the employee in his or her former or equivalent position. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2). OPM's regulations provide that an employee who separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than one year from the date eligibility for compensation began is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b). However, "if during the period of injury...the employee's conduct is such that it would disqualify him or her for employment <span class="Italic">under OPM or agency regulations,</span> restoration rights may be denied." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.108 (emphasis added). OPM's regulations instruct agencies to "see" 5 C.F.R. part 302 for more information on how to accomplish the restoration of an individual in the excepted service who has fully recovered after one year. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.104, "[e]ach agency shall follow the provisions of this part relating to examination, rating, and selection for appointment of an applicant when a...person entitled to priority consideration applies for appointment to a position covered by this part." A "person entitled to priority consideration" is a person who was furloughed or separated without misconduct, from a position without time limit, because of a compensable injury and whose recovery takes longer than one year from the date compensation began. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.105. The parties do not dispute that the appellant was in the excepted service, is a person entitled to priority consideration, and is applying for a covered position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 301.101(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before making an appointment to a covered position each agency shall establish qualification standards, such as those relating to experience and training, citizenship, minimum age, and physical condition, that shall relate to the duties to be performed. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.202. Each agency shall make its standards a matter of record in the appropriate office of the agency, and shall apply the standards for a position uniformly to all applicants, except for such waivers as are provided for a preference eligible. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The qualification standards established by an agency or by an administrative level or subdivision of an agency "may provide that certain reasons disqualify an applicant for appointment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.203(a). Criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct "may be included" as a disqualifying reason. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.108 allows for the disqualification of a person entitled to priority consideration only under an OPM or agency regulation that provides for such disqualification. OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.203 permits agencies to include certain reasons in its qualification standards that would disqualify persons entitled to priority consideration. We do not, however, view section 302.203 as self-effectuating. <span class="Italic">See Raicovich v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 675 F.2d 417, 421-22 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (addressing the agency's implementation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.203 in its Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM) and its Personnel Handbook). Requiring agencies to adopt disqualifying factors in their qualifications standards appears designed to ensure that agencies "apply the standards for a position uniformly to all applicants," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.202, and not make <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> decisions, <span class="Italic">see Raicovich,</span> 675 F.2d at 422.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there is no indication in the record or in the testimony of the agency's witnesses that the agency disqualified this appellant under an OPM or agency regulation. Although the agency cited sections 661.53, 666.2, and 665.2(m) of its ELM in its letter denying the appellant's request for restoration, those provisions appear to apply to "employees," and not individuals entitled to priority consideration. It is also not clear that the cited provisions of the ELM were promulgated pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.202. <span class="Italic">See Raicovich,</span> 675 F.2d at 422 (finding that part 313.5 of the Postal Service Personnel Handbook did not satisfy OPM's restoration regulations because it was not published pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.202).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Raicovich,</span> <span class="Italic">Wright v. USPS</span>, 13 MSPR 353, 354-56 (1982), required restoration rights to be provided to an employee with a distant history of attendance problems:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 19, 1980, the Board's Washington, D.C. Regional Office issued a decision sustaining the agency's action. However, the Board subsequently vacated and remanded that decision for reconsideration in view of its findings in <span class="Italic">Thompson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 5 MSPB 274, 5 M.S.P.R. 228 (1981), regarding restoration rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the reconsidered initial decision, the presiding official found that appellant had been absent from duty for several extended periods totalling 11 months during the two year period between the date of the last disciplinary action relied upon for denying him restoration and the date of his separation. Moreover, the presiding official held that the remaining 13 non-consecutive months of performance were not sufficient to establish that appellant's behavior had improved adequately in view of the serious nature of his disciplinary record. Accordingly, the presiding official sustained the agency's denial of appellant's application for restoration to duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, appellant argues that the presiding official erred in concluding that the agency was justified in denying him restoration on the basis of his disciplinary record. For reasons set out below, we hereby GRANT appellant's petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reveals that appellant was separated from his position in March 1977 due to a compensable injury incurred on the job in 1974. In 1979 it was determined that appellant had fully recovered from his injury. Therefore, appellant filed an application for priority consideration for restoration to duty by the agency pursuant to section 22(b)(2) of the Federal Employees Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2). The agency denied his request on the basis of his disciplinary record, which included a l4-day suspension and a 30-day suspension for absence without leave (AWOL). We find that the agency's disqualification of appellant's application for restoration was improper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has recently determined that it would be inconsistent with the statutory purpose of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2) for an agency to refuse to rehire a recovered former employee on the basis of prior conduct for which he was not dismissed. <span class="Italic">See Raicovich v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 675 F.2d 417, 424 (D.C. Cir., 1982). The appeals court held that by enacting the 1974 Amendments to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, Congress sought to do everything feasible to compensate and reinstate federal employees injured in the line of duty. Therefore, the court concluded that Congress desired to accord injured workers treatment equal to that which they would have received but for their injury. <span class="Italic">Raicovich, supra,</span> at 424. In addition, the court <span id="Page_4451"></span>held that to comply with the statute, priority consideration requires that a former employee in good standing at the time of his injury, who has not engaged in egregious behavior of the sort enumerated at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.203, must be placed on an appropriate priority employment list and be reemployed when vacancies arise. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 424.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the court noted in <span class="Italic">Raicovich</span> that a former employee may be disqualified for restoration by having engaged in conduct shortly before his injury which would have resulted in dismissal but for the intervening injury, appellant's misconduct here did not rise to a level requiring his removal. In fact, his misconduct produced only disciplinary suspensions ranging from 14 to 30 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In that appellant was not disqualified from restoration on the basis of conduct that would have justified his removal if he were continuously employed, we find that appellant was entitled to priority consideration for reemployment, and that the agency was obligated, upon receipt of his application, to make "all reasonable efforts" to place him in his former or an equivalent position. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2). We construe this language to require the agency to attempt to reemploy the qualifying former employee at the facility which last employed him, and if that is not feasible, at any other agency facility having an equivalent position available--unless, of course, the agency and the former employee agree on another mutually acceptable arrangement. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> FPM ch. 353, subch. B-3 (October 29, 1975). Consistent with the agency's burden of proof in appeals before the Board 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1), the agency must submit evidence regarding all such available positions, and any restrictive qualification requirements, in order to show that it has made "all reasonable efforts" to re-employ the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Raicovich</span>, use of approved leave for unscheduled absences did not constitute egregious misconduct contemplated by 5 CFR 302.203. <span class="Italic">Emelio v. USPS</span>, 21 MSPR 701, 703 (1984). Removal based on a strike against the government disqualified the employee from restoration rights, <span class="Italic">Cox v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 31 MSPR 148, 151 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal employees entitled to restoration to their former or equivalent positions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2), upon recovery from a compensable work-related injury, include those who were "...separated or furloughed from a position without time limitation <span class="Italic">as a result of a compensable injury</span>." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.103(c)(1) (emphasis added). An employee who is removed for cause has no right to restoration simply because he received disability compensation subsequent to removal. <span class="Italic">Miller v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 3 M.S.P.R. 336, 337 (1980). The separation or furlough had to have resulted from the compensable injury alone in order for restoration rights to accrue. <span class="Italic">Id. Cf. McKoy v. Department of the Army,</span> 18 M.S.P.R. 636 (where the Board found that appellant's separation because of physical inability to perform the duties of her position was substantially related to her compensable back injury); <span class="Italic">Ruppert v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. 593 (1981) (in which the Board found that appellant's termination because of unsatisfactory performance following his absence due to a compensable injury showed that the separation was substantially related to the compensable injury).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wright v. USPS</span>, 5 MSPR 242 (1981) (provisions of a collective bargaining contract regulating the retention and use of disciplinary actions may factor into the reemployment analysis).</p>
