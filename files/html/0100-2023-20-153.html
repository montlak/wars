<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-145"><span class="space">15.</span>Other Investigations</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Congress did not specify an investigation (other than psychiatric exam or testing) as a prohibited personnel practice. But the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act amendments augmented compensatory damages proved to result from retaliatory investigations, under 5 USC 1221(g)(4):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Any corrective action ordered under this section to correct a prohibited personnel practice may include fees, costs, or damages reasonably incurred due to an agency investigation of the employee, if such investigation was commenced, expanded, or extended in retaliation for the disclosure or protected activity that formed the basis of the corrective action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The concept of a retaliatory investigation was developed in <span class="Italic">Schmitt v. Dept. of Energy,</span> DC-0752-15-0797-I-1 (NP 3/18/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An investigation is not a personnel action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Justice</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 7 (2007) (citing <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of Justice</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 317, 323-24 (1997)). The Board will consider evidence of the conduct of an agency investigation when it is so closely related to a personnel action that it could have been pretext for gathering evidence to use to retaliate against an employee for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 7. However, contrary to the appellant's assertions, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(4) does not create a separate cause of action for retaliatory investigations. S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 20-22 (2012). Indeed, Congress considered and rejected the option of explicitly and specifically recognizing a retaliatory investigation as a personnel action, so as to avoid discouraging agencies from undertaking legitimate and necessary inquiries. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 21. Congress opted instead to authorize an award of consequential damages once an employee is able to prove a claim under the Whistleblower Protection Act, if the employee can further demonstrate that an investigation was undertaken in retaliation for the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 21-22; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(b)(2). We therefore agree with the administrative judge that the only issue properly before her was the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A retaliatory investigation may, in combination with other factors, result in a "significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions" so as to constitute a prohibited personnel action under 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii)--often referred to as a hostile work environment. Under <span class="Italic">Skarada v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 17 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16, 18 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an appellant has suffered a "significant change" in his duties, responsibilities, or working conditions, the Board must consider the alleged agency actions both collectively and individually. <span id="Page_3905"></span><span class="Italic">See Holderfield v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 326 F.3d 1207, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 2003). In <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, the Board stated that a hostile work environment itself may constitute a covered personnel action under the WPA. <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 23. Although the term "hostile work environment" has a particular meaning in other contexts, we take this opportunity to clarify that allegations of a hostile work environment may establish a personnel action under the WPA, as established by longstanding Board precedent covering whistleblowing claims raised in a civil service law context, only if they meet the statutory criteria, i.e., constitute a significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). Thus, as described above, although the "significant change" personnel action should be interpreted broadly to include harassment and discrimination that could have a chilling effect on whistleblowing or otherwise undermine the merit system, only agency actions that, individually or collectively, have practical and significant effects on the overall nature and quality of an employee's working conditions, duties, or responsibilities will be found to constitute a personnel action covered by section 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant alleged that his chain of command harassed him and subjected him to a hostile work environment by, among other things, excluding him from meetings and conversations, subjecting him to multiple investigations,[4] accusing him of "fabricating data" and of a Privacy Act violation, refusing his request for a review of his position for possible upgrade, yelling at him on three occasions, and failing to provide him the support and guidance needed to successfully perform his duties.

<p class="Body-Text">An investigation of the appellant may suggest a pattern of agency behavior suggesting reprisal, that is, the investigation, if unwarranted, may go to motivation for the challenged personnel action or it may go to evaluation of the overall allegation of reprisal. <span class="Italic">Sistek v.

Cir. 2020), determined that an retaliatory investigation is not a covered action for purposes of an IRA appeal, with the exception of creation of a hostile environment (not found as to Mr. Sistek). The investigation may be shown to be a part of the larger picture of reprisal in connection with a covered personnel action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, a "personnel action," as defined by the WPA, is a predicate for a whistleblower appeal. Only upon proof of a qualifying personnel action may a claimant seek corrective action from the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a). The WPA defines the set of qualifying personnel actions at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). That section of the statute lists eleven specific personnel actions--including, for example, "an appointment," "a performance evaluation," and "a decision concerning pay"--followed by a catch-all provision: "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(i)-(xii). Noticeably absent from the list, however, is any mention of a "retaliatory investigation," or indeed, any investigation at all.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory language indicates that Congress intentionally excluded retaliatory investigations from the scope of personnel actions authorized for relief under the WPA. "Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion." <span class="Italic">Russello v. United States</span>, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal alterations omitted) (first quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. Wong Kim Bo</span>, 472 F.2d 720, 722 (5th Cir. 1972); then citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Wooten</span>, 688 F.2d 941, 950 (4th Cir. 1982)). Section 2302(a)(2)(A) does not expressly address "investigations" or "retaliatory investigations," but other sections do. Elsewhere, the WPA provides that the Board may order corrective action that includes "fees, costs, or damages reasonably incurred due to an agency investigation" that is "commenced, expanded, or extended in retaliation" for a protected disclosure or activity--i.e., a retaliatory investigation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(h), 1221(g)(4). Based on this asymmetry in the statutory text, we infer that Congress acted purposely in excluding retaliatory investigations from the set of qualifying personnel actions specified by &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history supports our interpretation of the statutory text. Congress amended the WPA with the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-199, 126 Stat. 1465 (2012). The Senate Report for the WPEA demonstrates that Congress was aware of the harassing character of retaliatory investigations, yet expressly declined to add them to the list of qualifying personnel actions. The report first acknowledges that the "retaliatory investigation of whistleblowers may be a prohibited form of harassment." S. REP. NO. 112-155, at 20 (2012) (discussing remarks of House Civil Service Subcommittee Chairman Frank McCloskey during consideration of the 1994 amendments to the WPA). The report then explains that the drafters of the WPEA declined to insert an express provision covering retaliatory investigations out of concern for chilling routine investigations. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 21. Instead, the drafters of the WPEA sought to chart a middle course. Even as they declined to add retaliatory investigations to the list of qualifying personnel actions, the drafters "create[d] an additional avenue for financial relief <span class="Italic">once an employee is able to prove a claim under the WPA</span>, if the employee can further demonstrate that an investigation was undertaken in retaliation for the protected disclosure." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). In doing so, the drafters underscored that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This provision of the legislation does not in any way reduce current protections against retaliatory investigations, and it would retain the existing standard for showing that a retaliatory investigation or other supervisory activity rises to the level of a prohibited personnel practice forbidden under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 21-22. The drafters expressly confirmed their intent that the Board's foundational decision in this area, <span class="Italic">Russell v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 317 (1997), would remain the "governing law" following the 2012 amendments. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the plain language of the statute, as further supported by the legislative history, we conclude that retaliatory investigations, in and of themselves, do not qualify as personnel actions under the WPA. Instead, the statute provides that a retaliatory investigation may provide a basis for additional corrective action if raised in conjunction with one or more of the qualifying personnel actions specified by &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Sistek acknowledges the statutory text and legislative history of the Whistleblower Protection Act discussed above, but insists that the allegedly retaliatory investigation at issue in this case satisfies the threshold requirements of the WPA for two distinct reasons. First, Mr. Sistek contends that the allegedly retaliatory investigation qualifies as a personnel action under the WPA's catch-all provision. Second, Mr. Sistek asserts that a retaliatory investigation is independently actionable <span id="Page_3906"></span>based on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 317. We address each argument in turn. We find neither argument availing to Mr. Sistek on the record before us.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Sistek first argues that the allegedly retaliatory investigation at issue qualifies as a personnel action under the WPA's catch-all category of "any other significant change in...working conditions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii). Before the Board, Mr. Sistek contended that the retaliatory investigation, either on its own or in conjunction with the letter of reprimand, created a hostile work environment that satisfies the catch-all provision. As the Government concedes, the Board failed to address this argument in the final decision. Oral Arg. at 31:58-32:49, <a href="http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=2019-1168.mp3">http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=2019-1168.mp3</a>. On these facts, however, we conclude that the Board's failure to address Mr. Sistek's argument was harmless.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, a retaliatory investigation, either on its own or as part of a broader set of circumstances, may qualify as a personnel action if it rises to the level of a "significant change in...working conditions." The plain language of the statute requires as much--so long as the change in working conditions is significant. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Dep't of the Army</span>, No. SF-1221-12-0349-W-6, 2017 MSPB LEXIS 3445, at *51-52 (M.S.P.B. Aug. 7, 2017) (collecting cases evaluating significance of change). Consistent with the statutory text, the Senate Report for the WPEA amendments expressly acknowledges that investigations may qualify as personnel actions "if they result in a significant change in job duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." S. REP. NO. 112-155, at 20. The Government conceded at oral argument that there may be extreme circumstances in which an investigation alone could constitute a significant change in working conditions. <span class="Italic">See</span> Oral Arg. at 18:11-19:20 (discussing hypothetical in which an employee is interviewed for an hour every day). Or, as the Board itself has held, a retaliatory investigation could contribute toward the creation of a hostile work environment that is actionable as a significant change in working conditions. <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 2017 MSPB LEXIS 3445, at *52 (citing <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, 627 (2015)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Sistek failed to establish a significant change of working conditions here, however. In support of his claim, Mr. Sistek only presented facts that would apply to almost any investigation that results in a reprimand. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., Oral Arg. at 16:59-17:39 (identifying only a single interview and a letter of reprimand). That Mr. Sistek was interviewed once and had the stigma and fear associated with every investigation does not make this investigation a significant change in working conditions. Nor does the fact that the investigation identified misconduct that resulted in a letter of reprimand--a letter that was later rescinded and expunged, no less. Congress declined to include retaliatory investigations within the scope of personnel actions out of concern for chilling routine investigations, S. REP. NO. 112-155, at 21, so it cannot be that the catch-all provision may be satisfied by conduct that would apply to almost any routine investigation. To hold otherwise would allow the exception to swallow the rule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Sistek next argues that the Board was compelled to address the allegedly retaliatory investigation by the holding of <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 317--the decision expressly left as "governing law" by the drafters of the WPEA amendments. S. REP. NO. 112-155, at 21. Mr. Sistek reads <span class="Italic">Russell</span> to establish that the Board may independently consider a separate claim of "retaliation by investigation" where there is a nexus between an investigation and a subsequent personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not read <span class="Italic">Russell</span> so broadly. In <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, an employee brought a WPA claim based on his demotion, which undisputedly qualified as a personnel action under the WPA. 76 M.S.P.R. at 320-22. The employee was demoted following several investigations that uncovered certain misconduct by that employee. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The investigations were initiated by officials with knowledge of the employee's prior whistleblowing activity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 323-24. Applying the WPA framework, the agency sought to rebut the employee's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal by arguing that the agency would have taken disciplinary action against the employee regardless of the employee's whistleblowing activities because the identified misconduct was independently sanctionable. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 322-24. The Board disagreed, explaining that it must "look[] at where the investigation had its beginnings." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 324 (citing <span class="Italic">Geyer v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 682, 689 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 116 F.3d 1497 (Fed. Cir. 1997)). The Board observed that the "investigations were initiated because of allegations about the [employee] made by one of the two subjects of the [employee's] protected disclosure." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board reasoned that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When, as here, an investigation is so closely related to the personnel action that it could have been a pretext for gathering evidence to retaliate, and the agency does not show by clear and convincing evidence that the evidence would have been gathered absent the protected disclosure, then the appellant will prevail on his affirmative defense of retaliation for whistleblowing. That the investigation itself is conducted in a fair and impartial manner, or that certain acts of misconduct are discovered during the investigation, does not relieve an agency of its obligation to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2)). To hold otherwise, the Board continued, would sanction the use of "selective investigations" as a "purely retaliatory tool." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 325. Because the investigations at issue gave rise to all the charges underlying the employee's demotion, they were sufficiently closely related to merit consideration in conjunction with the demotion itself. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. After considering evidence relating to the origin of the investigation, the Board ordered corrective action based on its conclusion that the agency had failed to rebut the employee's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 327-28.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the holding of <span class="Italic">Russell</span> that, in the WPA context, the Board should "consider evidence regarding the conduct of an agency investigation when the investigation was so closely related to the personnel action that it could have been a pretext for gathering evidence to retaliate against an employee for whistleblowing activity." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 323-24 (first citing <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 688; then citing <span class="Italic">Mongird v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 504, 507 (1987)). We reject Mr. Sistek's view that <span class="Italic">Russell</span> somehow makes retaliatory investigations independently actionable under the WPA separate and apart from a qualifying personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the holding of <span class="Italic">Russell</span> obligated the Board to consider the allegedly retaliatory investigation as part of its evaluation of the letter of reprimand. In its briefing to the Board, the Government acknowledged that "the Administrative Judge could potentially examine the conduct of the AIB in determining the propriety of the accepted personnel action--the reprimand." The Board also acknowledged the holding of <span class="Italic">Russell</span> in its final decision. <span class="Italic">See Decision</span>, 2018 MSPB LEXIS 3010, at *23-24 (citing <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 323-24). Yet, as the Government conceded at oral argument, the Board nevertheless failed to apply <span class="Italic">Russell</span> in evaluating the letter of reprimand. That was error, but for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the Board's error was harmless.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Sistek failed to establish any reason why the outcome could have been different had the Board properly considered the allegedly retaliatory investigation in conjunction with the letter of reprimand, as <span class="Italic">Russell</span> instructs. The facts of this case are distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Russell</span> at least because here there is no evidence that the official who initiated the allegedly retaliatory investigation had knowledge of any protected disclosures. Indeed, the Board specifically found that Ms. Kindred had no actual or constructive knowledge of Mr. Sistek's August 2012 and October 2013 protected disclosures, and Mr. Sistek did not dispute that finding on appeal. Although the Board did not account for Ms. Kindred's potential knowledge of the February 2014 protected disclosure (i.e., Mr. Sistek's email to the OIG following the AIB interview), Mr. Sistek did not allege any such knowledge in his briefing, much less explain how Ms. Kindred's knowledge of that protected disclosure could have had any impact on the Board's evaluation of the letter of reprimand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Doyle v. VA,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210514272">855 Fed. Appx. 753</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP), emphasized that the Board should not discount allegations that investigations are motivated by whistleblowing reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Doyle argues that the Board's conclusion that the AIB investigation does not qualify as an adverse personnel action is contrary to law. This court has held that an investigation of an employee, without more, is not a qualifying personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Sistek v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 955 F.3d 948, 955 (Fed. Cir. 2020). But "a retaliatory investigation, either on its own or as part of a broader set of circumstances, may qualify as a personnel action if it rises to the level" of a "significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, there is no dispute that Ms. Doyle had several significant changes in job duties and responsibilities as well as working conditions. During the course of the AIB investigation, Ms. Doyle was reassigned from her job as a DA to the mailroom, and then to the library. She was reassigned a third time as a direct result of a recommendation made by the AIB in its investigation report. As such, the AIB investigation was the direct cause for at least one change in Ms. Doyle's change in duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing circumstances, we conclude that the AIB investigation was a retaliatory investigation closely related to at least one reassignment. <span class="Italic">Russell v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. 317, 323-24 (M.S.P.B. 1997) ("The Board will consider evidence regarding the conduct of an agency investigation when the investigation was so closely related to the personnel action that it could have been a pretext for gathering evidence to retaliate against an employee for whistleblowing activity."). We therefore hold that the Board's legal conclusion that the AIB investigation was not a qualifying personnel action was contrary to law. Consequently, the burden shifts to the agency to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Kewley,</span> 153 F.3d at 1363.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Russell v. DOJ</span>, 76 MSPR 317, 323-24 (1997), cited in <span class="Italic">Sistek,</span> commented on the significance in IRA analysis of retaliatory investigations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3907"></span>The Board will consider evidence regarding the conduct of an agency investigation when the investigation was so closely related to the personnel action that it could have been a pretext for gathering evidence to retaliate against an employee for whistleblowing activity<span class="Italic">.

Dept. of the Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 504, 507 (1987). In considering such evidence, the Board looks at where the investigation had its beginnings. <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, 70 MSPR at 689.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The three charges in the instant case were based on six specifications. Five of the six specifications arose from the findings of certain investigations by the agency's Office of Internal Affairs (OIA). The OIA investigations were initiated because of allegations about the appellant made by one of the two subjects of the protected disclosure, Warden Wooten. On January 13, 1994, three (3) months after the appellant's disclosure, Warden Wooten reported to the agency's OIA that the appellant: used annual leave without approval; failed to report an assault of an inmate by a staff member; established inappropriate relationships with inmates; placed phone calls for an inmate; promised inmates transfers and early releases; held himself out as acting captain; and made unprofessional comments and gestures to female staff. Three of those allegations, that the appellant failed to report an assault of an inmate, placed phone calls for inmates, and made unprofessional comments and gestures to female staff, formed the bases of the agency's charges. In the addition, during OIA's investigation of the Warden's allegations, the appellant averred that he gave a pen to an inmate and that he made derogatory comments about staff in front of inmates. These averments were relied on to support two of the agency's charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, an investigation is so closely related to the personnel action that it could have been a pretext for gathering evidence to retaliate, and the agency does not show by clear and convincing evidence that the evidence would have been gathered absent the protected disclosure, then the appellant will prevail on his affirmative defense of retaliation for whistleblowing. That the investigation itself is conducted in a fair and impartial manner, or that certain acts of misconduct are discovered during the investigation, does not relieve an agency of its obligation to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1221(e)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To here hold otherwise would sanction the use of a purely retaliatory tool, selective investigations. Congress included protection for whistleblowers in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978), to assure federal employees that "they will not suffer if they help uncover and correct administrative abuses." S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess., 8 (1978), reprinted in 1978 USCCAN 2723, 2730. Eleven years later Congress strengthened protection for whistleblowers in enacting the WPA, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (1989), one goal of which was "to encourage government personnel to blow the whistle on wasteful, corrupt, or illegal government practices without fearing retaliatory action by their supervisors or those harmed by the disclosures." <span class="Italic">Marano</span>, 2 F.3d at 1142 (citing WPA &#x00A7; 2, 103 Stat. 16, 5 USC 1201 note). "So long as a protected disclosure is a contributing factor to a contested personnel action, and the agency cannot prove its affirmative defense, no <span class="Italic">harm</span> can come to the whistleblower." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). Thus, an agency's selective use of investigations, i.e., its choice to investigate a whistleblower, because of his or her status as a whistleblower, would contravene this goal. Since the investigations in the present case gave rise to five of the six specifications and all of the charges underlying the demotion action, the OIA investigations were so closely related to the adverse action, we will therefore consider the appellant's claim of "retaliation by investigation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In considering the appellant's claim of "retaliation by investigation," we recognize that the WPA is not intended to shield employees who engage in wrongful conduct merely because they have, at some point, "blown the whistle." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marano</span>, 2 F.3d at 1142 n.5. The appellant's situation, however, is more akin to cases where the Board sustains a charge, finds discrimination, and reverses the adverse personnel action because of the taint of discrimination. The taint in such cases is not "cleansed" by arguing that the employee cannot be shielded from his misconduct by anti-discrimination laws<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Johnson v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 61 MSPR 601, 610 (1994) (although the Board found that the employee was, as charged, absent without leave, it ordered the agency to cancel the removal because it was tainted by race discrimination, and the agency had failed to show by preponderant evidence that it would have taken the same action absent consideration of a discriminatory motive). An employee is not completely shielded from his misconduct by anti-discrimination laws or the WPA. Rather, those laws shield an employee only to the extent the record supports a finding that he would not have been disciplined except for his status as a whistleblower or a member of a protected class. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...An investigation is not a personnel action <span class="Italic">per se</span>, but the Board will consider evidence of the conduct of an agency investigation when it is so closely related to a personnel action that it could have been pretext for gathering evidence to use to retaliate against an employee. <span class="Italic">Kitlinski v. Department of Justice</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6; 27 (2015). Given the appellant's failure to show that the proposing and deciding officials, or any official who ordered the investigation into his potential conflict of interest, knew of his disclosures, we find that he has not shown that the investigation could have been a pretext for gathering evidence to retaliate against him. In any event, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(4), any corrective action ordered to correct a prohibited personnel practice may include fees, costs, or damages reasonably incurred due to an agency investigation of the employee, if such investigation was commenced, expanded, or extended in retaliation for the disclosure or protected activity that formed the basis of the corrective action. Here, the Board has not ordered corrective action to correct a prohibited personnel practice. Thus, the appellant is not entitled to damages under section 1221(g)(4).</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wine v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DA-1221-16-0513-W-2 (NP 2/10/2023), noted additional authority to OSC concerning retaliatory investigations, added by the 2018 NDAA, as the decision offered comprehensive, unfortunately nonprecedential, analysis of the implications of investigations on IRA analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Applicable Standard</span>[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Though not raised by the appellant, we recognize that the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-91, 131 Stat. 1283, was signed into law on December 12, 2017, just after the issuance of the initial decision in the instant appeal. <span class="Italic">Spivey</span>, 22 MSPB 24, &#x00B6; 5 n.1. In particular, Congress added a provision to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214 that allows OSC to petition the Board for corrective action concerning damages incurred by an employee due to an agency's investigation of the employee if it was commenced, expanded, or extended in retaliation for protected whistleblowing activity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(i). Regardless of questions concerning retroactivity, the provision does not apply to the instant IRA appeal because OSC has not petitioned the Board for such relief. <span class="Italic">Spivey</span>, 2022 MSPB 24, &#x00B6; 5 n.1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant first refers us to a change in the law between the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) and the WPEA. Among other things, the latter added 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(4) to the relevant statutory scheme. <span class="Italic">See</span> WPEA &#x00A7; 104. That provision provides as follows: "Any corrective action ordered under this section to correct a prohibited personnel practice may include fees, costs, or damages reasonably incurred due to an agency investigation of the employee, if such investigation was commenced, expanded, or extended in retaliation for the disclosure or protected activity that formed the basis of the corrective action." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(4). According to the appellant, the addition of section 1221(g)(4) shows that Congress intended to expand whistleblower protections to include retaliatory investigations as actionable personnel actions, on their own. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1221(g)(4) does not create a separate cause of action for retaliatory investigations. In fact, the legislative history shows that Congress considered and rejected the option of changing the standard developed under the WPA and Board precedent to recognize a retaliatory investigation as a personnel action because Congress wanted to avoid discouraging agencies from undertaking legitimate and necessary inquiries. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 20-22 (2012), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 2012 U.S.C.C.A.N. 589, 608-09 (referencing <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of Justice</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 317, 323-25 (1997)). Congress opted to instead authorize an award of consequential damages once an employee is able to prove a claim under the WPA, if the employee can further demonstrate that an investigation was undertaken in retaliation for the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 21-22; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(b)(2). Accordingly, the appellant's first argument about his retaliation by investigation claim fails.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3908"></span>The appellant's second argument, in the alternative, is that the agency's investigation qualified as a covered personnel action, even before the WPEA's addition of section 1221(g)(4). He asserts that "a retaliatory investigation was considered a personnel action if it was a pretext for gathering evidence to retaliate." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 323-24). On this point, we again disagree. The appellant appears to misunderstand Board precedent.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Mangano v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 658 (2008), best illustrates how the appellant's assertions about the applicable standard are mistaken. The appellant in <span class="Italic">Mangano</span> argued that the administrative judge erred by finding that two investigations--an Administrative Investigation Board (AIB) and a Quality Improvement Review (QIR)--were not personnel actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 36. The Board did not adopt the appellant's position, and the Board did not find that the agency's investigations were covered personnel actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 36-44. Instead, the Board recognized that the AIB and QIR investigations were so closely related to the misconduct charge underlying the appellant's removal that they could have been pretext for gathering evidence to use to retaliate for his whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 44. In doing so, the Board discussed how the QIR was convened by the subject of the employee's whistleblowing and was conducted in an unusual manner, and the agency included the AIB results in its misconduct charge against the employee in a way that was inconsistent with the investigatory results. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under those circumstances, the Board concluded that the appellant's allegation of retaliation by investigation concerning the AIB and QIR should be considered on remand in determining the strength of the agency's evidence supporting the appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In other words, the alleged retaliation by investigation was not a separate personnel action subject to its own burden-shifting analysis. Instead, the Board would consider the alleged retaliation by investigation as part of the burden-shifting analysis of a personnel action that is enumerated in section 2302(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Applying the Applicable Standard to This Appeal</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning back to the instant appeal, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to establish that the investigation constituted a personnel action as defined in section 2302(a)(2)(A), or that the investigation was a pretext for gathering evidence to retaliate for his whistleblowing. She further found that even if the appellant had met his burden regarding Personnel Action 2, the agency met its burden of proving that it would have conducted the investigation in the absence of the appellant's whistleblowing activity. We agree with the administrative judge's findings of fact. However, we modify the initial decision to apply those findings of fact to the proper standards, which we just described.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again, an investigation is not a personnel action, <span class="Italic">per se</span>. <span class="Italic">Supra</span> &#x00B6; 21. Furthermore, we found no substantive argument or evidence establishing that the investigation at issue in this appeal, which was conducted by an outside party, constituted a significant change in the appellant's working conditions or other enumerated personnel action, as defined in section 2302(a)(2)(A).
</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The more relevant question is whether retaliation by investigation tainted any personnel action that is enumerated in section 2302(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See supra</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-22. To the extent that the administrative judge applied the burden shifting framework to the appellant's retaliation by investigation claim, as if it might be a separate personnel action, she erred. <span class="Italic">See Clarke v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 154, &#x00B6; 19 n.10 (2014) (stating that the Board may not proceed to the clear and convincing evidence test unless it has first determined that the appellant established his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 623 F. App'x 1016 (Fed. Cir. 2015). Nevertheless, we find no basis for disturbing the underlying findings of fact about the legitimacy or nonretaliatory nature of the investigation, findings which are more appropriately considered in connection with whether the agency would have taken Personnel Actions 3-5 in the absence of the appellant's whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See Mangano</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 658, &#x00B6; 44; <span class="Italic">supra</span> &#x00B6; 22.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant reasserts that the investigation was a pretext for retaliation, he has failed to present any persuasive basis for us to disturb the administrative judge's findings to the contrary, which are largely based on hearing testimony and credibility determinations regarding several witnesses from multiple agencies. <span class="Italic">See Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (recognizing that the Board must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An OPM background investigation of an applicant for employment was not a personnel practice in an IRA appeal, <span class="Italic">Boyd v. OPM</span>, AT-0731-13-7162-I-1 (NP 11/21/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, the appellant failed to present any evidence of OPM engaging in a "personnel action" as it relates to the DHS position for which she applied. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). While DHS's nonselection of the appellant for its vacancy was a personnel action, <span class="Italic">see King</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 10, OPM's background investigation was not. In reaching this conclusion, we note that Congress took such investigations into consideration when it recently amended the WPA by enacting the WPEA. Specifically, the legislative history of the WPEA indicates that, although Congress was aware that retaliatory investigations were not expressly referenced as a personnel action under the WPA, it declined to insert a provision concerning such investigations in light of the Administration's concern "that legitimate and important agency inquiries--including...routine background investigations for initial employment...--not be chilled by fear of challenge and litigation." S. Rep. No. 112-743, at 21 (2012). Because there is no indication in the statute or its legislative history that routine OPM background investigations are personnel actions under the WPA, the administrative judge correctly dismissed the appellant's appeal in <span class="Italic">Boyd I</span> for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A notice to an employee that his responses to an investigation lacked candor, with no record of that notice in personnel records, and no warning as to future discipline, did not constitute a covered personnel action in <span class="Italic">Spivey v. DOJ</span>, 2022 MSPB 24 (2022). But negative information provided during an investigation, leading to a direct, credible threat to an applicant's federal appointment, amounted to a threatened personnel action within the ambit of an IRA, <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Dept. of Labor</span>, AT-3443-13-7178-I-1 (NP 11/21/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Boyd II</span>, the appellant's response to the show cause order alleged that two of her former supervisors at DOL were in positions to provide negative employment references for the DHS vacancy. She surmised that these DOL supervisors provided such references in retaliation for her alleged whistleblowing while employed there. In her petition for review of <span class="Italic">Boyd II</span>, the appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that there was no evidence of DOL's retaliating by providing negative information to OPM. Moreover, she argues that DOL's providing negative information, if any, was a "personnel action" under the WPA and that the administrative judge erred in finding otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Mattil v. Department of State</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 23 (2012), the Board held that "blacklisting" an employee could constitute a personnel action within the meaning of the WPA. There, the appellant asserted that the agency retaliated against him for his protected disclosures, in part, by relieving him of his duties, denying him the opportunity to extend his appointment, and "blacklisting" him from future employment opportunities. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 17. The Board found that, construed broadly, "blacklisting" could constitute a failure to appoint, or a threatened failure to appoint, both of which are expressly covered personnel actions under the WPA, and, therefore, remanded the appeal for further adjudication. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-established that an appointment to a position may be conditioned upon the completion of a background investigation and that information discovered in the course of that investigation may be the basis for the cancellation of an appointment. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Social Security Administration</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 128 (2012); 5 C.F.R. Parts 731, 736. However, this appeal involves more than a merely hypothetical effect from the dissemination of derogatory information. Taking the appellant's assertions as true, the allegedly negative information clearly represented a direct and credible threat to the appellant's conditional DHS appointment. This threat was not speculative, but rather, was comparable to the allegation of "blacklisting" deemed actionable in <span class="Italic">Mattil</span>, involving specific actions by an agency official to prevent the appellant's employment in a particular position, and, therefore, could constitute a personnel action within the meaning of the WPA.</p>
