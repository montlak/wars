<p class="Body-Text">In 1994 Congress enacted Pub. L. 103-424, reauthorizing the MSPB and OSC. This statute substantially amended the Whistleblower Protection Act. One change, &#x00A7; 7 of the law, extended whistleblower protection to VA personnel employed under Chapters 73 or 74 of Title 38, U.S. Code. These employees include VA professional and other medical personnel. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC 7401; Senate Report 103-358, <span class="Italic">reprinted at</span> 1994 USCCAN 3549, 3559. [Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-186.html#sec1-184">Department of Veterans Affairs</a>," concerning MSPB jurisdiction over VA hybrid, nonhybrid, and Title 5 employees; refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-20-229.html#sec13-221">Stays of Personnel Actions</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-08-186.html#sec1-184">Department of Veterans Affairs</a>."] The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 established stay procedures of personnel actions against VA employees who are whistleblowers. Under 38 USC 714. [Refer later in this Chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-20-229.html#sec13-221">Stays of Personnel Actions</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-08-186.html#sec1-184">Department of Veterans Affairs</a>."]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Harding was appointed as a Staff Physician by the Department of Veterans Affairs ("DVA") pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(1). On November 8, 2002, the DVA removed Dr. Harding from his position on charges of persistent failure to maintain certain patient records. The DVA's discharge <span id="Page_3823"></span>notice indicated that Dr. Harding's removal "involve[d] a question of professional conduct or competence," entitling him to appeal the decision to a Disciplinary Appeals Board under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7462(a). Dr. Harding then pursued two simultaneous avenues to challenge his removal. He filed an appeal with the Disciplinary Appeals Board, which ultimately led to the removal penalty being mitigated to a fourteen-day suspension. He also pursued a claim, initially filed prior to his discharge, with the United States Office of Special Counsel, in which he alleged that he was improperly discharged in retaliation for whistleblower activities. The Office of Special Counsel, after conducting a preliminary investigation, advised Dr. Harding that it was "unable to make a determination in his favor" and terminated its investigation. It then notified him, in writing, that because he had alleged that he was a victim of "reprisal for whistleblowing," he had "a right to seek corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board" pursuant to an individual right of action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Harding then appealed to the Board. In his initial decision, the administrative law judge dismissed Dr. Harding's petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, concluding that Dr. Harding had "failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that he made a disclosure protected under the whistleblower statute." <span class="Italic">Harding v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> No. SE-1221-03-0216-W-1 (M.S.P.B. July 10, 2003) ("<span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span>").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Harding filed a petition for review by the full Board, which, in a decision rendered on March 14, 2005, denied the petition, reopened the appeal <span class="Italic">sua sponte,</span> vacated the Initial Decision, and dismissed the reopened appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. at 297. The Board, in a two-to-one decision, determined that it lacked jurisdiction over Dr. Harding's claim because of the exclusivity provision of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7462, which provides that DVA Disciplinary Appeals Boards "shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review any case...which arises out of...a question of professional conduct or competence of a section 7401(1) employee." Because Dr. Harding was a DVA physician appointed pursuant to &#x00A7; 7401(1), and because the DVA's discharge notice specified that Dr. Harding was removed for conduct involving his "professional conduct or competence," the Board concluded that the Disciplinary Appeals Boards had exclusive jurisdiction over his claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Dr. Harding argues that the Board's decision was not in accordance with law because it failed to properly consider an amendment to the WPA that, he asserts, expressly provides for Board review of whistleblower claims by DVA medical personnel. Like Board member Sapin in her dissenting opinion below, he argues that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(f) represents express authorization by Congress for the inclusion of DVA medical personnel in the class of "employees" protected by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Section 2105(f) provides that for purposes of several provisions of Title V, including section 1221, "employees appointed under chapter 73 or 74 of Title 38 shall be employees."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board considered this argument and rejected it, relying primarily on the "notwithstanding" clause of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7425(b), which states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, <span class="Italic">no provision of title 5...</span>which is inconsistent with...this chapter [38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7401 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>] shall be considered to supersede, override, or otherwise modify such provision of that section or this chapter except to the extent that such provision of title 5 or of such other law specifically provides, by <span class="Italic">specific reference</span> to a provision of this chapter, [f]or such provision to be superseded, overridden, or otherwise modified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The critical question is whether the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(f) is sufficient to constitute it as "a provision of title 5...[that] specifically provides, by specific reference to a provision of [chapter 74 of title 38], [f]or such provision to be superseded, overridden, or otherwise modified." The Board concluded that it was not, stating that "[t]he sweeping language of section 7425(b)...signals the drafter's intention that the provisions of the 'notwithstanding' clause trump all other laws," and that "the relevant portion of [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(f)] ...did not set out a 'specific' reference to any provision of Title 38 that was to be 'superseded, overridden, or otherwise modified.'" <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. at 300.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. Section 2105(f) of Title 5 expresses Congress' intent to supersede, not a "specific provision" of chapter 74, but all the provisions of chapters 73 and 74 that might operate to preclude "employees" appointed under those chapters from pursuing remedies under enumerated provisions of Title 5. The only question is whether this broad--but explicit--Congressional command should be defeated by its very breadth. We conclude that it should not. Section 2105(f), by stating Congress' intent to supersede all relevant provisions of chapters 73 and 74 for particular purposes, effectively overrides the specificity requirements of &#x00A7; 7425(b) and, consequently, the exclusivity provision of &#x00A7; 7462. To conclude that Congress' decision to supersede all relevant provisions of chapter 74 is somehow ineffective to supersede one particular provision of that chapter is to elevate form over substance and vitiate Congress' clear intent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cases relied upon by the dissent are entirely consistent with the result we reach today. The only Federal Circuit decision to address the application of &#x00A7; 2105(f) to Veterans Health Administration health-care personnel concluded that "Congress has expressly provided [DVA medical personnel] with coverage by Title 5 provisions relating to whistleblower protection." <span class="Italic">James v. Von Zemenszky</span>, 284 F.3d 1310, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing &#x00A7; 2105(f)). The Board has drawn the same conclusion. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 78, 84 n.* (1999) (stating that "as a Department of Veterans Affairs...physician appointed under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(1), the appellant cannot appeal his removal directly to the Board...[but] can bring this appeal, in which the only issue is whether the removal was retaliatory...because in 1994 Congress extended the WPA's coverage to DVA physicians"), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 242 F.3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The United States Office of Special Counsel sent a letter specifically advising Dr. Harding of his right to appeal his removal to the Board, stating that he could "seek corrective action from the MSPB under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(a)(3) and 1221," even instructing him to include the letter in his Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it is true, as the dissent states, that several other circuits have held "that under the predecessor of 7425(b), Title 5 yields to Title 38 in the case of a conflict, unless the conflicting provision of Title 5 expressly supersedes the Title 38 provision," those cases address the simpler circumstance in which an arguably inconsistent Title 5 provision makes no reference to any Congressional intent to supersede any part of Title 38. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Am. Fed. of Gov't Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth.,</span> 850 F.2d 782, 784 (D.C. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Am. Fed. of Gov't Employees, Local 3306 v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth.</span>, 2 F.3d 6, 10 (2d Cir. 1993) ("<span class="Italic">American Federation II</span>"); <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr. v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth.</span>, 705 F.2d 953, 958 (8th Cir. 1983). The most recent of the regional circuit cases cited by the dissent noted that under &#x00A7; 7425(b), "provisions of title 5...cannot implicitly modify title 38." <span class="Italic">American Federation II,</span> 2 F.3d at 10 (emphasis added). We agree with the dissent that, in the absence of any evidence of Congressional intent to override or modify a provision of Title 38, section 7425(b) must preclude any such modification. Where, however, Congress has expressly stated its intention to override multiple provisions of Title 38 for a particular purpose, sound principles of statutory construction not only permit, but require, this court to give effect to Congress' clear intent. This is especially true where, as here, the modifying provision substantially post-dates the provision that ostensibly precludes modification.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Section 2105(f) was enacted in 1994. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 103-424, 108 Stat. 4361. Section 4119 of title 38 was enacted in 1980, and was simply redesignated without modification as &#x00A7; 7425(b) in 1991. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 102-40, 105 Stat. 187. To the extent that &#x00A7; 7425(b) and &#x00A7; 2105(f) can be said to conflict, this is an appropriate circumstance for the application of the ancient canon of construction lex posterior derogate legi priori: where two statutory provisions appear to conflict, the later in time prevails.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the legislative history of &#x00A7; 2105(f) supports the view that Congress intended to provide the protections of the WPA to all Title 38 health care employees. In the floor debates discussing proposed legislation that became &#x00A7; 2105(f), Senator Conrad expressed concern that "[DVA] employees have reported that section 7425(b) of Title 38 supersedes Title 5 and exempts DVA health care workers from the provisions of the [WPA]." 139 Cong. Rec., pt. 4, 5822 (1993). Senator Conrad, citing a report by the House Committee on Government Operations on the deficiencies of the DVA medical quality assurance program, indicated that "DVA employees who report fraud, abuse and other inappropriate medical care at DVA medical facilities have been subject to harassment, intimidation, and other deplorable treatment by DVA management and supervisory personnel." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. He was "very concerned that health care personnel in the [DVA] are not adequately protected under the provisions of the [WPA]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In response to this concern, Senator Conrad "introduced legislation...to clarify that the provisions of the [WPA] (title 5) apply to title 38 health care employees of the [DVA]."[3] <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Although we acknowledge that, in interpreting statutes, courts should be "wary of testimony before committee hearings and debates on the floor of Congress save for precise analyses of statutory phrases by the sponsors of the proposed laws," <span class="Italic">S&#x0026;E Contracts, Inc. v. United States</span>, 406 U.S. 1, 13 n.9 (1972), that sensible caution does not prevent us from relying upon the remarks of the sponsor of legislation describing his purpose in introducing that legislation as an indicator of Congressional intent, at least in the absence of contradictory evidence in the legislative history. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">New Mexico v. United States,</span> 831 F.2d 265, 269 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1994, Congress adopted &#x00A7; 2105(f). Contrary to the assertions made by <span id="Page_3824"></span>the dissent and the Board, there is no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to limit its extension of Board jurisdiction to DVA medical personnel to those whose claim is not based on a question of "professional conduct or competence." <span class="Italic">Cf. Final Decision,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. at 301. Similarly, the 1980 Explanatory Statement cited by the dissent does little but restate the statutory language of what is now &#x00A7; 7425(b). It provides no insight into whether Congress might subsequently decide to supersede entire chapters of Title 38 instead of individual provisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge the interpretive difficulties of this case. We conclude, however, that by enacting &#x00A7; 2105(f) Congress expressed its intention to supersede all inconsistent provisions of chapters 73 and 74 of Title 38 and thereby extend Board jurisdiction to claims like Dr. Harding's. We therefore reverse the Board's decision and remand this case for consideration of the merits.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not dispute the AJ's conclusion that, as a medical professional appointed under 38 U.S.C. ch. 74, he cannot appeal his removal directly to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(10). Instead, the appellant contends that IRA jurisdiction has been established. Ordinarily in an IRA appeal, an appellant will be granted a hearing (where requested) if he has exhausted his administrative remedies before OSC and makes non-frivolous allegations that he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure and that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. In the absence of the requisite non-frivolous allegations, an IRA appeal is properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, without a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001). There is, however, a more basic jurisdictional issue in this appeal, namely, whether the Board can even entertain the possibility of IRA jurisdiction under <span class="Italic">Yunus</span> where the appellant contests his removal from employment as a DVA medical professional on a charge arising out of his professional conduct or competence. As explained below, we hold that the appellant cannot institute an IRA appeal from his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) of 1989 gave the Board jurisdiction to adjudicate IRA appeals brought by "employee[s]," among others. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221. In 1991, Congress enacted 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7462, which revised earlier law concerning DVA's internal appeals procedure for medical professionals; under section 7462, the DVA DAB has "exclusive jurisdiction" over an appeal from a major adverse action (such as a removal) taken against a DVA physician based on "a question of professional conduct or competence." As part of the same 1991 legislation, Congress provided that a DVA medical professional has no right of appeal under a provision of Title 5 if such an appeal would be "inconsistent" with the separate personnel system devised for such employees. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7425(b). Accordingly, under the 1989 version of the WPA, a DVA medical professional cannot bring an IRA appeal before the Board if the action complained of falls under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7462; for the Board to entertain an IRA appeal in such a case would be to interfere with the "exclusive jurisdiction" of the DAB, the decision of which, when executed by the Secretary of DVA, is "the final administrative action." <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7462(a)(1), (d)(4). A DVA medical professional may institute an IRA appeal from a personnel action that falls under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7463, that is, an action that is not a major adverse action or does not involve professional conduct or competence and is not part of a "mixed case."[2] <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7463(a);<span class="Italic"> Cochran v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 167, 174 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;A "mixed case" is a case that includes both a major adverse action arising out of a question of professional conduct or competence and an adverse action which is not a major adverse action or which does not arise out of a question of professional conduct or competence. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7462(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in the present case was removed based on a question of professional conduct or competence subject to the DAB procedure under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7462. We therefore disagree with the initial decision to the extent that it relied on <span class="Italic">Cochran--</span>which involved an employee subject to the procedure under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7463--to find that the appellant can institute an IRA appeal. Our analysis does not end there, however. In amendments to the WPA in 1994, Congress provided that, "[f]or purposes of section[] ...1221" of Title 5, U.S.C., DVA medical professionals shall be considered "employees." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(f). <span class="Italic">Cochran</span> mentioned the 1994 WPA amendments but expressly found that they did not apply because the personnel actions in that case were taken before the effective date of the 1994 amendments. <span class="Italic">See</span> 67 M.S.P.R. at 169. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Dick v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 464 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 4-7 (1999), <span class="Italic">vacated on other grounds</span>, 290 F.3d 1356, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2002), the Board mentioned the 1994 WPA amendments but did not apply them because the actions complained of in that case were taken before the amendments became effective. <span class="Italic">See Dick,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 464 &#x00B6; 6 (the Board took jurisdiction "under the WPA of 1989"); <span class="Italic">see also Cochran</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 169 (the 1994 WPA amendments became effective on October 29, 1994, and do not apply retroactively to personnel actions taken before that date).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Any suggestion in <span class="Italic">Cochran</span> and <span class="Italic">Dick</span> that the 1994 WPA amendments expanded the IRA appeal rights of DVA medical professionals to actions based on professional conduct or competence was <span class="Italic">dictum</span> and will not be followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The present case, in contrast to <span class="Italic">Cochran</span> and <span class="Italic">Dick</span>, is covered by the 1994 version of the WPA since the appellant's removal was effective in 2002. The issue before the Board is whether the appellant can institute an IRA appeal by virtue of the 1994 WPA amendments, or whether IRA jurisdiction is precluded under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7425 and 7462. The appellant argues that, based on the general intent of the 1994 WPA amendments as stated in Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs Report No. 103-358, <span class="Italic">viz</span>., to create a clear remedy for all cases of retaliation against whistleblowers, along with the specific language added at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(f) making DVA medical professionals "employees" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221, the 1994 WPA amendments extended unlimited IRA appeal rights to DVA medical professionals even in cases where the DVA DAB also has jurisdiction. The agency, for its part, contends that, under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7462, the DVA DAB has exclusive jurisdiction to review major adverse actions taken against Title 38 medical professionals which arise out of questions of professional conduct or competence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is axiomatic that statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute. <span class="Italic">Watson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 318, 321 &#x00B6; 7 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 262 F.3d 1292 (Fed. Cir. 2001), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 534 U.S. 1083 (2002). We find that the language of the relevant statutes--38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7425 and 7462--supports a conclusion that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's IRA appeal. Section 7425(b) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no provision of title 5 or any other law pertaining to the civil service system which is inconsistent with any provision of section 7306 of this title or this chapter shall be considered to supersede, override, or otherwise modify such provision of that section or this chapter except to the extent that such provision of title 5 or of such other law specifically provides, by specific reference to a provision of this chapter, [f]or such provision to be superseded, overridden, or otherwise modified.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The statute has an apparent typographical error. The last phrase should be "for such provision to be superseded, overridden, or otherwise modified." <span class="Italic">See Cochran</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 170-71.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, as stated above, under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7462, the DVA DAB has "exclusive jurisdiction" over appeals from actions involving the professional conduct or competence of DVA medical professionals; the DAB's decision, when carried out, as has already occurred here, is "the final administrative action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It would be "inconsistent" with the "exclusive" Title 38 DAB appeals scheme and its finality rule for the Board to consider an IRA appeal brought by a DVA medical professional against whom an action was taken based on a charge involving professional conduct or competence. <span class="Italic">Cochran</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 173. The sweeping language of section 7425(b)--"notwithstanding any other provision of law"--signals the drafter's intention that the provisions of the "notwithstanding" clause trump all other laws. <span class="Italic">See Brooks v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 464 &#x00B6; 13 (2004). The 1994 WPA amendments did not set out a "specific" reference to any provision of Title 38 that was to be "superseded, overridden, or otherwise modified," as required by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7425(b). Instead, the relevant portion of the 1994 amendments simply brought DVA medical professionals within the express definition of "employee" for purposes of enumerated Title 5 provisions, including section 1221.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the statutory language is inconclusive, we further find that the legislative history cited by the appellant does not show Board jurisdiction over his IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 405 &#x00B6; 8 (2002) (indicating that the Board will consider legislative history if the statutory language is not clear on its face). In the report issued by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs on the bill that became the 1994 WPA amendments, the section-by-section analysis states, insofar as is pertinent here, that section 7 of the bill would "extend[] whistleblower protection coverage" to DVA medical professionals. S. Rep. 103-358 at 11, 103rd Cong., 2d Sess. (1994), <span class="Italic">reprinted at</span> 1994 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 3549, 3559. The report further <span id="Page_3825"></span>states that the 1994 WPA amendments "incorporate[] ...a bill introduced by Senator Conrad to grant VA medical personnel whistleblower protection." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In introducing that bill, Senator Conrad stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Department of Veterans Affairs employees have reported that section 7425b of Title 38[38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7425(b)] supersedes Title 5 and exempts DVA health care workers under Title 38 from the provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Act. * * * The Committee on Government Operations recommends...that legislative action be taken to ensure that Title 38 employees are not exempt from the provisions under Title 5, the Whistleblower Protection Act. * * * I am introducing legislation today to clarify that the provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Act (Title 5) apply to Title 38 health care employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs--the exemption of Title 38 medical workers from the provisions of Title 5 would end.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">139 Cong. Record S3280 (daily ed. Mar. 19, 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This statement, however, appears to reflect the interpretation of the WPA of 1989 given prior to <span class="Italic">Cochran</span> in <span class="Italic">Alvarez v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 682 (1991), and <span class="Italic">Chan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 617 (1992). That interpretation excluded DVA medical professionals from the coverage of the 1989 version of the WPA. In <span class="Italic">Cochran</span>, to the contrary, the Board interpreted the scope of the <span class="Italic">pre-1994</span> version of the WPA as holding that DVA medical professionals are <span class="Italic">not</span> "exempt" from the coverage of the 1989 version of the WPA. Rather, according to <span class="Italic">Cochran</span>, a DVA medical professional may bring an IRA appeal under the WPA of 1989 as long as the action complained of was not a major adverse action based on a question of professional conduct or competence. <span class="Italic">Cochran</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 173-74; <span class="Italic">see also Dick</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 464 &#x00B6; 6. Thus, the legislative history--premised on the belief that DVA medical professionals were excluded <span class="Italic">altogether</span> from the coverage of the WPA of 1989--does not show that Congress intended to allow DVA medical professionals subject to a major adverse action based on a question of professional conduct or competence to bring an IRA appeal to the Board. Indeed, the 1994 WPA amendments can properly be understood as modifying <span class="Italic">Alvarez</span> and <span class="Italic">Chan</span>. In 1994, Congress had no reason to know those decisions would be modified by the Board in the 1995 <span class="Italic">Cochran</span> decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant argues that the agency can avoid defending IRA appeals simply by "self-labeling" an action as one involving professional conduct or competence. Granted, it appears that the Secretary of DVA has exclusive authority to determine what matters arise out of "professional conduct or competence." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7462(d)(1). In any event, however, we have no basis for second-guessing the agency's determination in this case that the charged conduct, the appellant's alleged failure to document patient progress notes connected with his examinations, involves professional conduct or competence. It is also noteworthy that, as mentioned above, the DAB took jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal and granted relief.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cochran v. VA</span>, 67 MSPR 167, 169-74 (1995), made passing reference to the 1994 legislation and added extensive analysis of 1991 legislation having the effect of allowing the Board to exercise jurisdiction over certain physicians' whistleblower complaints involving disciplinary actions that the VA examined through grievance procedures rather than through disciplinary boards:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In recent amendments to the WPA, Congress added subsection (f) to 5 USC &#x00A7; 2105 providing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that for purposes of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302, "employees appointed under chapter 73 or 74 of title 38 shall be employees." <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. 2970, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. &#x00A7; 7 (1994). The amendments, however, were effective "on and after the date of...enactment," which was October 7, 1994, and do not apply retroactively to the agency's letter of admonishment or its removal action, which were effected on August 20, 1993, and March 3, 1994, respectively. <span class="Italic">See Caddell v. Department of Justice</span>, 66 MSPR 347, 352-54 (1995). Nonetheless, for the following reasons, we find that the appellant is an employee over whom the Board may exercise jurisdiction in this IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department of Veterans Affairs Health-Care Personnel Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-40, 105 Stat. 210, enacted on May 7, 1991 (the 1991 Act), revised and redesignated sections 4101 through 4119 of chapter 73 of title 38 as various sections of the new chapter 74 of title 38<span class="Italic">. See</span> 105 Stat. 221. Thus, we will apply the provisions of the revised statute to this appeal, which concerns actions taken after the enactment of the 1991 Act. <span class="Italic">See Swango v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 59 MSPR 235, 238 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency appointed the appellant to his permanent, full-time, excepted-service Physician position on March 1, 1991, under the authority of 38 USC &#x00A7; 4104(1). The 1991 Act replaced section 4104(1) with section 7401(1), which provides, as did the former section, that the agency may appoint physicians. In finding that the Board lacked jurisdiction over IRA appeals filed by DVA employees appointed under section 7401(1), the administrative judge relied on the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Alvarez v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 49 MSPR 682, 684-86 (1991), and <span class="Italic">Chan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 53 MSPR 617, 620 (1992). The appellant argues that those two decisions do not address the specific issue raised here, and that changes made by Congress in the 1991 Act allow the Board to exercise jurisdiction over this appeal under the circumstances presented. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Alvarez</span>, the Board found that it did not have jurisdiction to adjudicate an IRA appeal from a physician who was appointed to his position under 38 USC &#x00A7; 4104(1). In so finding, the Board relied on 38 USC &#x00A7; 4119, which stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Notwithstanding any provision of law, no provision of title 5 or any other law pertaining to the civil service system which is inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter shall be considered to supersede, override, or otherwise modify such provision of this subchapter except to the extent that such provision of title 5 or of such law specifically provides, by the specific reference to a provision of this subchapter, for such provision to be superseded, overridden, or otherwise modified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See Alvarez</span>, 49 MSPR at 684-85. The new provision, 38 USC &#x00A7; 7425(b), contains the same language, except that references to "any provision of this subchapter" are replaced by references to "any provision of section 7306 of this title or this chapter." In addition, section 7425(a) was added <span id="Page_3826"></span>to include a list of title 5 provisions that are expressly not applicable to employees appointed under section 7401(1). The WPA is not a part of that list. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 7425(a); <span class="Italic">Swango</span>, 59 MSPR at 238 n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board in <span class="Italic">Alvarez</span> found a congressional intent that the agency be able to discipline employees without the restrictions pertaining to the civil service based on the language in 38 USC &#x00A7; 4110(d) that "[t]he decision of the Administrator [of the Veterans Administration] shall be final" in such matters. <span class="Italic">See</span> 49 MSPR at 685. Moreover, because the WPA made no specific provision for the Board to adjudicate personnel matters independently of the agency's scheme, the Board held that the provisions of the WPA did not override or supersede that scheme. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Chan</span>, the Board applied the legal analysis and reasoning in <span class="Italic">Alvarez</span> to find that it lacked jurisdiction over an IRA appeal filed by a physician appointed under 38 USC &#x00A7; 4114(a)(1)(A). <span class="Italic">See</span> 53 MSPR at 620. In further support of its jurisdictional finding, the Board noted that the language of 38 USC &#x00A7; 4114(a)(1)(A) stated expressly that civil service laws do not apply to a title 38 physician employed under that provision. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7401(1) does not state, however, as did the appointing statute at issue in <span class="Italic">Chan</span>, that civil service laws are inapplicable to a physician employed under that section. Rather, as explained above, section 7425(b) contains a list of title 5 provisions that do not apply to employees appointed under section 7401(1) and states that no other provision of title 5 or any other law pertaining to the civil service system which is inconsistent with any provision of chapter 74 of title 38 shall be considered to supersede, override, or otherwise modify chapter 74 of title 38 except to the extent that such provision of title 5 or of such law specifically provides, by the specific reference to a provision of chapter 74 of title 38 for such provision to be superseded, overridden, or otherwise modified. For the reasons discussed below, we find that 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221 is not "inconsistent with" the disciplinary scheme established by the 1991 Act for actions taken under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7463.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The former section 4110 of title 38 provided that all "charges of ineptitude, inefficiency, or misconduct" against a physician appointed under section 4104(1) should be heard before an agency disciplinary board, which would decide if the charges were sustained and, if so, what discipline to recommend to the Administrator, who would approve, disapprove, or modify the board's recommendation. 38 USC &#x00A7; 4110(a)-(d). According to the statute, "[t]he decision of the Administrator shall be final." As discussed in <span class="Italic">Chan</span>, such a disciplinary scheme made it "inconsistent" for the Board to adjudicate appeals from the Administrator's "final" decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 49 MSPR at 684-85.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the 1991 Act, when the agency's Chief Medical Officer takes a "major adverse action" against an employee appointed under section 7401(1), and the adverse action involves a "question of professional conduct or competence," the employee has a right of appeal to a Disciplinary Appeals Board under section 7462.[*] 38 USC &#x00A7; 7461(a) and (b)(1). Upon hearing such an appeal, the Disciplinary Appeals Board renders a decision, which the Secretary of the DVA shall execute, reverse, vacate and remand, or mitigate as to the discipline. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 7462. In cases involving questions of professional conduct or competence, the 1991 Act provides that "[t]he Secretary's execution of a board's decision shall be the final administrative action in the case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7462(d)(4). Moreover, in such cases, the Act provides that the avenue for appeal of the Secretary's decision is judicial review. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 7462(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;A "major adverse action" is defined as an adverse action involving a suspension, transfer, reduction in grade or basic pay, and discharge. 38 USC &#x00A7; 7461(c)(2). A "question of professional conduct or competence" is one involving "direct patient care" or "clinical competence." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7461(c)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the 1991 Act, in 38 USC &#x00A7; 7463, establishes a separate procedure for cases either not involving a "major adverse action" or not arising out of a "question of professional conduct or competence." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7463(a). It provides that the Disciplinary Appeals Board lacks jurisdiction over such cases, and that in them, the employee is entitled to a grievance procedure in which findings are made by an impartial examiner whose findings and recommendations are reviewed by "an official of a higher level than the official who decided upon the action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7463(d). Section 7463 of title 38 does not state that the reviewing official's decision shall be final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record in the instant appeal shows that the agency's removal action did not arise out of a question of professional conduct or competence, but rather out of a question of "preemployment suitability." The hearing the appellant received was not before a Disciplinary Appeals Board, but rather before a Professional Standards Board, which the record evidence shows is a different board. Moreover, the removal action proceeded under the agency's grievance procedures set forth at MP-5, Part II, Chapter 9; the action did not proceed under MP-5, Part II, Chapter 8, section A, which involves procedures to be followed when an action is a major adverse action arising out of a question of professional conduct or performance. Based on the documentary evidence, we accept the agency's characterization of the removal action as one falling within the provisions of 38 USC &#x00A7; 7463. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 466, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., at 30 (1990) ("the issue of whether a matter or question involves professional conduct or competence is not subject to review by any other agency").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The August 20, 1993, admonishment letter states that it was not being issued for reasons involving a question of professional conduct or competence. We therefore find that it, too, was an action taken under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7463.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following aspects of the statutory scheme involving a section 7401(1) employee who is subject to an adverse action under section 7463 action show that it would be consistent with that scheme for the Board to exercise jurisdiction over an IRA appeal by such an employee: (1) section 7463 does not state that the reviewing official's decision shall be final, as did the statutory provisions at issue in <span class="Italic">Chan</span> and <span class="Italic">Alvarez</span>; (2) section 7463, unlike section 7462, does not limit further review of the agency's action in any way; (3) Congress did not include the relevant provisions of the WPA in the list of title 5 provisions which expressly do not apply to section 7401(1) employees; and (4) section 7401(1) does not state that civil service laws are inapplicable to a physician employed under that provision, as did the statutory provision discussed in <span class="Italic">Chan</span>. There are yet additional considerations that support this conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the 1991 Act emphasizes that the Secretary's decisions as to actions taken under section 7462 are final and not reviewable by any other agency, while references to what became section 7463 make no such mention of the finality of the agency's decisions as to actions taken under that section. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 466, at 29-32. Moreover, Congress' intent in enacting the 1991 Act was, in part, to afford title 38 employees an opportunity to have "disciplinary actions and grievances related to their employment resolved in a timely fashion with an opportunity for outside review." 137 Cong. Rec. S4543 (Apr. 17, 1991) (statement of Sen. Cranston). As stated above, section 7463 does not limit the scope of outside review of agency actions taken under that section (as does section 7462), leaving open the opportunity for review of IRA appeals by the Board in cases involving section 7463 discipline. Further, Congress can be presumed to have known of the provisions of the WPA when it enacted the 1991 Act and to have contemplated that "outside review" of section 7463 actions could, in the absence of any limiting language, be exercised by the Board under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See D'Elia v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 60 MSPR 226, 232 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, a disciplinary action taken under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7462 requires review and execution by the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the highest-ranking administrative officer in the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 7462(d). Under such circumstances and in view of the statutory language that the Secretary's action shall be the "final administrative action in the case," the Secretary's action would be entitled to due deference and not subordinated to review by the Board absent an express statutory grant of review authority, such as was provided in the 1994 amendments to the WPA discussed above<span class="Italic">. See Colorado Nurses Association v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 851 F.2d 1486, 1488-92 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (where the relevant statute indicated Congress' intent to give the Administrator of the Veterans Administration final and exclusive authority to prescribe regulations concerning conditions of employment, the Administrator's exercise of authority in that regard could not be subordinated to review by the Federal Labor Relations Authority).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, disciplinary actions taken under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7463 are subject only to a grievance procedure wherein the employee has a right to "formal review by an impartial examiner within the Department of Veterans Affairs" and a review of the examiner's findings and recommendations "by an official of a higher level than the official who decided upon the action." 38 USC &#x00A7; 7463(d). There is no statutory requirement that a section 7463 disciplinary action be reviewed or executed by the Secretary, let alone that the action constitute the "final" administrative action in the case. Thus, we find that a section 7463 disciplinary action need not be accorded the deference given to a section 7462 action and may be reviewed by the Board "consistent with" 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221. <span class="Italic">Cf. Colorado Nurses Association</span>, 851 F.2d at 1488-92.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant has shown that the Board can exercise jurisdiction over his IRA appeal consistent with the disciplinary scheme established by Congress for section 7401(1) employees who were subject to a disciplinary action that was grievable under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7463. However, to establish the Board's jurisdiction over his IRA appeal, the appellant also must establish, by preponderant evidence, that: (1) He engaged in whistleblower activity by making a disclosure protected under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), i.e., he disclosed information he reasonably believed evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or substantial and specific danger to public health or safety; (2) the agency took or failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take, a "personnel action" as defined in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2) after the July 9, 1989, effective date of the WPA; and (3) <span id="Page_3827"></span>he raised the whistleblower issue before OSC, and proceedings before OSC have been exhausted. <span class="Italic">See Geyer v. Department of Justice</span>, 63 MSPR 13, 16-17 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's removal action and its issuance of the letter of admonishment each constitute a "personnel action" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2), and both actions were effective after the effective date of the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii); <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, 63 MSPR at 17. Thus, on remand, the administrative judge shall provide the appellant an opportunity to submit argument and evidence showing that he made a disclosure or disclosures protected under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), that he raised the whistleblower issue before OSC, and that proceedings before OSC have been exhausted. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)]. If the administrative judge finds that the appellant has met all of the jurisdictional elements of his claim, he shall issue a new initial decision adjudicating the appeal on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Geyer</span>, 63 MSPR at 19.</p>
