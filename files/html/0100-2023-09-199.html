<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-196"><span class="space">2.</span> Permissive Intervention</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM and OSC intervene in MSPB cases by right; for others, intervention is by permission of the Board, usually exercised through an application or motion to the AJ assigned to an appeal (although intervention may be sought at the PFR level or in a case within the Board's original rather than appellate jurisdiction). The regulation, 5 CFR 1201.34(c) (2022), states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;Any person, organization or agency may, by motion, ask the judge for permission to intervene. The motion must explain the reason why the person, organization or agency should be permitted to intervene.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;A motion for permission to intervene will be granted where the requester will be affected directly by the outcome of the proceeding. Any person alleged to have committed a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b) may request permission to intervene. A judge's denial of a motion for permissive intervention may be appealed to the Board under &#x00A7; 1201.91 of this part.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Griffin v. OPM</span>, 75 MSPR 263, 268 (1997), explained the elements of permissive intervention:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In appropriate circumstances, the Board may permit an intervention by persons not otherwise parties to a case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.34(a). In considering whether to grant a motion for intervention, the Board will review all of the circumstances surrounding the presentation of the motion, including, but not limited to: (1) The timeliness of the motion; (2) the purpose of the motion; (3) the status of the proponent; (4) the contents of the motion in relation to specific facts that have been presented for resolution; and (5) the rights of the parties to the case, and the effect upon those parties of acceptance of the motion to intervene<span class="Italic">. Boulware v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, MSPB Docket No. AT-0831-95-0274-B-1, slip op. at 4 (Apr. 9, 1997). A motion for permission to intervene must "explain the reason why the person, organization or agency should be permitted to intervene." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.34(c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1178"></span><span class="Italic">Kostan v. Arizona Nat'l Guard</span>, 45 MSPR 173, 176 (1990), also summarized permissive intervention:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he NGB timely moved to enter this case as a permissive intervenor. As the Board's regulations provide, permissive intervention is proper only when the movant shows that it would be directly affected by the outcome of the proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.34(c); <span class="Italic">Crumbaker v. Department of the Labor,</span> 7 MSPB 15, 7 MSPR 84, 91 (1981). In considering a motion for intervention, the Board reviews all of the circumstances surrounding the presentation of that motion, including, but not limited to: (1) The timeliness of the motion; (2) the purpose of the motion; (3) the status of the proponent of such a motion; (4) the contents of the motion in relation to the specific facts that have been presented for resolution; and (5) the rights of the parties to the case and the effect upon those parties of the acceptance of the motion to intervene. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 31 MSPR 622, 624 (1986); <span class="Italic">Adakai v. Department of the Interior,</span> 20 MSPR 196, 199-200 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing the National Guard Technician Act, Pub. L. No. 90-486, &#x00A7; 2(1), 82 Stat. 755 (codified at 32 USC &#x00A7; 709(d)), the NGB asserts that its regulations governing the employment of National Guard technicians would be adversely affected if the Board asserted jurisdiction over the appellant's restoration claims. Based on the five considerations enumerated above, in particular the purpose of the motion, the status of the NGB in this case, and the relation of the motion to the specific facts presented for resolution in this case, the Board grants the NGB's motion to intervene.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fletcher v. OPM</span>, 41 MSPR 445, 448-49 (1989) (circumstances reviewed as to an intervention request include specific facts presented for resolution, the rights of the parties to the case, and the effect upon the parties of the acceptance of an intervention request; citing <span class="Italic">Jones v.

Department of Labor,</span> PHO7528210189 (October 27, 1982). In considering a motion for intervention, the Board reviews all the circumstances surrounding the presentation of that motion. These circumstances include but are not limited to, the timeliness of the motion, the purpose of the motion, the status of the proponent of such a motion, its contents in relation to the specific facts that have been presented for resolution, and most importantly, the rights of all the parties to the case and the effect upon those parties of acceptance of the motion to intervene.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There can be no doubt that the motion to intervene was filed out of time. Moreover, there has been no showing that the intervenor acted in a diligent fashion to pursue its asserted interests. The intervenor does not allege that it was unaware of the initial proceedings, of the nature of the issues presented at those proceedings, or of the result of the initial decision issued on April 1, 1983. Although it is arguable that the intervenor does have some interest in the outcome of this case, that assertion is speculative at best and is substantially undercut by untimeliness of the motion. Moreover, it is clear that a factual redetermination would be detrimental to the opposing party since the appellants have not been afforded a fair opportunity to contest the validity of the facts asserted. In light of the foregoing, the motion for intervention is hereby denied.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The intervention request need not be made with particular formality by a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> petitioner; and intervention need not be mentioned at all if it should be clear to the AJ that the petitioner would require intervention to protect her interests in the appeal, e.g., a retirement annuity claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Griffin v. OPM</span>, 75 MSPR 263, 268 (1997). If an AJ improperly denies intervention status, the Board may reopen the case to correct that error and remand the case for further consideration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lawson v.

<p class="Body-Text">An individual may seek to intervene if his interests are directly affected, e.g., he has been accused of a prohibited personnel practice during an appellant's defense to an adverse action. The intervention should be sought quickly. If the evidence shows that the putative intervenor could and should have acted earlier, the Board will decline to permit intervention after an initial decision is issued. <span class="Italic">Stevens v. DHUD</span>, 36 MSPR 170, 173 (1988) (final order denying intervention at the PFR level: the initial decision contained comments critical of the intervenor/supervisor but did not make a finding that the intervenor committed a prohibited personnel practice; "[t]here is no evidence beyond mere speculation that this finding [that supervisor made some ill-advised verbal statements] will have any effect on Mr. Hancock's future").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Denial of a motion for permissive intervention may be appealed to the Board in accordance with 5 CFR 1201.91 (2022), governing interlocutory appeals, and 5 CFR 1201.34(c)(2) (2022), governing permissive intervention. The Board recognizes that although the regulations do not require an interlocutory appeal, that route is more efficient than an attempt to raise the intervention issue through a PFR after the initial decision is issued. <span class="Italic">Crumbaker v.

In this case, however, the record clearly indicates that any overpayment assessed against the appellant is considered to be an underpayment deemed payable to the retiree because the appellant's entitlement is defined as a portion of his annuity....&#8197;If it is determined that there is no overpayment to the appellant, then there is no corresponding underpayment to the retiree. If any monies already recovered from the appellant have been remitted to the retiree, then it is possible that the retiree could be deemed to have received an overpayment. Whether or not any monies have been collected from the appellant, and whether or not any recovered monies have been remitted to the retiree, it is clear from the unusual circumstances of this case that the retiree's rights are directly affected by the result in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under certain circumstances, individuals who are not otherwise parties to a case before the Board may be permitted to intervene. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.34.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because, as noted above, the retiree's rights are directly affected by the result in this case, the administrative judge should have afforded notice of the appeal and the opportunity to file a request to intervene. <span class="Italic">See Griffin v.

Indeed, OPM acknowledged the rights and interests of the retiree in this matter and asked the administrative judge to advise him of his right to intervene.

Filiberti</span>, 23 MSPR 371, 373 (1984). An employee accused of benefiting from a prohibited personnel practice was properly permitted to intervene in an OSC corrective action proceeding against the agency.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(3)(B) provides that, whenever the SC petitions the Board for corrective action, the Board shall provide the opportunity for "written comments by any individual who alleges to be the subject of the prohibited personnel practice." Contrary to the SC's argument, and the ALJ's characterization of the intervention issue in this appeal, we find that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(3)(B) is silent regarding the intervention of an individual in a Board corrective action proceeding. Rather, the plain language of this statute clearly addresses only the opportunity to provide written comments. We therefore need not and do not determine whether Knowles is the "subject" of a prohibited personnel practice within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(3)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no language in the remainder of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214 that addresses the intervention of an individual in a Board corrective action proceeding. Further, we have found nothing in the legislative history of this statute to indicate that Congress intended to legislate the intervention of individuals in a Board corrective action proceeding. We thus find that the applicable statute is silent regarding the intervention of individuals in a Board corrective action proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1179"></span>Where a statute is silent, an agency may exercise its generally conferred authority to fill a particular gap. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Mead</span> <span class="Italic">Corp.</span>, 533 U.S. 218, 229 (2001). The Board has the authority "to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the performance of its functions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h). The Board has prescribed regulations that govern original jurisdiction cases. "Except as otherwise expressly provided by this subpart [Subpart D-Procedures for Original Jurisdiction Cases], the regulations in subpart B of this part applicable to appellate case processing also apply to original jurisdiction cases processed under this subpart." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.121(b)(1). One of the regulations applicable to appellate case processing is 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.34(a),(c), which permits any person, organization, or agency to request intervention in a Board proceeding if the outcome of the proceeding will affect them directly and if intervention is otherwise appropriate under law. Thus, section 1201.34(a),(c) applies in this corrective action proceeding unless "otherwise expressly provided" by subpart D of 5 C.F.R. part 1201. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.121(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The SC relies on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.130(a)(1) as evidence that individuals who allegedly benefited from a prohibited personnel practice may not intervene in a Board corrective action proceeding. This regulation provides that "[a]person on whose behalf the Special Counsel brings corrective action has a right to request intervention in the proceeding in accordance with the regulations in &#x00A7; 1201.34 of this part." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.130(a)(1). It is undisputed that Knowles is not "[a]person on whose behalf the Special Counsel brings corrective action." Thus, this regulation does not provide Knowles a right to request intervention. However, this regulation does not state that no one other than "[a]person on whose behalf the Special Counsel brings corrective action" has a right to request intervention in a corrective action proceeding and we do not interpret it that way. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.130(a)(1). In fact, we promulgated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.130(a)(1) for the sole purpose of ensuring that an individual on whose behalf the SC brings corrective action has a right to request intervention in the proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> 62 Fed. Reg. 48,449, 48,450 (Sept. 16, 1997). We thus find that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.130(a)(1) does not "otherwise expressly provide[&#8197;] " that an individual who allegedly benefited from a prohibited personnel practice cannot request intervention in a corrective action proceeding pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.34.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The SC also relies on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.130(a)(3) to support its argument that individuals who allegedly benefited from a prohibited personnel practice may not intervene in a corrective action proceeding. Title 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.130(a)(3) provides that "[t]he judge to whom the complaint is assigned shall provide a person alleged to have been the subject of any prohibited personnel practice alleged in the complaint the opportunity to make written comments, regardless of whether that person has requested and been granted intervenor status." The first part of this regulation merely restates 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(3)(B) to ensure that the "subject" of a prohibited personnel practice has the right to make written comments. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.130(a)(3). As discussed above, such language does not address intervention and certainly does not prohibit the intervention of one who allegedly benefits from a prohibited personnel practice. The remainder of this regulation merely clarifies that an individual who has requested and been granted intervenor status still must be provided the opportunity to make written comments if he is "a person alleged to have been the subject of any prohibited personnel practice in the complaint." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.130(a)(3); <span class="Italic">see</span> 62 Fed. Reg. 48,449, 48,450 (Sept. 16, 1997). We thus find that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.130(a)(3) does not "otherwise expressly provide[&#8197;] " that an individual who allegedly benefited from a prohibited personnel practice cannot request intervention in a corrective action proceeding pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.34.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The SC has not alleged that any other regulation in subpart D of 5 C.F.R. part 1201 addresses intervention by individuals in corrective action proceedings and we are unaware of any such regulation. Therefore, we find that the Board's regulations in subpart D of 5 C.F.R. part 1201 do not "otherwise expressly provide[&#8197;] " that an individual who allegedly benefited from a prohibited personnel practice cannot request intervention in a corrective action proceeding. Consequently, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.34(a),(c) applies here in determining whether Knowles, an individual who allegedly benefited from a prohibited personnel practice, should be permitted to intervene in this corrective action proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.121(b)(1); <span class="Italic">cf. Special Counsel v. Filiberti</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 371, 373-74 (1984) (title 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.34 applies to actions brought by the SC).</p>

Permission to intervene will be granted "where the requester will be affected directly by the outcome of the proceeding." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.34(c)(2).[2] In considering a motion for intervention, the Board reviews the circumstances surrounding the presentation of the motion, including: The timeliness of the motion; the purpose of the motion; the status of the proponent; the motion's contents in relation to the specific facts that have been presented for resolution; and, most important, the rights of all parties and the effect upon them of granting the motion. <span class="Italic">Butler v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Title 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.34(c)(2) also provides that any person alleged to have committed a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) may request permission to intervene. There is no indication from the record before us that the SC has alleged that Knowles committed a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Knowles moved to intervene within the deadline set forth in the ALJ's order inviting him to intervene. Thus, his motion was timely filed. Knowles stated in his motion that he wished to intervene because the four charged counts, if substantiated during the Board proceeding, and the remedies requested by the SC, if granted, would directly affect, among other things, his employment status and finances. The agency supported Knowles's motion to intervene, noting that the SC requested, among other remedies, that the Board order the agency to recover 17 years of overtime payments paid to Knowles and to "determine Knowles'[s]future employment status." The agency therefore stated that Knowles will be affected by such remedies, should they be granted. We agree with Knowles's and the agency's characterization of the SC's complaint for corrective action. We thus find that the purpose of Knowles's motion to intervene, his status, and the motion's contents in relation to the specific facts that have been presented for resolution support his intervention in this corrective action proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn finally to the most important factor, that is, the rights of all the parties to the case and the effect upon those parties of our granting the motion to intervene. <span class="Italic">See Butler</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 655, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 13. The agency, Knowles, and the SC are all affected by the outcome of this proceeding and would be affected by our granting of the motion. Should we grant the motion to intervene, all of the parties could litigate whether the agency committed the alleged prohibited personnel practices with regard to Knowles's promotions, duties, the classification of his positions, and receipt of overtime pay and they would be barred from relitigating these issues. If we deny the motion and Knowles appeals these actions or the SC's requested remedies, should they be granted, the administrative adjudicator may determine that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar him from relitigating these issues. <span class="Italic">See Butler</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 655, &#x00B6; 13. This could produce inconsistent obligations for the agency and Knowles. The SC's assertion that Knowles's intervention will delay and complicate the proceedings and hinder settlement negotiations, does not persuade us that the SC's and the agency's rights will be adversely affected by Knowles's intervention. We thus find that consideration of the rights of all the parties and the effect upon them of Knowles's intervention weighs in favor of granting his motion to intervene. <span class="Italic">Cf. Stevens v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 170, 173 (1988) (supervisor was not entitled to intervene in appeal where there was no evidence beyond mere speculation that proceeding would have any effect on his future);<span class="Italic"> Filiberti</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. at 373-74 (employing agency was permitted to intervene in disciplinary action brought by the SC after issuance of an initial decision recommending lengthy suspensions of employees because such suspensions would clearly impact significantly on the agency's operations).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A labor union interested in intervening in Board proceedings because of the potential impact of a Board decision on an arbitration award is responsible for inquiring about and determining the case status.

The union seeks to establish that it will be directly affected by this proceeding for reasons independent of and unrelated to the issues raised by the appellant in the petition for appeal. It contends: (1) that it was affected by the proceeding because the agency claimed a right to question Godfrey [union vice president] as a witness during the hearing concerning events which occurred during the representation of an employee who was subsequently disciplined; and <span id="Page_1180"></span>(2) that examination of union officials concerning their representation of an employee amounts to an unfair labor practice...and would violate the union's duty of fair representation...since it makes it impossible to maintain a confidential relationship between the union member and the union representative if such testimony is required in a subsequent proceeding before the...Board. We find, however, that these contentions relate to issues arising out of the union's collective bargaining relationship with the agency rather than to issues which affect the appellant. In the present case the union has not alleged that the appellant has been affected by the calling of Godfrey as a witness. In fact, Godfrey testified at the request of appellant, and the presiding official specifically approved Godfrey's appearance at appellant's request and not at the request of the agency. Furthermore, the record does not establish that Godfrey was acting as appellant's representative when she attended the meeting between appellant and the agency manager....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the union is denied leave to intervene, the AJ's action will be reviewed for abuse of discretion and, as a practical matter, the AJ's action will not be cause to set aside an initial decision if the intervenor's interest is in presenting legal argument that, if made, would not affect the outcome of the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hatten v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 10, 1980, Consolidation Coal Company (Consol) filed a Motion for Permissive Intervention and Request for Interim Relief (Motion) in this case, asking for permission to intervene pursuant to 5 CFR sec. 1201.34 (1980) and requesting that the Board order the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) to reassign Mr. Coffield to mines other than those belonging to Consol pending the issuance of a final order in this proceeding. The Acting Special Counsel filed a response to Consol's Motion on September 12, 1980, and Consol submitted an amendment to its Motion on September 16, 1980.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has reviewed the various submissions relating to the Motion against the statutory purpose of this agency as stated in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978), and its legislative history, <span class="Italic">viz.:</span> to "[safeguard]the effective operation of the merit principles in practice." It does not appear that the interest asserted by Consol is related to this purpose, nor does it appear that the company's intervention would assist the Board in determining whether a prohibited personnel practice has been committed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The standard for deciding whether to grant motions for permissive intervention in Board cases is set forth in 5 CFR sec. 1201.34(c) (1980), which provides that such motions should be granted "where the requestor will be affected directly by the outcome of the proceeding...." Any effect which the Board's decision in this case will have on Consol will be indirect, however, since it is MSHA, not the Board, which assigns inspectors to specific mines.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consol's further request that the Board order MSHA to reassign Mr. Coffield to inspection of other mines pending final disposition of this proceeding is based on alleged prejudice to Consol arising from the testimony provided by Consol in support of Mr. Coffield's dismissal in the parallel proceeding in which Mr. Coffield is appealing that dismissal. However, this request rests upon the erroneous assumption that the Board has directed MSHA to assign Mr. Coffield currently to inspection of Consol's mines. The Board's stay orders have required only that "the terms and conditions of [Mr. Coffield's] ...employment are not significantly different from those of similarly situated employees during the effective period of the stay." <span class="Italic">See</span> Order of August 11, 1980, 3 MSPB 46, 2 MSPR 525; Order of April 3, 1980. Moreover, since Consol's concerns in this regard appear to arise out of the administration of the Mine Safety and Health Act, 30 USC secs. 801 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> (Supp. I 1977), those concerns would be more properly directed to MSHA, whose authority to carry out its responsibilities under the Act is in no way circumscribed by the Board's rulings on the agency's personnel matters.</p>
