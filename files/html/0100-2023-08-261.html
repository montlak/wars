<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-256"><span class="space">h.</span> Failure to Obtain Arbitration Hearing</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A common problem encountered by appellants who begin the grievance procedure is that the grievance is not pursued through arbitration. The employee may file a grievance, but only the union can make the decision to take the case to arbitration (involving the expense associated with the arbitration). 5 USC 7121 provides, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)(1)&#x2003;Any negotiated grievance procedure referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(iii)&#x2003;provide that any grievance not satisfactorily settled under the negotiated grievance procedure shall be subject to binding arbitration which may be invoked by either the exclusive representative or the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee (other than the unusual situation of the Postal Service preference eligible employee) initiates a grievance but the grievance does not make it to arbitration, the employee does not receive the hearing provided by the grievance procedure, and she does not obtain a hearing before the Board, for the Board's position is that once an appellant seeks arbitration by filing a written grievance, whether or not he gets to the point of a hearing and decision on the merits is immaterial: the Board is ousted from jurisdiction through the election. It is immaterial that an arbitrator does not decide the case on the merits, despite the resulting deprivation of a hearing. The Board is not a guarantor of merits-review in the arbitration process. <span class="Italic">Higgs v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 154, 157 (1982); <span class="Italic">see Garland v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 13 MSPR 629, 631 (1982) ("[A] final decision as contemplated by 5 USC 7221(d) was never rendered in this case."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Browning v. Dept. of Navy,</span> AT-1221-11-0928-W-1 (NP 6/19/2012) ("To the extent the appellant may be asking the Board to address the workings and alleged unfairness of the negotiated grievance procedure, the Board lacks the authority to conduct such an inquiry. <span class="Italic">See Greenspan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 247, &#x00B6; 21 (2003), <span class="Italic">reversed on other grounds</span>, 464 F.3d 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2006).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Martinez v. DOJ</span>, 85 MSPR 290, 294-96 &#x00B6; 10-12 (2000), declined to depart from the rule favoring a binding election of remedies:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_419"></span>...It is well settled that, with the exception of cases involving the U.S. Postal Service, an appellant must elect a negotiated grievance procedure or a Board appeal in contesting a removal and, upon initiating either procedure, he has made an irrevocable election. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Navy,</span> 898 F.2d 133, 134 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Justice,</span> 53 MSPR 117, 120, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 983 F.2d 1088 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). Notwithstanding the union's decision not to arbitrate the appellant's grievance of his removal, we find no reason to depart from this rule where, as here, the appellant undisputedly elected to first challenge his removal through the negotiated grievance procedure. The subsequent failure to reach arbitration is no basis on which to assert jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Higgs v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 12 MSPB 315, 14 MSPR 154, 156-57 (1982), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds, Hall v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 26 MSPR 233 (1985) (election of arbitration remedy is binding notwithstanding subsequent dissatisfaction with the choice; the Board is not a guarantor of merits of review in grievance/arbitration process).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In light of this undisputed fact, we do not further address the appellant's apparent claim on review that a reopening of his appeal is also warranted because the initial decision was based on misinformation that his grievance of the removal action was scheduled for arbitration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the appellant's other asserted grounds for reopening his appeal are unsubstantiated. Specifically, to the extent that he so asserts, we find no evidence in the record that the appellant lacked notice of the consequences of an election between the grievance process and a Board appeal. The agency's removal decision notice did not specifically inform the appellant that he could appeal the removal either to the Board or through the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. Nonetheless, we find that because the agency's motions below to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and its supporting documents sufficiently put the appellant on notice of the jurisdictional issue posed by his prior election of the negotiated grievance procedure, and neither he nor his attorney responded below that the appellant lacked notice of the consequences of his election and that he wanted to proceed instead with his Board appeal, that claim is not properly before us now<span class="Italic">. Banks v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 MSPB 342, 4 MSPR 268, 271 (1980) (the Board will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence); <span class="Italic">cf. McVicker v. Social Security</span> Administration, 77 MSPR 324, 329 (1997) (Board reopened withdrawn appeal <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, where the appellant was apprised for the first time only in the initial decision that jurisdiction was lacking over his appeal due to his election of the grievance process prior to filing his appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant retains only the limited right to seek review of a final grievance proceeding. <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 53 MSPR at 120. Hence, in the absence of a final arbitration decision, the Board lacks jurisdiction that it otherwise would have over a removal appeal asserting claims of prohibited discrimination, as defined in 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) and 7702, that were not raised during arbitration. <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 53 MSPR at 119-20. Accordingly, there is no merit in the appellant's claim that a reopening of the appeal is warranted because Board jurisdiction exists based on his discrimination claims.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The problem with the exclusive contractual grievance procedure lies in control over the process. An employee may file a grievance with or without assistance or consent of his union. Once a written grievance is filed, the contract process is elected as a binding remedy. The grievance process encompasses the arbitration process at the conclusion of a multi-step contract grievance procedure, but only the union can invoke arbitration on behalf of an employee under a collective bargaining contract. As a result, the employee may initiate the grievance process, but he is without power to obtain an arbitration hearing without the union's consent that the case proceed to arbitration. Arbitrators charge for their time, and their fees can be considerable--usually split between the union and the agency. The union may not be able to afford the process, or the grievance--having been filed--may be deemed to be lacking in merit by union officials (or union members) making the decision of whether to carry the grievance to arbitration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Labor Relations Authority recognizes that preclusion of an agency shop (mandatory union dues for all bargaining unit members) in the federal sector reduces the availability of arbitration to unions. <span class="Italic">See IRS and NTEU</span>, 47 FLRA 1091, 1108 (1993) ("With an agency shop prohibited in the Federal sector, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service,</span> 38 FLRA 615, 625 (1990), the reality of the Federal sector is that the potential for an undue financial burden in imposing arbitration of unfair labor practice charges on unions is considerably greater than in the private sector."). But the Board is clear that election of the grievance process excludes a direct Board appeal in other than cases involving Postal Service employees and that the failure of the union to carry the case to arbitration does not alter the exclusive and preclusive grievance election, <span class="Italic">Jung v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, DC-0752-14-0207-I-1 (NP 7/25/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from the GS-14 position of Patent Examiner for unacceptable performance. The removal decision informed the appellant that he could elect to pursue the matter by one "and only one (unless you choose to seek corrective action with [the Office of Special Counsel (OSC)] ; in that event you can also file a discrimination complaint)," of the following routes: filing a Board appeal; filing a grievance under the applicable collective bargaining agreement (CBA); filing a complaint with the equal employment opportunity office, or seeking corrective action with OSC. The appellant was a bargaining unit member of the Patent Office Professional Association (POPA), and he opted to file a grievance under the applicable CBA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently, the appellant filed a Board appeal. The administrative judge found that the agency had informed the appellant in the removal decision that he had the right to file a Board appeal or to grieve the removal action pursuant to the terms of the CBA, and had informed the appellant that whichever he filed first shall be an election to the exclusion of the other. The administrative judge found that the appellant had made an irrevocable election to proceed by filing a grievance, and he dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant generally disagrees with the initial decision. His disagreement is unavailing. It is well settled that, with the exception of cases involving the U.S. Postal Service, an appellant must elect a negotiated grievance procedure or a Board appeal in contesting a removal and, upon initiating either procedure, has made an irrevocable election. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Navy</span>, 898 F.2d 133, 134 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Justice</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 117, 120, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 983 F.2d 1088 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). Notwithstanding the appellant's assertion that the union has decided not to arbitrate the appellant's grievance of his removal, we find no reason to depart from this rule where, as here, the appellant undisputedly elected to first challenge his removal through the negotiated grievance procedure. Even a subsequent failure to reach arbitration is no basis on which to assert jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Higgs v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 154, 156-57 (1982), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds Hall v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 233 (1985) (election of arbitration remedy is binding notwithstanding subsequent dissatisfaction with the choice; the Board is not a guarantor of merits of review in grievance/arbitration process).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the appellant's assertion in his petition that his election to grieve his removal does not preclude Board jurisdiction because the POPA did not adequately represent his interest in the grievance proceeding. As the administrative judge found, the appellant's dissatisfaction with the grievance/arbitration process and his disapproval of his chosen representative's performance provides no basis to nullify or disregard his election to grieve his removal. <span class="Italic">See Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1981) (the appellant is responsible for the errors of his chosen representative).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although it may be suggested that at the time a grievance is filed the appellant obtain a guarantee from the union to take the case to arbitration, life is not so simple. Problems can develop along the route from grievance to arbitration award that may not be of the grievant's making or within his ability to correct. Unions may, by mistake, by judgment on the merits, or by financial necessity, fail or decline to arbitrate grievances. Individuals who do not obtain hearings on their cases may feel that the union is at fault, a conclusion that may result in unfair labor practice ("duty of fair representation") charges or other litigation against the union. The Board lacks jurisdiction over a duty of fair representation claim, <span class="Italic">Harris v. USPS</span>, 112 MSPR 186, 189 &#x00B6; 11, 2009 MSPB 168 (2009), although the claim might be asserted with the Federal Labor Relations Authority in an unfair labor practice charge (but not in a lawsuit, <span class="Italic">see Karahalios v. NFFE Local 1263</span>, 489 U.S. 527, 109 S. Ct. 1282 (1989)); <span class="Italic">cf. Hamilton v. Dept. of Labor</span>, PH-0752-21-0335-I-1 (NP 4/29/2022) (appeal dismissed based on election of remedies: "the appellant asserts that his union and the agency violated his right to arbitration by failing to request an arbitration panel from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service"). )). The duty of fair representation provides considerable latitude to union decisions, or inactions, that do not rise to the level of what can objectively be described as discriminatory, arbitrary, capricious, or reckless; as a result, there are few FLRA cases awarding remedies against federal sector unions for breach of the duty of fair representation. A note for appellants' counsel: before an employee files a grievance on a matter that might otherwise be directly appealed to the Board, clearly stated, written arrangements should be made with the union authorizing the employee to pursue the case to arbitration, with a firm understanding as to how the arbitration (and representation) will be financed, who will be the representative at the arbitration hearing, and how and when that individual will be designated as the union's representative. [For discussion of the duty of fair representation, refer to Chapter 8 of Broida's <span class="Italic">A Guide to Federal Labor Relations Authority Law and Practice</span> (<a href="http://deweypub.com/flraguide">Dewey Publications, Inc</a>. 2023).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without addressing remedial preclusion, the Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's position that ineffective invocation of the grievance process did not <span id="Page_420"></span>toll the Board's appellate time limit, <span class="Italic">Tillman v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal to this court, Mr. Tillman seeks to justify his belated filing on two grounds: (1) he never filed a formal grievance with the Department of Veterans Affairs; and (2) a breakdown in communications with his representative. Neither constitutes good cause for his late filing. First, whether or not Mr. Tillman filed a formal grievance with the Department of Veterans Affairs is immaterial when considering whether he timely filed an appeal. The Notice of Removal sent by the Department of Veterans Affairs clearly states that Mr. Tillman had thirty calendar days from the effective date of his removal to file a grievance or appeal to the Board. The fact that filing a grievance Is an option does not affect the requirement that any appeal to the Board be filed timely, whether a grievance is filed or not. Accordingly, Mr. Tillman had thirty calendar days from August 16, 1997 to file an appeal and he failed to meet this deadline by filing the appeal on November 25, 1997.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record is clear, however, that Mr. Tillman filed a grievance with the Department of Veterans Affairs. As correctly held by the Board, pursuit of a grievance does not constitute good cause for untimely filing of an appeal. <span class="Italic">See Bacashihua v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 811 F.2d 1498, 1502 (Fed. Cir. 1987). A petitioner is not entitled to first pursue a grievance, and then if dissatisfied with that procedure, pursue an appeal with the Board despite having missed the deadline for filing the appeal. To the contrary, Mr. Tillman was entitled [to] grieve his removal or appeal to the Board within thirty calendar days of the effective date of his removal, as stated in the Notice of Removal sent by the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Mr. Tillman's defense that there was a "breakdown in communications" with his representative does not establish good cause because this in no way interfered with his timely filing of an appeal. It is well settled that a person is bound by the consequences of his representative's conduct, which include both the representative's acts and omissions. <span class="Italic">Rowe v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 802 F.2d 434, 437 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Although there was a breakdown in communications and Mr. Tillman may have acted in good faith in relying on the action or inaction of his representative. Mr. Tillman had a personal duty to file an appeal in a timely manner. Therefore, Mr. Tillman cannot escape the consequences of his untimely appeal because he was notified of the deadline to file and failed to meet this deadline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Atanus v. MSPB</span>, 434 F.3d 1324, 1325-28 (Fed. Cir. 2006), provides another example of a grievance filed, and a Board appeal precluded, because the appellant incorrectly initially assumed the grievance would be fully processed by the union:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 1, 2003, Atanus received a notice of removal from her position of Procurement Analyst due to disorderly conduct charges and failure to follow authorized instructions. The removal letter stated that Atanus could challenge her removal either by filing a grievance or by appealing to the Board, but not both. As far as pursuing a grievance was concerned, the letter stated: "Under the terms of the GSA/NFFE National Agreement, you may be represented and assisted by the union in exercising any of your grievance rights." On July 22, 2003, Atanus sent a letter to the deciding official, Richard Smith, stating that she wished to grieve her removal and asked to be assisted and represented by the union in the grievance procedure. Two days later, she sent a second letter confirming her election of the grievance procedure, expressing her desire to proceed to arbitration, and designating a representative. On July 26, 2003, Atanus sent a third letter withdrawing her grievance. That same day she filed an appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The General Services Administration ("GSA") filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that Atanus waived her right to appeal to the Board when she elected to grieve her removal in her first letter. Atanus responded that her election of the grievance procedure was not an informed election because she was misled by her union representative. Atanus claimed that before she elected to grieve her removal, a representative told her that the union would assist her, and that she made her decision to grieve based on the assumption that she would be represented by the union throughout the entire grievance process. After she made the election, however, Atanus alleged, the representative told her that the union was no longer willing to represent her. Based on this information and believing that she would not be represented, Atanus withdrew her grievance and appealed to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the Board properly decided that it did not have jurisdiction over Atanus's appeal because she made an informed decision to grieve her removal, thereby waiving her right to appeal to the Board. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1), an aggrieved employee may raise his or her grievance by timely filing a written grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure or by filing a notice of appeal under the applicable appellate procedures, "but not both":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which also fall within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures of section 7701 of this title or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1). "[O]nce a timely filing is made to pursue a path, the other is forever waived." <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 804 F.2d 673, 675 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In order to comply with the statute, the agency must properly inform an employee of her choices. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. U.S. Dep't of Labor</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 447, 450 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency expressly informed Atanus in its removal letter that she had the option to pursue a grievance procedure or appeal to the Board, but not both. Although Atanus alleges that her election was not properly informed, that is not correct. While a few Board decisions have held that an election of a grievance was not binding, in such cases the Board found that the employee's decision was not fully informed because the agency had only notified the employee of one available avenue of recourse when others were available. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. U.S. Dep't of Labor</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. at 450; <span class="Italic">Miyai v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 15 (1985); <span class="Italic">Blanshan v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 84 (1984). That is not the case here. The agency clearly notified Atanus in her letter of both options and that she could only pursue one option.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Atanus also contends that her election was uninformed because the letter did not completely notify her of the scope of her union representation and the union representative misled her. However, these are allegations of union misconduct, and are not the fault of the agency. Moreover, there is nothing in the record from which to ascertain what the union representative may or may not have told Atanus. Thus, we can only evaluate Atanus's undisputed actions, which are that she opted for the grievance procedure having been previously told by the agency that grieving would preclude an appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Atanus clearly elected to pursue the grievance procedure. Although she later changed her mind, irrespective of the reason, as long as the agency clearly expressed to Atanus that she had two options, and that one would exclude the other, and Atanus exercised one option, Atanus is precluded from withdrawing her option to pursue the other. It was incumbent upon Atanus to inquire into the extent of the union's assistance before making a binding election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent emphasizes the short time period between Atanus's election of a grievance and its withdrawal, suggesting lack of prejudice to the agency. Were we empowered to sit as a court of equity, taking into account the difficulties of employee decision-making, and deciding where the merits lie, we might agree. But we are not; it is our task to determine whether the Board erred in applying a statute, not to amend the statute to take account of lack of prejudice, length of time between election and withdrawal of election, etc. That is a slippery slope not for courts of appeals interpreting statutes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unfortunately, Atanus lost her Board appeal right by electing to pursue a grievance, and then lost her grievance right by withdrawing her grievance. As we are bound by the statute, which holds that an employee may either file a grievance or appeal to the Board, but not both, and Atanus elected a grievance, she has no right of appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A secondary problem is that some employees, having filed a grievance and obtained a final grievance decision short of arbitration, will attempt to have the Board review their prohibited personnel practice allegations. It is the rule, however, that with a negotiated procedure, the appellant is required to exhaust administrative remedies in the labor contract, including arbitration, before taking any permissible appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Garvin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 5 MSPR 372, 373 (1981) (under 5 USC 7121(d) and 7702, an employee may appeal the <span class="Italic">final</span> decision under a negotiated grievance procedure); <span class="Italic">cf. Mawson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 48 MSPR 318, 322 (1991) (final decision in arbitration is a prerequisite to Board review; the decision implied that the pendency of FLRA exceptions to a grievance award precludes the finality necessary for Board review). The exhaustion requirement is not met if arbitration--the final step of the grievance procedure--is not invoked. <span class="Italic">Gillman v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 7 MSPR 299, 301, 7 MSPB 192 (1981) ("Thus, a final decision within the meaning of section 7121(d) was not rendered."). [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-248.html#sec5-247">Review of Arbitration Awards</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Decisions reprise the theme. The grievance procedure must be exhausted through the point of arbitration. <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 12 MSPR 251, 253 (1982); <span class="Italic">see Farmer v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 93-3533) (grievance not pursued through arbitration did not achieve the status of a "final decision," as defined by the contract, and could not be pursued to the MSPB); <span class="Italic">Martinez v. DOJ</span>, 85 MSPR 290, 295 &#x00B6; 10 (2000), <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Carreno v. Dept. of Army</span>, 22 MSPR 515, 518 n.2 (1984) ("right to seek Board review attaches only to a 'final decision,' which the Board has defined to require the exhaustion of administrative remedies under the negotiated grievance procedure"). If the employee files a grievance but does not obtain arbitration, and instead goes to court, he does not exhaust his contract administrative remedies and the Board will not accept jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Clark v. EEOC</span>, 31 MSPR 455, 457 (1986). <span class="Italic">Parks v. Smithsonian Inst.</span>, 39 MSPR 346, 349-50 (1988), summarized the law:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_421"></span>The Board may review a grievance decision when three conditions are met: (1) the subject matter of the grievance is one over which the Board has jurisdiction; (2) the grievant alleges discrimination as stated in 5 USC 2302(b)(1) in connection with the underlying action; and (3) a final decision has been issued.... Because the appellant was removed from his position and alleged discrimination, the first two conditions have been established. We find, however, that the appellant has failed to establish that a final grievance decision was issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The final decision rendered pursuant to a negotiated grievance procedure, which is then appealable to the Board under 5 USC 7121(d), is the arbitrator's decision in cases where the grievance procedure provides for arbitration as the last resort.... The record does not reflect, nor does the appellant allege, that he pursued his grievance through arbitration. Thus, a final decision within the meaning of section 7121(d) was not rendered.... The appellant's request, therefore, is not ripe for adjudication by the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Khenaisser v. Dept. of Interior</span>, SF-0752-16-0665-I-1 (NP 1/23/2023) ("When the negotiated grievance procedure provides for arbitration as the last resort, the "final decision" appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) is the arbitrator's decision. <span class="Italic">Parks v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 346, 349 (1988)...."Although the appellant argues that the union illegally denied him arbitration, the union's decision not to pursue arbitration on his behalf does not render the agency's decision on the step-three grievance 'final' as to qualify for Board review under section 7121(d).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 7121(g)(3), if a grievance is filed on a personnel action, e.g., a removal, that election appears to preclude an Individual Right of Action to challenge the same action based on whistleblowing reprisal actions. [Refer to Chapter 13, "Grievance or MSPB Appeal."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">LaCombe v. Dept. of Navy</span>, PH-0752-12-0136-I-1 (NP 11/29/2012), reaffirmed the binding nature of a grievance election and the need for a final arbitration decision to establish a basis for subsequent Board review (under 5 CFR 1201.155):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that, with the exception of cases involving the U.S. Postal Service, an appellant must elect a negotiated grievance procedure or a Board appeal in contesting a removal, and, upon initiating either procedure, she has made an irrevocable election. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Atanus v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 434 F.3d 1324, 1325-28 (Fed. Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Navy</span>, 898 F.2d 133, 134 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Department of Justice</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 290, &#x00B6; 10 (2000). Where, as here, the appellant undisputedly elected to first challenge her removal through the negotiated grievance procedure, this rule precludes her Board appeal notwithstanding the union's decision not to arbitrate her grievance. The subsequent failure to reach arbitration is no basis on which to assert jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Martinez</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 290, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Hall v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 233 (1985) (election of arbitration remedy is binding notwithstanding subsequent dissatisfaction with the choice; the Board is not a guarantor of merits of review in the grievance/arbitration process).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's contention is incorrect that, because the union elected to forego arbitration, the determination at Step 3 of the negotiated grievance procedure constitutes a reviewable final decision. Because the collective bargaining agreement provides for arbitration, and the union did not refer the matter to arbitration, there is no reviewable "final decision" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). <span class="Italic">See Gustave-Schmidt v. Department of Labor</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 667, &#x00B6; 4 (2001) (noting that an arbitration decision is a final grievance decision); <span class="Italic">Parks v. Smithsonian Institute</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 346, 349-50 (1998) (a final decision, which is appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), "is the arbitrator's decision in cases where the grievance procedure provides for arbitration as the last resort").</p>

<p class="Body-Text">We offer some comments for employee or union representatives. Arbitration is generally preferred to Board appeals for adverse actions. The Board defers to management's reasonable choice of a penalty; the arbitrator often (not always) shows an interest in mitigating a penalty when it is reasonable to do so. Before filing a grievance--as attractive as grievance-arbitration may seem--obtain the union's advance commitment, in writing if possible, that the case will be taken to arbitration. If the union will not make that commitment, through whatever process the union decides on what cases will go to arbitration, use a Board appeal and avoid a preclusive election of remedies through a grievance that may not be carried to arbitration.</p>
