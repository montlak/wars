<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-110"><span class="space">f.</span> Annuity Election Form; Signature; Submission</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An election need not take a particular form, but its intent must be clear. Designation of a spouse by remarriage as an insurance beneficiary, along with submission to OPM of a marriage certificate, did not equate to election of a survivor annuity, <span class="Italic">Rakowsky v. OPM</span>, 705 Fed. Appx. 986, 988-89 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The election of a survivor annuity in cases where a retired employee remarries after retirement is governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(C)(i), which states, in relevant part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Upon remarriage, a retired employee or Member who was married at the time of retirement...may irrevocably elect during such marriage, in a signed writing received by [OPM] within 2 years after such remarriage..., a reduction in the employee or Member's annuity under paragraph (4) of this subsection for the purpose of providing an annuity for such employee or Member's spouse in the event such spouse survives the employee or Member.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory provision does not require an election of a survivor annuity in any particular form, but it must show an "unmistakable intent" to make such an election. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 985 F.2d 549, 550 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Any signed writing that manifests the annuitant's intent to make an election will suffice. <span class="Italic">Dorsey v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 587 F.3d 1111, 1114 (Fed. Cir. 2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Rakowsky argues that the evidence clearly shows that her husband intended to provide a survivor annuity for her, even though he did not file an election. According to her, Mr. Rakowsky's submission of Standard Forms 2808 and 2823 in 1998 and the marriage certificate in 2010, combined with his desire to take care of his family, demonstrates that he intended for Ms. Rakowsky to receive a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that Mr. Rakowsky did not elect a survivor annuity in a <span id="Page_4239"></span>signed writing, as required by statute. The forms Mr. Rakowsky submitted relate to other benefits and do not elect a survivor annuity benefit. <span class="Italic">See Dorsey</span>, 587 F.3d at 1114 (holding that submission of the Standard Forms 2808 and 2823 did not demonstrate an intent to elect survivor annuity benefits). Accordingly, the forms themselves do not demonstrate an intent to elect survivor annuity benefits. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Rakowsky also argues that her husband--by sending in his marriage certificate, allegedly in 1997 and again in 2010, and notifying OPM of his change in marital status--sufficiently manifested his intent to elect a survivor annuity. Her evidence in support of this argument was not all before the administrative judge. Nor did the Board consider this evidence "because [it did] not constitute new evidence." Even if the Board had considered it, however, substantial evidence would still support the Board's determination that Mr. Rakowsky did not elect to provide a survivor annuity for Ms. Rakowsky. This court has encountered this situation before and has held that a retired employee sending OPM a copy of his marriage certificate and placing his wife on his insurance before the time limit expired did not show an "unmistakable intent" to make a survivor annuity election. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 15 Fed. Appx. 864, 866 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Even where, in addition to filing a Designation of Beneficiary form with OPM, the retired employee also sent a letter stating, "I have remarried and would like to change my beneficiary for death benefits on my life insurance to [my new wife] ," this court held that such actions did not evince a clear intent to elect survivor annuity benefits. <span class="Italic">Czvik v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 20 Fed. Appx. 890, 891 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Because the conclusion that Mr. Rakowsky failed to make a legally sufficient election of such a benefit for Ms. Rakowsky is supported by substantial evidence, we must affirm. <span class="Italic">See Dorsey</span>, 587 F.3d at 1115.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, a survivor annuity election was insufficiently clear in <span class="Italic">Kirk v. OPM</span>, 93 MSPR 547, 549-50 (2003):</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vincent v. OPM</span>, 78 MSPR 307, 309-12 (1998), considered whether another individual, e.g., the spouse, can sign and submit a survivor annuity election to OPM at the direction of the employee. The Board determined, first, that there was no requirement for a particular type of form to serve as an election and, second, that a directed signature was effective if there is proof that the election was signed in the presence of the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following facts in this case are not disputed. The appellant married Shedrick C. Vincent in January 1946. They were divorced in 1974, while Mr. Vincent was a Federal employee covered under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Mr. Vincent retired in 1979 and, being unmarried, elected an annuity without survivor benefits. The Vincents resumed living together in 1980, and they were remarried on March 26, 1996. Mr. Vincent died of lung cancer on March 31, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 27, 1996, before Mr. Vincent died, a request was submitted to OPM asking for a reduction in his current annuity, with survivor benefits for the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> It is uncontested that the request was written and signed by the appellant, and that she signed it "Shedrick D. Vincent."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> After submitting the request, and prior to her husband's death, the appellant contacted OPM to determine whether there were any problems with the request, but was not told that it was defective. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> OPM denied the appellant's subsequent application for survivor benefits because the election of a reduced annuity with survivor benefits was not signed by Mr. Vincent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed from OPM's reconsideration decision alleging that: (1) When the election was executed, Mr. Vincent was too ill to sign his own signature; and (2) due to Mr. Vincent's lack of education, she normally took care of his financial affairs. The administrative judge sustained OPM's reconsideration decision. The appellant has now petitioned for review, restating her allegations raised below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An applicant for a survivor annuity has the burden of proving that he or she is entitled to the benefits sought. <span class="Italic">See Cheeseman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 791 F.2d 138, 140-41 (Fed. Cir. 1986). An appellant's entitlement to a survivor annuity must be determined by reference to the requirements of the statute governing the benefit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shaughnessy v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 633, 637 (1990), citing <span class="Italic">Zucker v. United States</span>, 758 F.2d 637, 640 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The applicable statute in this case, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(A), provides that an employee who is unmarried at the time of retirement, and who later marries, may irrevocably elect, in a "signed writing" received in OPM within 2 years after his post-retirement marriage, a reduction in his current annuity to provide a survivor benefit for his spouse. The statute does not, however, set forth any specific form which the writing must take. Therefore, an annuitant who marries after retirement may make an election of survivor benefits for his current spouse through a letter, memorandum, or other signed writing provided that such a writing manifests an unmistakable intent to elect such benefits.<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 985 F.2d 549, 550 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Camerino v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. 67, 70 (1997); <span class="Italic">Lemp v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. 549, 551-52 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, although the statute requires that the writing in which the election is made be signed, it does not prescribe the form that the signature must take. More specifically, there is nothing in the plain language of section 8339(k)(2)(A), or in the relevant OPM regulations, set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.631(b)(1), which may be read as requiring that the signature on the election of survivor benefits be holographic.[1] <span class="Italic"> Compare Gilmore v. Lujan,</span> 947 F.2d 1409, 1412 (9th Cir. 1991) (application for oil and gas leases, which was faxed to the Bureau of Land Management, was rejected because it contained only a fax signature, and the agency's regulations specifically require a holographic signature).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;A "holographic" signature is one which the author has written by himself. <span class="Italic">See In re Estate of Buckley</span>, 536 F.2d 580, 582 (3d Cir. 1976).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, absent such a specific statutory or regulatory requirement, Mr. Vincent was not required to personally sign the election of survivor benefits for it to be valid, but that the appellant, acting at his direction and request, and in his presence, could sign the election on his behalf. <span class="Italic">See</span> 80 C.J.S. Signatures &#x00A7; 6. A signature so made becomes the signature of the person for whom it is made, and has the same validity as though written by him. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Where a signature is made in this manner, the person writing the name is a mere instrumentality, by which the person whose signature is written exercises his own discretion and acts for himself, rather than through an agent. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Although the Board has not previously addressed this issue, the general principles of law set forth above have been adopted by the State of Kentucky, the appellant's state of residence. <span class="Italic">See Prichard v. Kitchen,</span> 242 S.W.2d 988, 990 (Ky. 1951); <span class="Italic">Widick v. Pursifull,</span> 299 Ky. 773, 775, 187 S.W.2d 447, 448 (1945). Accordingly, we further find that, if the appellant signed the March 27, 1996, election of survivor benefits at Mr. Vincent's direction and request, and in his presence, it constituted a "signed writing" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(A), and thus, was a valid election of survivor benefits in which Mr. Vincent manifested an intent to provide such benefits for the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Harris,</span> 985 F.2d at 550; <span class="Italic">Camerino</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. at 70; <span class="Italic">Lemp</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. at 552.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant testified, without contradiction, that she drafted the March 27, 1996, letter at Mr. Vincent's specific request. Her testimony was corroborated by that of a neighbor, Viola Newton, who stated that she was present when Mr. Vincent told the appellant to write to OPM regarding survivor benefits, because he was going to die soon. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We therefore find that the March 27, 1996, letter was written by the appellant at Mr. Vincent's direction and request. The record, however, does not disclose whether the letter met the requirement that it be signed "in his presence." Because, as noted above, we have not previously addressed <span id="Page_4240"></span>this issue, the appellant could not have been on notice of the showing that she was required to make. Therefore, we remand this appeal to the regional office for further development of the record on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge will determine whether the March 27, 1996, election of survivor benefits was signed in the presence of Mr. Vincent. In making such a finding, the administrative judge will consider whether, under all the circumstances, the appellant signed the election in such proximity to Mr. Vincent that it was signed within his hearing, knowledge and understanding, even if it was not signed within his actual sight, or in the same room. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., In re Estate of Hoffman,</span> 137 Cal.App.2d 555, 559-60, 290 P.2d 669, 672-73 (1955); <span class="Italic">In re Estate of Demaris,</span> 166 Or. 36, 64, 110 P.2d 571, 585 (1941). If the administrative judge determines that the appellant signed the election in Mr. Vincent's presence, she will order OPM to grant the appellant's application for survivor benefits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The validity of a signature to a form reducing the spouse's annuity was considered and the matter remanded for further consideration in <span class="Italic">Ford v. OPM</span>, DC-0831-16-0647-I-1 (NP 10/11/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the CSRS, the surviving spouse of a retired Federal employee is entitled to an annuity equal to 55% of the retiree's annuity unless the survivor consented in writing to receive no such annuity or a reduced annuity at the time of the employee's retirement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8339(j)(1), 8341(b)(1); <span class="Italic">Hathaway v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 678, &#x00B6; 7 (2012); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.614. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(1), the election must be made in accordance with the requirements that OPM prescribes by regulation and that the election is irrevocable. OPM's regulations provide, in pertinent part, that "[a] married employee may not elect...a partially reduced annuity...without the consent of the current spouse," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.614(a), which must be filed on a form prescribed by OPM, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.614(b). The form prescribed by OPM "require[s] that a notary public or other official authorized to administer oaths certify that the current spouse presented identification, gave consent, signed or marked the form, and acknowledged that the consent was given freely in the notary's or official's presence." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.614(c). The burden of proving entitlement to a survivor annuity is on the applicant for benefits. <span class="Italic">Cheeseman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 791 F.2d 138, 140-41 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is only one dispute of material fact in this appeal, namely whether the signature appearing on the SF-2801-2 Spouse's Consent to Survivor Election is genuine. The administrative judge found, and we agree, that the signature appearing on the SF-2801-2 does not appear to be identical to the appellant's signature as it appears on various other documents in the record. Nevertheless, we also agree that these signatures are not so different that a layperson could say with any confidence that they were made by different people. Furthermore, we observe that the signature on the SF-2801-2 was notarized by one Sham Robertson and that the notarization of a signature creates a strong but rebuttable presumption of validity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is not bound, but may be guided by the Federal Rules of Evidence. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 10 (2010), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 635 F.3d 526 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Under Federal Rule of Evidence 302, "[i]n a civil case, state law governs the effect of a presumption regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision." In this case, the SF-2801-2 reflects that the notarial act occurred in the District of Columbia and was made by a notary commissioned under the laws of the District. We therefore find that the effect of the notarization is determined under the laws of the District of Columbia. <span class="Italic">See Butler v. Encyclopedia Brittanica, Inc</span>., 41 F.3d 285, 295 &#x0026; n.6 (7th Cir. 1994) (applying state law to determine the effect of the notarization of a signature on an Employee Retirement Income Security Act spousal waiver form). Under District of Columbia law, "to overcome the presumption arising from [the notary's] certificate there must be proof of gross concurrent mistake or fraud, through strong and disinterested evidence." <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Estate of Lewis</span>, 193 A.3d 139, 144 (D.C. 2018) (quoting <span class="Italic">Marden v. Hopkins</span>, 47 App. D.C. 202, 206-07 (D.C. 1918)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we agree with the administrative judge that the existing record does not contain sufficient evidence to rebut the presumed validity created by the notarization, we find that, in the interest of justice, the appeal should be remanded for further proceedings. Specifically, we find that the appellant was not fully apprised of the presumption created by the notarization or the type of evidence that might be sufficient to overcome it. Consequently, she may not have fully appreciated the importance of retaining a handwriting expert or requesting a hearing during which she would have the opportunity to testify as to genuineness of the signature on the SF-2801-2 or subpoena the notary or any disinterested witness to testify. Because this <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant was not fully apprised of her burden on the dispositive issue and because the instant appeal concerns an application for civil service retirement benefits, <span class="Italic">see Irvine v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 643, &#x00B6; 9 n.1 (1999) (finding that the interest in reaching the correct result warranted some deviation from the strict adversarial model of adjudication in an OPM benefits case), we remand the appeal to the Washington Regional Office to give the appellant an additional opportunity to prove her claim in light of this Order.</p>
