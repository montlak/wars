<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-308"><span class="space">b.</span> Mitigation Analysis; Progressive Discipline</h5>
<p class="noindent">Arbitrators are not required to consider the dozen or so mitigation factors identified by the MSPB in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span>, 5 MSPR 280, 5 MSPB 313 (1981), as to suspensions of 14 days or less. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3887, Nat'l Council of Dept. of Educ. Locals Council 252 and Dept. of Educ., Institutional Review Branch</span>, 48 FLRA 717, 721 (1993); <span class="Italic">see AFGE Local 2145 and VA, Hunter Holmes McGuire Med. Ctr.</span>, 55 FLRA 366, 368 (1999) ("[A]rbitrators are not required to apply the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in cases involving suspensions of 14 days or less."). <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216 and EEOC</span>, 49 FLRA 906, 917 (1994), explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is deficient because the Arbitrator failed to apply the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in determining that the 14-day suspension was too harsh. Contrary to the Agency's argument, the Arbitrator was not required to apply these factors in deciding the grievance in this case. The <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors enunciated by the MSPB essentially constitute guidelines governing the appropriateness of penalties. The Authority has consistently held that arbitrators are bound by the same substantive standards as the MSPB only when resolving grievances concerning actions covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3947 and U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Medical Center, Rochester, Minnesota</span>, 47 FLRA 1364, 1370-71 (1993); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Army, III Corps and Fort Hood, Fort Hood, Texas and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1920</span>, 46 FLRA 609, 613 (1992). Suspensions of 14 days or less are not covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 or 7512. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2128 and U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Contract Management District South</span>, 47 FLRA 962, 967-68 (1993). Therefore, because the grievant in this case was given a 14-day suspension, the Arbitrator was not bound to follow the same substantive standards as the MSPB....</p>
<p class="noindent">Arbitrators are not required to follow tables of penalties when contracts provide them greater discretion in reviewing disciplinary cases, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., New York and NTEU Chap. 153</span>, 51 FLRA 743, 744-46 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator stated that the grievant admitted performing his duties in a negligent manner.&#x2003;However, according to the Arbitrator, the negligence resulted from a "mere mistake." The Arbitrator also stated that, although the grievant previously had been suspended, that suspension "was for conduct wholly unrelated to the conduct here under review." Citing Article 28, Section 5 of the parties' agreement, which identifies factors to be considered by the Agency in determining the appropriate level of discipline, and noting, among other things, that the Agency's regulatory table of penalties provided a range of discipline from an official reprimand to a 2-day suspension for a "first offense" of negligence, the Arbitrator concluded that the appropriate discipline under the circumstances of this case was an official reprimand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish that an award is based on a nonfact, the appealing party must demonstrate that the central fact underlying the award is clearly erroneous, but for which a different result would have been reached by the arbitrator....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's exception assumes that application of its table of penalties, an Agency regulation, is dispositive of the issues before the Arbitrator. However, it is well established that collective bargaining agreements, rather than agency regulations, govern the disposition of matters to which they both apply. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Fort Campbell District, Third Region, Fort Campbell, Kentucky and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2022</span>, 37 FLRA 186, 194 (1990). Both the regulation and Article 28, Section 5 of the parties' agreement concern the same matter: factors to be considered in assessing the appropriateness of disciplinary penalties. Accordingly, even if the Arbitrator erred in interpreting the regulation, such error would not provide a basis on which to find the award deficient because the agreement--not the regulation--controlled the disposition of the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In particular, although the Arbitrator's statement regarding the grievant's "first offense" refers to the Agency's table of penalties, the Arbitrator expressly linked her conclusion regarding the appropriate discipline of the grievant only to "consideration of the factors to be included in deciding the appropriate level of discipline pursuant to Article 28.5." The Agency has not demonstrated that but for the Arbitrator's statement regarding the range of penalties for a first offense of negligence under the Agency's table of penalties, the award, which is based on the parties' agreement, would have been different. Consequently, without addressing whether the disputed statement is clearly erroneous, it does not provide a basis on which to find the award deficient.</p>

<p class="noindent">Mitigation authority has limits. FLRA overturned an award reducing a suspension to a reprimand but instructing the parties that a repeat performance would incur a five-day suspension, <span class="Italic">DHHS, Austin and NTEU Chap. 219</span>, 40 FLRA 1035, 1041-42 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the Union and the Agency except to the portion of the award directing that a 5-day suspension without pay be imposed on the grievant if, during the one-year period in which the written reprimand is in effect, the grievant causes a disturbance in or outside the work area and/or refuses to perform work within her job specifications. The Union and the Agency argue that the award interferes with management's right to discipline....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the award is deficient because it conflicts with the right to discipline....&#8197;In <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, [34 FLRA 670 (1990),] the Authority was presented with exceptions concerning a virtually identical remedy as that presented here. In that case, the arbitrator determined that a 5-day suspension was not for just cause, reduced the suspension to a reprimand, and directed that the reprimand warn the grievant that any further violation would result in a 5-day suspension. We found that the portion of the award directing a future 5-day suspension improperly interfered with the exercise of management's right to discipline....&#8197;In reaching that result, we stated that restrictions on an agency's ability to choose the specific penalty to impose in disciplinary actions directly interfere with management's right to discipline under section 7106(a)(2)(A) by eliminating management's discretion to choose the penalty it will impose for a given offense. 34 FLRA at 673-74.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA sustains creative awards concerning suspensions that do not transgress its views of protected management rights. In <span class="Italic">Nat'l Gallery of Art and AFGE Local 1831</span>, 55 FLRA 480, 480-82 (1999), involving a challenge to a five-day suspension for "physically aggressive behavior" toward a supervisor, the arbitrator denied the grievance but directed that the suspension be held in abeyance for a year, to be "enforced only if Grievant commits a further offense during the period while under supervision different from at present but, if not, the instant offense and any record thereof shall be expunged." FLRA concluded that the award neither affected management's right to discipline employees nor necessitated a reassignment violating management's right to assign employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award violates its management rights to discipline and assign employees.&#x2003;We review the questions of law raised by these assertions and the Arbitrator's award <span class="Italic">de novo. See National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 24 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service v. FLRA, </span>43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying a standard of <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review, we assess whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law, based on the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">National Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Employees, Local 1437 and U.S. Department Of</span> <span class="Italic">the Army, Army Research, Development and Engineering Center, </span>53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998) <span class="Italic">(Army</span> <span class="Italic">Research). </span>In <span id="page_2281"></span>making that assessment, we defer to the Arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an agency asserts that an arbitrator's award violates management's rights, the Authority first determines whether the award affects managements rights. <span class="Italic">See United States Small Business Administration and</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">2951, </span>55 FLRA 179, 184 (1999). If it does, then the Authority applies the two-prong test set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and</span> <span class="Italic">Printing, Washington, D.C. and National Treasury</span> <span class="Italic">Employees Union, Chapter 201, </span>53 FLRA 146, 151-54 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>). If the award does not affect management's rights, then the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis is not required.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1. The award does not affect management's right to discipline employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the remedy interferes with its right to discipline, asserting that the award directs it to impose a five-day suspension on the grievant for the next offense committed during the abeyance period. The Agency relies on case law holding that restrictions on an agency's ability to choose the specific penalty to impose in disciplinary actions directly interfere with management's right to discipline by eliminating management's discretion to choose the penalty it will impose for a given infraction. Exceptions at 4 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Austin, Texas and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 219, </span>40 FLRA 1035 (1991)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award in this case states that the "discipline of five work days suspension is to be held in abeyance for a period of one year...and, shall be enforced only if [g]rievant commits a further offense during that period while under supervision different from at present...." As plainly worded, the award permits the Agency to enforce the penalty for the infraction involved in this case. That is, it mandates that the five-day suspension for the prior offense be automatically reinstated upon the occurrence of a further infraction. As such, the award does not limit, in any way, the appropriate penalty for a new infraction. Therefore, the award does not affect the Agency's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2. The award does not affect management's right to assign employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that this award directs it to assign the grievant to a different supervisor during the period in which the suspension is held in abeyance and, therefore, restricts its right to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award states only that the grievant's suspension will be enforced if another infraction is committed while the grievant is under the direction of a different supervisor. Thus, the award limits the infraction that would trigger the enforcement of the suspended discipline to an infraction involving another supervisor. However, this does not require the Agency to assign the grievant to a new supervisor. Therefore, the award does not affect the Agency's right to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Arbitrators need not require progression in penalties or MSPB mitigation principles in disciplinary actions falling below the adverse action threshold, <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Prison Locals, Local 1612 and DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Med. Ctr. for Fed. Prisoners</span>, 40 FLRA 498, 502-03 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's contentions regarding FPM letter 751-2 are...without merit. The Union is apparently claiming that Section IV.A. of the letter relating to employee "conduct requiring lesser disciplinary action" requires progressive discipline. FPM Letter 751-2, Section IV.A. provides in pertinent part: "Many incidents of conduct are relatively minor, such as tardiness, rudeness to a fellow employee,...etc. They may require no more than informal discussion with an employee,...or a warning....&#8197;If misconduct continues, [the Agency] should consider some disciplinary action such as...a suspension of 14 days or less."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the FPM letter requires an Agency to refrain from suspending an employee for even a "minor" offense. Rather, it is suggested that such offenses <span class="Italic">may</span> require less severe discipline. Moreover, in this case, the Arbitrator concluded that the grievant's conduct was egregious, not merely minor rudeness, and was part of an ongoing pattern of similar behavior. Accordingly, it is clear that the Arbitrator's award is not contrary to FPM letter 751-2, and the Union's exception does not provide a basis for finding the award deficient....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Arbitrator was not required in this case to consider the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors enunciated by the MSPB. We have repeatedly held that arbitrators are not bound by the same substantive standards as the MSPB when resolving grievances over actions not covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512....&#8197;Furthermore, although he did not consider expressly and specifically the so-called <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the Arbitrator did specifically consider the appropriateness of the penalty assessed and found that the 14-day suspension was warranted. The Union fails to establish otherwise, and its contentions provide no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 522 and VA Montgomery Reg'l Office</span>, 66 FLRA 560, 563 (2012), reaffirmed the arbitrator's discretion in reviewing short suspensions and minor disciplinary actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although arbitrators considering suspensions of fourteen days or less <span class="Italic">may </span>use and apply the legal principles established by the MSPB and the Federal Circuit for review of adverse actions under &#x00A7; 7703, such use is not mandatory. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot.</span>, 65 FLRA 160, 163 (2010) (<span class="Italic">CBP</span>) (Member Beck dissenting as to other matters); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2172</span>, 57 FLRA 625, 629 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Local 2172</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, INS, Jacksonville, Fla.</span>, 36 FLRA 928, 932 (1990). Arbitrators are also not required to consider the <span class="Italic">Douglas </span>factors in cases involving suspensions of fourteen days or less. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 64 FLRA 516, 518 (2010) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">NATCA, MEBA/NMU</span>, 52 FLRA 787, 792 (1996)). Thus, a claim that an arbitrator failed to apply or misapplied &#x00A7; 7703, the <span class="Italic">Douglas </span>factors, a preponderance burden, or an abuse-of-discretion standard in a case involving a suspension of fourteen days or less will not establish that an award is deficient. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., CBP</span>, 65 FLRA at 163; <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 64 FLRA at 518; <span class="Italic">Local 2172</span>, 57 FLRA at 629.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the suspension at issue here is a fourteen-day suspension, the Arbitrator was not required to apply &#x00A7; 7703, the <span class="Italic">Douglas </span>factors, a preponderance burden, or an abuse-of-discretion standard. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., CBP</span>, 65 FLRA at 163; <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 64 FLRA at 518; <span class="Italic">Local 2172</span>, 57 FLRA at 629. Consequently, the Union's claims that the Arbitrator failed to apply or misapplied them do not provide a basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's reliance on cases concerning constitutional due process is similarly misplaced. Where a union's claim challenges an arbitrator's actions in the conduct of the hearing and not an agency's actions as part of the pre-decisional process of proposing and deciding to suspend a grievant, the union's claim questions what process was due the grievant from the arbitrator, as a matter of law. The Authority has held that federal employees suspended for fourteen days or less are not entitled to any post-suspension proceedings. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3911, </span>66 FLRA 59, 61 (2011) (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 45</span>, 52 FLRA 1458, 1465 (1997)). As a post-suspension proceeding in a case like this involving a suspension of fourteen days or less is not required as a matter of law, there are no procedures specified by law that the Arbitrator was required to follow in resolving the grievance. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Accordingly, the Union's exception does not demonstrate that the Arbitrator denied the grievant the process that was due him as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 62 FLRA 70 (2007), set aside and remanded an award that mitigated a suspension to a reprimand based on the arbitrator's mistaken conclusion that a reprimand was required by 5 USC 7503, establishing procedures to be followed for short suspensions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 66 FLRA 750, 751 (2012) ("The Union argues that the Arbitrator failed to abide by Federal Circuit and Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) precedent when he did not take into account the grievant's medical condition in upholding the grievant's suspension.

<p class="noindent-1">[I]n <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Council of Veterans Administration Locals and Veterans Administration</span>, 31 FLRA 360 (1988) (Proposal 19, Section 7, Paragraph 10)...we found that a proposal that the "concept of progressive discipline" should be followed by an agency when it exercises its right to discipline employees is...outside the duty to bargain. In that case, the proposal violated management's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) because the agency's discretion to determine appropriate discipline would be impermissibly limited by the proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While an arbitrator may properly determine whether an agency has just cause to discipline an employee, that determination may not be based solely on an interpretation of the parties' agreement which violates the Statute. Here, the Arbitrator based his "just cause" decision solely on his <span id="page_2282"></span>finding that the parties' agreement required the Agency to follow each step of the progressive discipline article. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's award is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Bremerton MTC</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-44.html">71 FLRA 240</a>, 241-42 (2019) (Member DuBester concurring), declined to provide what amounted to retroactive effect to a provision of the now defunct Executive Order 13,839, at <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11939/promoting-accountability-and-streamlining-removal-procedures-consistent-with-merit-system-principles">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11939/promoting-accountability-and-streamlining-removal-procedures-consistent-with-merit-system-principles</a>, allowing management to avoid bargaining requirements for progressive discipline, and the decision also determined that mitigation of a short suspension did not violate the requirement that a remedy be proportionate to the contract violation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Agency contends that the Arbitrator's decision to mitigate the penalty is contrary to EO 13839, which, according to the Agency, "has granted supervisors and deciding officials the ability to tailor their penalty determinations to the facts and circumstances of each instance of misconduct and progressive discipline is not required." The Agency cites &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2(a) and 2(b) of EO 13839 in support of that proposition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, EO 13839 was issued on May 25, 2018, long after the grievant was suspended and the matter proceeded to arbitration. Section 8(b) of EO 13839 provides that "[n]othing in this order shall abrogate any collective[-]bargaining agreement in effect on the date of this order."[13] Because EO 13839, by its own terms, does not affect the grievant's antecedent rights under the CBA, the award cannot be deemed contrary to law on account of any alleged discrepancy with the order. Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;Exec. Order No. 13,839, 83 Fed. Reg. 25,343 (May 25, 2018).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we address the Agency's contention that the award excessively interferes with management's right to discipline its employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and the three-part <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> framework.[17]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;Under the three-part framework set forth in <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, the first question is whether the arbitrator found a violation of a contract provision. <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 70 FLRA at 405. We proceed to the second question of whether the arbitrator's remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to that violation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the answer to both questions is yes, then the final question is whether the arbitrator's interpretation of the provision excessively interferes with a &#x00A7; 7106(a) management right. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the answer to that question is yes, then the arbitrator's award is contrary to law and must be vacated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 406.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 27 of the CBA requires that disciplinary actions be taken only for just cause, and the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency lacked just cause for the seven-day suspension. Correspondingly, in answering <span class="Italic">DOJ's</span> first question, it is undisputed that the Arbitrator found that the Agency's imposition of a seven-day suspension violated Article 27 of the CBA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the second question, the Agency contends that the awarded remedy does not reasonably and proportionally relate to the violation of Article 27's "just cause" requirement. But the Agency provides no support for its contention beyond its mere disagreement with the Arbitrator's conclusion that a five-day suspension was appropriate based on the average suspension for such a charge, and, so, the Agency violated Article 27 by imposing a seven-day suspension without just cause.[21] Accordingly, the answer to the second question is also yes.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;The Agency contends that the Arbitrator erred in finding that a five-day suspension was the average given for similar misconduct, but it provides no support for its assertion, such as the evidence of the comparator employees plainly reviewed by the Arbitrator below. Parties are reminded that exceptions must be accompanied by any relevant documents that the Authority cannot easily access, such as, exhibits presented during the arbitration hearing. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.4(a)(3). In any case, this argument challenges the Arbitrator's factual finding, but the Agency does not argue that the award is based on nonfacts. <span class="Italic">See generally SSA, Seattle Region</span>, 58 FLRA 374, 375 (2003) (Member Pope concurring). As previously noted, the Authority defers to the Arbitrator's factual findings absent a demonstration that those findings are nonfacts. <span class="Italic">Local 933</span>, 70 FLRA at 510 n.13.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third question under the <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> test is whether the Arbitrator's interpretation of the CBA excessively interferes with a &#x00A7; 7106(a) management right. Again, while the Agency emphatically disagreed with the Arbitrator's award, the Agency failed to demonstrate how the two-day mitigation excessively interfered with its right to discipline under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A). Accordingly, we conclude that the answer to the third question is no. We therefore deny the exception.</p>
