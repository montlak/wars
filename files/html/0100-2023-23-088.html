<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Niday v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 673, 677 (1990), suggested that computation of back pay is governed by regulations and is not a matter for negotiation between the employee and the agency. The Board will compel proper evidence of agency contributions and calculations of retirement contributions following reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Tydingco v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 28 MSPR 563, 565 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Gallagher v. Dept. of Army</span>, 59 MSPR 379, 385 (1993) (dispute over a settlement canceling removal: agency was required to ensure appellant's leave and earnings statement reflected the appellant's accrued retirement contributions); <span class="Italic">Hooks v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 655, 659 (1993) (requiring agency to ensure employee receives all retirement allocations he would have accrued had he not been terminated); <span class="Italic">Greene v. DHHS</span>, 54 MSPR 163, 169 (1992) ("Although the Back Pay Act does not expressly require withholding or deducting income taxes from back pay awards, it is implicit from the words of the statute and its implementing regulations that taxes and retirement contributions that would have been withheld had the improper action not occurred must be deducted from a back pay award." (citing <span class="Italic">Cortez v. VA</span>, 27 MSPR 648, 651 (1985) (under the Back Pay Act an employee is regarded as never having a break in service, and retirement contributions must be paid unless waived by OPM))). Under <span class="Italic">Hargett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 82 MSPR 180, 182 &#x00B6; 8 &#x0026; n.1 (1999), retirement contributions are calculated on the basis of gross basic back pay, defined as the amount the appellant would have been paid had no personnel actions been taken. Gross basic back pay does not include any amounts paid for lump sum annual leave, and it does not take into account any interim earnings or amounts paid to the appellant in the form of separation incentives or gross annuities.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The procedure for settlement of retirement contribution problems was outlined, <span class="Italic">Dailey v. DHHS</span>, 33 MSPR 493, 495 (1987) (an enforcement petition):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[C]alculation of the amount of back pay to which appellant is entitled is governed by 5 CFR 550.805(e)(2) and Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 990-2, Subchapter S8-7(d)(2) and (4). Briefly, these provisions provide that a refund of retirement contributions paid to an employee based on a separation that is subsequently found erroneous and canceled by restoring the employee to duty retroactively so that there was no break in service removes the legal basis for the refund. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8342. Consequently, a refund paid in error represents a debt due the retirement fund that must be deducted from any back pay entitlement. [So must any lump-sum leave payment received by the employee be set off against the employee's back pay award.] Where the employee is entitled to back pay, and where, as here, the employee has obtained a refund of retirement contributions, the agency must contact OPM to determine the amount of the refund (debt) to be offset against the back pay entitlement and submit to OPM a check for the appropriate amount.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will deny restoration of retirement benefits when, because of intervening circumstances, no obligation exists to make those contributions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Roja v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 618, 621 (1992) (appellant was on OWCP status; because an OWCP recipient is on LWOP, he receives no basic pay and FERS contributions are based on a percentage of basic pay). Should assistance be required from OPM to compute annuity benefits, employing agencies will not be penalized as a result of OPM's delays. <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. DHHS</span>, 36 MSPR 496, 504 (1988).

<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR Part 1605 (2022) provides regulations of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board governing correction of administrative errors (including adjustments of personnel actions through MSPB litigation or arbitration awards) affecting contributions of Thrift Savings Plan participants. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1605.13 (2022) ("Back pay awards and other retroactive pay adjustments").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming an underlying Board order affecting employment, the Board may order adjustments to be made to TSP accounts, <span class="Italic">Giove v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has the authority, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), to order any federal agency to comply with any order or decision issued under its adjudicatory authority, and to enforce compliance with any such order. Under that provision, the Board may review matters related to TSP accounts, including claims that an agency failed to take corrective actions it should have taken with respect to such an account. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Shobert v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2001) (the Board's order to cancel the employee's suspension required the agency to comply with applicable TSP regulations, including those providing for transfer of funds to the employee's TSP account and for payment of lost earnings on that account). We therefore agree with the appellant that the Board has the authority to review his TSP-related claim, and to determine whether OPM or any other federal agency has failed to take action necessary as a result of the August 2004 order mentioned above.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency must fully account for contributions due to the Thrift Savings Plan. <span class="Italic">Shobert v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 90 MSPR 262, 266-67 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2001) (partially overruled by <span class="Italic">Bills v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> 122 MSPR 367, 2015 MSPB 25 (2015)), outlined the scheme for recovery of TSP contributions for employees restored to agencies through Board orders:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The TSP was established by the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA), Pub.L. No. 99-335, 100 Stat. 514 (codified as amended largely at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8351 and 8401-8479), and has been implemented through regulations at 5 CFR, Part 1600. The agency was required to comply with the FERSA and with the applicable TSP regulations in issuing the appellant's back pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805(h) (agencies must correct errors that affect an employee's TSP account consistent with regulations prescribed by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency was required to implement the appellant's TSP elections by deducting his employee contributions from the back pay award and transferring those funds to the TSP. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1605.4(c)(1). According to a summary prepared by DFAS, the appellant elected to contribute 5% of his basic pay to the TSP. The DFAS report states that the appellant earned $860.96 in wages and that $43.05 in employee contributions was deducted and transferred to the TSP. The report also indicates that the agency transferred to the appellant's TSP account $8.61, representing the agency automatic (1%) contributions, and $34.44, representing the agency matching contributions. Accordingly, we find that the agency has submitted sufficient evidence with respect to the employee and agency contributions made to the appellant's TSP account.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to these contributions, the agency was required to pay an amount, computed by the TSP recordkeeper, that is necessary to restore the TSP earnings lost as a result of the agency action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1606.3. Lost earnings are calculated by the TSP recordkeeper based on "lost earnings record"[2] submitted by the employing agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1606.13<span class="Italic">. See also</span> TSP Bulletin No. 01-35, <span class="Italic">Processing Lost Earnings Records</span> (Aug. 15, 2001). Pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1606.11(b), the agency was required to provide lost earnings records to the TSP recordkeeper "for each pay period affected by the error." The appellant asserts that the agency must produce these lost earnings records as evidence of compliance, citing <span class="Italic">Camastro v. Department of Justice,</span> 86 MSPR 267, 273-74 (2000). We agree. While the TSP recordkeeper determines the proper amount of lost earnings to be deposited into the appellant's TSP account, the agency must show that it provided the information and certification that is required to enable the TSP recordkeeper to correctly compute the lost earnings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;A "lost earnings record" is defined as "the data record containing information enabling the TSP system to compute lost earnings and to determine the investment fund in which money would be invested had an error not occurred." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1606.2.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, <span class="Italic">Shobert</span> returned to the Board, <span class="Italic">Shobert v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 91 MSPR 572, 575 &#x00B6; 9 (2002). The agency was in compliance with its TSP obligations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The TSP regulations define a "lost earning record" as "the data record containing information enabling the TSP system to compute lost earnings and to determine the investment fund in which money would be invested had an error not occurred." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1606.2 (2001). Lost earnings records have a "beginning date," which is the pay date on which the contribution should have been made; an "ending date," which is the pay date on which the contribution was made; the amount of the contribution by source (employee, agency automatic 1%, or agency matching); and, if the "beginning date" is before May 1, 2001, the amount of the contribution by investment fund (G, F, or C)<span class="Italic">. See</span> TSP Bulletin No. 01-35, Processing Lost Earnings Records (Aug. 15, 2001). The agency has provided a spreadsheet that appears to meet the definition of a "lost earnings record." The spreadsheet shows the dates each contribution should have been made, the dates the contributions actually were made, and an accounting showing the source of the contribution (employee, automatic 1%, and matching), and the allocation among the investment <span id="Page_4886"></span>funds. Accordingly, we find the agency in compliance with respect to the appellant's TSP account.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The FRTIB TSP restoration regulation was discussed in <span class="Italic">Latham v. USPS</span>, DA-0353-10-0408-X-1 (NP 9/11/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency was required to comply with applicable TSP regulations in issuing the appellant's back pay. <span class="Italic">See Shobert v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 9 (2001). As relevant here, TSP regulations provide that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The employing agency must give a reinstated or retroactively appointed [TSP] participant the following options for electing makeup contributions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;The reinstated or retroactively appointed participant may submit a new contribution election for purposes of makeup contributions if he or she would have been eligible to make such an election but for the erroneous separation or erroneous failure to appoint; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;If a reinstated participant had a contribution election form on file when he or she separated, the contribution election the participant had on file when he or she separated may be reinstated for purposes of makeup contributions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13(a)(2) (2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency provided the appellant with the opportunity to make a new election for purposes of makeup contributions during the back pay period. The appellant completed the "Employee Form To Recover Back Pay," PS Form 8038, which specifically asked whether he wanted to participate in the TSP during the back pay period. The appellant checked the "no" box. Underneath that box, he wrote: "Not now. Was already placed in taxable distribution. Want money for back pay period." Thus, the appellant clearly indicated that he did not wish to have deductions taken from his back pay for TSP contributions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the agency provided the appellant with a TSP election form, TSP-1. The appellant contends that this form is "clear evidence" of his intent to participate in the TSP during the back pay period. He points to a comment he wrote at the top of the form: "To be made whole [illegible] during back pay period." This comment does not constitute a TSP election. The form clearly instructed the appellant that "[t]o start or change the amount of your contributions to your TSP account, enter either a whole percentage of your basic pay per pay period (item 6) or a whole dollar amount per pay period (item 7)." The appellant left items 6 and 7 blank. Thus, the record reflects that the agency provided the appellant with the option of submitting a new election form for the back pay period and that the appellant elected not to participate. We therefore agree with the administrative judge that the agency has demonstrated compliance with regard to the appellant's TSP participation during the back pay period.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant states that the agency "touts the ability to change one's TSP contributions at any time." That may well be true with respect to prospective TSP contributions, but makeup contributions must be computed before the back pay award is paid, deducted from the back pay, and submitted to the TSP record keeper. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13(c)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Thomas-Jordan v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-0752-16-0343-X-1 (NP 3/20/2023), added as to agency obligations concerning TSP accounts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's TSP account, the regulations implementing the Back Pay Act require that an agency correct errors affecting an employee's TSP account consistent with the regulations prescribed by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. <span class="Italic">Rittgers v. Department of the Army</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 7 (2015); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(h). Pursuant to these regulations, the employing agency must give a reinstated employee who would have been eligible to contribute to her TSP account but for the erroneous separation the opportunity to submit a new contribution election for purposes of makeup contributions or to reinstate the contribution election she had on file at the time of her separation for makeup contributions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13(a)(2). The regulations also provide the employee's makeup contributions must be accompanied by attributable agency matching contributions and that, even if the reinstated employee does not elect to make up her employee contributions, the employing agency must make all appropriate agency automatic (1%) contributions associated with the back pay award. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13(c)(3).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations implementing the Back Pay Act require an agency to correct errors affecting an employee's Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account consistent with regulations prescribed by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB). 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(h); <span class="Italic">see Madison v. Department of Defense</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 11 (2009). The FRTIB regulations address the process by which a reinstated employee's TSP account should be credited with the contributions that should have been made during the back pay period. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13. Among other things, the regulations require the employing agency to deduct the appropriate TSP contributions from an employee's back pay award and submit the contributions to the "TSP record keeper," a component of the FRTIB. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13(c)(1); <span class="Italic">Madison</span>, 111 M.S.P.R., &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1690.1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the September 30, 2009 Opinion and Order, the Board directed the agency to "clearly set forth its calculations relating to the appellant's...TSP account." <span class="Italic">Tubesing</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6; 22. In its submission in response to the Board's Opinion and Order, the agency provided a spreadsheet purporting to show the amount of the appellant's TSP contributions and the agency's matching payments. The agency, however, offered no explanation regarding its calculations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the agency's submission, the appellant argued that the agency had not properly restored his TSP contributions. In support of his assertion, the appellant cited an October 14, 2009 statement from the agency's finance and accounting service allegedly showing that nothing had been withheld from the appellant's back pay award for TSP contributions. Contrary to the appellant's assertion, the October 14, 2009 statement appears to show that the agency deducted $892.32 from his back pay award for the TSP. The agency, however, provides no explanation regarding how this figure was calculated and it appears inconsistent with the agency's other documentary evidence regarding the appellant's TSP account.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be in compliance regarding the appellant's TSP account, the agency must show that it has complied with the FRTIB's regulations regarding back pay awards, including the requirement that the agency inform the TSP record keeper of the back pay award. <span class="Italic">See Walker</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 136, &#x00B6; 26. The agency must also show that it requested the FRTIB to provide a computation of interest and lost earnings in accord with the applicable regulations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Additionally, the agency must provide a detailed explanation of its calculations regarding TSP and must show how they demonstrate compliance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency requirements on TSP contributions were modified as a result of a regulatory change that discontinued the requirement of an agency to request a computation of interest and lost earnings from FRTIB, <span class="Italic">Bills v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the compliance initial decision, the administrative judge incorrectly imposed two additional requirements on the agency to show compliance. The administrative judge required the agency to inform the TSP record keeper of the back pay award and to show that it requested FRTIB to provide a computation of interest and lost earnings in accord with the applicable regulations. The administrative judge's authority for these requirements was based on <span class="Italic">Shobert v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 11 (2001), which in turn derived the requirements from the then-current governing regulations, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1606.3 (2001) and 1606.11 (2001). However, the authority of 5 C.F.R. Part 1606 expired on August 31, 2003. <span class="Italic">See</span> Various Changes to the Thrift Savings Plan, 70 Fed. Reg. 21290, 21291 (April 25, 2005). At that time, the governing authority for all TSP contributions from back pay awards became 5 C.F.R. Part 1605. 70 Fed. Reg. at 21291. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13, the agency is now no longer required to request a computation of interest and lost earnings from FRTIB, and only needs to notify the TSP record keeper of the back pay award if there are employee make-up contributions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13(c). Therefore, the portion of the compliance initial decision requiring the agency to inform the TSP record keeper of the back pay award and to show that it requested FRTIB to provide a computation of interest and lost earnings is hereby VACATED, and <span class="Italic">Shobert</span> is OVERRULED to the extent that it requires agencies to comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1606.3 (2001) and 1606.11 (2001).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With reference to <span class="Italic">Bills</span>, <span class="Italic">Chen v. USPS,</span> SF-0353-13-0150-C-1 (NP 4/29/2016), said of TSP calculations and accounting for those calculations and deposits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations implementing the Back Pay Act require that an agency correct errors affecting an employee's TSP account consistent with the regulations prescribed by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB). <span class="Italic">Price v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 222, &#x00B6; 16 (2012) (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(h)). As explained in the FRTIB's regulations, makeup contributions are contributions that should have been deducted from an employee's basic pay or contributed by the agency on an earlier date, but were not deducted or contributed. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.1. Breakage is "the loss incurred or gain realized on makeup...contributions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Calculating breakage is a function of the TSP, not a function of the employing agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(a) (stating that "[t]he TSP will calculate breakage on late contributions [and] makeup agency contributions"). Thus, the agency cannot change the breakage calculated for the appellant's makeup contributions.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We find that the three Board cases cited by the appellant do not support her argument that the agency improperly implemented her TSP relief. <span class="Italic">See Giove v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 53 (2007); <span class="Italic">Shobert v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 262 (2001); and <span class="Italic">McKinley v.

The relevant issue in <span class="Italic">Giove</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 53, &#x00B6; 8, was whether or not the Board had jurisdiction over the appellant's TSP claims, <span id="Page_4887"></span>whereas here, the administrative judge already found that the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's TSP claims and addressed the merits of them. The appellant appears to cite <span class="Italic">McKinley</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 571-72, to argue that the agency is required to calculate and forward makeup contributions to the TSP. However, as discussed below, she has not presented any evidence to refute the agency's evidence that it did so. Finally, we note that FRTIB regulations have changed since <span class="Italic">Shobert</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 11, was issued, and an agency is no longer required to request a computation of interest and lost earning from FRTIB, as argued by the appellant. <span class="Italic">Bills v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 367, &#x00B6; 9 n.2 (2015). Instead, the current regulation governing an employing agency's correction of TSP errors after a back pay award is 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13, which we analyze below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency has submitted evidence that it satisfied its obligation under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13(c)(1) by forwarding its TSP adjustments to the TSP record keeper. The Accounting Supervisor's declaration states that the agency forwarded the TSP adjustments to Serco, which the Supervisor identifies as "the agency responsible for calculating breakage." Further, the agency submitted below a detailed history of the appellant's breakage in her TSP payments and an explanation of how the TSP calculates breakage. On review, the appellant does not specify how the breakage calculations were erroneous. The appellant's remedy for errors in the breakage calculations is found in the procedures in 5 C.F.R. part 1605, subpart C. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.22. These procedures do not provide authority for our review and, in light of our limited jurisdiction and our finding that the agency took all required actions, we cannot review TSP's breakage calculations. <span class="Italic">See Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (finding that the Board's jurisdiction is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McKinley v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 73 MSPR 569, 571-74 &#x00B6; 15 (1997), discusses an agency's failure to account for or properly make TSP contributions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulation governing retroactive TSP contributions in connection with a back pay award upon correction of an erroneous separation is 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1605.9(c). It requires the agency, after giving the employee the opportunity to make any elections which could have been made during the back pay period, to compute and forward to the National Finance Center (NFC) the amounts which the employee would have contributed during this period, together with the agency's basic and matching contributions for the same period. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1605.9(c)(2)[.] This regulation clearly requires the agency to forward to NFC the contributions which the appellant would have made to her TSP account, as well as those which the agency would have made, and we find that it is not excused from doing so on the ground that she is now employed by another agency, as the agency has suggested. The TSP bulletin which the agency cites concerning retroactive contributions for separated, retired, or deceased employees, is on its face inapplicable to this situation.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Debt collection procedures are available to the agency if it has overpaid the appellant by paying to her amounts which should have been paid to her TSP account. However, as the administrative judge found, the appellant has expressed her willingness to reimburse the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence which the agency has submitted indicates that the appellant's basic back pay award (before offset of severance pay) was $6,182.40. The appellant has indicated that she elected to contribute 10 percent of her pay to the TSP, and the computer printout of contributions to her TSP account submitted by the agency indicates that the appellant was contributing 10 percent of her basic pay at the time of her separation and that the agency's basic and matching contributions pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 8432(c)(1)(A) &#x0026; (2)(B) were respectively 1 percent and 4 percent of her pay. The amounts on the printout (dated May 23, 1996 and August 15, 1996) which the agency has identified as its contributions to the appellant's TSP account for the back pay period are $736.72 (the contribution on behalf of the appellant), $101.09 (the agency's basic contribution), and $387.60 (the agency's matching contribution). However, these figures do not represent the corresponding percentages of the back pay award. At the same time, the printout shows no contributions to the TSP on behalf of the appellant or the agency for the six pay periods between the appellant's reinstatement and her transfer to the Forest Service, which suggests that some of the contributions identified by the agency may not have been for the back pay period. Without clear evidence of the appellant's TSP contribution election, the amount of her basic back pay subject to the TSP, and the amount of the agency's contributions to her TSP account for the back pay period and for the remainder of the appellant's employment by the agency, the Board is unable to determine whether the appellant has been made whole.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we ORDER the agency to submit within 25 days of the date of this order evidence, including a narrative explanation, showing 1) what is the amount of contributions to the appellant's TSP account due from the appellant and the agency during the back pay period and the basis for this determination; 2) that the agency has made these contributions to the appellant's account; 3) that all contributions to the TSP account due for the period.... have been made, and the basis for this conclusion; and 4) that lost earnings resulting from the delayed payment of any additional amount due the appellant's TSP account have been posted to her account.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Camastro v. DOJ</span>, 86 MSPR 267, 273-74 (2000), provided specific directions to an agency concerning TSP contributions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency submitted documentation purporting to show that it made automatic and agency matching contributions to the appellant's TSP account and awarded lost earnings. The printout of the thrift savings plan shows that several deposits were made to the appellant's TSP account on December 19, 1996, and that lost earnings were also posted to his account. While the amounts shown on the printout may be correct, there is no way to ascertain the accuracy of the amounts absent an explanation of the underlying salary figures on which the contributions are based. The agency must provide a detailed explanation showing that it complied with the procedures set forth in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1605.4 for making the required payments and adjustments to the appellant's TSP account for the back pay period. Additionally, in order to determine whether the amounts are correct, the agency must provide information of the appellant's salary during the back pay period and show, as directed by the administrative judge, that the TSP contributions were based on the back pay owed, as set out in the agency's May 28, 1998, submission. Further the agency must provide a detailed explanation of how the lost earnings were computed. Pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1606.11(b) an employing agency is required to submit a separate lost earnings record for each pay period affected by the error. The record should contain the beginning date the contribution should have been made, the amount of the contribution and the date the contribution was processed by the TSP record keeper. <span class="Italic">See</span> Thrift Savings Plan Bulletin, No. 95-29, at 5 (Oct. 5, 1995).

In addition, the agency must address the matter of "lost earnings" and show that it has complied with the regulations concerning "lost earnings." 5 CFR Parts 1605 and 1606. We recognize that the administrative judge implied that, because the TSP recordkeeper determines the proper amount to be deposited in the appellant's TSP account, there is no way to verify whether the agency's assertions about the TSP deposits are accurate.

Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 327 (2010), requires the agency to request a computation of interest from the FRTIB but that the declaration from Russell Teed, Accounting and Control Specialist for the Payroll Benefits Branch, did not aver that he asked FRTIB to calculate interest, and thus the agency failed to prove that it provided him with <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief with respect to his TSP account.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations implementing the Back Pay Act require an agency to correct errors affecting an employee's TSP account consistent with regulations prescribed by the FRTIB. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805 (h); <span class="Italic">see Tubesing</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 327, &#x00B6; 17; <span class="Italic">Madison v.

Among other things, the regulations require the employing agency to deduct the appropriate TSP contributions from an employee's back pay award and submit the contributions to the "TSP record keeper," a component of the FRTIB. <span class="Italic">Tubesing</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 327, &#x00B6; 17 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13 (c)(1)).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant concedes in his petition for review that the agency corrected the initial contribution amount to his TSP for the period of his demotion, but he asserts that the agency has not paid him for the lost interest on those contributions. As the administrative judge recognized, Mr. Teed explained in his sworn declaration that the TSP calculated the appellant's interest and lost earnings, known as "breakage," based on the "late" TSP contributions resulting from the appellant's back pay award. Mr. Teed noted that the TSP, rather than the agency, calculates breakage and that breakage can be positive or negative given the risk of investments. Mr. Teed attached a computer report and explained that the report is customized to show "any and all periods of employment history TSP deductions" and "the exact breakage calculated by TSP with respect to these periods of back pay for [the appellant]." Mr. Teed explained the breakage calculations for relevant pay dates in relevant funds for employee contributions, agency automatic contributions, and agency matching contributions. Such calculations represent the computation of interest and lost earnings in accordance with <span class="Italic">Tubesing</span> and the applicable regulations. The appellant's assertion that the agency failed to meet its burden solely because Mr. Teed did not explicitly aver to requesting the FRTIB to calculate interest and lost earnings is without merit as the evidence shows that breakage was calculated and credited to the appellant's TSP account.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of difficulties restoring the appellant's Roth account within the TSP, <span class="Italic">Grimsrud v. Dept. of Transp</span>., NY-0752-13-0073-X-1 (NP 6/28/2016), also commented on the roles of the agency and FRTIB:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to FRTIB regulations, when pay has been contributed to a participant's traditional balance when it should have been contributed to his Roth balance, the agency must promptly submit a redesignation record. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.17(b). That is exactly what the agency did here. (certification of redesignation of records and journal voucher). Once the agency submitted the redesignation records, the FRTIB was responsible for treating "the erroneously submitted contribution (and associated positive earnings) as if the contribution had been made to the correct balance on the date that it was contributed to the wrong balance." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.17(c)(1). The FRTIB was also responsible for changing the tax characterization of the erroneously characterized contribution. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.17(c)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, once the agency certified the transfer of funds (Form TSP-2-G), the FRTIB was responsible for calculating "breakage," i.e., "the loss incurred or the gain realized on makeup or late contributions." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.1. The regulations make clear that the FRTIB calculates breakage on late contributions and makeup agency contributions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(a). The FRTIB, not the employing agency, must determine the number of shares of applicable investment funds the participant would have received had the contributions been made on time. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(b)(1)(ii). The regulations further provide that there is no "breakage" associated with the redesignation of a TSP account from traditional to Roth. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.17(c)(4).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board requires agencies to restore TSP accounts when that relief is appropriate, but the Board neither requires agencies to inform the appellant of options concerning TSP transactions undertaken by the appellant nor does the Board exercise authority over the administrator of the TSP, FRTIB, to waive its regulatory requirements. The enforcement case of <span class="Italic">Thunder-Collier v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 115 MSPR 82, 86-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14, 2010 MSPB 202 (2010), expressed limitations on Board enforcement authority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e do not agree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency was not in compliance because it failed to inform the appellant of her rights upon reinstatement with respect to amounts withdrawn from her TSP account. It is correct that the appellant was entitled to restore the amount that she had withdrawn from the TSP at the time of her retirement and, in such a case, of the right also to reinstate the outstanding loan from her account, which was treated at the time of her withdrawal as a taxable distribution. These rights are conferred by the TSP regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13(d)-(e). However, section 1605.13 ("Back pay awards and other retroactive adjustments") does not state any agency duty to provide notice of this right, and the administrative judge cited no authority for such a requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant voluntarily withdrew her funds from her TSP account to transfer them to an IRA and also thereby terminated her loan. Since she was aware of having done so, it was incumbent on her to make inquiries if she wished to restore these funds to her TSP account upon reinstatement. The applicable TSP regulation informed her of her right to do so and the time limit for exercising it. Furthermore, the appellant has cited no authority for the Board to order the Thrift Investment Board to exercise its discretion to waive the time limit for restoring the funds. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Giove v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 53 &#x00B6; 9 (2007) (the Board lacks authority to order that the appellant be allowed to redeposit the amount he withdrew from his TSP account during the period between denial of his disability retirement application and the Board's decision reversing the denial).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find, however, that compliance with that order does not require any agency to permit redeposit of the $61,000 the appellant withdrew from his TSP account. To the extent the withdrawals are related to OPM's initial disallowance of the appellant's disability retirement application, the tax-related and other consequences of those withdrawals would represent damages resulting from the disallowance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vitanza v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 385, &#x00B6; 15 (2003) (referring to expenses the employee allegedly incurred as a result of his removal and its cancellation--including expense of relocating back to his job location after the cancellation of the removal, and travel expenses related to the employee's appearance at the hearing on the removal--as damages); <span class="Italic">Bullock v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 217, &#x00B6; 9 (2003) (referring to medical expenses allegedly incurred as a result of a removal as damages). The Board's authority to award damages is limited to a few categories of cases, i.e., cases in which the Board orders corrective action in an individual right of action appeal, those in which it orders corrective action in response to a petition filed by the Special Counsel under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214, and those in which it finds intentional discrimination of a kind covered under the Civil Rights Act of 1991. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.201(c), (d). The appellant's disability retirement appeal falls into none of these categories. We therefore find that he is not entitled to an order permitting him to redeposit the money he withdrew from his TSP account. <span class="Italic">See Vitanza</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 385, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">Bullock</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 217, &#x00B6; 9</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the administrative judge did not explicitly state whether, in calculating the appellant's TSP contributions, the agency should include contributions during the 6-month periods following his withdrawals. Concerning the first withdrawal, the appellant argues that he would not have withdrawn the funds from his TSP account but for the agency placing him on administrative leave prior to his indefinite suspension and the corresponding loss of overtime pay. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The placement of the appellant on paid administrative leave prior to his indefinite suspension is not an appealable action. <span class="Italic">See LaMell v. Armed Forces Retirement Home</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 413, &#x00B6; 7 (2007).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, the appellant argues that the agency should reimburse her the amount of her defaulted TSP loan. However, because she already received a distribution of her TSP loan, reimbursement would place her in a better position than she would have been in had the wrongful personnel action not occurred. The applicable regulations do not require an agency to restore funds withdrawn by the appellant. <span class="Italic">Rittgers v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, moreover, claims that the agency must compensate her for the taxes and penalties she incurred after she was unable to make loan payments during the back pay period, resulting in a taxable distribution of her TSP loan. However, the Board has found that it lacks the authority to make an award of damages for taxes and other consequences of an agency action without the specific statutory authority to do so, which is lacking here. <span class="Italic">Crazy Thunder</span>-<span class="Italic">Collier v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant is not entitled to restoration of his TSP account loan under the Back Pay Act.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency is not in compliance because it has not reinstated a loan outstanding from his TSP account when he separated from service. The regulations implementing the Back Pay Act require that an agency correct errors affecting an employee's TSP account consistent with the regulations prescribed by the FRTIB. <span class="Italic">Price v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 222, &#x00B6; 16 (2012) (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(h)). In accordance with the FRTIB's regulations, the appellant had the option to restore the amount withdrawn from his TSP account at the time of his separation and, in such a case, could elect to reinstate an outstanding loan that was treated as a taxable distribution. <span class="Italic">See Crazy Thunder-Collier v. Department of the Interior</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 82, &#x00B6; 13 (2010) (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13(d)-(e)). The option to restore withdrawn funds expires if the participant does not exercise the option by notifying the FRTIB within 90 days of his reinstatement. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13(d). The Board has found that this regulation does not obligate an agency to notify an employee of this option. <span class="Italic">Crazy Thunder-Collier</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 82, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14 (stating that it was incumbent on the appellant to make inquiries if she wished to restore funds to her TSP account upon reinstatement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency plays no role in reinstating the appellant's TSP loan. To the extent that the administrative judge relied on the tax consequences of the TSP loan being converted to a withdrawal, an issue the appellant believes is irrelevant in his petition for review, we modify the initial decision. We reach the same conclusion as the administrative judge based on our finding in <span class="Italic">Crazy Thunder-Collier</span>. Since an agency has no obligation to inform the employee of her right to reinstate a TSP loan, the appellant's position that the agency had an obligation to reinstate his loan is untenable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency cannot change the breakage calculated for the appellant's makeup contributions.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appears to be arguing that the agency failed to comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13 by not calculating the breakage on his TSP makeup contributions based on investment in the correct fund. Makeup contributions are contributions that should have been deducted from an employee's basic pay or contributed by the agency on an earlier date but were not deducted or contributed. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.(1) Breakage is the loss incurred or gain realized on makeup contributions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Makeup contributions and the associated breakage are invested according to the employee's contribution allocation on the posting date.[3] 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.13(a)(3). Calculating breakage is based on the participant's contribution allocation on file for the "as of" the date. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(b). The "as of" date is the date the TSP contribution should have taken place. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.1(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Posting date means the date on which a transaction is credited or debited to a participant's account. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1690.1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appears to be alleging that, at the time of his separation, he had a contribution allocation on file investing all of his contributions in the C Fund, and therefore his breakage should have been calculated based on an investment in that fund. The agency states that it has been advised by the TSP and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service that the management of the appellant's TSP account is a matter between the appellant and the TSP. The appellant acknowledges that he received both makeup contributions and breakage. We agree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency is in compliance with its TSP payment obligations under the applicable regulations. Calculating breakage is a function of the FRTIB/TSP, not a function of the employing agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2 (stating that "[t]he TSP" will calculate breakage on makeup contributions).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Wilkes alleges that the VA did not fully comply with the MSPB's order reinstating his employment because the agency did not reinstate his TSP loan, which had been converted to a taxable withdrawal upon his retirement. The governing law does not support Mr. Wilkes's argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Wilkes, not the VA, had an obligation to seek reinstatement of his TSP loan. The VA may correct errors in Mr. Wilkes's TSP account consistent with the FRTIB's regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(h) ("Agencies must correct errors that affect an employee's [TSP] account consistent with regulations prescribed by the [FRTIB].").
