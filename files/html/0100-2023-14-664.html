<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-665"><span class="space">I.</span> APPRAISAL OF UNION OFFICIALS ON OFFICIAL TIME</h3>
<p class="noindent">In comments accompany 1995 revisions to regulations of OPM governing performance appraisal, OPM noted at 60 FR 43936, 43937 (Aug. 23, 1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several comments raised related labor relations issues concerning employees who serve as representatives of labor organizations in their agencies under chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code. For example, one commenter suggested adding a requirement that union officials be granted presumptive ratings at the "Fully Successful" (or equivalent) level. Under performance appraisal provisions in part 430, the performance to be planned, monitored, and rated covers the work, duties, and responsibilities that accomplish the agency mission and for which the employee is accountable to the employing organization. When an employee is serving as the representative of a labor organization, he or she is performing duties for that labor organization. To intermingle performance of the representational duties into the appraisal program would be inappropriate because appraisal of the employee's performance must be based solely upon the employee's performance of agency duties. For employees who spend 100 percent of their time as labor representatives, and for employees who spend a significant amount of time as determined by the agency, this means that they cannot, and should not, be given performance appraisal ratings of record. In the interest of preserving the distinction between the agency-assigned duties of an official position and union duties and responsibilities, OPM is not adopting this suggestion. The regulations at part 430 continue to preclude a "presumptive" or "assumed" rating of record and such employees are considered "unratable." The only place in regulations where an "assumed" rating is used is in the regulations at &#x00A7; 351.504 for granting addition service credit based on performance in a reduction in force.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unions attempt through negotiations to address performance appraisal of union officials who spend some or all of their work weeks on official time. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 39 FLRA 731, 732-36 (1991), considered the negotiability of Provision 1: "The chapter president, chief steward and all other stewards who spend eighty (80) or more hours on bank time in a two-quarter rating period will be exempt from a measured evaluation for that period." The proposal was nonnegotiable because it interfered with the right of the agency to assign work and because it was not an appropriate arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's rights to direct employees and assign work under <span id="page_1113"></span>section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute include the right to identify critical elements of performance and establish performance standards. Proposals that establish criteria governing the content of critical elements of performance and performance standards directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, proposals that relate only to the application of critical elements and performance standards do not conflict with management's rights to direct employees and assign work, because they do not prevent management from initially determining the content of standards and do not require management to change or modify established standards....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that absolve employees of accountability for meeting specific levels of performance are nonnegotiable because they preclude management from establishing performance standards to evaluate employees in all circumstances.... Similarly, proposals that make adjustments or changes in production expectations are nonnegotiable because they interfere with management's discretion to determine the standards of work production to be required of employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Union's argument, we find that the provision does modify the criteria that management will use to evaluate the performance of certain union officials because it would require the Agency to use only subjective criteria for evaluation periods during which a Union official has spent a specified amount of time on representational functions. As the current performance standards establish both subjective and objective criteria for evaluations, the provision would modify the content of those performance standards under the specified circumstances. Consequently, the provision directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In analyzing a case under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, the Authority reviews all proposed arrangements that seek to ameliorate the adverse effects of the exercise of a management right on the facts and circumstances in each particular case.... As a threshold matter in these cases, the Authority will determine whether a proposal or provision is an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management rights by examining "the effects or foreseeable effects on employees which flow from the exercise of those rights, and how those effects are adverse."... Proposals addressing "purely speculative or hypothetical concerns, or which are otherwise unrelated to management's exercise of its reserved rights," will be excluded from consideration as appropriate arrangements.... Where an adverse effect is reasonably foreseeable, and the disputed provision or proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected, we will proceed to examine whether the provision or proposal excessively interferes with management's rights....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a threshold matter in this case, we find that the provision establishes an arrangement for union officials adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights. The intent of the provision is to ameliorate the effects of a quantitative evaluation on union officials who spend a significant amount of official time on representational activities. It is realistic to conclude that a union official who spends a significant amount of official time on representational functions could not meet a quantitative standard established for employees who spend 100 percent of their time performing their primary job duties. The provision attempts to ameliorate any adverse effects on such employees, by precluding a supervisor, in certain circumstances, from rating the employee on the quantitative factor of the evaluation. Consequently, we find that the provision is intended as an arrangement for adversely affected employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We must now determine whether the provision is appropriate or whether it excessively interferes with management's rights....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the language of the provision, we find that it excessively interferes with management's rights. As the Union stated, the employees are evaluated on both subjective and objective (measured) criteria. The provision would prevent management from evaluating an employee in a measured fashion if that employee had spent a specified amount of time on representational functions. In doing so, the provision completely eliminates one factor from an employee's performance evaluation. In addition, the provision imposes an absolute requirement on management's action. The provision does not allow for exceptions in situations where an accurate measured evaluation could be obtained even though the employee had spent a specified amount of time on representational activities. Based on these considerations, we find that the interference with management's rights is excessive and outweighs the benefit to employees. Consequently, we find that the proposal is not an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Considered in <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 41 FLRA 795, 808 (1991) (Provisions 2 and 3), were two related proposals designed to ease reentry into the workaday world of union officials whose immediate past efforts were devoted primarily to union matters:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whenever an Association official spends, over a two[-]year period, less than 40% of his/her duty hours per bi-week on examining related activities, the official, upon returning to substantially full[-]time examining duties, will be given a reasonable retraining period (without loss of grade or status) of at least 120 days.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the retraining period, there shall be no formal evaluations with respect to quality and quantity that could result in adverse consequences to the Association official. However, supervisors are encouraged to informally evaluate and counsel officials during the retraining period. After the retraining period, no record shall be kept regarding any informal evaluation. If during that 120 day period there is a reassignment (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, a docket change), the retraining period shall be restarted from the date of the reassignment. After the retraining period, the official shall only be formally evaluated by, and in accordance with, regular evaluations and regular evaluation procedures that apply to full time examiners; there shall be no special evaluations for former Association officials.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">POPA</span> proposals were nonnegotiable, 41 FLRA at 811-15:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The language of Provision 2 is couched in terms of requiring a "retraining" period for Union officials who are returning to "substantially full[-]time examining duties." However, when read in context with Provision 3 and the Union's statement of intent, we conclude that a more accurate description of Provisions 2 and 3 is that they establish a transition period in which such officials are afforded an opportunity to brush up on their job-related knowledge and skills and rebuild their case docket without being subjected to strict application of performance standards. Provisions 2 and 3 do not prescribe a specific training program that must be afforded such officials during this "retraining," or transition, period. Consequently, we find that the Agency's arguments to the effect that Provision 2 directly interferes with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) because it would prescribe a training program are misplaced. Rather, Provisions 2 and 3 concern management rights only insofar as they relate to performance appraisal systems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provisions 2 and 3 require that accommodations be made for Union officials who are returning to substantially full-time examining duties insofar as they concern the productivity standards that they will be expected to meet. Provision 2 establishes the circumstances under which the accommodations must be made and Provision 3 specifies the accommodations that will be made; namely, that no work done during the retraining period will be subject to formal evaluation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that management's rights to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute include the right to identify critical elements of performance and establish performance standards....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that absolve employees of accountability for meeting specific levels of performance directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work because they preclude management from establishing performance standards to evaluate employees in all circumstances.... Similarly, proposals that make adjustments or changes in production expectations directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work because they interfere with management's discretion to determine the standards of work production to be required of employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As written and explained by the Union, Provisions 2 and 3 would have the effect of requiring that production expectations be altered for Union officials during the prescribed retraining period. Consequently, they directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a threshold matter, we find that Provisions 2 and 3 establish an arrangement for Union officials adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights to direct employees and assign work. The intent of the provisions is to ameliorate the effects of the Agency's established performance standards on Union officials who have spent substantial amounts of time for a substantial period on Union activities rather than on their regular duties. It is reasonable to conclude that absence from regular duties for 60 percent, or more, of the time over a 2-year, or more, period would result in an inability to meet, or at least considerable difficulty in meeting, productivity standards that are premised on full time spent on regular duties. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that requiring those Union officials to meet immediately the productivity standards that are established for their positions would adversely affect them. Consequently, we find that the provisions are intended as an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having concluded that Provisions 2 and 3 constitute an arrangement, we now consider whether that arrangement is appropriate within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that Provisions 2 and 3 excessively interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1114"></span>The nature and extent of the adverse effect suffered by employees would be those associated with having to meet performance standards that, under the circumstances, would be impossible or, at best, extremely difficult to meet. That is, as noted, an employee who had been spending a large portion of time on non-examining, but nevertheless legitimate, activities for a substantial period of time would be required to produce at a level expected of an employee who had been devoting full time to examining activities. A negative performance evaluation can result in personnel actions adverse to an employee, which could include denial of a within-grade increase, demotion, and termination. Thus, the nature and extent of the foreseeable adverse effects that could flow from productivity standards that do not make any accommodation for time spent on union activities are considerable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency suggests that the choice to engage in union activities rests with the employee and is not within the Agency's control and, thus, any resulting consequences are the product of factors outside of management's control. Under section 7102 of the Statute, employees have a statutory right to engage in such activities. This is consistent with one of the underlying policies of the Statute that labor organizations and collective bargaining in the civil service are in the public interest. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101. In furtherance of this right and policy, section 7131 of the Statute specifically authorizes negotiation of official time to accommodate employees who engage in activity on behalf of a union. Clearly, the Statute seeks to minimize any adverse effects on employees that might result from union activity.... Thus, we reject a view that an employee's choice to engage in union activities on official time makes the employee culpable, in whole or in part, for any adverse effects on his or her career that result. Rather, we believe that the adverse effects should be viewed as a product of performance standards that make no allowance for time legitimately spent on non-examining activities. As management retains the right to establish performance standards, employees have little, if any, control over the productivity expectations placed on them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Clearly, an allowance regarding expected production levels made for time spent in union activities offers a significant benefit to affected employees in that it ensures that employees engaged in representational activities will not be penalized because of such activity. However, the Agency has a significant interest in being able to hold employees accountable for their performance by establishing and enforcing performance standards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While offering significant benefits to employees, Provisions 2 and 3 place severe restrictions on management's rights to direct employees and assign work. Specifically, Provisions 2 and 3 effectively prohibit any formal evaluation of work performed during the retraining period. For example, these provisions would prevent the Agency even from holding an employee accountable for work defects that are not attributable to circumstances caused by the employee having spent a significant amount of time by protected activity. Thus, these provisions would severely hamper the Agency's ability to hold employees accountable for their work performance during that period. Consequently, we conclude that the interference with management's rights is excessive and outweighs the benefit to employees and that Provisions 2 and 3 do not constitute an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent">Evaluations for union officials were again discussed in <span class="Italic">NAGE, FUSE, Local R1-144 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr., Newport</span>, 42 FLRA 1285, 1286-87 (1991). Several related proposals were nonnegotiable. Proposal 1 required the agency to revise the position description of the union president. Proposal 2 provided that critical elements and performance standards for the union president will be written and evaluated by a "neutral source" outside the agency. Proposal 3 addressed the union president's eligibility for performance awards. The proposals were:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Proposal 1</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The president of FUSE [Federal Union of Scientists and Engineers] is subject to PARS, as is every other FUSE unit member. In order to generate critical elements and standards that reflect the duties of an individual who is President of FUSE and thus allowing him/her to be rated regardless of the amount of time that he/she devotes to union work, the position description (PD) of the president of FUSE will be amended to include the statement "this individual performs the duties of the president of NAGE R1-144." This statement will be removed from the PD when he/she is replaced as president of FUSE.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Proposal 2</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to remove any real or perceived prejudices against the president of FUSE, the PARS critical elements and standards pertaining to the duties of the president of FUSE will be written and evaluated by a neutral source selected from either the Federal Labor Relations Authority, a FMCS Mediator, or an Arbitrator who is selected from the American Arbitration Association listing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Proposal 3</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The president of FUSE is eligible for the performance awards that are attached to PARS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;For the purpose of PARS, the president of FUSE will be grouped with code 00 organizational pool.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;In order to remove any real or perceived prejudices against the president of FUSE, a monetary payout to the president of FUSE is established as follows</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;For a PARS rating of level 5, no less than 2% of salary.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;For a PARS rating of level 4, the arithmetic [sic] average of all level 4 ratings payouts in the organizational pool and no less than the highest payout of any level 3 rating.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;For a PARS rating of level 3, the arithmetic [sic] average of all level 3 rating payouts in the organizational pool.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr.</span> the proposals were nonnegotiable, 42 FLRA at 1290-94:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute defines conditions of employment as "personnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions[.]" Excluded from the definition of conditions of employment, among other things, are matters "relating to the classification of any position[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14)(B). In determining whether a proposal concerns a condition of employment, the Authority examines: (1) whether the matter proposed to be bargained pertains to bargaining unit employees; and (2) the nature and extent of the effect of the matter proposed to be bargained on working conditions of those employees<span class="Italic">. Antilles</span>, 22 FLRA at 236-37.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that, under <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, the four proposals do not concern conditions of employment because, among other things, "there is no requirement that the individual elected president of the [U]nion be a bargaining unit member, or for that matter, an employee of the [A]gency."... The Union does not dispute the Agency's statement. The Union asserts, however, that "the bylaws of the [U]nion allows [sic] any bargaining unit employee in good standing to seek an elected office in the [U]nion."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">From our reading of the proposals and the record as a whole, it is apparent that the Union intends the proposals to apply only insofar as the Union's president is a bargaining unit employee.... We find, therefore, that the proposals would have effect only if the Union president is a Government employee who occupies a position in the bargaining unit and we will address the proposals in that context.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals 1, 2, and 3 address position descriptions, performance plans, and performance awards for the Union president. Contrary to the Agency's claim, there is no basis on which to conclude that these matters relate to internal Union business. Moreover, it is clear that these matters relate to working conditions, as required by section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute. Accordingly, consistent with our finding that the proposals have effect only insofar as that official is a unit employee, we conclude, based on <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, that Proposals 1, 2, and 3 concern conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Among other things, section 7102 of the Statute provides employees with rights to "form, join, or assist any labor organization[.]" Agencies may not interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of such rights, and may not discourage membership in a labor organization by discrimination in connection with conditions of employment. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although employees are guaranteed certain rights by section 7102 and agencies are prohibited from taking certain actions by section 7116, we have no basis on which to conclude that these sections, independently or together, affect the negotiability of the proposals before us. Put simply, insofar as the Union argues that the proposals are required by, and reflective, of these statutory requirements, we reject the arguments as unfounded. We will not address these arguments further.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(a), the Agency is required to develop systems which provide for appraisals of employees' job performance.... "Job performance" is not statutorily defined. Based on our reading of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 43 and its implementing regulations, however, we conclude that such job performance may not encompass duties and responsibilities performed on official time on behalf of a labor organization. Instead, we find it clear that such job performance is intended to encompass an employee's performance of agency-assigned duties and responsibilities....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, it is undisputed that the Union president has been granted, and uses, 100 percent official time. That is, the Union president spends all of his or her duty time performing Union activities. Such Union duties are not assigned by the Agency....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2 would require the establishment and evaluation of critical elements and performance standards "pertaining to the duties of" the Union president. As the Union president performs Union duties only, and as 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 requires that elements and standards encompass only Agency-assigned duties, we find that the establishment of performance standards and critical elements for the duties encompassed by Proposal <span id="page_1115"></span>2 is inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302. Accordingly, without addressing the Agency's other arguments, we conclude that Proposal 2 is inconsistent with law and is nonnegotiable under section 7117(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 addresses the Union president's position description. In other contexts, proposals relating to unit employees' position descriptions have been held negotiable.... Here, however, Proposal 1 requires the Union president's position description to be revised solely "[i]n order to generate critical elements and standards that...[will] allow[ ] him/her to be rated regardless of the amount of time that he/she devotes to [U]nion work[.]" By its plain terms, Proposal 1 is linked to, and derives meaning from, Proposal 2. As we determined above, Proposal 2 is inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 and, thereby, nonnegotiable under section 7117(a) of the Statute. We conclude, therefore, that as Proposal 1 is linked to Proposal 2, Proposal 1 also is nonnegotiable under section 7117(a) of the Statute because it is inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, with respect to Proposal 3, the Union acknowledges that "[t]he negotiability of this proposal depends on the negotiability of...[P]roposals 1 and 2."... The Union's acknowledgement is consistent with the plain wording of Proposal 3, which references the Union president's PARS ratings, and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, which provides for rewarding employees on the basis of performance appraisals. Proposals 1 and 2 are nonnegotiable under section 7117(a) of the Statute because they are inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302. Accordingly, we conclude that because the negotiability of Proposal 3 is dependent on the negotiability of Proposals 1 and 2, Proposal 3 also is inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 and, therefore, nonnegotiable under section 7117(a) of the Statute.</p>

[Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-615.html#sec6-616">Factors Beyond Control of Employee</a>," concerning adjustments for factors beyond employees' control in the context of performance standards and appraisals.]</p>

The proposal did not require the agency to evaluate the employee based on union representation responsibilities:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 and its implementing regulations, 5 C.F.R. part 430 (part 430), job performance may not encompass duties and responsibilities performed on official time on behalf of a labor organization, but, instead, is intended to encompass an employee's performance of agency-assigned duties and responsibilities. In particular, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, as interpreted and applied by the Authority, critical elements and performance standards encompass only agency assigned duties and responsibilities<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, office of Hearings and Appeals and American Federation of Government Employees, Council 215</span>, 48 FLRA 357, 364 (1993) (quoting <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Federal Union of Scientists and Engineers, Local R14-144 and U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Underwater Systems Center, Newport, Rhode Island</span>, 42 FLRA 1285, 1293 (1991)). The issue here is whether the minimum appraisal period for Union representatives established by the disputed provision is inconsistent with part 430.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;5 C.F.R. Part 430 Does Not Preclude an Agency from Providing Virtually Full-Time Union Representatives with a Performance Appraisal</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Part 430 requires that an agency performance program specify a minimum performance period before a rating can be prepared.&#x2003;However, as the Agency acknowledges, the regulations applicable here do not prescribe the length of such a period<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 430.206(a), 5 C.F.R. 207(a). Consequently, under part 430, agencies have discretion as to the length of a minimum appraisal period.[10]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;Prior to 1995, OPM regulations prescribed a minimum appraisal period of not less than 90 days or not more than 120 days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.205(b) (1994)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Hawaii Federal Employees Metal Trades Council, AFL-CIO and U.S. Department of the Navy, Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii</span>, 34 FLRA 873, 875-76 (1990).

See National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 52 FLRA 1265, 1274-75 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a Government-wide regulation provides an agency with discretion over a particular matter, and the exercise of that discretion is not sole and exclusive to the agency, a proposal prescribing how that discretion is to be exercised, within the limits granted by the discretion, is not inconsistent with that regulation<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees, National Border Patrol Council and U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service</span>, 51 FLRA 1308, 1335 (1996); <span class="Italic">International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 128 and U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation</span>, 39 FLRA 1500, 1526 (1991); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, National Border Patrol Council and Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service</span>, 23 FLRA 146, 148-49 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's arguments with respect to the meaning and intent of part 430 do not demonstrate that the provision is inconsistent with that regulation. In arguing that part 430 is intended to preclude the appraisal of union representatives who spend a significant portion of their time on representational duties, the Agency cites OPM's comments on the revisions to part 430, which state as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Under performance appraisal provisions in part 430, the performance to be planned, monitored, and rated covers the work, duties, and responsibilities that accomplish the agency mission and for which the employee is accountable to the employing organization. When an employee is serving as the representative of a labor organization, he or she is performing duties for that labor organization. To intermingle performance of the representational duties into the appraisal program would be inappropriate because appraisal of the employee's performance must be based solely upon the employee's performance of agency duties. For employees who spend 100 percent of their time as labor representatives, and for employees who spend a significant amount of time as determined by the agency, this means that they cannot, and should not, be given performance appraisal ratings of record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">60 Fed.&#x2003;Reg. 43,937 (1995). The Agency interprets OPM's comments as limiting the Agency's discretion with respect to the appraisal of union representatives who do not spend a significant amount of time performing agency work. The Agency argues that the provision at issue herein, by permitting an appraisal based on 120 hours or less of agency work, is inconsistent with OPM's intent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has relied on OPM's explanatory comments to interpret the intent of part 430<span class="Italic">. See Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 52 FLRA at 1274-75 (OPM's comments indicate that performance appraisals must be based on the performance of agency duties and responsibilities). However, the Agency's argument misses the point of the comments quoted above. Specifically, OPM states that agencies must decide whether the amount of time spent by an employee on union activities is "significant." No basis is established for finding that the Agency lacks discretion under part 430 to determine that an employee is spending a "significant amount of time" as a labor representative if the employee performs agency work for at least 120 hours per evaluation year. This discretion is consistent with the fact, noted above, that part 430 does not prescribe a specific minimum appraisal period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Requiring the Agency to Negotiate a Different Minimum Appraisal Period for Virtually Full-Time Union Representatives Does Not Conflict with 5 C.F.R. Part 430</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's claim that, under part 430, the provision must be consistent with the 60-day minimum appraisal period established pursuant to the Agency's system, and approved by OPM, is based on a misinterpretation of part 430. Part 430 distinguishes between a performance appraisal system, which must be approved by OPM, <span class="Italic">see</span> nn.5 and 6, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and performance appraisal programs, which do not need such approval, <span class="Italic">see</span> n.5, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Part 430 permits the development of separate appraisal programs within the same appraisal system. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 430.204(a), 205(c). Each agency appraisal program must specify the minimum appraisal period, <span class="Italic">see</span> n.9, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appraisal programs must "conform to statute, the regulations [set forth in 5 C.F.R. part 430], and the requirements established by the appraisal system." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.204(b)(5). The Agency has not demonstrated that the provision: (1) is inconsistent with any statute; (2) is inconsistent with OPM regulations; or (3) fails to conform to the requirements of the applicable appraisal system. Specifically, the Agency cites no law with which the provision is inconsistent. As to OPM regulations, the fact that the provision may, in effect, create an additional appraisal period that varies from the current Agency appraisal program does not, in and of itself, make it inconsistent with the requirements of part 430 governing such programs. Nothing in part 430 requires uniformity of procedures or requirements between all agency appraisal programs. Finally, the Agency cites no provision of its appraisal system that requires such uniformity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency's assertion that the provision is inconsistent with the 60-day minimum appraisal period prescribed in the Agency's appraisal program is tantamount to a claim that the provision is barred from negotiation by an agency regulation<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 29 and U.S. Army Engineer District, Kansas City, Mo.</span>, 21 FLRA 298 (1986) (claim that proposal conflicted with performance appraisal system resolved as claim of conflict with agency regulation). Under section 7117(b) of the Statute, an agency regulation does not bar negotiation on an otherwise negotiable provision unless the agency can <span id="page_1116"></span>demonstrate a compelling need for the regulation under section 2424.11 of the Authority's Regulations. The Agency has not demonstrated or even asserted that a compelling need exists for its performance appraisal program<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees, Locals 3807 and 3824 and U.S. Department of Energy, Western Area Power Administration, Golden, Colorado</span>, 55 FLRA 1, 3 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Agency has discretion, in establishing performance appraisal programs under part 430, to determine the minimum length of an appraisal period, as long as that appraisal period is consistent with law, regulation, and the Agency's own appraisal system. Because a minimum appraisal period of 120 hours, as set forth in the provision, is consistent with law and regulation, and is not barred by the Agency's appraisal program, the provision is within the Agency's discretion under part 430. Accordingly, we find that the provision is not inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. part 430.</p>
