<h2 class="h2" id="sec18-3"><span class="space">II.</span> FORMS</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">Some readers asked for forms. You know who you are. The author generally disapproves of forms, but generally approves of readers, tolerates clients, and likes cats. Bowing to demand, forms were created concerning an adverse action involving the Federal Cat Commission and one of its employees. No magic words substitute for the analysis and careful writing required in litigation. No good lawyer relies on the work product of another lawyer developed for a different case. He may glance at it, but he will not rely on it. Why, then, do lawyers use forms? Some lawyers use them as references, to ensure that in their own drafting they have not omitted some essential element of a commercial document, release of claims, or conveyance. Other lawyers use them because they do not care to take the time to think through a transaction and develop their own paperwork; or there may be no time and a form is convenient. But it should be understood that a form may appear in a lawyers' formbook because the document, when used in a case, was sufficiently unclear that it became the subject of litigation and judicial interpretation. At best, a form is an aid, never a substitute. If used, a form must be tailored to the circumstances of a case. No form, and no number of them, will encompass a particular case. The forms included in this chapter are bare suggestions on the approach to a particular problem, for example, the preparation of a petition for review, or a notice of deposition. These forms are of the author's creation; they are not instruments of the Board and they should not be copied with (or without) changes reflecting names or dates. The names and events are fictitious. Any verisimilitude is accidental. Captions and signature lines are shortened to conserve space. The Board publishes a few forms of its own, including forms for an initial appeal, and a designation of representative, at <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/forms.htm">https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/forms.htm</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The following forms are presented for drafting guidance:</p>

<p class="Body-Text">APPELLANT, by counsel, appeals to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">1.</span> The appellant is Jenny Any Dots, P.O. Box 3423, Arlington, VA 22203, (703) 555-0000. The Federal Cat Commission is the respondent agency, located at 1200 Purr Way, Annapolis, Maryland.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">2.</span> The action taken is a 42-day suspension effective December 25, 2022, for misuse of a government vehicle and for misrepresentation of her status as an Agency official to police who investigated an accident involving the car.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">3.</span> A hearing is requested.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">4.</span> The action is improper: (1) the accident was not appellant's fault, and she did not misrepresent her status as a government employee; (2) the action is unsupported by a preponderance of evidence; (3) the penalty is unreasonable; (4) the penalty has been applied disparately; (5) the action does not enhance service efficiency; (6) there is insufficient nexus to support the action; (7) appellant has been discriminated against on the basis of a disabling condition, alcoholism: the car accident involving the GOV was not a result of her drinking, and Respondent failed to accommodate that condition by imposing a suspension rather than permitting Appellant to enter into a rehabilitation program.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">5.</span> Back pay, compensatory damages, and counsel fees are requested as remedies.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">6.</span> The name and address of appellant's counsel are noted below.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">7.</span> Neither the appellant nor anyone acting on her behalf has filed a grievance or complaint with any agency concerning the subject matter of this appeal. The decision notice is attached.</p>

<p class="Body-Text-ch">ACKNOWLEDGMENT ORDER</p>
<p class="Body-Text">This office has received the appellant's petition for appeal. A copy of the appeal is being sent to the agency with this Order. I am the administrative judge assigned to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">I ORDER the parties to follow the procedures set out in the separate notices below. If any party fails to follow my orders or the Board's regulations, I may impose sanctions pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43. If either party has a question regarding any aspect of the case processing instructions set forth in this order, he or she may seek clarification from me at the phone number listed at the end of this order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch1">NOTICE TO APPELLANT</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If your appeal is timely filed, and within the Board's jurisdiction, you have the right to a hearing on the merits of your case. If you requested a hearing, I will schedule a hearing for you. If you did not request a hearing, you have 10 calendar days from the date of this Order to file a written request for one. If you do not request a hearing, you waive your right to one. In that event, you and the agency will be given an opportunity to make written submissions before the record on your appeal closes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch">TIMELINESS</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Generally, you must file an appeal with the Board no later than 30 calendar days after the effective date, if any, of the action you are challenging, or 30 days after the date you receive the agency's decision, whichever is later. The date your appeal is postmarked is ordinarily considered the date of filing. If you personally deliver your appeal to the regional office, the date of filing is the date of receipt. If you file by facsimile, the date of filing is the date of the facsimile. Because your appeal appears to have been filed after the time limit, it may be untimely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You have the burden of proof on the issue of timeliness. Accordingly, I ORDER you to file evidence and argument showing that your appeal was timely filed or that good cause existed for the delay. Your submission must be filed within 15 calendar days of the date of this Order. The agency may file a response on this issue within 25 calendar days of the date of this Order. Unless I notify you to the contrary, the record on this issue will close on that date. No evidence or argument on the timeliness issue filed after the close of record will be accepted unless you show that it is new and material evidence that was unavailable before the record closed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch2">DESIGNATION OF REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You may name a representative. If you already have a representative, you must fill out the enclosed "Designation of Representative" form and file it with the Board and with the agency within 10 calendar days of the date of this Order unless you have included your representative's name, address, telephone number, and signature in your appeal. If your representative has filed the appeal for you and you have not personally signed the appeal or submitted a signed "Designation of Representative" form, you also must file a signed "Designation of Representative Form" with the Board and with the agency within 10 calendar days of the date of this Order. If you name a representative after receiving this Order, fill out the enclosed "Designation of Representative" form and file it with the Board and the agency immediately after obtaining your representative.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You must immediately notify the Board and the agency in writing of any changes in the name, address, or telephone number of your designated representative.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If you register as an e-filer (see information below), you can use electronic filing to file a Designation of Representative, or to notify the Board of a change in contact information.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch">DISCOVERY</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Discovery is the procedure you may use to learn of any facts, documents, or other evidence the agency has that may be helpful to your case. If you wish to engage in discovery, initial requests or motions must be filed within 30 calendar days of the date of this Order. Responses to initial discovery requests must be filed promptly but no later than 20 days after the date of service of the other party's discovery request or the MSPB order. Unless you are filing a motion to compel, you must not submit your discovery requests and responses to the Board. If you do, they will be rejected and returned to you. The procedures used for discovery are at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.71-.85.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is the policy of the Board to decide an appeal within 120 calendar days of receipt. The Board expects all parties to assist in the expeditious processing of this case by honoring requests for relevant documents and producing material witnesses without additional Board intervention.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch">RESPONSE TO MOTIONS</p>
<p class="Body-Text">You may file a response or objection to any motion filed by the agency. Unless otherwise specified by me or the Board's regulations, your response or objection must be filed with this office and served upon the agency within 10 calendar days of the date that appears on the agency's certificate of service. I will reject any untimely response or objection unless you show good cause for the delay in filing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch">GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS</p>
<p class="Body-Text">FILING PLEADINGS WITH THE MSPB</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A "pleading" is any written submission setting out claims, allegations, arguments, or evidence. Pleadings include briefs, motions, petitions, attachments, and responses. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(b). Pleadings can be filed via postal mail, facsimile (fax), personal or commercial delivery, or in electronic format via e-Appeal Online (<a href="https://e-appeal.mspb.gov/">https://e-appeal.mspb.gov/</a>). Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.26, all pleadings filed with the Board must meet the following requirements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;All pleadings must be legible and either printed on 8'/2 by 11 inch paper, or formatted so that they will print on 81/2 by 11 inch paper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;All pleadings must be filed by the date set by me or the Board's regulations. The date of filing is the date your submission is postmarked, faxed, the date of electronic submission if you e-file, or the date of receipt if you personally deliver it to the Board's regional office. Extensions of filing dates will' only be granted if requested in writing and if good cause is shown. A continuance of the hearing date will be granted only if requested in writing in accordance <span id="Page_5419"></span>with the Board's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.51(e), which requires an affidavit or sworn statement, and if you are able to show extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;All pleadings must be served upon opposing parties and their representatives, must be accompanied by a certificate of service stating (a) the names and addresses of the parties served; (b) the manner of service (personally delivered, mailed, faxed, or electronic delivery); and (c) the date of service. A certificate of service is attached to this Order and lists the names and addresses of the parties who must be served in this case. The attached certificate of service constitutes a model which you may follow in preparing your own certificate of service. The Board may reject a submission that does not have a certificate of service. If you register as an e-filer, a certificate of service will be prepared automatically as part of the pleading you file online.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pleadings Submitted in Hardcopy</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">When a pleading submitted by postal mail, fax, personal or commercial delivery includes three or more documentary attachments, the attachments should be "tabbed." A "tab" is a dividing page, a portion of which extends beyond the normal 8 1/2 inch width of the paper, and which contains a description or label. When such a pleading is submitted via fax, each page of the attachments should be sequentially numbered and the attachments should be preceded by a table of contents describing each attachment and indicating the page on which it starts. Special instructions for preparing the Agency's response to the appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.25 are included below.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">All documents within a tab must have new page numbers (by hand if necessary) so that each document, within each tab, is re-numbered, from the first page of the first document to the last page of the last document. This will allow for specific page references to the record, by tab and by page number within a tab. The new page numbers should be placed in the bottom right-hand margin of each page. If some pages within a tab are already numbered in the bottom-right margin, parties should place the new page numbers just to the right of the original page numbers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pleadings Submitted via e-Appeal Online</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Electronic bookmarks and tables of contents take the place of physical "Tabs" in pleadings filed by traditional means. When an e-filed pleading contains three or more electronic supporting documents, each attachment must be identified, either by filling out the table for such attachments at e-Appeal Online, or by uploading the supporting documents in the form of one or more PDF files in which each attachment is bookmarked. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(g)(3).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Regardless of whether it is uploaded or entered online, each pleading will be assembled into a single PDF document, which will include all electronic attachments, and will contain sequential page numbers. E-filers need not manually paginate their pleadings and attachments.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Pleadings are subject to a 20 megabyte size limit. To avoid exceeding this limit, e-filers are encouraged to scan documents in black and white and to adjust settings to limit file size. If what would otherwise be a single pleading must be broken into multiple pleadings because of the size limit, each should contain the same descriptive title, together with a "Part" designation in parentheses, e.g., Agency File (Part A), Agency File (Part B), etc.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For more information about e-filing, read the Board's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14, or visit e-Appeal Online (<a href="https://e-appeal.mspb.gov/">https://e-appeal.mspb.gov/</a>) and click the link entitled "How does Electronic Filing Work?"</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch">REGULATIONS</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For more detailed information on these procedures, you should refer to the Board's regulations in 5 C.F.R. Part 1201. The regulations are available for review in agency personnel offices, law libraries, some large public libraries, and at the Board's website <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/">http://www.mspb.gov</a>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch1">NOTICE TO AGENCY/INTERVENOR</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">AGENCY RESPONSE</p>
<p class="Body-Text">I ORDER the agency to read, comply with, and/or respond to any and all portions of the "Notice to Appellant" which are applicable to it. I also ORDER the agency to serve me, appellant, and appellant's representative (if applicable), with the material listed on the enclosed schedule and any other information required by 5<span class="Italic"></span> C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.25 within 25 calendar days of the date of this Order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch2">DESIGNATION OF REPRESENTATIVE</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency must designate a representative. I ORDER the agency to file the name, address, and telephone number of the person authorized to act for the agency on the enclosed "Designation of Representative" form within 25 calendar days of the date of this Order. The representative must have authority to settle this appeal or be able to directly reach someone with that authority on short notice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch1">NOTICE TO THE PARTIES</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch">SETTLEMENT</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board strongly encourages the settlement of the appeals that come before it. Even where discussions between the parties do not result in settlement, they often help to define the issues and assist the parties in agreeing to stipulations. I therefore urge the parties to contact each other to discuss the possibility of settlement as early in this proceeding as possible. I am available to assist in the discussions. The parties should discuss concrete, specific settlement proposals unless either party concludes in good faith that no compromise of any kind is possible. They must also be prepared to discuss with me the status of any settlement discussions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(12) (the administrative judge is authorized to "[h]old prehearing conferences for the settlement and simplification of issues").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the parties agree to settle this appeal, and to enter the agreement into the record, the Board will retain the authority to enforce its terms if the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. However, if they do not enter the agreement into the record, or if jurisdiction has not been determined, the Board will have no authority to enforce the agreement.</p>

Therefore, should the agency and the appellant jointly agree that additional time is necessary to pursue discovery or settlement, additional time may be granted at the discretion of the presiding administrative judge for a period up to 30 days, and case processing will be SUSPENDED. In lieu of participating in a joint request, either party may submit a unilateral request for additional time of up to 30 days to pursue discovery. Such unilateral requests may be granted for good cause shown at the discretion of the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A request that the adjudication of this appeal be suspended must be filed with the administrative judge within 45 days of the date of this order (or within 7 days of the appellant's receipt of the agency file, whichever date is later). An untimely request may be granted at the discretion of the judge. No case may be suspended for more than a total of 30 days under these procedures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should the parties contact the administrative judge during the period of suspension for assistance relative to discovery or settlement, and if the administrative judge's involvement is likely to be extensive, the judge will notify the parties that it will be necessary to take the case off suspension and return it to standard processing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch2">ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), in an effort to provide alternatives to the regulatory adjudication process, offers the parties to the appeals brought to the Board several dispute resolution options. This notice will familiarize you with those possibilities so that you can consider them and discuss them with the Administrative Judge before you decide how to proceed. All options are cost free. Settling your case with the assistance of the professional who will guide the parties through the process offers your best chance of reaching a resolution of the appeal that benefits both parties. Accordingly, the MSPB urges you to be open to the possibility of such a resolution at all times.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch2">THE MEDIATION APPEALS PROGRAM</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Mediation Appeals Program (MAP) is a voluntary, confidential process in which the parties meet with a trained mediator in a non-litigious, non-adversarial setting. Even more than the other settlement options available, MAP encourages the parties to approach settlement with an open mind and to consider possible resolutions that may not mirror a potential outcome of the adjudication process. Both parties must agree to mediation, and the MSPB must concur that it could be beneficial, given the circumstances of the case and of the parties. Because the appeal will be outside the normal adjudication process while it is in MAP, your agreement to mediate requires that you be ready to proceed to mediation without delay, and that you be willing to finalize any settlement you may reach expeditiously. Cases should normally not spend more than 30 days in the program.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The mediator will meet with the parties and facilitate discussions between them in an effort to find common grounds on which to resolve the appeal. In some circumstances, mediations may be done by video-conference or by telephone, but they are usually done in person. If the efforts to resolve the appeal do not result in a settlement, the mediator will have no input into the adjudication of the appeal. Nonetheless, the parties are likely to return to adjudication with a better understanding of what is important to them and to the other party, which often helps them reach a settlement during the adjudicatory process. A brochure that further explains MAP is enclosed for your review or is available on-line at <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/files/Mediation_Appeals_Program.pdf">https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/files/Mediation_Appeals_Program.pdf</a>. If you have other questions specific to the mediation option, in addition to discussing them with the Administrative Judge, you may call the MAP Regional Operations Coordinator at (202) 653-6772, ext. 4509, or email at <a href="mailto:regionaloperations@mspb.gov">regionaloperations@mspb.gov.</a></p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch2">THE SETTLEMENT JUDGE PROGRAM</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A Settlement Judge is an Administrative Judge like the one assigned to your appeal, but he or she is assigned specifically and solely to discuss settlement options with the parties. Like the Administrative Judge assigned to your appeal, a Settlement Judge is skilled at evaluating the parties' positions and offering sound advice on the strengths and weaknesses of each party's position. A Settlement Judge plays no part in the processes and procedures through which an appeal goes during the course of the traditional adjudication process, and has no input into the decision if the appeal does not settle. For this reason, some parties feel more open to frank discussion of their appeals and their settlement goals with a Settlement Judge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unlike MAP, both parties do not have to request the services of a Settlement Judge. However, there must be a genuine willingness by both parties to explore settlement before one will be appointed. Accordingly, if, after initial settlement discussions between the parties and with the assigned Administrative Judge, a party believes the assignment of a Settlement Judge would be useful, a request may be made to the Administrative Judge or the Regional Director. If the Regional Director or Chief Administrative Judge concurs, a Settlement Judge will be assigned.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch"><span id="Page_5423"></span>THE MSPB SETTLEMENT PROGRAM</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Administrative Judge assigned to decide your appeal will explore the possibility of settlement with the parties to almost all appeals. Thus, you need not make any election if this is the option you prefer. Through the documents filed by the parties and the evidence submitted, the Administrative Judge becomes thoroughly familiar with the case and is in the best position to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the appeal, as well as to evaluate not just the likelihood of success but also the validity of settlement offers made by the parties, and to suggest proposals for their consideration. Administrative Judges often spend considerable time working with the parties to help them craft mutually beneficial settlements in lieu of adjudication, in which it is more likely that there will be a "winning" and a "losing" side. Any settlement discussions with the Administrative Judge, however, have no effect on the ultimate outcome of the appeal if the case does not settle.</p>

<p class="Body-Text-c"><span id="Page_5424"></span>JENNY ANY DOTS,</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">Appellant,</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">vs.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">FEDERAL CAT COMMISSION,</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">Agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch2">No. 00000000</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch">AGENCY RESPONSE TO APPEAL</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Appellant was suspended for 42 days for misconduct, following notice of the proposal by the Agency to suspend her and following submission by her of an oral as well as a written reply, for misconduct characterized in one charge of conduct unbecoming a Federal Cat Litter Inspector during an off-duty traffic accident and one charge of misuse of a government vehicle arising from the same incident.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Agency, the Federal Cat Commission, is charged by law with the nationwide responsibility for ensuring the adequacy and safety of veterinary healthcare facilities, cat food manufacturing establishments, and manufacturers or suppliers of commercial cat litter. The Appellant is a Federal Cat Litter Inspector, and in that position she is responsible for traveling to and inspecting cat litter manufacturing and packaging plants throughout her region. She has the authority to issue correction orders and penalties relative to substandard manufacturing and distribution facilities and practices. In the case of emergency conditions, she has the authority to abate the objectionable condition by immediately shutting down plant operations pending further review and correction of the cited condition.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Appellant performs her work with substantial independence and discretion. She works from her home office, is assigned a government vehicle for official use only, and is permitted to maintain that vehicle at her home. She communicates with her supervisors and other officials within the Agency through email, telephone, and by periodic visits to the regional or central offices of the Commission.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On Monday, October 24, 2022, the Appellant requested to take sick leave because she had been injured on Sunday, October 23, while off-duty in vehicular collision involving her personal vehicle. Appellant's ankle was broken as a result of that accident. Sick leave was immediately granted for a period of three weeks based on the Appellant's report of the extent of her injury and her promise of confirming medical reports. On November 17, 2022, the Agency motor pool chief received a call from the local police stating that the government vehicle assigned to the Appellant for official use had been damaged that morning and was being towed. Further investigation by the Agency, as confirmed by police reports, showed that the vehicle was damaged in an intersectional collision while the Appellant was driving. The police issued a citation to the Appellant as a result of that incident for reckless driving. At the time of the accident, the Appellant was on sick leave and had no official responsibilities and no valid basis for using the government vehicle. Investigation by the police reflected that at the time they responded to the accident, the Appellant misrepresented herself as being on official government business at the time of the accident and that at that time she requested that she not be cited by the police as result of her status as a government inspector.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Intentional misuse of the government vehicle requires a minimum statutory suspension of 30 days, under 31 USC 1349(b), and to that minimum mandatory suspension was added by the agency an additional 12 days to the suspension as a result of misrepresentation by the Appellant of her official status to the police officers investigating the auto accident that occurred while she was off duty. The Agency had ample grounds to remove the Appellant and acted with leniency by suspending her.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In her appeal and in her oral and written replies, the Appellant maintains that she was justified in using the government vehicle because her personal vehicle had been damaged, it was unusable, and because she did not have sufficient income to rent a car until her damaged car was repaired and she was reimbursed for those repairs by her insurance company. The Appellant maintains that she did not misrepresent her status as a government official when she was questioned by the police following the accident with the government vehicle. She stated in her replies, contrary to the police reports, that the police officers made a mistake when they saw her government identification in her wallet when the Appellant was trying to find her drivers license and incorrectly concluded that the Appellant was attempting to demonstrate that she was on official government business by a display of her government credentials. She also raised the defense of disability discrimination based on alcoholism.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Appellant's misrepresentation of her duty status is verified by the written reports of two police officers with no motive for misstating the facts. Whatever the justification that may be offered by the Appellant for personal use of the government vehicle entrusted to her for official use, the governing statute requires a suspension if a government vehicle is used for unofficial reasons. The Agency has no discretion. The statutory penalty is mandatory. As to the additional suspension, statements by the two police officers who interviewed the Appellant at the scene of the accident involving the government vehicle state unequivocally that the Appellant not only displayed her government credentials but also said that she was on official government business and that she should not be cited for reckless driving by reason of her official status. Misrepresentation by the Appellant is particularly significant because the Agency as well as industry officials rely on her integrity as a government official in the course of industry regulation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Appellant's suggestion in her appeal that there is no nexus between her off-duty conduct and the adverse action taken against her as a government employee completely ignores the fact that she was using government property while she was off duty and misrepresented her government position during the course of the accident involving Agency property. As to disability, the Agency has no obligation to accommodate by forebearance of discipline against an individual who drinks, drives, and becomes involved in an accident.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To summarize: the Appellant's use of the GOV was not for official use. The suspension for vehicle misuse for one month was mandatory under 31 USC 1344, 1349(b). The additional suspension of 12 days was warranted for misrepresentation by the Appellant of her official status to police during the off-duty traffic accident. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Majette v. USPS</span>, 16 MSPR 419 (1983) (sustaining removal for, among other things, an employee's misrepresentation of his duty-status during an arrest for an off-duty incident).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The action by the Agency should be sustained.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">I.&#x2003;&#x2003;MOTION</p>
<p class="Body-Text">I move that the MSPB enforce the subpoena against the Annapolis Police Department in U.S. District Court and stay all hearings in this case until the enforcement proceedings have been completed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">II.&#x2003;&#x2003;BASIS OF MOTION</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Pursuant to 28 USC 1746 and under penalty of perjury, the undersigned certifies that, as to service, the subpoena issued in this case was served, certified mail, March 3, 2023, seeking appellant's official police records. A copy of the certified receipt is attached to this letter. The return date for the subpoena was March 25. No response has been received. If, during enforcement proceedings in court, my presence as a witness or an affidavit is needed, kindly advise me and I shall appear or provide an affidavit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board described its subpoena enforcement procedure in <span class="Italic">Porter v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 301, 6 MSPB 257 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because subpoenas are issued for the benefit of the requesting party, when a subpoena is not honored the requesting party must indicate in a motion for enforcement that it considers the witness's testimony to be of sufficient importance to the case to warrant invoking the authority of a United States district court. It is incumbent on the party to inform the Board that it considers the testimony necessary to its case. It is logical that all information initially sought by a party will not necessarily prove important in the final analysis. Proffered testimony which initially appears important upon issuance of a subpoena may prove to be irrelevant or duplicative as other information is developed. The party who sought the subpoena is in a unique position to decide whether it would be productive to move for compliance. In the absence of such motion, the presiding official would reasonably conclude the party did not view the testimony of the witness of sufficient importance to warrant a Board request for enforcement. Should there be no request for enforcement, it is proper for the presiding official to proceed with the hearing in the absence of the witness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The undersigned has determined that the information sought by the subpoena is essential to the fair presentation of this case and to the pursuit of discovery and presentation of evidence at the hearing. The subpoena was requested because the Police Department maintains records pertaining to the accident leading to the adverse action charges against appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The basis for the subpoena was stated with greater particularity in the motion leading to its issuance, incorporated by reference in this motion for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It makes no sense to proceed with a hearing until the Board has enforced the subpoena and discovery has been completed; accordingly it is moved that the hearing be continued pending the outcome of enforcement proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">III.&#x2003;&#x2003;CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board should enforce the subpoena and continue the hearing pending enforcement and completion of discovery.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">I.&#x00A0;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;FACTS AND ISSUES</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;THE FACTS</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ms. Dots, a 36-year employee of the Cat Commission, has a previously unblemished record. Her 20 outstanding performance appraisals over the past 20 years, coupled with scores of performance, Special Act, and other awards, contributions to technical publications, and numerous unsolicited commendations from manufacturers and distributors whose businesses are regulated by the Commission, bespeak an employee with an exemplary record and a long history of dedicated and successful service to the Commission.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a result of Agency efforts to improve productivity and reduce travel costs, it has allowed inspectors to work from their homes and to keep at their homes clearly identified government vehicles to be used for official travel--for Ms. Dots, travel from her home to facilities of the industry regulated by the Agency in Region 5. Travel in the GOV is recorded in a log and the log is photocopied and periodically provided to the Agency. Ms. Dots also keeps at her home a personal vehicle, a 2010 Toyota Corolla, which she uses for personal travel.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On October 23, 2022, while she was driving back from the grocery store in the early evening, an intoxicated driver shot through a red light and struck Dots' Corolla on the left side at the driver's door. The impact pushed the Corolla twenty feet. If there is anything fortunate about the incident, Ms. Dots seven-year old daughter, Guenevire, was at home and not in the car. Although airbags softened the impact of the crash, Ms. Dots left ankle was broken and she was bruised and disoriented as a result of the accident. Two local police arrived within minutes of the accident and, arresting the drunk and arranging for his transportation to the police station, immediately attended to Ms. Dots, trying to determine the extent of her injuries, which required her transport to a hospital and emergency room care while her ankle was examined, x-rayed, and placed into a cast.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The accident of October 23 destroyed Appellant's personal vehicle and resulted in Ms. Dots taking sick leave starting October 24, with approval for at least three weeks of leave from the date of the accident for rest and treatment of her fractured ankle. During this time, Ms. Dots was on medication to reduce her pain and to permit her to sleep. And during this time, Ms. Dots, who is a single parent, was responsible for the care of seven-year old Guenevire. Dots was fortunate in that a neighbor was able to drive Ms. Dots to local stores to go shopping and to take care of routine matters that required auto transportation. During this period, however, Dots became depressed about the accident, the sick leave that she had to take, and she began to drink wine, beer, and spirits, first moderately and then less moderately. This was the first that she had used alcohol since her marriage broke up five years ago and when her use of alcohol had increased to the point where she had been diagnosed as alcohol-dependent and was treated in an in-patient and out-patient program and which led to her attendance for a period of several years, at AA meetings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On the afternoon of November 17, 2022, Ms. Dots called her neighbor to get a ride because Guenevire was running a high fever and her pediatrician had phoned a prescription into a local pharmacy. The neighbor was not in and Dots could not reach another neighbor to get a ride. The daughter's fever was persistent and Dots decided that she could not wait for the arrival of a neighbor. Dots took the GOV and left to get the medication from the pharmacy, which was a mile away. It had been raining, and it was at about the freezing level outside. The combination of a lot of leaves on the road, rain, and freezing temperatures led to slick road surfaces. Dots had been drinking before she went to the pharmacy. While turning into the pharmacy from the highway, Dots was going more quickly than she had intended, used the brakes, and put the car into a skid. The car she was driving hit another vehicle passing in the opposite direction of the highway. The cars were both damaged, although there were no injuries. Police arrived within a few minutes. Dots was very upset about the accident, her judgment was somewhat impaired by the combination of alcohol and painkillers she had been taking. The police, after speaking with her, detained her under suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. Dots was taken to the local hospital emergency room to be check for injuries and then to the police station. The GOV she had driven was damaged to the extent that the fender of the car had been pushed into the left front tire, making the car unusable until the fender was pried away from the tire.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">During their interview of her, the police officers asked Dots for identification and she showed them her driver's license and her government identification. Dots told the officer that her young child was at home and asked the officer to call the an elderly next door neighbor, who had a key to the house and look after Guenevire, while Dots called the child on the cellphone and tried to calmly explain what had happened. The officer, then noticing the government plates on the car, asked Dots whether it was a government car, and Dots told him it was. In response to the officer's question, she gave him her supervisor's telephone number because the officer said the GOV would have to be towed to the police lot until it could be collected for repair and the police officer wanted to inform someone of the location of the car while Dots was being taken to the police station.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;THE ISSUES</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Dots has been suspended for misuse of a government vehicle and for improperly representing her official status to the police during the accident of November 17. The issues are:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">1.</span> Can the Agency demonstrate by preponderant evidence and as a matter of law that Dots misused a GOV under the circumstances?</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">2.</span> Can the Agency demonstrate by preponderant evidence that Dots misrepresented her status to the police officers?</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">3.</span> Is there a nexus, or connection, between the off-duty accident on November 16 and disciplinary action against Dots?</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">4.</span> Should the Agency accommodate Dots' disability of alcoholism by allowing her a period of rehabilitation and forbearance from discipline pending the successful outcome of that rehabilitation?</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">5.</span> Is the disciplinary action unreasonable under the circumstances?</p>
<p class="Body-Text">II.&#x00A0;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;STIPULATIONS</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are no stipulations.</p>

<p class="Body-Text-c"><span id="Page_5431"></span>SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is agreed by the Federal Cat Commission and Jenny Any Dots that the following constitutes full and complete settlement of the Merit Systems Protection Board appeal she filed in MSPB Case 00000000:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">1.</span> Dots will submit and the Commission will accept her voluntary resignation from the Commission effective June 30, 2023.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">2.</span> The notice of proposed suspension and the decision to suspend are withdrawn and canceled. Dots will be paid backpay under OPM regulations for the period of the suspension. To provide Ms. Dots with a clean record, the Commission will expunge and segregate from her Official Personnel File all documentation relating to the suspension action under appeal, for purposes of responding to inquiries from prospective employers. The Commission also agrees that any inquiries to management from prospective employers with the Commission will be referred to a designated individual other than her former immediate supervisor. The responses to those inquiries will include, to the extent feasible, only the information that appears in the reference letter included as Attachment 1. It is understood that the designated official is not expected to provide any information regarding Dots that is not truthful.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">3.</span> Dots agrees that by this settlement, the Board is authorized to dismiss as settled her MSPB appeal and that her EEO complaint (No. 1111) is withdrawn. Dots agrees to withdraw any and all other EEO claims, grievances, appeals, unfair labor practice charges, administrative or judicial matters currently pending. Dots further agrees, except as to secure enforcement of this Agreement, not to institute any legal or administrative proceedings on issues already raised or that could have been raised prior to the date of this Agreement arising out of or in connection with her employment with the Commission.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">4.</span> Dots agrees that she is responsible for her own counsel fees and all costs she has incurred in this appeal. She and her attorney waive any right to seek those fees or costs from the Commission.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">5.</span> All parties agree that this Agreement does not constitute an admission by the Commission of any violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, or any other federal or state statute or regulation.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">6.</span> The terms of this Agreement will not establish any precedent, nor will the Agreement be used by Dots or any other person to seek or justify similar terms in any subsequent case.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">7.</span> The terms of this Agreement will not be publicized or divulged in any manner, except as necessary for the Commission to administer this Agreement and except to the extent necessary for Dots to resolve her tax or legal obligations with any federal, state, or local agency or court. Dots may disclose the Agreement's terms to her significant other. Upon inquiry the parties may say that the case has been resolved.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">8.</span> This Agreement constitutes the complete understanding of the parties. No other promises or agreements will be binding unless placed in writing and signed by both parties.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">9.</span> Dots acknowledges that she understands all of the provisions of this Agreement and that she enters it voluntarily and with the advice of counsel. The parties desire that this Agreement be accepted into the record by the MSPB for enforcement, and the parties condition the effectiveness of the Agreement upon its acceptance for that purpose by MSPB. Once the Agreement has been accepted by the MSPB, Dots' appeal will be dismissed as settled.</p>

<p class="Body-Text-ch">Letter of Reference</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p class="Body-Text">This is with regard to the employment of Ms. Jenny Any Dots with the Federal Cat Commission.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ms. Dots was employed with the Commission as a Cat Litter Inspector, CS-14, from June 1, 1985, until she resigned on June 30, 2023. Her duties in that capacity included inspection, research, providing advisory memoranda to the public and to agency officials, and preparing responses to congressional inquiries. She performed her work in an exemplary manner.</p>

<p class="Body-Text-c">Agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch2">No. 00000000</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">MOTION FOR COUNSEL FEES</p>
<p class="Body-Text-ch">WITH SUPPORTING MEMORANDUM</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Pursuant to 5 USC 7701(g), Appellant moves for an order directing Respondent to pay counsel fees of $1,568,536.19.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">I.&#x00A0;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The facts of the case are set forth in the Initial Decision by the Administrative Judge and the Board's Final Decision. Essentially, the Agency discriminated against Dots because of disability when it declined to properly accommodate her alcoholism, fired her, and when the dismissal was settled prior to hearing. Dots received substantial benefit from the settlement and is the prevailing party. <span class="Italic">Griffith v. USDA</span>, 96 MSPR 251, 255 &#x00B6; 10 (2004).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">II.&#x00A0;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;Fee Entitlement</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the standards of <span class="Italic">Allen v. USPS</span>, 2 MSPR 420, 433, 2 MSPB 582 (1980), the Agency knew or should have known that it could not prevail on the merits of the case, and that conclusion is supported by the evidence contained in the Appellant's appeal and in the Agency response to the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Reasonableness</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The hourly rate claimed is principally based upon counsel's retainer rate and the rate he charges for comparable work for other clients. The factors demonstrating the reasonableness of that rate, as enumerated in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc.</span>, 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974), are discussed in the accompanying affidavit: time and labor required; novelty and difficulty of questions; skill requisite to perform legal service properly; preclusion of other employment customary fee; time limitations imposed by client or circumstances; amount involved and result obtained; experience, reputation, and ability of counsel; undesirability of the case; nature and length of professional relationship with client; awards in similar cases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Here the case was of considerable complexity, involving the relationship of adverse action and disability discrimination law in an area plagued with conflicting and vague pronouncements by the Board, OPM, and the courts. Counsel was and is highly skilled in these cases. The fee was reduced as an accommodation for a union client who represented an indigent member.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">III.&#x00A0;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;&#x2003;CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fees must be awarded. The fees requested are reasonable. The motion should be granted.</p>

<p class="Body-Text-R">Rat T. Feline</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c"><span id="Page_5434"></span>AFFIDAVIT AND SWORN DECLARATION OF RAT T. FELINE</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Pursuant to 28 USC 1746 and under penalty of perjury, Rat T. Feline states upon his oath that the following information is true to his personal knowledge:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">1.</span> My name is Rat T. Feline.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">2.</span> During these proceedings I have been retained by Ms. Dots.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">3.</span> In support of Appellant's motion for reimbursement of counsel fees and expenses, the following justification and information is offered. This explanation provides information as to my experience, my education, the nature of this case, and the nature of other cases that I have handled, the time spent on this case, and the manner that it was spent.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">4.</span> I am a graduate of Tuna State University in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where I received a BA degree in 1970.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">5.</span> I received a J.D. degree from the High Sierra School of Law in May of 1973. At High Sierra I was a Cat Chow Scholar, selected from competitors of the Twelfth Federal Judicial Circuit.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">6.</span> During the last two years of law school, I clerked with the law firm of Porpoise, Whale and Tuna, with offices in Ocean City, New Jersey. There I assisted in the representation of labor unions and employees in labor-management disputes. Although my formal responsibility was to provide advice to senior lawyers of the firm, I became actively engaged in arbitrations, contract negotiations, grievances, and other matters pertaining to labor unions and the employees they represented.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">7.</span> In 1973, following law school, I became an associate with the Miami firm of Lion &#x0026; Bobcat, a partnership of approximately 55 lawyers. I was assigned to the labor section of the litigation division of the firm. For the next two years I represented management (corporate) clients in all types of labor-relations matters, including arbitrations, ULP charges, disciplinary and pension problems, negotiations, grievance, and wage and hour matters.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">8.</span> In 1975, I left the management arena to associate with Herring and Goldfish, a smaller firm located in Key West. There I returned to the representation of union clients, employees, and occasional management clients, in labor relations and employment disputes.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">9.</span> One of the clients who retained me in Key West was the Affiliation of Federal Cats, the largest federal-sector cat union, with offices worldwide. The sun always shines on an affiliated federal cat. In March 1977, I joined the AFC national office as staff counsel. I remained there through January of 1980 when I resigned as Assistant General Counsel for Litigation to return to private practice. My AFC responsibilities included supervision and conduct of litigation entrusted to the staff lawyers. That litigation was conducted throughout the nation in many federal district courts and in the Court of Federal Claims, federal circuit courts of appeals, and the United States Supreme Court. Additionally, I either conducted or supervised litigation before administrative law judges, complaints examiners, hearing officers of the MSPB and other administrative agencies concerned with federal sector labor relations and employment problems. I also represented employees and the AFC in arbitrations, disciplinary cases, EEO proceedings, and ULP hearings.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">10.</span> I returned to private practice in February of 1980, to join my present practice. My work was then and continues to involve representation of labor unions and employees before various courts and administrative agencies, including the MSPB. I represent federal sector unions and employees in many different industries, trades, and professions. My work requires representation in various areas of the country, but it is centered in metropolitan Washington, D.C. My practice involves representation from first level grievance sessions through to the United States Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">11.</span> I am a member of the Bars of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the District of Columbia. I am admitted to the United States Supreme Court; the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the Third, Fourth, District of Columbia, and Federal Circuits; United States District Courts for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Western District of Virginia, and District of Columbia; the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and all state or local courts in jurisdictions where I am a member of the Bar. I practice in other federal courts on a <span class="Italic">pro hac</span> vice basis. My work also involves extensive work before the MSPB, arbitrators, the FLRA, and EEOC.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">12.</span> When time permits, I write articles for the benefit of lawyers and others who can use guidance in federal sector personnel and labor relations law. Antiquated articles include two in the publication Commonsense Cat Law: one on adverse action cases before the Board; the other on the processing of administrative EEO cases in the federal sector. An article also was published on the duty of fair representation in the review of the Association of Cat Professionals. I have lectured in various parts of the country on civil service and labor law. In May of 1984 I published <span class="Italic">A Guide To Merit Systems Protection Board Law and Practice</span>, now, I trust, in use throughout the country by innumerable attorneys, unions, law libraries, and federal agencies. This book has been updated and has been republished annually. It and its author are the subjects of numerous favorable reviews and awards by Dewey Publications and its subsidiaries. I have served as an expert witness in court and before administrative agencies on civil service issues. I have presented testimony as a civil service lawyer to the House Subcommittee concerned with revisions to the CSRA.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">13.</span> My hourly rate, and the hourly rate for this office during 1998 was $215 per hour; for 1999 the rate was $275 per hour; for 2022-2023 the rate $1,000 per hour. The rate increased by $10 on January 1st of each year, except for 2022, when I decided I needed to fund a retirement account. The old rate is probably average or low in comparison to rates charged by other lawyers in employment cases in the District of Columbia and other cities. The new rate may be slightly higher. Throughout my past practice I have endeavored to keep fees as low as possible to provide legal services to clients at rates within their means. I can attest to the reasonableness of my hourly rate on the basis of my employment with AFC, where I was frequently called upon to approve bills submitted by counsel both in the District of Columbia and elsewhere who provided representation on contract with AFC. I know what the Board and arbitrators have allowed in similar cases involving counsel fee awards, and the allowable rates do, on occasion, considerably exceed the rate that I charge.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">14.</span> This case was undertaken at the rate of $1,000 per hour, on the basis of a retainer agreement (attached to this affidavit) signed on November 24, 2022.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">15.</span> The work that I performed for Ms. Dots has been extensive, involving time on a 42-day suspension case. They were handled in two stages: (1) pre-MSPB appeal; (2) MSPB hearing and post-hearing. At the preappeal stage, Ms. Dots came to me with documentation concerning both cases and I advised her as to her reply rights and the substantive merits of the charges against her. This required research and review of an enormous amount of documents developed by the supervisor. Ms. Dots had to be advised as to the administrative processing of portions of these actions before FCC and then there was the MSPB appeal of both these cases. The MSPB appeal involved the usual preparation of an appeal, briefing, discovery, file review, attendance at a hearing, conferences with witnesses and the client, correspondence, post-hearing argument, and a petition for review with MSPB. In addition, there is the time spent on this fee petition, motion, and affidavit.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">16.</span> I keep time records by tenths of hours as I perform work. These time sheets are attached to this statement. The timesheets indicate, in a summary form, the nature of the activity, the date it was performed, and the time involved. Incidental expenses, e.g., postage and travel, are noted by the office staff and posted to the client's ledger card. The billing increments are conservative; there are lawyers who charge a minimum of .25 hours for each task, no matter how short. There is a lot of time in any case that I do not charge. Either I forget to charge it or I decide that I do not feel the charge is proper for some reason, such as calling someone only to find out that he or she is unavailable.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">17.</span> My timesheets indicate that my time on this case amounts to 568 hours, plus 1,000 hours for preparation of this fee petition (review of timesheets, preparation of affidavit, motion, research). As was noted earlier, the retainer rate is $1,000 per hour. Total fees amount to $1,568,000.00. There may be a few notations on the timesheets showing NC--this means that I worked the time shown to the left of the notation but did not bill the client; the time is claimed, it simply was not billed to the client to try and keep her costs down. There has also been time spent on the case by Xavier Dewey, an associate of this firm, whose time is charged at the rate of $100 per hour. Mr. Dewey is a member of the D.C. Bar and is a graduate of the Coastal Region Law School. His past employment has included representation of whistleblowers with the Commission For Cat Adoption. He spent 3 hours on the case, for a fee of $300. Total fees for my time and Dewey's are $1,568,300.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">18.</span> There are also some expenses entailed in the Board litigation. These expenses include: toll calls of $3.42, postage of $29.27, and parking at the MSPB hearing for $203.50, totaling $236.19. Total fees and expenses claimed amount to $1,568,536.19. I have reviewed the records carefully and although it is possible that an arithmetic error in posting or addition has occurred, these figures are accurate to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">19.</span> The Board has regularly awarded this law firm fees at the rates comparable to those requested here. $135 per hour for time spent on a RIF case in 1989 was awarded in case #DC0000000000 (June 6, 1987). The same rate was approved in case CH0000000001 (1983). The $145 rate was approved for 1990 time in case DC0000002-Add (RO 1988). The $1,000 per hour figure has not yet been approved. But we are waiting.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="list">20.</span> On the basis of my personal experience, the time and fees charged in this case are reasonable.</p>

<p class="Body-Text-c">APPELLANT'S PETITION FOR REVIEW</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Jenny Any Dots petitions for review of the addendum decision of Administrative Judge Ben Mouse of the regional office. His decision is incorrect as a matter of fact and law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The administrative judge correctly found that Appellant's counsel was entitled to counsel fees, for the Appellant was found to be the victim of disability discrimination. Her suspension was reversed. The administrative judge awarded fees, but with respect to the hourly rate for travel time, counsel was awarded only $20 per hour. The hourly rate that was otherwise approved by the administrative judge was $1,000 per hour. The diminution of the fee for travel time was erroneous as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Hoyt v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 28 MSPR 275 (1985), to reduce counsel fees for time spent in travel. In <span class="Italic">Crumbaker v. MSPB</span>, 781 F.2d 191 (Fed. Cir. 1986), the Federal Circuit expressly reversed the Board on the issue of reduced fees for travel. Accordingly, travel time must now be paid at the full hourly rate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board must grant this PFR and either modify the result to provide for full payment to Appellant's counsel, or remand the case to the administrative judge for the same result.</p>
