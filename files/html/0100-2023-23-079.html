<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-78"><span class="space">6.</span> Reinstatement With No or Limited Pay; Time-Served or Other Suspension; Shortened Notice Period</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ may not mitigate a removal to a suspension lasting from the date of the removal to the date of the initial decision--what amounts to a time-served suspension, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 14 MSPR 61, 64-65 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue, then, is whether a 164-day suspension is reasonable under the circumstances of this case. Based on the record on appeal, the Board finds, as did the presiding official, that appellant's removal under the circumstances of this case was excessive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a closely analogous case, <span class="Italic">Morris v. Naval Weapons Support Center,</span> 8 <span id="Page_4870"></span>MSPB 395, 396 (1981), (November 24, 1981), <span class="Italic">citing Cuiffo v. United States,</span> 137 F. Supp. 944, 950 (Ct. Cl. 1955), the Board rejected the imposition of a 162-day suspension by a presiding official as an alternative to removal where the alternative punishment was selected without articulation of a reasonable basis and was determined by accident, rather than by a process of logical deliberation and decision. In <span class="Italic">Morris,</span> as in this appeal, the presiding official determined the penalty by calculating the total number of days between the date of the appellant's discharge and 35 days after issuance of the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finding that the presiding official offered no reasonable basis for such penalty in this case, the Board cannot affirm the presiding official's mitigation of appellant's removal to a 164-day suspension. Upon review of the evidence of record on appeal in light of the considerations set forth above, the Board finds that the maximum reasonable penalty warranted in this case is a suspension for a period of sixty (60) calendar days.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Morris v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 9 MSPR 31, 8 MSPB 395 (1981), cited in <span class="Italic">Jackson,</span> reevaluated an AJ's decision mitigating a removal to a suspension lasting from the date of the removal to 35 days after the issuance of the initial decision (the finality date of the decision if no PFR were filed):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Court of Claims has stated its disapproval of penalties which amount to a suspension without pay for the intervening period between an improper removal and restoration to duty because such an alternative punishment, without articulation of a reasonable basis for the selection of such a suspension, "is determined by accident, and not by a process of logical deliberation and decision."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, after finding that appellant's removal was excessive under the circumstances, and that another employee had been given a thirty day suspension for a similar offense, the presiding official determined that the appropriate penalty would be to suspend the appellant for the period from the date of his discharge until 35 days after issuance of the initial decision. Although we agree that the distinctions between the circumstances of this case, and the case involving the other employee who was charged with a similar offense, do not account for the difference between a 30 day suspension and a removal, we find that since the presiding official in this instance did not articulate a reasonable basis for the 162 day suspension which she imposed on the appellant, that penalty, in light of the court's holding in <span class="Italic">Cuiffo,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was erroneous.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cuiffo v. United States</span>, 137 F. Supp. 944, 950 (Ct. Cl. 1955), involved a suit for backpay after an internal agency review board reinstated a worker following a minor offense, but gave him no pay through the date of the internal board's decision. Of this the Court of Claims said:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We think that plaintiff's punishment was determined by accident, and not by a process of logical deliberation and decision. We have no doubt that, had the Review Board reached the plaintiff's case within 10 days or 30 days after his removal, they would have nullified his removal, as they did, and would have ordered his immediate reinstatement. But the Board did not reach the case for several months, and after it and the Acting Chief of Transportation had acted, the agency did not get around to reinstating the plaintiff for several more months. This casual attitude toward the livelihood of a working man, found by the Review Board to be "a veteran of World War I, 55 years of age, who enjoyed an enviable record at the port" and having "a good reputation for honesty, sobriety, integrity and veracity" was a complete departure from fair dealing and tolerable personnel policy. We think it was so arbitrary and unfair that it should be set aside.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">An indefinite suspension under the crime provision is not void because of a subsequent acquittal or hung jury, but the agency must move expeditiously to terminate the suspension following the outcome of the criminal proceeding.

<p class="Body-Text">Should the agency remove a tenured employee and treat that individual as a probationer, denying the employee the 30-day advance notice required by statute, the Board treats the shortened notice period as an improper suspension and directs the agency to provide back pay to the employee for the days of the notice period that the employee lost as a result of the agency's action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stephen v.

<p class="Body-Text">If the Board mitigates a demotion to a suspension, the appropriate directive to the agency is to order a prospective suspension. Because a suspension requires placement of an employee in a temporary status without duties or pay, 5 USC 7501(2), the agency cannot be directed to withhold pay for a period when the appellant has worked, i.e., the suspension cannot be retroactive if the employee has been working during the period of the retroactivity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schoeffler v. USDA</span>, 50 MSPR 143, 146 (1991) (ordering "the agency to suspend the appellant for a 60-day period without pay effective 20 days from the date of this [compliance] decision"); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 14 MSPR 112, 114 (1982) (AJ improperly directed that a demotion be canceled and that appellant be suspended for 30 days from the effective date of the demotion; because appellant had then been working, the suspension would not comply with the statutory requirement that it be served "without duties"; the Board ordered the agency to restore the employee with back pay and then to suspend him without duties and without pay).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stewart v. Dept. of Army</span>, 104 Fed. Appx. 718, 720 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Dept. of Army</span>, 98 MSPR 170 (2004) (summarizing the holding of the court and directing the agency to comply)), considered a dispute over a settlement agreement that mitigated a demotion to a suspension. The language of the agreement, not the clearest, led the agency to impose a suspension retroactively to the date the employee was initially demoted, meaning that the employee was presented with a bill for the pay he received during the period of the retroactively-imposed suspension. The agreement could not be interpreted in the manner suggested by the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The construction of the settlement agreement espoused by the agency and adopted by the Board would require us to ignore this bedrock principle of federal employment law: employees do not work for free.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The subsequent counsel fee decision, in<span class="Italic"> Stewart v. Dept. of Army</span>, 102 MSPR 656, 662 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15, 2006 MSPB 223 (2006), explained that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has long held that it is a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(2) to retroactively suspend an appellant who has worked during the period of the suspension. <span class="Italic">See Schoeffler v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 143, 146 (1991);<span class="Italic"> Smith v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 112, 114 (1982). Additionally, with exceptions not applicable here, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1342 prohibits the government from accepting voluntary services. As the Federal Circuit noted in its decision in this case, by withholding monies from the appellant to recoup the salary it paid him for work he had already performed, the agency conceded that it would be accepting voluntary services from the appellant in violation of the law. <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, 104 Fed. Appx. at 720.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of these laws, the agency's action in withholding monies from the appellant to recoup his salary for days he had worked could not be sustained. Further, the Board has long resolved the principle that it is a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(2) to retroactively suspend an appellant who has worked during the period of the suspension, and the agency presents no basis for relitigating this well-settled legal principle. <span class="Italic">See Keely</span>, 760 F.2d at 249; <span class="Italic">Schoeffler</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 146; <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. at 114....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board employed an unusual approach in a constructive adverse action appeal, <span class="Italic">Sink v. Dept. of Energy</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SINK_JONATHAN_F_DE_0752_07_0333_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_372188.pdf">110 MSPR 153</a>, 161-64 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-23, 2008 MSPB 231 (2008). The appellant was geographically reassigned. The agency proposed the appellant's removal when he declined the reassignment. He was incorrectly told by an agency advisor that if he was removed his federal health insurance would not be continued beyond 30 days following the removal; that is, he was not properly informed concerning the ability to continue the benefit following his removal. With that information, and with a need to continue the health insurance benefits, the appellant retired before the agency effectuated his removal. He then appealed the retirement based on misleading information concerning his health insurance benefits. The Board concluded that the information was misleading and that the retirement was involuntary, but as to the remedy the Board determined that reinstatement and back pay were inappropriate for the entire period from the retirement to the date of the Board's final order. Instead, on the assumption that the appellant would have retired, and secured continuation of health benefits, had the agency issued a final decision to remove him, the Board directed back pay from the date of the retirement through the date of the removal if the agency, on remand, decided that it would have removed the appellant for failure to accept the geographical reassignment. The Board's reasoning was that the appellant should not, through the retirement based on the bad advice concerning <span id="Page_4871"></span>health benefits, be placed in a better position than if the agency proceeded with the removal and the appellant retired when he was removed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant prevails in an adverse action appeal, we would normally issue a final order directing the agency to cancel the appellant's separation and to reinstate him to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>; i.e., to restore the appellant to his former position of record and provide him with back pay and benefits retroactive to the date of his separation. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of the Army,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6; 11 (2008); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Army,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 449, 450, 455 (1990). However, we find that further consideration of the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> and the appellant's entitlement to back pay is warranted under the unusual circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ultimate goal when the Board orders an agency to cancel an action is to, as nearly as possible, place the appellant in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, that is, in the situation in which he would have been had the wrongful personnel action not occurred. <span class="Italic">House v. Department of the Army,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 530, &#x00B6; 9 (2005); <span class="Italic">Mascarenas v. Department of Defense,</span> 57 M.S.P.R. 425, 430 (1993). The appellant is not entitled to be placed in a better position than he would have enjoyed had the adverse action not occurred.<span class="Italic"> Silvestri v. Department of the Army,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 580, 584 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> in this case includes that: the appellant's former position had been abolished in a legitimate reorganization; the appellant had been given a directed reassignment to a new position in the LM Headquarters Office in Washington, D.C., effective January 8, 2006; the appellant had refused that directed reassignment on January 4, 2006; the appellant had been placed on administrative leave effective January 9, 2006; the agency had proposed the appellant's removal due to his refusal to accept the directed reassignment; the appellant had responded to the removal proposal; the agency could have issued a decision that involuntarily separated the appellant with an effective date of Monday, February 20, 2006; and the appellant involuntarily chose to take an immediate retirement effective Friday, February 17, 2006, so as to avoid the potential loss of his FEHB, which he had been erroneously informed would occur if he was removed. Further, the AJ found that the appellant's decision to retire was not coerced by the agency's removal action because the agency proved that it had a legitimate basis for proposing that action. In restoring the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, he is subject to those same circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A determination of the appropriate relief in this appeal is complicated by the directed reassignment (which the AJ found to have been taken for legitimate reasons) and the absence of an agency decision on the notice of proposed removal. The appellant's refusal to accept his directed reassignment in January 2006 creates a substantial issue as to the scope of appropriate relief. <span class="Italic">See Washington v. Tennessee Valley Authority,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. 377, 379 (1984) (although the Board mitigated the appellant's removal for cause to a reprimand, the appellant would have properly been subject to separation by reduction in force (RIF) but for his prior removal for cause, and the agency was not prohibited from retroactively separating the appellant by RIF; "[t]o prohibit the agency from retroactively separating appellant by RIF in this situation would result in mandatory placement of appellant in a better position than he would have enjoyed if he had not been wrongfully removed"),<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 770 F.2d 180 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). Based on the record in this matter, it seems likely that the agency would have decided to remove the appellant for failure to accept his directed reassignment had he not retired on February 17, 2006. Had that occurred, the appellant would have been eligible for a retirement annuity upon his separation from service. Thus, even in the absence of the misinformation from the agency regarding his FEHB, the appellant likely would have been separated from service and retired shortly after February 17, 2006. Had the appellant not retired on February 17, 2006, the agency could have effected his removal as early as the following week. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) (an employee is entitled to at least 30-days advance written notice of a removal action under 5 U.S.C. ch. 75).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In these circumstances, the Board's relief order must take into account the appellant's impending removal for failing to accept his directed reassignment, otherwise the appellant would be placed in a better position than he would have enjoyed if he had not retired on February 17, 2006. <span class="Italic">See Washington,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. at 379. Thus, the appropriate relief in this appeal is to cancel the appellant's involuntary retirement, restore him with appropriate back pay and other benefits from February 17, 2006, until the date he would otherwise have been separated from service, and adjust his retirement annuity accordingly. <span class="Italic">See Washington,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. at 379; <span class="Italic">see also Mixer v. Department of Labor,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. 481, 482-83 (1985) (the agency properly complied with the Board's order to cancel the appellant's involuntary resignation where, after canceling the resignation, the agency retroactively effected a RIF that had been previously proposed and was to have taken effect 1 day after her resignation). Had the agency removed the appellant in February 2006 for failing to accept his directed reassignment outside of his local commuting area, the appellant would have possessed all of the requisite requirements for either an immediate retirement or a discontinued service retirement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(a), (d). Consistent with OPM's instructions in Chapter 44, Subsections 44A1.1-2, 44A1.1-3, 44A2.11, and 44A2.1-3, of OPM's "CSRS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices," the agency would have been required to effect the appellant's involuntary separation through either an immediate retirement or a discontinued service retirement, at the appellant's election. Further, the appellant would have remained eligible to retain his FEHB in his retirement in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8905(b) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 890.303(a). Thus, if the agency subsequently effects the appellant's involuntary separation for failing to accept his directed reassignment outside of his local commuting area, the appellant would be entitled to a later retirement date. <span class="Italic">See Gammill v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 484, 489 (1985) (the appellant's reasonable detrimental reliance on erroneous information from his employing agency warranted a change in his retirement date).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that the agency never acted on the notice of proposed removal. Only the agency may take such an action against the appellant. <span class="Italic">See McCollum v. National Credit Union Administration,</span> 417 F.3d 1332, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("Where the agency has not acted, an employee's removal cannot be in accordance with law."). The parties have not presented specific evidence and argument on this issue, and based on the existing record, we cannot determine if, and when, the appellant would otherwise have been separated from service had he not retired on February 17, 2006. Accordingly, we direct the agency to make a determination on this issue.</p>
