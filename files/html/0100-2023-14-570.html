<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-571"><span class="space">1.</span> Competitive Area</h4>
<p class="noindent">The broader the competitive area in a RIF, the broader the scope of competition within a competitive level and the better the potential for assignment rights. Unions seek to negotiate broad competitive levels when employees in units of recognition are threatened by a RIF. Because the boundaries of a competitive area have no necessary relation to the boundaries of the unit of exclusive recognition, a proposal that seeks a broad competitive area may have a potential adverse impact on nonunit employees who might be immune from displacement by unit employees narrowly cabined. The impact of competitive area definition on nonunit employees produced extensive litigation over the negotiability of proposals defining competitive areas. The result of the litigation is preclusion of negotiations of the scope of competitive areas to the extent they are set by OPM government-wide regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA initially determined that agencies retain discretion to define competitive areas, i.e., the organizational boundaries where employees affected by a RIF compete for retention, and those boundaries were negotiable within OPM guidelines. Agency regulations defining competitive area did not present a compelling need. The possible disruption of an expanded competitive area could be controlled: bumping rights could be denied when their use would cause undue interruption to the activity in an individual case. An agency regulation limiting the size of a competitive area, although possibly helpful to the agency, was not essential. <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, Region IV</span>, 11 FLRA 254 (1983) (Proposal 1). A proposal to negotiate competitive areas was within the duty to bargain and it was negotiable for the union to propose that nonbargaining unit technicians would not compete with bargaining unit technicians for bargaining unit positions. A proposal directly affecting the conditions of employment of unit employees and otherwise consistent with law was within the duty to bargain even if the proposal also affected employees outside the unit. <span class="Italic">ACT, Pa. State Council and Pa. Army and Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 14 FLRA 38, 38-39 (1984) (Proposal 1).</p>
<p class="noindent">Subsequently, a proposal to define a competitive area was nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 14 FLRA 754 (1984), <span class="Italic">remanded</span>, 774 F.2d 498, 502-05 (D.C. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">post</span>, because it determined the conditions of nonunit employees. <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, Region IV</span>, 11 FLRA 254 (1983), was distinguished: it only involved the issue of whether there was a compelling need for a regulation setting a competitive area differently than the union proposal. The same result was reached as to a proposal that redrew a competitive area to narrow the area of competition for nonunit employees within the redrawn area by excluding positions outside the local commuting area. It was nonnegotiable since it determined conditions of employment of employees not in the unit. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 29 and Dept. of Army, Army Corps of Eng'rs, Kansas City Dist.</span>, 16 FLRA 75, 77 (1984) (Proposal 2), <span class="Italic">remanded</span>, 774 F.2d 498, 502-05 (D.C. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">post</span>. The other decision mentioned earlier, <span class="Italic">ACT, Pennsylvania State Council and Pennsylvania Army and Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 14 FLRA 38 (1984), was questioned in the court's decision because of apparent conflicts with the <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32</span> and other Authority decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent">On judicial review <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> and <span class="Italic">Local 29</span> were remanded to FLRA for reconsideration, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and NFFE Local 29 v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 498, 502-05 (D.C. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> opinion, the FLRA recognized that it previously had found that proposals seeking to define competitive areas were within the duty to bargain in two types of cases.... The first type of case, exemplified by <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of Health and Human Services, Region IV</span>, 11 FLRA 254 (1983), involved a situation where the applicability of the proposal to non-bargaining unit employees was not asserted by the agency as a ground for precluding negotiation of the proposal.... We have no quarrel with the Authority's effort to distinguish this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[In the] second type of case...the Authority has held a proposed competitive area to be within an agency's duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Association of Civilian Technicians, Pennsylvania State Council and Pennsylvania Army and Air National Guard</span> (<span class="Italic">"ACT"</span>), 14 FLRA 38 (1984). According to the <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> opinion, in <span class="Italic">ACT</span>, "the proposal effectively would have limited the competitive area to the bargaining unit and the Authority found that the agency had not asserted, nor was it otherwise apparent, that the proposal was inconsistent with laws or regulations applicable to National Guard Technicians."... Because we find that the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">ACT</span> is, on its face, inconsistent with the results obtained in the instant case, and because the Authority's attempt to distinguish <span class="Italic">ACT</span> is inadequate, we remand to the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n <span class="Italic">ACT</span>...the FLRA [stated]:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Authority has previously stated that a bargaining proposal which directly affects the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees and is otherwise consistent with applicable laws and regulations is within the duty to bargain despite the fact that such proposal would affect employees outside the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On its face, this passage in the <span class="Italic">ACT</span> opinion conflicts with the FLRA's declarations in <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> and <span class="Italic">Local 29</span> that a proposal which affects the conditions of employment of non-bargaining unit employees is outside the statutory duty to bargain. This apparent conflict is highlighted by four additional considerations. The first is that the principle that a proposal may be a mandatory subject for bargaining despite its effect on non-bargaining unit employees appears fairly well established in FLRA precedent. A second consideration...is that the Authority's opinions...appear to be at odds with a familiar principle of private labor law, that a proposal concerning "terms and conditions of employment" is within the employer's duty to bargain, despite its potential effects on third parties.... A third fact...is that, in one of the instant cases, the Agency had, in the previous bargaining period, assumed that the definition of competitive area in a RIF was the proper subject for bargaining....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fourth...consideration...appears in the Authority's incomplete attempt to distinguish <span class="Italic">ACT</span>....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It appears that, since the <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> decision, the FLRA has adhered to the view that proposals to define competitive areas in the RIF context are non-negotiable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Housing and Urban Development and American Federation of Government Employees Local 476</span>, 18 FLRA 783 (1985); <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees Local 1705 and General Services Administration</span>, 17 FLRA 945 (1985); <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of Health and Human Services, Region VII</span>, 17 FLRA 589 (1985); <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, Region II, and American Federation of Government Employees Council 242</span>, 17 FLRA 329 (1985). Nevertheless, the inconsistency between the <span class="Italic">ACT</span> and <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> approaches remains. In the interest of facilitating judicial review of the FLRA's decision in this area, and in order to ensure that future negotiations are conducted within an atmosphere of certainty as to the applicable law, we must require the Authority to either explain its apparently inconsistent treatment of the case or explicitly adopt a new approach.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1036"></span>...On remand, we expect that the FLRA will address and resolve the conflict candidly and in a manner that persons affected by the Authority's decisions can comprehend.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 22 FLRA 478 (1986), determined that due to the impact on nonunit employees the proposal was not negotiable. The appeals court had directed FLRA to resolve the apparent conflict between <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> and <span class="Italic">ACT, Pennsylvania State Council and Pennsylvania Army and Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 14 FLRA 38 (1984). FLRA stated, 22 FLRA at 483-85:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has never held that negotiating over competitive areas is prohibited.&#x2003;However, it has held that an agency is not <span class="Italic">obligated</span> to bargain over proposals which directly determine conditions of employment of nonbargaining unit employees even though it can bargain over these matters if it chooses to do so. Therefore, under Authority precedent any agency could properly bargain over the definition of a competitive area which would include nonunit employees, as the agency here apparently did in the past. Nonetheless, in the Federal as in the private sector, previous bargaining over a <span class="Italic">permissive</span> matter would not prevent an agency negotiating a new agreement from changing its position and refusing to bargain over an elective subject....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the employees involved in the <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> case, as for most Federal employees, a RIF must be carried out in accordance with regulations prescribed by...OPM pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3502. These regulations establish a comprehensive system for determining which employees will be retained in the positions which remain in an agency undergoing a RIF. Within that system "competitive area" constitutes the basic geographic and organizational boundaries within which employees will compete for retention. The OPM regulations do not allow competitive area to be defined in terms of positions, as, for example, bargaining unit positions. Consequently, as a practical matter, most competitive areas which are established under OPM regulations will include both bargaining unit and nonunit positions and employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Local 32</span>, the proposal would have defined the competitive area for RIF as the Washington Metropolitan Area.... [T]he proposed competitive area would include nonbargaining unit employees.... Acceptance of the Union's designation of competitive area would allow it to determine with whom nonunit employees would compete for retention rights in the event of a RIF....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its decision in <span class="Italic">ACT</span> [14 FLRA 38 (1984)],...the proposed competitive area [was] within the Agency's duty to bargain. The proposal in <span class="Italic">ACT</span> essentially defined a competitive area for RIF limited to the bargaining unit. As previously mentioned, such a competitive area would not be consistent with the OPM regulations applicable in the <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> case. However, in the <span class="Italic">ACT</span> case, as distinguished from <span class="Italic">Local 32</span>, the bargaining unit consists of National Guard Technicians who are not subject to those OPM regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.202(c)(5) (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal in <span class="Italic">ACT</span> for that reason would have directly determined or defined the competitive area only for bargaining unit positions and employees. It also undeniably would have affected or influenced in a limited, indirect way the potential scope of any competitive area for nonbargaining unit employees by excluding them from the area negotiated for the bargaining unit. However, the proposal would not otherwise limit or prescribe a competitive area for those nonunit employees. Hence, it did not define or directly determine a condition of their employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...<span class="Italic">ACT</span> only affected conditions of...nonunit employees indirectly: it excluded them from the negotiated competitive area.... <span class="Italic">Local 32</span>...encompassed nonbargaining unit employees in the negotiated competitive area. It directly determined...their competitive area.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> litigation over negotiability of competitive areas continued with another appeal to the D.C. Circuit and another remand from that court. The court declared in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 v. FLRA</span>, 853 F.2d 986, 989-93 (D.C. Cir. 1988):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's reasoning in its first consideration of the <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> case indicates the approach that has guided the FLRA's course in these cases both before and after the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Local 32</span>. The FLRA, regarding the impact on employees other than those represented by the negotiating union as dispositive of bargainability, held that an agency's statutorily imposed duty to bargain does not extend to proposals with a direct impact on the working conditions of employees outside the bargaining unit....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our first encounter with this matter...the court identified a number of infirmities in the FLRA's reasoning. Of prime importance, the Authority's position in the original <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> and <span class="Italic">Local 29</span> cases appeared to be inconsistent with the FLRA's ruling in...<span class="Italic">Association of Civilian Technicians</span>...14 FLRA 38 (1984)...[that] an agency's duty to bargain a union proposal that in essence defined the agency's competitive area as coextensive with the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the course of this dispute the matter in controversy has been brought into sharper focus.&#x2003;The Authority recognizes that, in the absence of an impact on nonunit employees, or conflict with the management rights expressly enumerated and reserved to agencies in the statute...competitive area proposals are among the "working conditions" that qualify as mandatory subjects of collective bargaining. The Authority has not argued that the proposals now at issue conflict with the management rights conferred in &#x00A7; 7106, nor is there any argument that the proposals are exempt from bargaining under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117, which precludes proposals that conflict with federal law or an agency regulation for which there is a compelling need. Instead, the Authority claims an inherent right or responsibility, as expert adjudicator, to balance the agency's duty to bargain against the agency's right to determine the working conditions of non-unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fatal flaw in the Authority's opinion on remand lies in the balancing approach it has formulated to evaluate the negotiability of proposals that affect nonunit employees. An approach that ostensibly balances conflicting rights undoubtedly strikes a basic judicial chord; "balancing" is often identified as altogether rational. For the FLRA's approach here to comport with a reasonable construction of a statute, however, the "rights" assertedly at issue must have some substantive basis in law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The right to refuse to bargain over proposals that affect the working conditions of nonunit employees is not among the management rights that the FSLMRA identifies, nor can such a right be inferred from other provisions that qualify the duty to bargain.... The Authority has offered no argument to persuade us that the statute's express definition of management rights should be augmented or supplemented by inherent FLRA power to qualify an agency's duty to bargain over working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor does the <span class="Italic">Local 32 II</span> decision indicate to us that the FLRA has a clear vision of the standard it is purporting to follow. At one point, the Authority states that a proposal is not bargainable if it "actually determines" the working conditions of nonunit employees; at another, the Authority defines a lower standard, under which a proposal is not bargainable if it has a "significant effect" on nonunit employees.... More recently, the FLRA has altered its formulation yet again, limiting invocation of its asserted inherent authority to "[a] proposal which has a direct and significant effect <span class="Italic">on vital interests</span> of nonunit employees."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having twice failed to articulate an intelligible rationale for determining when an impact on nonunit employees precludes mandatory bargaining over a competitive area proposal, the Authority should reconsider the standard that obtains in the private sector. Under that standard, the expert adjudicator inquires only whether vital interests of unit employees would be affected by a given proposal, and permits bargaining over such proposals without regard to the potential effect on nonunit employees. Before asserting that the FSLMRA requires more with respect to competitive area proposals or any other subjects of bargaining, the FLRA must tie its disposition to a solid foundation. It is not enough to refer in Delphic tones to inherent authority, or to rely vaguely on the Authority's general duty to interpret the statute with government efficiency in mind.</p>
<p class="noindent">Back to the mat. The court cases resulted in FLRA's decisions in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 33 FLRA 335 (1988), and <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 29 and Dept. of Army, Army Corps of Eng'rs, Kansas City Dist.</span>, 33 FLRA 507 (1988). FLRA capitulated, concluding that the proposal seeking to define the competitive area was negotiable. The 1988 remand decision in <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> is explored at greater length in the earlier discussion in the introductory portions of this chapter concerned with the "vitally affects" test and negotiability of matters affecting nonunit employees. But in 1995 FLRA revisited the whole matter of the "vitally affects" test and determined it could not permit that test to allow negotiation of a proposal that defined competitive areas and impacted on working conditions of supervisory personnel within those competitive areas, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 51 FLRA 491, 502-13 (1995) (aff'd, AFGE Local <span class="Italic">32 and FLRA,</span> 110 F.3d 810 (D.C. Cir. 1997), post)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has carved a narrow exception to this limitation on the duty to bargain under the Statute.&#x2003;Under this exception, an agency may be obligated to bargain with a union over matters that directly affect individuals other than unit employees insofar as such matters "vitally affect" the terms and conditions of employment of unit employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923 and</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administration, Health Care</span> <span class="Italic">Financing Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 44 FLRA 1405, 1416-21 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Health Care Financing</span>) (proposal that equal employment opportunities be provided to prospective employees held within the duty to bargain because it vitally affected conditions of employment of unit employees and was not otherwise prohibited from bargaining). The "vitally affects" test, enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Allied</span> <span class="Italic">Chemical &#x0026; Alkali Workers of America, Local Union No. 1 v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. Chemical Division</span>, 404 U.S. 157 (1971) (<span class="Italic">Pittsburgh Plate Glass</span>), looks to the nature and extent of the impact on unit employees' <span id="page_1037"></span>working conditions of a bargaining proposal that directly implicates matters involving third parties. The Court stated that, in examining and assessing whether an employer is required to bargain over matters relating to third parties:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he question is not whether the third-party concern is antagonistic to or compatible with the interests of bargaining-unit employees, but whether it vitally affects the "terms and conditions" of their employment.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Pittsburgh Plate Glass</span>, the union sought to bargain over proposals relating to insurance benefits for retired employees. Concluding that the benefits to current employees from bargaining over the proposals were "speculative and insubstantial at best[,]" the Court held that the employer was not obligated to bargain and, therefore, did not violate the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 158, by refusing to do so. 404 U.S. at 180.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">On review of <span class="Italic">Naval Aviation</span>, the D.C. Circuit "approve[d] the Authority's decision to adopt the 'vitally affects' test[.]" <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1439. However, in two respects, the court rejected the Authority's construction of the test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In effect, the court in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> held that the identity of the third party that is affected by a proposal <span class="Italic">is</span> relevant in determining whether the proposal is within the duty to bargain.[21] When a proposal directly implicates employees in other bargaining units and/or supervisory personnel, the effect of the proposal on unit employees is not sufficient--even if it is "vital"--to bring the proposal within the duty to bargain. In such circumstances, the vitally affects test does not apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;The court remanded the case to the Authority for further proceedings to determine whether there were "non-unit, non-supervisory employees...whose conditions of employment [were] directly implicated" by the proposals and, if there were, whether the vitally affects test had been satisfied<span class="Italic">. Cherry Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1443. On remand, the Authority concluded that the record did not permit a construction of the disputed proposals as limited to non-unit, non-supervisory employees and, as such, the proposals were outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">International Association of Machinists and</span> <span class="Italic">Aerospace Workers, Local Lodge 2297 and U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point, North Carolina</span>, 45 FLRA 1154 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority's Application of Cherry Point</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has applied the reasoning of the court in <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> Point in a series of decisions concerning whether proposals that directly implicated individuals outside the union's bargaining unit are within the duty to bargain.[22] These decisions have involved three types of bargaining proposals: (1) those that directly implicated nonemployees; (2) those that directly implicated employees in other bargaining units; and (3) those that directly implicated supervisory personnel.[23]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[22]&#x2003;Consistent with the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, the Authority has found that the vitally affects test is not applicable to proposals that relate principally to unit employees' conditions of employment and do not directly implicate any category of individuals outside the union's bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1482 and U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Mapping Agency, Louisville, Kentucky</span>, 45 FLRA 1132, 1135-38 (1992) (proposal establishing procedure for selecting unit employees to serve as backups to supervisors).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[23]&#x2003;These categories encompass three of the four third-party groups discussed by the court in Cherry Point. As noted in n.19, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Authority has not addressed the application of the vitally affects test to proposals directly implicating unrepresented employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]ith regard to proposals directly implicating supervisory personnel, the Authority similarly has held, with one exception, that the vitally affects test does not apply and, accordingly, that such proposals are outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">E.g., Health Care Financing</span>, 44 FLRA at 1422-24 (proposal that managers and supervisors be held accountable for successful implementation of affirmative employment program). The exception is <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>, the decision relied on by the Union in this case. <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Weather Service</span> is the only post-<span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> case in which the Authority found a proposal that directly implicated supervisory employees to be within the scope of mandatory bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal at issue in <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>, like the proposal here, concerned competitive areas for RIF purposes. The Authority concluded that, although the proposed competitive area encompassed, and thereby directly determined the conditions of employment of, supervisors, it was within the duty to bargain consistent with the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>. <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>, 44 FLRA at 29. According to the Authority:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he fact that the competitive areas defined by the provision...encompass management personnel as well as bargaining unit employees does not indicate that the Union is seeking to regulate the conditions of employment of the management personnel. Rather, it represents an effort to draft a proposal directly affecting the competitive areas of bargaining unit employees that meets the regulatory requirements governing the definition of competitive areas. Therefore,...the Union does not, through the provision...purport or seek to regulate the terms and conditions of employment of management personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 28.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On review, the D.C. Circuit concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the agency's argument that the proposal should have been found nonnegotiable based on its effect on supervisors and managers because that argument had not been made to the Authority and, instead, had been raised for the first time before the court. <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 7 F.3d at 246. In particular, the court rejected the agency's assertion that it would have been futile for it to make the argument to the Authority in a request for reconsideration of the <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Weather Service</span> decision. In the court's view:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Authority's reasons for distinguishing <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> seem to us rather tenuous. We therefore suspect that if the government had provided the FLRA the cogent arguments presented to this court, the FLRA may well have reconsidered its decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 7 F.3d at 245-46.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">IFPTE</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>, 47 FLRA 1086, the Authority considered a union proposal that the competitive area for RIF purposes "shall be all commands at Mare Island represented by" a particular local of the union. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1087. The Authority noted that the union held exclusive recognition in three organizational entities at Mare Island, and that there were other bargaining units, represented by other unions, also located there.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority found that the meaning of the proposal was unclear.&#x2003;In particular, the Authority concluded "that the plain wording of the proposal, and the [u]nion's somewhat inconsistent statements of intent, supported two different interpretations of the proposal<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1088. In this regard, the Authority did not consider, as it had done in <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>, whether the union sought to accomplish anything different from what the proposal would in fact accomplish. Instead, the Authority analyzed the proposal under the two possible interpretations of what the proposal would accomplish. The Authority found that under the first (whereby the proposed competitive area included only unit employees), it was inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.402, and under the second (whereby the competitive area included employees represented by other unions), it was outside the duty to bargain consistent with the analysis in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of the Statute and Precedent in This</span> <span class="Italic">Case</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>, a proposal creating a competitive area that includes supervisory employees may be within the duty to bargain if it can be established that the union "does not...purport or seek to regulate the terms and conditions of employment of management personnel." <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>, 44 FLRA at 28. Because this conclusion departs from the weight of other Authority precedent in the aftermath of <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, and in view of the observation of the court in Commerce that the Authority's reasons for distinguishing <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> were "tenuous," 7 F.3d at 245-46, we find it appropriate to reconsider the Authority's decision. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the analysis the Authority articulated in <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span> is without support in the Statute or relevant case law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we find no statutory basis for the proposition that, in determining whether a proposal concerns a condition of employment of unit employees, it is appropriate to rely on what the union seeks to accomplish rather than what the proposal would, in fact, accomplish, when the two are inconsistent. The legislative history of the Statute likewise produces no support for discounting the effect of a proposal in this way.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, to the extent that such a departure in <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Weather Service</span> was premised on either the application of the vitally affects test in the private sector, or the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, we conclude that it was not well-founded.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the approach articulated by the Authority in <span class="Italic">National Weather <span id="page_1038"></span>Service</span> was not followed in the subsequent case that raised similar issues: <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>. The Union attempts in this case to distinguish its proposal from <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span> on the basis that its proposed competitive areas would not encompass employees in any other bargaining units. However, under the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, regulation of working conditions of employees in other bargaining units is proscribed to the same extent as supervisory employees. If "intent" in the manner used by the Authority in <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span> is a relevant concept, it is relevant to the same extent in both situations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are unable to reconcile the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span> and <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>. In view of the absence of any grounding in either the Statute or private sector labor law, and the weight of Authority precedent that <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Weather Service</span> counters, we conclude that the approach it adopted should no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arguments in this case do not persuade us that the Union's proposal, which directly determines the working conditions of supervisory personnel, is within the duty to bargain. We recognize that this conclusion places the Union in a "catch-22" situation--because the inclusion of supervisors in the proposed competitive area is, as the Union states, the "unavoidable" result of complying with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.402. We also are mindful that two Authority decisions finding proposed competitive areas that encompassed supervisory employees to be within the mandatory scope of bargaining, <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE III</span>, have been enforced by the D.C. Circuit. <span class="Italic">Commerce; OPM III</span>. Indeed, the D.C. Circuit's decisions in <span class="Italic">OPM I</span> and <span class="Italic">II</span> "pushed the FLRA into exactly the position it...adopted" in <span class="Italic">AFGE III. OPM III</span>, 905 F.2d at 435 (Silberman, J., concurring). Given this, and the evident significance of competitive areas to the working conditions of employees, <span class="Italic">see AFGE II</span>, 33 FLRA at 339, we do not reach our decision lightly. However, for the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the Agency is not required to bargain over the proposal, and we dismiss the Union's petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent">[The FLRA decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32</span> is discussed in Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-13-018.html#sec5-19">'Vitally Affects' Test; <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span></a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's 1995 decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span> was affirmed on appeal in the D.C. Circuit. The court decided in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and FLRA</span>, 110 F.3d 810, 813-16 (D.C. Cir. 1997), that the effect of government-wide regulations was to remove the substance of the proposal from the bargaining table:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is not a new issue for this court.&#x2003;This is at least the fourth time that these two parties have clashed over the negotiability of union competitive area proposals. In <span class="Italic">Local 32, Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, AFL-CIO v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 498 (D.C. Cir. 1985) [hereinafter <span class="Italic">AFGE I]</span>, the Authority below had held that a union proposal was outside an agency's duty to negotiate because it would affect non-bargaining unit employees. In a different case presenting similar facts, however, the Authority had held that a proposal defining competitive areas was within an agency's duty to negotiate. This court noted the discrepancy between these holdings and remanded the case to the Authority to reconcile the apparent inconsistency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 499-500.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand the Authority announced again that the union's competitive area proposals did not fall within the Agency's duty to negotiate.

<p class="noindent-1">The union contested the Authority's conclusions and its analysis in an appeal to this court. We again agreed with the union and remanded the case to the Authority.

We reminded the Authority of the analogous relationship between the FSLMRS and the National Labor Relations Act and urged it to consider using the private sectors "vitally affects" test in its further consideration of this question. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 992; <span class="Italic">see Allied Chem. &#x0026; Alkali Workers of America, Local Union No. 1 v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co.</span>, 404 U.S. 157, 179, 92 S. Ct. 383, 397-98, 30 L. Ed.2d 341 (1971). The "vitally affects" test has been used in the private sector to expand "the scope of mandatory bargaining subjects to include issues directly relating to non-employees or other conditions [outside the bargaining unit], so long as a sufficient nexus with the employees' interests can be shown." <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1440 (quoting CHARLES J. MORRIS, THE DEVELOPING LABOR LAW 765 (2d ed. 1983)) (alteration in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accepting our suggestion, the Authority began to use the "vitally affects" test to determine the negotiability of union proposals. Applying that test to the proposals involved in <span class="Italic">AFGE I and AFGE II</span>, the Authority found that the proposals were negotiable because they "vitally affect[ed]" the working conditions of employees in the bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 32, AFL-CIO and Office of Personnel Management</span>, 33 FLRA 335, 338-39 (1988). The OPM appealed the decision to this court, challenging both the result and the Authority's use of the "vitally affects" test. We denied its petition. We did not, however, consider whether the "vitally affects" test had been appropriately applied. We held that the law of the case doctrine and justiciability concerns barred us from considering the challenge. <span class="Italic">United States Office of Personnel Management v. FLRA</span>, 905 F.2d 31, 433-35 (D.C. Cir. 1990) [hereinafter <span class="Italic">AFGE III</span>].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority therefore went on resolving negotiability disputes by asking whether the proposal "vitally affected" the working conditions of employees in the relevant bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Council of Marine Corps Locals and Dep't of the Navy, U.S. Marine Corps</span>, 35 F.L.R.A. 1023, 1030-33 (1990). The appropriateness of this practice went unreviewed until this court considered the question in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> the Authority applied the "vitally affects" test to proposals concerning promotion practices and parking policy at a military base. The Authority found the proposals to be negotiable and the Navy brought a petition challenging the Authority's "adoption, construction and application" of the "vitally affects" test. <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1436. We approved the Authority's decision to adopt the "vitally affects" test, but held that the Authority's construction and application of the test were flawed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1439. Contrary to the Authority's practice, the "vitally affects" test is applicable only when the subject of the proposal is outside the scope of mandatory bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1440.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, and of greater relevance for this case, we also held that the vitally affects test is not applicable if a union proposal "directly implicate[s]," "purports to regulate," or "seek[s] to regulate" the working conditions of supervisory personnel or members of other bargaining units. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 141-143. Such proposals are always non-negotiable. The present case requires us to expound on this aspect of <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine the negotiability of the union's proposal, we must first ascertain whether it "directly implicates," "purports to regulate," or "seeks to regulate" the working conditions of supervisors. If it does, the proposal is outside the Agency's duty to negotiate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note at the outset that the Authority has not been consistent in its application of <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>. In <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>, the Authority focused on the union's intent in determining whether the proposal "purported" to regulate the working conditions of supervisory personnel. If the effect on supervisors was a result of the operation of a federal regulation rather than the result of the union's intent, the Agency could not claim that the proposal "purported" to regulate the working conditions of supervisors and was for that reason outside the duty to negotiate. In <span class="Italic">IFPTE </span>and in its opinion in this case, however, the Authority relied not on the union's expressed intent, but rather on the effect that the proposal would have on the working conditions of supervisory personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are not suggesting, however, that the Authority has been arbitrary or capricious. Rather, as we noted above, the Authority expressly rejected its <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span> reasoning in its decision in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> op. at p. 813, <span class="Italic">supra</span> (citing 51 FLRA 491, 1995 WL 649037, at *10 (1995)). The Union argues to us now that the Authority's approach in <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span> is correct. It reads our use of the terms "purport" and "seek" in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> to require the Authority to determine the negotiability of a proposal by looking to the intent of the union as it is expressed in the language of the proposal itself. In the Union's view, its proposal does not say anything about the working conditions of supervisory personnel, and therefore cannot be said to "purport" or "seek" to regulate their working conditions or "directly implicate" them. The Union contends that its proposal is therefore negotiable so long as it "vitally affects" the working conditions of members of its bargaining unit. Due to the central importance of the RIF process, the Union maintains that its competitive area proposal clearly meets that standard and is within the Agency's duty to negotiate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority disagrees.&#x2003;It rejects as contrary to statute, common sense, and <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> the Union's "myopic" focus on the language of the proposal. It interprets <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> to mean that a union proposal that "preclusively determines" or "mandate[s]" working conditions for supervisory personnel is outside the scope of the agency's duty to negotiate. In this case the union proposed a redefinition of OPM's competitive areas. OPM regulations require that competitive areas be defined so as to include all employees within the area. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.402(b). Supervisors work within the competitive area that the union proposes to define. Therefore, the Authority contends that the union's proposal "purports" to regulate the working conditions of supervisors and is outside the Agency's duty to negotiate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority is correct.&#x2003;All the Union has to offer in support of its position is a strained interpretation of the <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> court's use of the word "purports." Its interpretation is easily rejected. Its most obvious flaw is that it is completely counter to the approach we took in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> itself. In <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> we focused, not on the language that the union used in crafting its proposal, but on the effect that the union proposal would have if the agency accepted it. We held that the proposals in question in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> were nonnegotiable. We did not base our holdings on <span id="page_1039"></span>the fact that the union proposals, if accepted, would have <span class="Italic">some effect </span>on the working conditions of supervisors or members of other bargaining units. Nearly every bargaining proposal, if accepted, will have some effect on non-unit personnel. We found that the union's proposals were non-negotiable because, if accepted, they would govern the working conditions of supervisors and employees in other bargaining units. This is the distinction that we were drawing through our use of terms such as "directly implicate," "seek to regulate," and "purport to regulate."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An analysis of the two parking proposals mentioned in the opinion makes this point clear.&#x2003;The first proposal is the one the union submitted. The union's proposal called "for the establishment of an 'open' parking policy for all employees and supervisory personnel working at the <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> installation." <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1436. We held that this proposal was outside the agency's duty to negotiate. The second parking proposal, a hypothetical mentioned at oral argument and discussed in the opinion, called for "all parking at Cherry Point [to] be reserved for employees in the Local 2297 unit<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1441. We said that this proposal was negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The significant difference between these proposals is not that the first mentions the interests of the supervisors and the second does not or that the first impacts non-unit personnel and the second does not. The crucial difference is that the first would have bound the agency <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> the parking rights of members of other bargaining units and supervisors, and the second would not have. Had the agency accepted the second proposal, it would have had severely limited options regarding the parking privileges of these other employees and supervisors (and that is why the proposal would likely have been unreasonable, despite being negotiable) but it still could have worked with these other groups to arrive at some other arrangement. The first proposal, by contrast, would have defined parking privileges not just for members of the union's bargaining unit, but also for members of other bargaining units and supervisory personnel. Because this would be counter to basic principles of labor law, we held that the union's parking proposal was non-negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this principle to the facts of this case, it is clear that the Union's competitive area proposal is not within the agency's duty to negotiate. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.402(b) and <span class="Italic">U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Merit Sys. Protection Bd</span>. require that a competitive area be defined to include all workers in an area. The Union's proposal, if implemented, would therefore govern the competitive area not only for members of the Union's bargaining unit, but also for supervisory personnel. As the <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> court made clear, such a proposal is outside an agency's duty to negotiate. The Authority's decision was therefore correct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union emphasizes repeatedly that it does not intend to define the competitive area for supervisors.&#x2003;Its proposal has this effect only because of the necessary operation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.402(b). The Authority noted that this placed the Union in a difficult position, where it might never be able to force the Agency to bargain bilaterally over the definition of competitive areas. 51 FLRA 491, 1995 WL 649037, at *10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We acknowledge that this ruling puts the Union in a difficult position.&#x2003;Difficult though that position may be, it seems to be contemplated by the FSLMRS. Under &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1) the duty to bargain in good faith does not extend to proposals that are inconsistent with federal law or government-wide regulations. This statutory provision appears to give the government the ability to make certain categories of proposals non-negotiable by adopting government-wide regulations covering those subjects. This is essentially what the government did here. The FSLMRS gives the Union the right to negotiate only for employees who are members of its bargaining unit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1). Supervisors may not belong to any bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(1). Because of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.402(b), however, the Union's proposal will determine competitive areas for supervisors as well as for members of the Union's bargaining unit. The Union's proposal therefore exceeds the negotiating authority that it is given under the FSLMRS. It is inconsistent with federal law and outside the Agency's duty to negotiate. <span class="Italic">See AFGE III</span>, 905 F.2d at 436 (Silberman, J., concurring).</p>
<p class="noindent">During all this litigation over the negotiability of competitive areas, related decisions issued, with varying results. A proposal concerning the competitive area for RIF purposes that affected the assignment rights of employees of another bargaining unit was nonnegotiable. The scope of bargaining extended only to matters directly affecting the conditions of employment in the unit of recognition. <span class="Italic">SEIU Local 556 and Dept. of Army, Office of Adjutant Gen., Hale Koa Hotel, Honolulu</span>, 9 FLRA 687, 688 (1982). Another proposal that established a competitive area affecting non-bargaining unit employees was not within the mandatory duty to bargain. That duty did not extend to matters concerning positions and employees outside the unit. The agency could bargain over those matters if it so chose. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1379 and Dept. of Interior, BLM, Ore. State Office</span>, 15 FLRA 796 (1984). Regardless of the intent of a union proposal, if the proposal to define a competitive area impacted on the RIF rights and competitive area of nonunit employees the agency was not required to negotiate the proposal. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1705 and GSA</span>, 17 FLRA 945, 946 (1985). Because any definition of a competitive area would include supervisory personnel, proposals were not negotiable inasmuch as they affected nonunit personnel. A proposal could not be limited to negotiation of a competitive area for just unit personnel that would not affect nonunit personnel. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R7-23 and Dept. of Air Force, Hq. 375th Air Base Group, Scott AFB</span>, 19 FLRA 491, 492 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 51 FLRA 491, 502 (1995) (applying reformulated "vitally affects" test to preclude negotiability of proposal defining competitive areas when proposal necessarily impacted working conditions of supervisory personnel); <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, Region X</span>, 25 FLRA 1041 (1987) (Proposal 2, defining competitive area, was outside scope of bargaining because proposal was broad enough to include supervisory or nonunit personnel).</p>
<p class="noindent">Unions were in a difficult position. They could not negotiate competitive areas that impacted employees outside the unit, but they had problems negotiating proposals that limited competitive areas to the unit of recognition. A proposal that in part defined a competitive area in terms of positions in particular bargaining units rather than solely in terms of organizational units and geographical locations was inconsistent with OPM government-wide regulations, requiring both that competitive areas be defined solely in terms of an agency's organizational units and geographical location and that the competitive area include all employees within the competitive area. <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, Region VI, Dallas</span>, 22 FLRA 580, 581 (1986) (Proposal 1); <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, Region X</span>, 25 FLRA 1041 (1987) (Proposal 2 was nonnegotiable because definition of competitive area was sufficiently broad that it could include nonunit personnel or supervisors). Unions could not negotiate for placement across competitive areas. A demand was nonnegotiable that the employer provide for assignments across competitive areas to positions that any Group I or Group II had held through promotion or to an essentially identical position. OPM regulations permit employees in a competitive area to compete only with each other, not with employees in another competitive area. <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, Region VI, Dallas</span>, 22 FLRA 580, 584 (1986) (Proposal 3).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 11 and Dept. of Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard</span>, 47 FLRA 1350, 1354 (1993), resolved as nonnegotiable, contrary to government-wide OPM regulations, a proposal that sought to create a competitive area limited to a defined group of employees. Contrary to 5 CFR 351.402(b) (2022), the coverage of the competitive area would not have been defined in terms of all employees within an agency's organizational unit or geographical location. Under <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Wage &#x0026; Investment Div.</span>, 60 FLRA 219, 222 (2004) (Proposal 2), assuming that the difficulty is not with the effect of a proposal defining a competitive area upon supervisors, a proposal will still interfere with management's right to layoff employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) if there is no allowance for the proposal as a procedure or arrangement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-203 and Dept. of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Serv.</span>, 55 FLRA 1081, 1089-90 (1999) (Proposal 6) (same result as <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770 and Defense Commissary Agency, Central Region</span>, 52 FLRA 904, 907 (1997) (proposal was inconsistent with government-wide regulations that defined competitive area to include only bargaining unit employees); <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-6 and Dept. of Army, Applied Aviation Tech. Directorate</span>, 52 FLRA 124, 127 (1996) (proposal was nonnegotiable that would limit bump and retreat rights of individuals within same competitive area in manner inconsistent with 5 CFR 351.402(a), 5 CFR 351.701); <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-45 and DOD, Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 52 FLRA 354 (1996); <span class="Italic">IFPTE and Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Security Force Battalion Pac.</span>, 47 FLRA 1086, 1088-89 (1993) (nonnegotiable: competitive area that exceeded scope of bargaining unit).</p>
<p class="noindent">Through 1995 and <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 51 FLRA 491 (1995), FLRA declared negotiable proposals that defined competitive areas, e.g., <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Marine Corps Locals and Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps</span>, 35 FLRA 1023, 1030 (1990) (Proposal 2), and FLRA pronounced nonnegotiable proposals that limited competitive areas in violation of OPM regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">West Point Elem. Sch. Teachers Ass'n and U.S. Military Academy West Point Elem. Sch.</span>, 34 FLRA 1008, 1018 (1990) (nonnegotiable: Provision 3, provision restricting competitive area to particular school). If proposals seeking to determine competitive areas had an impact under OPM regulations on individuals outside the bargaining unit, the proposals were under the "vitally affects" test. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE HUD Council 222 and DHUD</span>, 23 FLRA 552 (1986), <span class="Italic">rev'd on remand</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE HUD Council 222 and DHUD</span>, 33 FLRA 503 (1988) (following <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 33 FLRA 335 (1988)). FLRA explained its pre-1995 stance as to negotiability of proposals involving competitive areas in <span class="Italic">Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees Org. and Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, Nat'l Weather Serv.</span>, 44 FLRA 18, 24-28 (1992) (also addressing budget-impact argument):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the provision and the proposal are nonnegotiable because of their impact on employees in another bargaining unit.&#x2003;In the past, we have rejected arguments that proposals are nonnegotiable because they affect employees in another bargaining unit. We held that a proposal's effect on non-unit employees and positions, including employees and positions in other bargaining units, was not dispositive of the negotiability of the proposal.... Rather, we held that a proposal that affected employees or positions outside the bargaining unit was negotiable under the Statute if it vitally affected the working conditions of unit employees and was consistent with applicable law and regulation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the fact that the competitive areas defined by the provision and the proposal encompass <span id="page_1040"></span>management personnel as well as bargaining unit employees does not indicate that the Union is seeking to regulate the conditions of employment of the management personnel. Rather, it represents an effort to draft a proposal directly affecting the competitive areas of bargaining unit employees that meets the regulatory requirements governing the definition of competitive areas. Therefore, we conclude that the Union does not, through the provision and the proposal, purport or seek to regulate the terms and conditions of employment of management personnel.</p>
