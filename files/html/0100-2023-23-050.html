<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-51"><span class="space">l.</span> Fraud; Misrepresentation; Bad Faith; Merit of the Underlying Action</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The PFR is usually the proper means for raising an allegation that an agreement is void for fraud. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. DOJ</span>, 66 MSPR 366, 368 (1995) (enforcement petition is properly presented at the regional office to obtain enforcement of the settlement or to obtain rescission of the agreement for noncompliance, but a PFR must be timely filed from the initial decision accepting the settlement if fraud is alleged as a basis for setting the agreement aside). <span class="Italic">McKinney v. USDA</span>, 70 MSPR 165, 166-67 (1996), explained the distinction between attempting to set aside an agreement procured by fraud or duress and enforcement of a settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an administrative judge dismisses an appeal as settled, a party <span id="Page_4823"></span>who believes that the agreement is invalid because it was obtained by fraud or coercion, or because it was based on mutual mistake, may file a petition for review of the initial decision and seek to have the settlement agreement set aside. <span class="Italic">See Keith v. US Postal Service</span>, 56 MSPR 668, 669-70 (1993). If, however, a party is not challenging the validity of the settlement agreement, but believes that the other party has failed to comply with a term of the agreement, he may file a petition for enforcement with the regional or field office that issued the initial decision<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 670.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's September 19, 1995, submission alleges noncompliance with the settlement agreement. While the appellant continues to allege noncompliance in his October 5, 1995, submission, he also claims fraud based on the agency's alleged intent not to comply with the settlement agreement, and he seeks to have the settlement agreement set aside on that basis. Thus, the appellant has stated a ground for us to review his submission as a petition for review. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 669-70.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The party seeking to set aside a settlement agreement must show that it is tainted with invalidity either by fraud or by mutual mistake<span class="Italic">. See Asberry v. US Postal Service</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982). The appellant has submitted no evidence of a predisposition on the part of the agency towards noncompliance with the settlement agreement. Instead, the appellant makes only a bare allegation that he is "under the impression" that the agency "never meant" to comply with the agreement. The appellant has failed to present sufficient evidence or argument to support his assertion of agency fraud. Therefore, his submission does not meet the criteria for review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115; <span class="Italic">Viens-Koretko v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 53 MSPR 160, 162-63 (1992) (absent specific evidence and argument demonstrating error by the administrative judge, a party's bare assertions on petition for review do not warrant Board consideration).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim of noncompliance, however, must be addressed. Where a settlement agreement has been entered into the record for enforcement and the appellant alleges noncompliance with the agreement in a petition for review, those allegations of noncompliance will be forwarded to the regional or field office for processing as a petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See Greco v. Department of the Interior</span>, 52 MSPR 357, 361 (1992)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Checkley v. VA</span>, AT-1221-16-0454-W-1 (NP 6/14/2022) ("A settlement agreement is a contract between the parties and its terms are to be interpreted as a question of contract law. <span class="Italic">Wofford v. Department of Justice</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 6 (2010). An appellant may challenge the validity of a settlement agreement if she believes it was unlawful, involuntary, or the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Forston v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 154, 162 (1993), explained the rule, and its variant, when breach and fraud issues are concurrently raised:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's usual practice in circumstances such as these where an appellant raises both fraud and new compliance issues in a petition for review is to adjudicate the fraud issue but forward the new compliance issues to the regional office for adjudication in the first instance<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Whiteside v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 56 MSPR 173, 174-75 (1992); <span class="Italic">McGann v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 55 MSPR 216, 218 (1992). However, in this case, such a practice could lead to inconsistent or even mutually exclusive results. For example, the Board could conceivably find the settlement agreement void due to fraud and order reinstatement of the appellant's removal appeal while, at the same time, the administrative judge could find the agency in noncompliance with the settlement agreement and order its enforcement. Thus, to avoid this possible anomalous result and, in the interest of judicial efficiency, we find that the appellant's new allegations of fraud and agency noncompliance with the settlement agreement are properly matters for initial consideration by the administrative judge<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Sharkey v. Department of Transportation</span>, 56 MSPR 156, 158 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 11 F.3d 1070, No. 93-3187 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 12, 1993) (Table); <span class="Italic">Jackson v.

<p class="Body-Text">A PFR asserting fraud or bad faith must be filed within the regulatory time limit, beginning with the appellant's knowledge of or concerns about the agency's misconduct, <span class="Italic">Ferreira v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 48 MSPR 80, 81-83 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 1, 1990, the agency suspended the appellant for 40 days from his position of Mine Safety and Health Inspector, based upon charges of misusing government property, misusing a government vehicle and falsifying a government document. The appellant filed an appeal of this action with the Board's Denver Regional Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to the hearing scheduled in this case, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. Under the terms of this agreement, the appellant did not admit to any wrongdoing, he accepted a suspension of 12 days, and the agency promised to expunge the adverse action in 15 months, including its allegations of the charged misconduct, "conditioned upon no other adverse actions being initiated and finally sustained (after all appeal rights have been exhausted) against the appellant by MSHS [the agency] if any adverse actions are initiated during the fifteen month period." The parties entered this agreement into the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 4, 1991, the appellant filed a motion to "clarify" or vacate the settlement agreement with the Denver Regional Office. The appellant asserted that, at the time he and the agency entered into the settlement agreement, the agency was conducting an investigation of possible misconduct he committed prior to his August 1, 1990 suspension, and that the agency failed to disclose this matter to him during settlement negotiations. The appellant also asserted that 11 days after the agency signed the settlement, it initiated a pre-disciplinary inquiry with respect to alleged misconduct occurring prior to his previous suspension, and that this inquiry culminated in a December 20, 1990 notice of proposed suspension of 15 days, that included a reference to the previously settled suspension as evidence of the appellant's continued unwillingness to adhere to agency policies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued that the agency's investigation and initiation of another adverse action evidenced bad faith on its part during the settlement negotiations, and that, had he known of the investigation, he would not have entered into the settlement agreement. The appellant also stated that his disclaimer of wrongdoing in the settlement precludes the agency from considering it in a subsequent action, and that any misconduct occurring prior August 1, 1990, must be subsumed into the previous adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his sworn statement, the appellant explained that he did not file his petition for review by December 6, 1990, because he believed that he had provided the agency with a satisfactory explanation for the matters under inquiry and could not file a petition for review on the basis of the agency's "concerns." The appellant further states that the agency did not take final action suspending him for 7 days until February 1, 1991, and he then submitted his petition promptly on February 4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may extend the 35-day time limit for filing a petition for review for good cause shown. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.114(f). Factors for consideration in determining whether good cause has been shown for extending the time limit include the length of the delay and whether the appellant was notified of the time limit or was otherwise aware of it. <span class="Italic">See Morderosian v. General Services</span> <span class="Italic">Administration,</span> 29 MSPR 17, 18 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that the appellant's reasons for the late filing are insufficient to establish good cause for extending the time limit for filing a petition for review because the appellant has not shown that he exercised due diligence to protect his right to review. The appellant's submission establishes that he was aware about the existence of an investigation at the time he entered into the settlement, and became concerned about this matter when he learned of the contents of the investigation 11 days after entering into the settlement. Indeed, because the appellant asserted that he would not have entered into the settlement had he known about the subject of the investigation, the reasonably prudent course of action would have been to file his petition upon learning of the investigation, or at least, upon receiving the notice of proposed suspension on December 20, 1990. Instead, the appellant waited until receiving the agency's decision. Accordingly, we find that this delay does not constitute good cause for his filing delay. <span class="Italic">See Claussen v. Department of the Navy,</span> 47 MSPR 262, 266-267 (1991).[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;In reaching this conclusion, we note that our decision does not preclude the appellant from pursing an enforcement action with the Regional Office under 5 CFR Part 1201, Subpart F.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because fraud must be timely raised through PFR, the appellant has a duty to make himself reasonably aware of events involving implementation of a settlement. A lapse of more than two years in checking documentation in an OPF was not excused when the appellant discovered and then alleged that documentation of a suspension arrived at through settlement carried the wrong reason for the suspension. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Graves v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...He urges that the agency "made illusory promises designed to entice [him] into settling their dispute and once he withdrew his right to a hearing, the [a]gency's bargain, the [a]gency intended to deny him the benefit of his bargain." To the extent that this is a distinct invalidity argument based on "bad faith" in the formation of the contract, rather than a post-settlement breach of the implied covenant of good faith, it is similarly flawed for lack of jurisdiction in this petition for enforcement. <span id="Page_4824"></span>We also note that these bald allegations of bad faith, unsupported by any corroborating evidence, fall far short of meeting the "heavy burden" to prove that the settlement agreement was invalid. <span class="Italic">Asberry v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that, in April 2004, he discovered that the agency had granted his former attorney a consulting contract, supporting his suspicion that this former attorney and the agency had conspired to coerce him into agreeing to the settlement terms set forth at the November 12, 2003 hearing. He contends that he did not want to accept the settlement at the time, but agreed only due to coercion by his former attorney and the agency. The appellant's allegations are insufficient to demonstrate that the settlement was the result of impermissible coercion or duress by the agency or his former attorney that would warrant voiding the settlement agreement. The appellant has presented no evidence establishing that his former attorney engaged in contract negotiations with the agency prior to March 2004, four months after the settlement agreement was reached. The fact that the agency procured the services of the appellant's former attorney some four months <span class="Italic">after</span> the settlement is not of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that of the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appeal was remanded to the AJ when the settlement agreement submitted by the agency was, the appellant alleged, not the agreement he signed and the format of the agreement was irregular on its face.

<p class="Body-Text">Notwithstanding the law relating to invalidation through the PFR process of a settlement reached in bad faith or through fraud, an appellant may, through an enforcement proceeding, attempt to show that agency bad faith, apparently either in the formation or execution of the settlement, constitutes a breach of an agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ortega v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, an agency's post-settlement harassment and retaliation against an appellant could establish its noncompliance with a settlement term like the one at issue here. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Kuykendall v.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1988). To establish a breach of the settlement agreement based on this implied covenant of good faith, it is the appellant's burden to show that the agency's proven retaliatory/harassing actions, under the totality of the circumstances, amounted to an unjustified and substantial deprivation of his rights as an incumbent of the position in question. <span class="Italic">E.g., Nance v. Department of Transportation</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 68, 71 (1992). Because the appellant is raising a compliance issue pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182, and because the Board has retained jurisdiction over the settlement agreement, we forward this appeal to the regional office for adjudication as a petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also Briones v.

"Bad faith" in this context is not simply bad judgment or negligence but instead implies conscious wrongdoing because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find that the alleged facts, even if proven, would not support a finding that the agency acted in "bad faith" amounting to a breach of the agreement. The agency communicated with the appellant to arrange for the timely payment to him required by the agreement, and, as a result, he received timely payment. We find no indicia of "bad faith" in the agency's actions to comply with the agreement....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, even if we assume that the appellant negotiated and executed the settlement agreement under the mistaken assumption that her grade had not been reduced, the appellant's unsubstantiated allegation that the agency acted in bad faith by failing to correct her misapprehension in this regard is insufficient to set aside the agreement. <span class="Italic">Wells v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schultz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 667, 671-72 (1988), remanded to the region to consider a challenge to a settlement based on misrepresentation by the agency concerning the availability of a particular position for the appellant upon reinstatement. As to that issue and as to another allegation--that the agency placed the appellant into a position beyond her qualifications or training--the Board determined that fraud or mutual mistake could be a basis for setting aside an agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if coercion is not apparent at the time of settlement, however, the settlement agreement must be set aside if it is subsequently shown by new evidence that the contract is tainted with invalidity, either by fraud or by mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">See Asberry</span> <span class="Italic">v. United States,</span> 692 F.2d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Hazlett v. Department of Justice,</span> 25 MSPR 623, 625 (1985). The appellant asserts that the settlement she entered into is tainted with invalidity by fraud because the agency falsely represented that no position existed at the GS-12 level to which she could be assigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence of the EEO Officer's retirement, which forms the basis of the appellant's allegation of invalidity, became known to her after she signed the settlement agreement and thus is new.... If the agency knew of the impending retirement and withheld that information from the appellant, the appellant's evidence also would be material because it could warrant a finding of agency fraud in the settlement process. Further, if both parties based their agreement on an assumption that no position at the GS-12 level, to which the appellant could be assigned, would be available reasonably soon, the appellant's evidence could warrant a finding of mutual mistake.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's allegation of mutual mistake with regard to her being assigned to a position for which she is not qualified is really an assertion of agency lack of compliance.... Although she agreed to accept a position in the Civilian Personnel Department rather than one in the Housing Division, the agreement cannot be read as permitting assignment to a position which the appellant does not have the means to perform. Nor can it be permitted to be used for assignment to a sham position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, on remand the administrative judge should, if she finds no agency fraud with regard to the agreement, accept evidence and argument concerning the agency's compliance with such agreement with particular regard to the appellant's claims that she does not have the training and experience to perform the duties of the position she accepted in that agreement and that she has not been provided with office facilities necessary for performance....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, an appeal was remanded for factual development of an allegation that during settlement negotiations the agency withheld information concerning the availability of a position that could have been obtained through reassignment rather than downgrade, <span class="Italic">Henson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 86 MSPR 221, 223-24 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleges that the settlement agreement is invalid because it was the result of agency misrepresentation. Specifically, he alleges that the agency's representative misled him during settlement negotiations by telling him that there were no GS-13 positions at the Help Desk to which he could be reassigned. He asserts that he later learned that, at the time these representations were made to him, one of the GS-13 employees at the Help Desk had retired, and another GS-13 employee, Mr. Steve Ralph, was in the process of retiring.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if invalidity is not apparent at the time of settlement, the settlement agreement must be set aside if it is subsequently shown, by new evidence, that the agreement is tainted with invalidity by fraud or misrepresentation. <span class="Italic">See Schultz v. Department of the Navy,</span> 37 MSPR 667, 671 (1988). As noted above, the appellant states that he did not learn about the retirements in question until after he signed the settlement agreement. Therefore, if proven, this would constitute new evidence. Further, if the agency knew of the retirements, and withheld that information from the appellant, this would be material evidence because it could warrant a finding of agency misrepresentation in the settlement process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of facts which, if proven, could justify setting aside the settlement agreement. Therefore, we find it appropriate to remand the appeal to the regional office to afford the appellant an opportunity to prove his allegation of misrepresentation with regard to the vacant Help Desk positions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to set aside a settlement with terms that were reasonably clear, although allowing some flexibility as to placement of the appellant, when the appellant maintained the agency representative promised more than was delivered during mediation leading to settlement, <span class="Italic">Littlefield v. Dept. of Navy,</span> AT-0752-15-0408-I-1 (NP 2/17/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant states that, during mediation, the agency represented that it could immediately place him into a GS-8 position. He claims that, to the contrary, there was no GS-8 position into which he could be immediately placed when the agreement was fully executed.<span class="Italic"></span> He further asserts that a GS-8 position did not become available until September 20, 2015, and that, as of September 22, 2015, the date he filed his petition for review, the agency had yet to reinstate him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In construing a settlement agreement, the Board will first consider the terms of the agreement itself, and will only examine extrinsic evidence if the terms of the agreement are ambiguous, meaning they are susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 4 (2005). The settlement agreement did not state that the appellant would be "immediately" placed into a GS-8 position. Rather, it stated that the agency would "act in good faith" to reinstate the appellant "as quickly as possible." Thus, regardless of whether the agency told the appellant during settlement negotiations that it would reinstate him immediately, we cannot find that he was misled when he voluntarily signed a settlement agreement that plainly stated otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also suggests that he only agreed to accept a GS-8 position because, during mediation, the agency falsely advised him that no GS-9 positions were available at that time. However, in paragraph 2 of the settlement agreement, the parties agreed that neither party would be "bound by any representation, promise, nor inducement not set forth" therein. Thus, the appellant cannot now rely upon the agency's alleged assertion that no GS-9 positions were available, which is not set forth in the settlement agreement, to support his claim of misrepresentation. <span class="Italic">See Hopkins v.

We are not aware of, and the appellant has not identified, any Board or Federal Circuit decision involving an agency misrepresentation regarding another employee. Nevertheless, we find it appropriate to rely on <span class="Italic">Hazelton</span> and <span class="Italic">Henson</span> because they are consistent <span id="Page_4826"></span>with a body of precedent involving waivers of Board appeal rights and withdrawals of Board appeals through, or as a result of, settlement agreements, all of which are grounded in the basic principle that an appellant's actions must be knowing and voluntary. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wyatt v.

Indeed, the Board has held that an employee's decision to enter into a settlement agreement "is considered involuntary if it resulted from the employee's reasonable reliance on the agency's misleading statements, or from the agency's failure to provide the employee with adequate information on which to make an informed choice." <span class="Italic">Pawlowski v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because these principles have broad applicability, it is appropriate to extend the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Hazelton</span> and <span class="Italic">Henson</span> to the appellant's claim of agency misrepresentation involving another employee.

Indeed, if the agency representative knew that the agency intended to reinstate or had reinstated the other party to the altercation and stated otherwise to the appellant, this would be material evidence because it could warrant a finding of agency misrepresentation in the settlement process. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board considered and dismissed allegations of fraud relating to settlement when the agency maintained and did not disclose the existence of a secret file concerning one aspect of the appeal. <span class="Italic">Koury v. SBA</span>, 40 MSPR 172, 176 (1989) (allegation of fraud dismissed for lack of proof that agency representative had the file or, if he did, that he inappropriately obtained it). In an appeal involving apparent reliance upon incorrect information concerning health insurance benefits, the Board dismissed as untimely a PFR filed after the underlying case was dismissed as settled. The information that triggered the PFR--the knowledge that the agency's information on benefits was wrong--could have been discovered earlier, meaning that the late PFR was not excused. Curiously, the Board did not address the validity of the underlying agreement or remand the matter to the region as a compliance issue that could have been raised without tying the timing of the enforcement petition to the regulatory deadline for filing a PFR. <span class="Italic">Claussen v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 262, 266 (1991).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects, however, that the appellant knew of the existence of findings from FOH and that she repeatedly sought this information from the agency in the months preceding her acceptance of the settlement agreement. She thus could have refused to enter into the settlement agreement until the agency provided the information from FOH. In these circumstances, the appellant, who was represented by counsel at the time, cannot now claim that this information would have been material to her decision to enter into the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Wobschall v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 521, 524 (finding that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of an involuntary resignation pursuant to a settlement agreement based on alleged breach by the agency, because the appellant knew of the agency's alleged breach before he tendered his resignation), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 918 F.2d 187 (Fed.

Accordingly, we find that the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agreement should be invalidated based on fraud.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant's claim is that the settlement was obtained by fraud because the agency withheld information sought by the appellant and blocked by agency objections during discovery, the appellant's claim will not likely succeed without a showing of wrongful intent by the agency, <span class="Italic">Cassidy v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not presented any evidence showing that the agency's objection to his request for production of the polygraph charts was not a true expression of its opinion that the documents were not relevant, or that the agency made such an objection only to deceive him. <span class="Italic">See Nance v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transportation</span>, 55 MSPR 68, 71 (1992). Moreover, the appellant has presented no evidence showing that the agency was aware, at the time of the settlement discussions, that the results of the polygraph examinations were actually inconclusive or leaned toward the deceptive end of the scale. Therefore, we conclude that he has not shown good cause for his untimeliness and that there is no basis for our waiving the filing deadline<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board disavowed interest in looking behind a settlement in the unusual case of <span class="Italic">Campbell v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 122, 127(1991). The appellant was fired for advocating the hiring of his son. He settled for a downgrade. After the settlement, the appellant sought to set the agreement aside because, he asserted, one of the leading witnesses recanted his allegations and allegedly told the agency representative (but not the appellant) of the recantation prior to the Board hearing. The Board refused to intercede. First, the appellant should have used discovery in some fashion, perhaps to learn of the recantation, perhaps to have the witness testify under oath. Second, the affidavit the appellant obtained from the witness pertained to the proof of the charges, i.e., the alleged misconduct; the evidence did not directly pertain to the validity of the settlement. Finally, the Board attempted to evaluate the evidence and the strength of what it thought might have been produced by the agency from other sources. The Board concluded that, although there was a conflict between the affidavit and the statement offered by the agency representative as to what was said to him by the affiant, the Board could "only speculate" as to what the outcome of the appeal would have been had the AJ received the recanter's testimony. In sum, the Board determined in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, "there was no persuasive evidence that the agency wrongfully induced the appellant to settle." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Black v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 279, 280-81 (1994) ("[T]o the extent that the petition for review can be read to assert a claim that the agency acted in bad faith in not correctly informing the administrative judge of the appellant's restoration rights, we find that the agency's position on appeal was not clearly inconsistent with the agency regulation on which the appellant relies and is not probative of fraud such as would serve to vitiate the settlement."). Similar to <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> is <span class="Italic">Lybrook v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 241, 245 (1991), declining to set aside a settlement after the appellant claimed that the agency harassed one of his witnesses.

<p class="Block-Quote1">"Fraud in the inducement" is defined as "occurring when a misrepresentation leads another to enter into a transaction with a false impression of the risks, duties, or obligations involved; an intentional misrepresentation of a material risk or duty reasonably relied on, thereby injuring the other party without vitiating the contract itself." Black's Law Dictionary 671 (7th Ed. 1999). To establish that a settlement agreement resulted from fraud in the inducement, the appellant must show that the agency knowingly concealed a material fact or intentionally misled her. <span class="Italic">See Armstrong v. Department of Transportation</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 7 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant contends that the agency's pre-hearing submission and the accompanying motion to dismiss in the compliance matter demonstrate that the agency did not purge negative information about her from its files, which thereby shows that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the agency did, knowingly, as well as intentionally, conceal and/or misrepresent the material fact that its actual intention...at the time of the negotiations, as well as at the time when the agreement was executed, was to retain and/or preserve these same referenced documents and/or records on a long term basis in the agency's files which are described and/or identified by the agency as being a litigation database, as well as an Office of Investigation[s] file.... [T]he agency intentionally deceived the appellant by using all of the elements of fraud.... It is clearly established, therefore, that any reasonable person would have been misled given the fact that the agency falsely indicated that a meeting of the minds existed between the parties when the agency did, on June 18, 2002, execute the parties['] MSPB settlement agreement....

<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the mere fact that the agency did not purge negative information about the appellant from its files and, thus, may have breached the settlement agreement, is insufficient on its own to establish that the agency never intended to purge the files and that it knowingly concealed a material fact or intentionally misled her. <span class="Italic">See Armstrong</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 7.

OPM disapproved the appellant's retirement application. The appellant claimed that before entering into the settlement, the agency provided information to OPM that led to disapproval of the retirement. The failure to disclose the communications to OPM was alleged by the appellant to constitute fraudulent inducement to enter an agreement that the agency knew would not afford the appellant the benefit of the bargain he sought. The Board remanded the appeal for additional development by the regional office of the allegation of fraud that was raised for the first time in the PFR, following the issuance by OPM of its decision denying the appellant's retirement.</p>

Nor was fraud established by an appellant who asserted that he accepted a RIF through settlement based on misleading information from agency officials concerning pay retention rights. Appellant and his counsel were provided copies of regulations governing grade and pay retention benefits, and they examined those regulations prior to signing the settlement. The regulations addressed the point in contention. The agreement was a result of careful negotiations; it provided that both parties "'understand fully the terms and conditions of this agreement,'" and that "'they have been afforded the opportunity to carefully review this agreement and have consulted with counsel.'" <span class="Italic">Gutierrez v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that the agreement was tainted by fraud because his union representative misrepresented certain facts to him and took advantage of his depressed state of mind in order to induce him to enter into the agreement. He has submitted several affidavits in support of his allegations. Specifically, the appellant alleges that: (1) He requested that he attend the prehearing conference but his representative advised him that he was prohibited from doing so by Board regulations; (2) his representative informed him that the administrative judge had already decided in favor of the agency.... The appellant asserts that he would not have entered into the agreement had he not believed that a decision against him had already been made....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant...has not asserted that the agency participated, in any manner, in the alleged fraud.... Thus, even assuming that the appellant's allegations of fraud by his representative are true, the appellant has not shown a basis upon which the Board must set aside the agreement since the appellant is responsible for the actions or inaction of his chosen representative.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant is responsible for fraud on himself by his own representative? What an odd conclusion from an agency that purports to exist in the real world. In <span class="Italic">Hynes</span>, 37 MSPR at 162 n.*, the Board offered the appellant cold comfort by suggesting that his "recourse, if any, is against his union representative, not against the agency." The Board is in error in its analysis, as should have been obvious from its own recognition that the appellant was alleging that his mental condition was impaired. If the appellant was suffering from depression and could not properly analyze his case, he could not have legally consented to the settlement agreement. Beyond the legal point concerning the appellant's condition, however, is the unwillingness of the Board to police its own processes. If what the appellant said was true, the Board's own procedures were subverted: it seems intolerable that the Board could stand by and do nothing to protect the appellant's statutory right to a hearing after the adjudicator is confronted with allegations that its decisional processes were completely misrepresented to the appellant. The proper course for the Board is to investigate those allegations and to bar representatives from further practice before the Board if those representatives are found to have been involved in significant misconduct. The remedy is not to deprive the appellant of his statutory right to a hearing. As a practical matter, the "right of action" the Board proclaims against the union representative is no more than an invitation to additional, collateral, expensive, and uncertain litigation. Current case law makes it difficult, if not impossible, to join the government in fair representation litigation, meaning that the employer's resources are not available to pay the employee's damages and meaning also that the employee cannot recover his job or clear his record. The likelihood is small that the local union or union representative has a pocket deep enough for an individual's back pay, front pay, and associated benefits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Noncompliance is not fraud. If the agency fails to meet its obligations under a settlement agreement, the remedy is an enforcement petition with the regional office, not a PFR seeking to set aside the agreement (or initial decision adopting it) for fraud. <span class="Italic">Coleman v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3089) ("To the extent Mr. Coleman is arguing that the Postal Service's alleged breach shows that it never intended to honor the agreement and that it therefore fraudulently induced him into dismissing his appeal, that argument fails because Mr. Coleman has not made any showing that the Postal Service acted fraudulently in negotiating or entering into the agreement."); <span class="Italic">Sharkey v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 56 MSPR 156, 158 (1992) ("Even if the agency failed to comply with one provision of the agreement in an untimely manner, and even if it has not yet complied with another provision, we see no basis for finding that these failures would show that the agency misrepresented a material fact or otherwise acted fraudulently. Such failures also would not establish that the parties were mutually mistaken with respect to any material fact."). A material breach may lead to rescission.
