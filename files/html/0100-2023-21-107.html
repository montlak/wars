<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-106"><span id="Page_4222"></span><span class="space">b.</span> Notice to Annuitant of Necessity to Notify OPM of Remarriage to Secure Annuity</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 8339, OPM is required to provide annuitants an annual notice of their right to elect a survivor annuity upon remarriage, and if the election is not made within the statutorily-permitted period, a belated election is ineffective. Questions arise as to the proof by OPM of delivery of the annual notice. <span class="Italic">Davies v. OPM</span>, 5 MSPR 199, 200-03 (1981) (involving an earlier version of the notice and election requirements), considered the general nature of OPM's statement concerning delivery of the required notice and the appellant's specific evidence refuting an inference of receipt of the notice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant, a retired employee, filed a timely petition for appeal from the reconsideration decision of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) denying his election of a reduced retirement annuity with survivor benefits for a spouse acquired after retirement. OPM denied appellant's request because his election was not timely made under 5 U.S.C. 8339(j) "in a signed writing received in the Office within 1 year" after he remarried on November 21, 1978. Appellant waived a hearing and the matter was determined by the presiding official based upon the record. 5 C.F.R. 1201.24(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence of record is clear and mainly uncontroverted. Appellant retired in 1971 and elected a reduced annuity with survivor benefits for his spouse. In May 1975 appellant's spouse died. Appellant did not notify the Civil Service Commission (now OPM) of his spouse's death. Therefore, appellant continued to receive a reduced annuity. Effective October 1, 1978, Congress enacted Pub. L. No. 95-317, 92 Stat. 382 (1978) (the Act), changing survivor benefit provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Act, in part, to permit annuitants who acquired a spouse after retirement to elect receipt of a reduced annuity with a survivor benefit for that spouse. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 8339(j).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 21, 1978, appellant remarried but he did not inform the Civil Service Commission of his remarriage or request a change in his retirement annuity. In mid-December 1979 appellant received from OPM the annual notice required by section 3 of the Act, informing "each annuitant of such annuitant's right of election under sections 8339(j) and 8339(k)(2)." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 8339 note. On January 3, 1980, appellant wrote to OPM informing the agency of the death of his first wife, his subsequent remarriage and election of a reduced annuity with survivor benefits for his present spouse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM denied appellant's election request because the election was not received by OPM within one year after appellant's remarriage as required by section 8339(j). Appellant requested reconsideration and alleged that when he remarried in November 1978 he was not aware of any time limit in notifying OPM of his first wife's death and his subsequent remarriage until he received the notice in mid-December 1979 when it was too late to make a timely election under the statute. OPM's reconsideration decision denied appellant's election request as untimely received under section 8339(j). OPM informed appellant that it would adjust his annuity to its full unreduced rate effective the first day of the month following the death of appellant's previous spouse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant petitioned for appeal from the reconsideration decision. OPM responded to the petition and submitted its file of the case. OPM asserted that under the annual notice provision, section 3 of the Act, all annuitants were first sent notification (by the Civil Service Commission) of their rights of election along with their annuity checks dated September 1, 1978. OPM stated that the notice received by appellant in mid-December 1979 was the second notice he received under the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM asserted in a letter dated June 23, 1980, in response to the petition for appeal, that the first notification required by section 3 of the Act "<span class="Italic">was sent to annuitants</span> with their checks dated September 1, 1978." (Emphasis supplied.) The OPM letter also contained a copy of the first annual notification. However, OPM did not provide any evidence by way of testimony at the hearing, sworn affidavit, records or other exhibits which showed that it specifically mailed the first annual notice of election rights to appellant in September 1978. The copy of the notice, BRI 49-422 (September 1978), was not addressed to appellant nor does it indicate that it was mailed to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board follows the traditional judicial test for hearsay. Under the test, the assessment of the probative value of hearsay evidence necessarily rests on the circumstances of each case. <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Department of Justice,</span> MSPB Order No. SF075209008 at 7 (February 27, 1981). OPM's unverified and unsubstantiated hearsay evidence of delivery to appellant of the first annual notice is not sufficiently supported under the circumstances of this case to establish the probative value of the hearsay evidence. OPM failed to provide testimony or sworn affidavit of the person or persons with firsthand knowledge of the facts to support its assertion that the notice was delivered to appellant, nor did it explain its failure to do so. <span class="Italic">See Borninkhof, supra</span>, at 12. Nor did OPM corroborate its allegation by presenting documentary evidence from its records showing that delivery of the notice to appellant was effected in September 1978. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 13. <span class="Italic">Cf. Legille v. Dann</span>, 544 F.2d 1 (D.C. Cir. 1976).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's assertion that he never received the first notice is consistent with his conduct in this case. Appellant's contention that he would not have continued receipt of a reduced annuity after the death of his first spouse had he received the first notice is credible because under section 8339(j) he would have been entitled to have his annuity retroactively adjusted to its full unreduced rate effective the first full month following the death of his previous spouse. Appellant admitted that he received the second annual notice which OPM mailed in December 1979, but only after he could have made a timely election under the statute. Once appellant received the second notice he ascertained that he had not notified OPM of the death of his first spouse and his subsequent remarriage. Thereafter, appellant immediately notified OPM of these facts and attempted to make his election. Appellant's conduct corroborated his assertion of non-receipt of the notice and was not rebutted by contradictory evidence of delivery by OPM. Therefore, the Board finds that OPM did not provide appellant with the first annual actual notice of his election rights as required by section 3 of the Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that appellant exercised due diligence in attempting to make a timely election under section 8339(j) once he was put on notice of his election rights by receipt of the untimely second annual notice of his election rights. We believe that OPM's failure to provide appellant with timely annual notice so that he could make an effective election should not detrimentally impact on appellant in this case. Under these particular circumstances a necessary exception may be implied to the election requirements of section 8339(j) in order to effectuate the obvious Congressional intent that OPM provide annuitants with annual actual notice of their election rights under section 3 of the Act so that they may make a timely election upon remarriage.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rakowsky v. OPM</span>, 705 Fed. Appx. 986, 989-90 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP), summarizing decisions, explained that OPM properly establishes a presumption that the required notice was sent, and received, through specific declarations by OPM personnel concerning mailing of notices:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the law also provides that a former spouse may receive survivor annuity benefits even without an affirmative election by the annuitant if the annuitant intended to provide the annuity but did not receive the required notice. <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 450 F.3d 1332, 1334-35 (Fed. Cir. 2006). To prove that it provided adequate notice, OPM must establish both "that the notice was actually sent...[and] the contents of the annual notice." <span class="Italic">Brush v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 982 F.2d 1554, 1561 (Fed. Cir. 1992). If OPM can establish through credible evidence that it is more probable than not that the annual notice was sent, the burden of going forward falls upon the petitioner. <span class="Italic">Schoemakers v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 180 F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Rakowsky maintains on appeal that Mr. Rakowsky never received a personal notice from OPM. The Board reviewed OPM's evidence and found that OPM properly notified Mr. Rakowsky of his right to elect a survivor annuity. OPM provided a declaration by Donna G. Lease in which she stated that she sent out annual notices to all annuitants, including Mr. Rakowsky, in December 1997 and December 1998. A declaration of a person familiar with how annual notices are prepared and sent can satisfy OPM's burden to show that the annuitant received the annual notice. <span class="Italic">Schoemakers</span>, 180 F.3d at 1380-81. Further, OPM may satisfy its obligation by sending a general notice announcement rather than providing each annuitant with a personalized notice letter. <span class="Italic">Hairston v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 318 F.3d 1127, 1130 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The notices provided Mr. Rakowsky information regarding how to make an election, the time-frame within which he needed to do so, and the consequences of choosing a survivor annuity benefit. Thus, we agree that the notices were adequate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM having established that the notices were sent, the burden shifts to Ms. Rakowsky to establish that her husband did not receive the annual notice. <span class="Italic">Schoemakers</span>, 180 F.3d at 1381. The Board must then decide whether it will credit the applicant's testimony and whether that testimony overcomes the presumption that the notice was received. <span class="Italic">Brush</span>, 982 F.2d at 1561. To rebut OPM's evidence, Ms. Rakowsky provided testimony that Mr. Rakowsky "must not have received the notices." Ms. Rakowsky did not provide any other evidence supporting her contention that the notices were not received. We agree with the administrative judge and the Board, therefore, that Ms. Rakowsky did not sustain her burden to show that the annuitant did not receive the annual notices. <span class="Italic">See Schoemakers</span>, 180 F.3d at 1381 (holding that a wife's testimony that the notices may have been thrown out or misplaced by her husband and that she never received the notices did not establish that her husband, the annuitant, did not receive them).</p>

OPM</span>, SF-0831-16-0716-I-1 (NP 1/5/2023) ("Here, the OPM official responsible for printing and distributing retirement forms and notices provided an affidavit explaining that general notices regarding survivor elections were sent annually to all annuitants on OPM's master annuity roll <span id="Page_4223"></span>from 1989 to 2010. Such notice satisfies OPM's burden of proving that it sent the required annual notice. <span class="Italic">See Schoemakers</span>, 180 F.3d at 1380-81 (holding that a similar affidavit from a person familiar with how annual notices are prepared and sent can satisfy OPM's burden to show that the annual notices were sent). The record includes copies of the notices sent to the appellant in December 2009 and December 2010, which contain a section titled "Survivor Election for a Spouse You Marry After Retirement" and provide the appellant with his right to elect a survivor annuity, including information regarding how to make an election, the time frame within which to do so, and the consequences of choosing a survivor annuity benefit.").
