<p class="Body-Text">Restoration rights for physically disqualified employees are set by 5 CFR 353.301(c) (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Physically disqualified.</span> An individual who is physically disqualified for the former position or equivalent because of a compensable injury, is entitled to be placed in another position for which qualified that will provide the employee with the same status, and pay, or the nearest approximation thereof, consistent with the circumstances in each case. This right is agencywide and applies for a period of 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation begins. After 1 year, the individual is entitled to the rights accorded individuals who fully or partially recover, as applicable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"Physically disqualified" is defined at 5 CFR 353.102 (2022) (definitions):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Physically disqualified means that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)(i)&#x2003;For medical reasons the employee is unable to perform the duties of the position formerly held or an equivalent one, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;There is a medical reason to restrict the individual from some or all essential duties because of possible incapacitation (for example, a seizure) or because of risk of health impairment (such as further exposure to a toxic substance for an individual who has already shown the effects of such exposure).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The condition is considered permanent with little likelihood for improvement or recovery.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Leach v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 61 MSPR 8, 12-15 (1994), addressed employees physically disqualified for the former position or equivalent because of a compensable injury:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.302, an individual who is "physically disqualified for the former position or equivalent" because of a compensable injury has a right, within "1 year from the date compensation begins," to be "placed in the agency in another position for which qualified that will provide [her] with the same seniority, status, and pay, or the nearest approximation consistent with the circumstances in each case." The Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), ch. 353. subch. 2-2.f (Feb. 24, 1988) defines the term "physically disqualified" to mean that, because of medical reasons, an employee is incapable of, or is restricted from, performing the duties of her former or an equivalent position but that "the [disqualifying medical] condition would have to be permanent, with little likelihood for improvement or recovery." Although we are not bound by the provisions of the FPM, we find no basis for disagreeing with its definition of "physically disqualified" and, thus, find it appropriate to defer to its guidance here. <span class="Italic">See Heinze v. Department of the Interior,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 375, 377-78, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 949 F.2d 403 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). It is undisputed, and we find, that the appellant was a "physically disqualified" individual because, after her surgery in August 1989 for a herniated disc and degenerative spinal stenosis of the lumbar spine, she was permanently incapable of performing the duties of her former Custodial Worker position or an equivalent position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]ssuming that the 1-year period began as early as May 1989 or ended as late as September 1990, however, it is undisputed that between May 1989 and September 1990 the appellant was not qualified for any other type of position to which she could have been reassigned. Unlike section 353.301, which provides that an individual who fully recovers from a compensable injury within 1 year from the date compensation begins is entitled to be restored to her former or an equivalent position "immediately and unconditionally," section 353.302 provides only that a physically disqualified individual is entitled, within 1 year from the date compensation begins, to be restored to another position "for which qualified...." We therefore find that the agency properly denied restoration under section 353.302 and that any adjudicatory error by the administrative judge in determining the 1-year period covered by section 353.302 does not warrant reversal of the initial decision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that the administrative judge erred by applying the "arbitrary and capricious" standard in reviewing the agency's actions under section 353.302. The "arbitrary and capricious" standard is applicable to the Board's review of a denial of restoration under section 353.304. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401(c). It is not applicable to the Board's review of a denial of restoration under section 353.302 because, contrary to section 353.304, section 353.302 grants the employee a right to restoration, albeit one that is limited by the requirement that the employee be qualified for another position. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401. The administrative judge's error in this regard does not warrant reversal of the initial decision with respect to this matter, though, in view of our finding that the agency properly denied the appellant's right to restoration under section 353.302....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kravitz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 104 MSPR 483, 484-86 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-7, 2007 MSPB 15 (2007), also considered the responsibilities of agencies to physically disqualified employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4501"></span>The RD follows the Board's remand of this case after the initial decision (ID) was issued. All facts pertinent to the initial appeal phase of the case are set forth in <span class="Italic">Kravitz v. Department of the Navy,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-6 (2005). In that Opinion and Order, we found that the appellant, formerly a civilian mariner with the U.S. Navy Military Sealift Command (MSC), was not "fully recovered" or "partially recovered" under the standards set forth in 5 C.F.R. part 353, <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-12, but we determined that he <span class="Italic">had</span> nonfrivolously alleged facts which, if proven, would establish that he is a "physically disqualified" employee pursuant to those standards,<span class="Italic"> id.</span> &#x00B6; 15, and thus eligible for placement in another position under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(c). We remanded the case, instructing the administrative judge (AJ) to provide the appellant with detailed notice of the jurisdictional elements for proving that he had sought restoration to duty after a compensable injury, but the agency had failed to restore him. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, and after considerable discovery and a hearing, the AJ found that the appellant met the definition of physically disqualified but failed to timely seek restoration. For this reason, he dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 5. The appellant filed a timely PFR, requesting oral argument pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.117(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The regulation defines a "physically disqualified" employee as one that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)(i)&#x2003;For medical reasons...is unable to perform the duties of the position formerly held or an equivalent one, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;There is a medical reason to restrict the individual from some or all essential duties because of possible incapacitation (for example, a seizure) or because of risk of health impairment (such as further exposure to a toxic substance for an individual who has already shown the effects of such exposure).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The condition is considered permanent with little likelihood for improvement or recovery.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. The record establishes that the appellant has been restricted from performing his former duties for medical reasons. He is subject to such restriction because he is allergic to marine paints and petroleum products, which are regularly used on MSC ships, and his allergy is expected to be permanent. He has been awarded both Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) payments and disability retirement for this condition. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(c), then, he is a physically disqualified employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The right of restoration for a physically disqualified employee applies for one (1) year from the date such employee becomes eligible for OWCP payments. During that time, he is entitled to be placed in another position for which he is qualified and which will provide him with the same status and pay, or the nearest approximation thereof, consistent with the circumstances of his case. He has an agency-wide right to such placement. After the year passes, he is entitled to the rights accorded individuals who are fully or partially recovered, as applicable, under the Rehabilitation Act. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(c); <span class="Italic">see Mendenhall v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. 430, 436-37 (1997). The appellant was awarded OWCP benefits retroactive to June 12, 2002. As we noted in our earlier decision, the agency assessed his capacity to work in July 2002 and found him to be permanently unfit for sea duty. <span class="Italic">Kravitz,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 15. He was thus entitled to placement within one year after June 12, 2002.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on PFR that the AJ erroneously concluded that he did not seek restoration in a timely fashion and there were no positions for which he was qualified. The AJ found that the appellant sought to return to work only when the OWCP terminated his benefits in January 2004. The appellant claims that the AJ was wrong because he was regularly in contact with agency officials regarding restoration, "albeit maybe not in the form the Administrative Judge might have wanted." The appellant argued before the AJ that he had spoken with a number of agency managers during the period he was receiving OWCP payments about restoration to duty, and he averred under oath:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On several occasions throughout this ordeal, I contacted Bob Rosemeyer, who is the Director of the Military Sealift Command Office in San Diego, California, about returning to Military Sealift Command. I also contacted Andrew Kallgren, who is the Director, Marine Placement Department at Military Sealift Command Headquarters in Virginia Beach, Virginia about working for MSC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Later, however, he admitted, also under oath, that he had no record of these contacts and only limited recall of specific conversations. In addition to this evidence, the AJ relied upon hearing testimony by the agency officers in question, Rosemeyer and Kallgren, who failed to recall such contacts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gerdes v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 500, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13 (2001), however, the Board found that if an employee who is physically disqualified for his position files an application for a vacant position during the year following his OWCP award, that application is construed as a request for restoration. The Board held that "[t]here is no requirement in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(c) that a physically disqualified individual who applies for a vacant position must state that he is seeking the position as a restoration to duty."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> &#x00B6; 12. We find that a pending application for a vacant position should also be construed as a request for restoration because the agency becomes aware of the request when it is acting upon the application. Thus, as long as a selection for the position has not been made by the agency, a physically disqualified employee's application for a vacant position that is pending with the agency on the date the employee receives an OWCP award constitutes a request for restoration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. USPS</span>, 123 MSPR 404, 412-13 n.9, 2016 MSPB 22 (2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A partially recovered employee is one who has recovered sufficiently to return to work part-time, to light duty, or to a position with less demanding physical requirements, with the expectation that she will fully recover eventually. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. In contrast, a physically disqualified individual is one who cannot, or for medical reasons should not, perform the duties of her former position, and who is not expected to improve or recover. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. To the extent the appellant was attempting to assert rights as a physically disqualified employee, we find that her rights were properly analyzed by the administrative judge as those of a partially recovered employee because, after 1 year, a physically disqualified employee's rights are the same as those of a fully or partially recovered employee, as applicable. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(c)....</p>
