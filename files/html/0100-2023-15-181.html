<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-180"><span class="space">a.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Metz</span></span> Test</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's reasonable interpretation of a threat or words believed to constitute a threat are given deference by a reviewing court. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Meehan v. USPS</span>, 718 F.2d 1069, 1075 (Fed. Cir. 1983) ("Giving the connotation which a reasonable person would give to the words, we find no error in the board's rejection of that interpretation."). But the Federal Circuit, deciding that the Board needed some guidance in threat analysis, provided it in <span class="Italic">Metz v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 780 F.2d 1001, 1002-03 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">rev'g</span> <span class="Italic">Metz v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 23 MSPR 576, 578 (1984)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Any threat made to a Government supervisor is a serious matter that clearly impairs the efficiency of the service. In some cases, however, it is difficult for the agency to determine if a threat has been made. This court has held that the board must use "the connotation which a reasonable person would give to the words" [citing <span class="Italic">Meehan v. USPS</span>, 718 F.2d 1069, 1075 (Fed. Cir. 1983)] in order to determine if the words constituted a threat.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to apply the reasonable person standard, however, the board must weigh the evidence. We direct the board to consider the following evidentiary factors in deciding whether an employee threatened his supervisors or co-workers:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The listener's reactions;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The listener's apprehension of harm;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The speaker's intent;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Any conditional nature of the statements; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;The attendant circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Supreme Court provided the basis for these standards by writing "the statute initially requires the Government to prove a true 'threat'" [citing <span class="Italic">Watts v. United States</span>, 394 U.S. 705, 708 (1969)]. This standard applies to Government agency regulations as well as the statute construed in <span class="Italic">Watts</span>. Our guidelines effect the appropriate standard by directing the board to give objective evidence heavy weight. The standards direct the board to apply the reasonable person criterion by considering what reasonable persons who heard the statements actually did. For instance, a listener who reacted by calling police after hearing a statement is more likely to have heard a threat than a listener who did nothing. Likewise, an employee who made a generalized conditional statement is less likely to have intended to threaten a co-worker than an employee who stated a simple threat. We do not instruct the board to rely on objective evidence alone. A credible supervisor might testify that he feared harm; such testimony tends to show that an employee made a threat. Evidence of an employee's intent in making a statement can show that the statement was a threat. Rumors, however, or fear based on rumors, cannot suffice to prove that an employee threatened anyone. While we do not instruct the board to disregard subjective evidence of fear or intent, we do direct the board to give objective evidence heavy weight.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Judge Nichols, concurring in <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, 780 F.2d at 1005, was critical of judicial rulemaking:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...What Metz most needed was a three-week paid vacation on some tropic and eventless isle, but this is the last thing our benevolent government is likely to offer its overwrought employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In fairness to the agency, it has to be admitted that even as "reformed" in 1978, the Civil Service laws are still not flexible in the means they afford supervisors to deal with somewhat bizarre personnel problems, not falling into the well-worn slots of mental disability, inadequate performance, or willful misconduct. And, in our far-flung civil service, even the bizarre is the ordinary somewhere....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[Metz'] choice of language was that normal to overwrought persons and no doubt upsetting, but a misconduct termination is for life. Since it is the function of judges to interpret the meaning of words, in the course of assigning legal consequences to them, their interpretation must be controlling here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Watts v. United States</span>, 394 U.S. 705, 708 (1969), cited in <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, considered an alleged threat during a political rally against the life of the president. The Court directed a judgment of acquittal: "But whatever the 'willfullness' requirement implies, the statute initially requires the Government to prove a true 'threat.' We do not believe that the kind of political hyperbole indulged in by petitioner fits within that statutory term."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, the Board readily affirmed that an employee threatened his supervisor by brandishing a gun, pointing it at his supervisor, and threatening to kill him. The supervisor said he feared for his life and became ill as a result of the incident. <span class="Italic">McGowan v. VA</span>, 30 MSPR 221, 223 n.* (1986); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Gunn v. USPS</span>, 34 MSPR 509, 511-12 (1987) (without mentioning <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, the Board affirmed the removal of a mail handler based on the intoxicated employee's threat to his supervisor that he would kill him). Without referring to <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, the Federal Circuit affirmed a removal based on several incidents involving a supervisor who was told by the appellant that a revolution (that he would help to lead) would occur and the supervisor (along with other supervisors) would be victims--and then showed her the "battle plan" apparently designed to effectuate the project. The supervisor was intimidated and was fearful of harmful action, showing "that petitioner appeared ready to commit a harmful act and that [the supervisor] was afraid that he would. That is enough to show the misconduct charged." <span class="Italic">Thomas v. GSA</span>, 794 F.2d 661 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (on appeal from <span class="Italic">Thomas v. GSA</span>, 27 MSPR 401, 409 (1985) (describing the misconduct as "clearly destructive of the employer-employee relationship and disruptive of the work environment").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit analyzed a threat and sustained dismissal in <span class="Italic">Mesberg v. USDA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3022), examining the words and circumstances of their use, the reaction of employees, and employees' knowledge of a past incident involving the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Mesberg was employed by the United States Forest Service as an Accounting Technician, GS-525-5. She worked in the Financial Management section of the Umpquah National Forest Supervisors Office. Ms. Mesberg was scheduled to attend a training session at the beginning of the week of July 7, 1997. As a single parent, she had arranged for child care to accommodate the session. On July 2, 1997, she was notified by her supervisor, Sandy Stephens, that the training session at the beginning of the week was full and that she would be attending a session at the end of the week instead.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Apparently under stress from events in her personal life, Ms. Mesberg saw the postponement of her training as an example of the poor treatment that she believed she was receiving from her supervisors. In an expression of anger, she commented to Elizabeth Kinney, a co-worker: "I don't make enough money to count around here. I wish I had a gun." At the hearing, Ms. Mesberg's account of what she had said was only slightly different. She recalled stating: "I can understand why people go berserk--it's a good thing I don't have a gun."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Kinney took the statement as a threat and reported it to Ms. Stephens. As Ms. Mesberg's supervisor, Ms Stephens was shaken by the statement. The next morning, Ms. Kinney told Ms. Mesberg that she had reported the incident. Rather than asserting that she had not meant the statement as a threat, Ms. Mesberg stated: "I wish I had a gun, I'd blow everyone away." Ms. Kinney also reported this comment to Ms. Stephens. At the hearing, Ms. Mesberg testified that she did not recall making this second statement, but acknowledged that she may have.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Stephens reported the two incidents to Donald Ostby, the Forest Supervisor and Bernie Rios, the Deputy Forest Supervisor. Mr. Ostby summoned Ms. Mesberg to a meeting, in which he informed her that he could not tolerate threats in the workplace and that her comments caused him to be concerned for the safety of her co-workers. Mr. Ostby thereupon placed Ms. Mesberg on administrative leave and she was escorted from the office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Stephens held a meeting with other employees in the Financial Management department and told them about the incidents. In addition to Ms. Stephens, at least one other employee was shaken by the statements. Some of the workers were aware that Ms. Mesberg previously had been suspended for an incident in which she had displayed a knife and had asked a co-worker, "Are you afraid I am going to stab you or something? You never know what I'm going to do next." A second meeting, called a critical incident debriefing, also was held. At that meeting, certain employees related past experiences involving Ms. Mesberg and expressed concerns about working with her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In October of 1997, Roy M. Roosevelt, the Director of Human Resources for the Pacific Northwest Region of the Forest Service, removed Ms. Mesberg from the agency for having made statements that caused anxiety and disruption in the workplace.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Mesberg appealed her removal to the Board. Following a hearing, the AJ sustained the agency's action. The AJ determined that the agency had carried its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Ms. Mesberg had committed the offense with which she was charged....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In regard to the anxiety and disruption that arose from Ms. Mesberg's statements, while the AJ found that the agency's actions increased anxiety to some degree, he also found that several employees had a genuine and legitimate "core" of anxiety. The AJ also found that the <span id="Page_2682"></span>agency's actions were appropriate to the situation and that Ms. Mesberg was responsible for any increased anxiety that resulted from the agency's appropriate response to her statements. Given Ms. Mesberg's past behavior, there is little doubt that her co-workers were reasonably made anxious by her threats.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Mesberg points to the counseling she received as a factor the Board should have considered. We disagree. The record does not indicate that Ms. Mesberg was receiving counseling at the time of the removal decision, nor does the record indicate that she argued to the Board that the agency had improperly failed to consider counseling she received when it made the decision to remove her. Furthermore, it was not unreasonable to remove Ms. Mesberg in light of her extreme conduct, even assuming that she was receiving counseling.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Metz,</span> there is no requirement that the agency demonstrate that the threat constituted a violation of a state criminal statute. <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 300 Fed. Appx. 923, 926 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board can be exacting in its analysis of what constitutes a threat under <span class="Italic">Metz</span> criteria, <span class="Italic">Castner v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 393, 394-99 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed his removal from the position of Parcel Distribution Clerk, PS-5, effective September 22, 1995, on a charge of "misconduct, making a verbal threat."...&#8197;As to the nature of the statement, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant's statement, voiced loudly and angrily to coworker Marilyn Evans (Evans), Rural Carrier, was: "If I had a gun right now, I'd start shooting."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the characterization of the statement, the administrative judge stated that his review of the witnesses' testimony convinced him that they considered the appellant's statement to be a threat, felt apprehensive for their personal safety and the safety of the Post Office in general, and reacted accordingly....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that in order to apply the "reasonable person" standard to determine whether words constitute a threat, we must weigh the following factors:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The listener's reactions;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The listener's apprehension of harm;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The speaker's intent;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Any conditional nature of the statements; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;The attendant circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1002. After setting out the sequence of pertinent events, we address these factors seriatim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the morning of May 25, 1995, the appellant was frustrated because he was behind in the distribution of parcels from the previous day. The administrative judge found that the appellant's frustration grew when he realized that he would not be able to finish distributing parcels before the end of his shift at 8:30 <span class="small">A.M.</span> Around 8:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, when he could not find a mail tub which he believed should have been there, he made the statement in question to co-worker Evans.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following people either heard, overheard, or were informed of the appellant's statement to Evans on the day it occurred. Sharon Whisler (Whisler), a Rural Carrier Auxiliary who was working 15 feet away, overheard the statement. Neither she nor Evans took any steps to report the appellant's statement at that time. Twenty minutes later, Evans "mentioned" the statement to Barbara Jean Eggebrecht (Eggebrecht), Rural Carrier Associate, while the two were on break. When their break ended, Eggebrecht then relayed information of the incident to Mayda Brendsel (Brendsel), Shop Steward, who, in turn, later that day notified the Postal Inspection Service of the incident. The agency then placed the appellant on administrative leave as of the date of the incident, and ordered him to undergo a psychiatric fitness for duty examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In assessing the listeners' reactions, we find that they made no report to either supervisors or security. Rather, there was conversation about it during a break; and when a union steward was later told of the incident by employee Eggebrecht, who did not directly hear the appellant's statement, she waited until her work shift ended to place a call to the agency "hot line." Thus, the evidence shows that no immediate effort was made by the appellant's co-workers to remove either the appellant or themselves from the work place, or, to apprise anyone of the need for immediate action. Rather, the listeners' reactions were much like those described in <span class="Italic">Metz,</span> where the court found that those who heard the statements did not react to them as if they were threats. <span class="Italic">See Metz</span> at 1003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the listeners' apprehension of harm, we find that the two workers who heard the statement when it was made--Evans and Whisler--both continued to do their work at their stations (Evans: "I turned back to my case, and continued working"), and both reacted to the statement more as an annoyance than as a threat (Whisler, on her reaction: "Are we going to have to go through more [of the appellant's] outbursts?"). Although Evans testified that she was fearful after returning to work the next day, she stated that her concern was not based on the appellant's comment but on coemployees' comments that the appellant might retaliate against her for reporting him. She further testified that she met the appellant at a cocktail lounge sometime after he was removed and did not feel threatened by him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two agency witnesses, Barbara Eggebrecht and Mayda Brendsel, expressed substantial fear of harm from the appellant. Neither, however, heard the remark or was in the appellant's presence when the remark was made. Rather, as stated above, Marilyn Evans mentioned the remark to Eggebrecht during a break and Eggebrecht then reported it to Brendsel, and their testimony indicates that their reactions and fears were based largely on prior unpleasant interactions with the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency chose not to call as a witness, Daunhauer, the mail clerk who had moved the mail tub which the appellant needed, and who therefore might have had the greatest reason to feel threatened. However, based on a statement by the agency representative in a prehearing conference that the agency would not call Daunhauer because he did not feel threatened, the administrative judge found that the mail clerk did not feel threatened. Finally, the agency itself conceded in its closing brief that "the listeners did not feel personally threatened at that particular time."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the speaker's intent, the appellant's expert witness John Santa (Santa), Ph.D, a clinical psychologist who had been treating him for eighteen months before the incident, testified that both he and Dr. Herbert Gray (Gray), a psychiatrist who, at the agency's request, administered a fitness-for-duty examination after the incident, are of the opinion that the appellant did not intend to threaten anyone. Dr. Santa conferred with Dr. Gray after Dr. Gray's first examination of the appellant, and read the report written subsequently by Dr. Gray. Dr. Gray's affidavit focuses on his conclusion that the appellant did not intend to harm anyone and that he does not represent a danger in the workplace. Although Dr. Gray does not specifically address the appellant's intent in making the statement, the general tenor of his affidavit is consistent with Dr. Santa's testimony. It should be noted that Dr. Santa had read the <span class="Italic">Metz</span> decision and found its criteria to be reasonable and appropriate from a clinical standpoint. Thus, we find that it is likely that his professional assessment of the appellant's intent is in accord with the legal criteria.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not take any note of Dr. Gray's opinion, and found that Dr. Santa's conclusions were "questionable," on four grounds: 1) He did not interview the postal employees who felt threatened by the appellant's statement, and so he had to accept the appellant's version of events; 2) at the hearing he did not clarify whether his opinion was related to the witnesses' version of the appellant's statement or the appellant's version; 3) he did not perform any tests to support a diagnosis; and 4) he admitted that in spite of eighteen sessions he had with the appellant focusing on anger management, the appellant did not handle the situation in the best way.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the testimony substantiates that the two employees who actually heard the appellant's outburst, as well as the one who had apparently generated the appellant's anger, did not, in fact, feel threatened. Thus, Dr. Santa's admitted failure to interview the postal employees involved is not of significance to his opinion as to the <span class="Italic">intent</span> of the appellant's statement. Second, Dr. Santa testified that regardless of which version of the statement was proffered to him, he did not consider that the appellant intended it as a threat. Third, a diagnosis is not a prerequisite to a professionally informed opinion as to whether the appellant intended to make a threat. Indeed, since diagnostic tests would only be relevant to diagnosing a particular type of illness, they might be relevant to whether the appellant would be likely to harm anyone, but would appear to be irrelevant to a determination of whether the appellant intended his statement to threaten anyone. It should be noted that Dr. Gray, whom the agency tasked with performing a psychological fitness for duty examination, apparently did not find it necessary to administer diagnostic tests to the appellant either. Finally, Dr. Santa's concession that the appellant did not "choose the right way" in this matter, does not in any way impact on a determination of the appellant's intent. Certainly, no one would argue that the appellant acted in an appropriate manner; that, however, is not the question before us. Rather, consistent with the agency's sole charge, we must determine whether the appellant's actions amounted to a threat. Accordingly, we find no merit in the administrative judge's reasons for finding Dr. Santa's expert testimony "questionable."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Significantly, the language used was conditional; such phraseology weighs against a finding of threat under the fourth factor which must be considered in applying the Federal Circuit's test. <span class="Italic">See Metz,</span> 780 F.2d at 1003 ("[an employee who makes] a generalized conditional statement is less likely to have intended to threaten a co-worker than an employee who stated a simple threat"); <span class="Italic">see also Hayslett v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States Postal Service,</span> 38 MSPR 267, 270 (1988) (conditionality an additional factor in not sustaining a charge of threat).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the consideration of the fifth factor under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, "attendant <span id="Page_2683"></span>circumstances," we find that one of the two attendant circumstances discussed by the administrative judge at least equally supports a finding opposite to that which he reached. The administrative judge noted that although the appellant had a history of outbursts, use of profanity, and intimidating behavior, his statement on this occasion was different from those previous instances; "he had never made a threat before." This observation is, of course, in accord with the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant's statement was a threat. The context of the appellant's history of anti-social but non-violent verbal outbursts, however, offers equal support to the conclusion that his statement was <span class="Italic">not</span> a threat but merely another intemperate outburst. Indeed, the non-apprehensive immediate reactions of the persons who heard the statement, as set forth above, appear to have resulted, at least in part, from their being accustomed to the appellant's "bizarre" comments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the second attendant circumstance referred to by the administrative judge--that the appellant's reaction was disproportionate to its cause--we agree. The fact that a comment is disproportionate, bizarre, or even "irrational," however, does not mean that it constitutes a threat.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our consideration of all the factors enumerated in <span class="Italic">Metz,</span> we find that the agency did not prove its sole charge of verbal threat. <span class="Italic">See Kilgour v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 67 MSPR 544, 549 (1995) (in applying the reasonable person criterion, the Board is to apply the five <span class="Italic">Metz</span> considerations in deciding whether statements constitute threats), <span class="Italic">abrogation in part on other grounds noted in</span> <span class="Italic">Moscato v. Department of Education</span>, 72 MSPR 266 (1996). The language used was conditional, the listeners did not feel personally threatened at the time of the outburst and took no immediate action which would indicate apprehension of harm, there is unrebutted expert testimony that the appellant did not intend to threaten anyone, and there are no attendant circumstances which provide preponderant evidence of the appellant's having made a verbal threat.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the agency brought only the charge of threat, this analysis must end our inquiry. The fact that the appellant's misconduct might well have supported another serious charge cannot influence our decision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By this decision, we do not condone the behavior of the appellant. Rather, we are sympathetic to the agency's plight in having a troublesome employee in the workplace, but that is not sufficient reason to find that his conduct meets the stringent test imposed by the Federal Circuit for threats in <span class="Italic">Metz</span>. Accordingly, we reverse the removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another decision closely scrutinized the meaning of words and the reaction of threatened victims, <span class="Italic">Roseberry v. VA</span>, 51 MSPR 172, 174-75 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency alleged that the appellant had returned two loan files to a bank because the bank failed to include zip codes on the loan applications. The bank complained to the agency that the error could have been corrected by telephone and that returning the applications resulted in delayed processing. Mr. Brantley sent the appellant a memorandum that asked him to justify his action in returning the applications, in writing. In a memorandum dated June 22, 1990, the appellant responded to Mr. Brantley's memorandum. The appellant began his response with a joke about an inexperienced bird hunter who borrowed his friend's dog Queenie, a champion pointer. When the friend asked the would-be hunter how he got along with Queenie, the reply was:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Just fine. Oh at first she wanted to run in front of me, stop, hold up one paw and stick her tail straight out behind her, but after I caught up with her a couple of times and kicked her in the ribs she followed along at my heels the rest of the day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the portion of the memorandum that is the basis for the agency's charges, the appellant stated, "If you chuckled at the above story (did you?) you're a fool....&#8197;However, unlike Queenie, when I get kicked, I kick back." The remainder of the memorandum discussed the loan form and requested written instructions from Mr. Brantley.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant denied that he intended to exhibit insolent, insubordinate and threatening behavior in the memorandum. He alleged that he had been following established procedure that had not been changed. He alleged also that the charge was a continuing form of harassment by Mr. Brantley. He alleged further that the agency committed procedural error by failing to advise him that it was conducting an investigation that might lead to disciplinary action, failing to advise him of his right to representation and improperly having a third party present at a July 26, 1990, meeting regarding the memorandum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision, the administrative judge sustained the agency's action. He found that the appellant did not establish that the agency committed harmful procedural error in effecting the action. He further found that there was a nexus between the efficiency of the service and the appellant's conduct, and that the penalty was within the tolerable limits of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant contends that the agency did not establish that he exhibited threatening behavior as that term is defined in <span class="Italic">Metz v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 780 F.2d 1001, 1004 (Fed. Cir. 1986). He argues that in the absence of that proof, the entire charge must fail under <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the agency has not established the elements of its charge of threatening behavior as defined under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>. The evidentiary factors to be considered in determining whether a threat has occurred under <span class="Italic">Metz</span> include the following: (1) The listener's reaction; (2) the listener's apprehension of harm; (3) the speaker's intent; (4) any conditional nature of the statement; and (5) the attendant circumstances<span class="Italic">. See Metz</span>, 780 F.2d 1001. With regard to the agency's allegation of threatening behavior, Mr. Brantley testified at the hearing that he understood the appellant's memorandum to mean that the appellant believed he was being punished for doing what he had been trained to do. He testified further that he did not feel physically threatened, nor did he consider the appellant's letter a "threat to my person." When asked what he believed the appellant meant by "he kicks back," Mr. Brantley responded that he believed that the appellant might engage in a work slow down, or only do what was necessary and no more.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that he did not intend the memorandum as a threat. Rather, he testified that it was an attempt at levity and to lighten up his strained relations with Mr. Brantley. When asked about the "kicking back" comment, he stated that he wanted to make the point that he would be glad to follow any changes in procedure but to protect himself in the future, he wanted written instructions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the <span class="Italic">Metz</span> standards, we find that the agency did not establish that the "listener," Mr. Brantley, feared that he might be harmed. Moreover, the agency did not establish that the "speaker," the appellant, intended to threaten Mr. Brantley. Accordingly, we find that the agency has not established the element of its charge that the appellant exhibited threatening behavior.</p>
