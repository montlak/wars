<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-44"><span class="space">j.</span> Mental Disability</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee's mental state and the amount of time allowed to make a decision are relevant and material factors in determining his ability to exercise free choice in resigning. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 30 MSPR 12, 15 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Carrier v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 54, 58 (1994) ("A finding that the appellant was not mentally capable of making a rational decision at the time of retirement would render his decision involuntary and bring his appeal within the jurisdiction of the Board."). The test for determining whether a resignation was involuntary based on an alleged lack of mental capacity is whether, at the time of the resignation, the employee was capable of making a rational decision to resign. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 77, 80 (1987). At issue is the employee's actual condition at the time of his resignation rather than the employer's knowledge of the condition. <span class="Italic">Paone v. Dept. of Army</span>, 10 MSPR 284, 287 (1982) (citing <span class="Italic">Manzi v. United States</span>, 198 Ct. Cl. 489, 494 (1972)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Kitt v. Dept. of Army</span>, 22 MSPR 32, 33 (1984) (resignation submitted by an employee suffering mental illness is invalid, irrespective of the agency's lack of knowledge of the condition). The test does not require total incompetency or hospitalization, but rather focuses on whether the employee has the ability to make a rational decision. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. USPS</span>, 39 MSPR 236, 239 (1988) (appellant's schizophrenia, paranoid type, was well-document and led the Board to determine that the appellant lacked the ability to make a rational decision to resign); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Pentecost v. USDA</span>, 12 MSPR 262, 264 (1982) (resignation was not involuntary when "appellant has a mild mental dysfunction perhaps affecting his memory capabilities"; a physician "concluded that there should be no restriction on his future work or educational activities").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Anderson v. DHHS, DC-0752-16-0845-I-1 (NP 3/24/2023), summarized decisions concerning the effect of emotional distress or mental incapacity on the validity of a resignation entered through settlement of an appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant has alleged emotional distress as a ground for involuntariness, the Board considers whether the appellant was represented, whether she has demonstrated that she was mentally impaired at the time, and whether she has otherwise shown that she was unable to understand full y the nature of the action in question or to assist her representative. <span class="italic">See Sullivan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 81, 85 (1998). The Board also will review any medical evidence submitted by the appellant to determine whether it is sufficient to show mental incapacity at the time the agreement was signed. <span class="italic">Clede v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 279, 282-83 (1996), <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 113 F.3d 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table). To be entitled to a jurisdictional hearing, an appellant needs to do more than make bare assertions of incapacity; she needs to present sufficient evidence supporting such assertions for the Board to conclude that a jurisdictional hearing is necessary. <span class="italic">Id.</span> at 284.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party to a settlement agreement is presumed to have full legal capacity to contract unless she is mentally disabled and the mental disability is so severe that she cannot form the necessary intent to enter into the agreement. <span class="italic">Swidecki v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-19 (2006)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer to Chapter 16 for discussions of bases for setting aside settlements.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An allegation that an employee was <span class="Italic">non</span> <span class="Italic">compos</span> <span class="Italic">mentis</span> at the time of a resignation is a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness warranting a hearing on the issue. At the hearing, the appellant must prove that he lacked the mental capacity for making the free choice necessary to a voluntary resignation. <span class="Italic">Boles v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 121, 123, 7 MSPB 46 (1981). Completely subjective evidence of mental incapacity as to a resignation was discounted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harmon v. DOD</span>, 50 MSPR 218, 220 (1991); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Chamberlain v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 626, 634 (1991) (in a restoration case involving an employee who resigned, received OWCP benefits, and claimed that the resignation resulted from mental illness, the Board found that the OWCP decision was not determinative on the link between compensable injury and resignation; medical evidence was discounted for lack of a mental status evaluation near time of resignation; subjective evidence from the appellant was discounted for lack of corroborating evidence from other witnesses, including family members, who could testify as to his condition at the time of his resignation). If an agency is aware of substantial evidence that casts doubt on the employee's capacity to make the free choice necessary to a voluntary resignation, its decision to accept the resignation is improper. The agency's knowledge or lack of knowledge of the employee's mental state is irrelevant in and of itself, for the test is the employee's actual condition rather than the employer's knowledge of it. <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. VA</span>, 18 MSPR 381, 382 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Duvall-Little v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 89 MSPR 416, 420 &#x00B6; 12 (2001) ("[W]here an agency is aware of substantial evidence which would cast doubt on the employee's capacity to make the free choice necessary to a voluntary resignation, its decision to accept the resignation is improper."); <span class="Italic">Solga v. Dept. of Army</span>, 12 MSPR 656, 658 (1982) ("[T]he record supports appellant's allegation that his mental condition was such that he lacked the mental capacity to voluntarily resign; whether the agency was aware of it or not is not controlling in this situation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Manzi v. United States</span>, 198 Ct. Cl. 489 (1972).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's jurisdiction to consider an allegation that an appellant was not mentally competent to resign is to be based on nonfrivolous allegations rather than on proof of the mental condition, <span class="Italic">Burks v. DOD</span>, 70 MSPR 127, 130 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is axiomatic that a resignation or retirement is presumed voluntary. <span class="Italic">See Christie v. United States,</span> 207 Ct. Cl. 333, 518 F.2d 584, 587 (1975). The presumption of voluntariness, however, may be rebutted if the employee can establish that he was mentally incompetent. <span class="Italic">See Scharf v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 710 F.2d 1572, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The common element in all cases where the Board and the courts find an involuntary resignation or retirement is that factors have operated on the employee's decision-making processes that deprived him or her of freedom of choice. <span class="Italic">See generally Heining v. General Services Administration,</span> 68 MSPR 513, 519 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's mental state is a material factor in determining his ability to exercise free choice, and a finding that the appellant was not mentally capable of making a rational decision at the time of his resignation would render his decision involuntary and bring his appeal within the jurisdiction of the Board. <span class="Italic">See Heining,</span> 68 MSPR at 519; <span class="Italic">Carrier v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 MSPR 54, 58 (1994). In order to make a nonfrivolous allegation entitling him to a hearing on the jurisdictional issue, however, the appellant need only set forth assertions which, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the action was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Harper v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 68 MSPR 594, 601 (1995); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 504, 512 (1995). As noted above, the appellant asserted below that he was confined in a hospital from June 13, 1995, to June 17, 1995, and from July 14, 1995 (the date he resigned), until his discharge on July 26, 1995. He also asserted that he suffered from DTSS, that, on July 14, 1995, he was not mentally and emotionally capable of making the decision to resign, and that the agency misrepresented his options.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant requested an extension of time not only to obtain discovery on the issue of coercion, but also to obtain medical records relating to <span id="Page_1959"></span>the issue of his alleged mental incapacity. The administrative judge's Order denying the appellant's request to leave open the record, however, addressed only the issue of discovery and did not even mention the issue of the medical records. The appellant, therefore, has shown good cause for the untimely submission of these medical records on review. In any event, we find that, even absent the supporting medical records that the appellant has submitted on review, the arguments he presented below were sufficient to constitute nonfrivolous allegations of the Board's jurisdiction that warranted a hearing.[*] <span class="Italic">See Carrier</span>, 65 MSPR at 58; <span class="Italic">Lewis v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 35 MSPR 77, 80 (1987), <span class="Italic">appeal after remand</span>, 39 MSPR 236 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;While we find that the appellant did, in fact, make below a nonfrivolous allegation of the Board's jurisdiction based on mental incapacity and was not required to submit supporting evidence, we find that, once the appellant requested that the record be held open to allow him additional time to secure supporting medical records, the administrative judge erred by denying his request and then finding in the initial decision that he failed to present supporting medical documentation for his claim of mental incapacity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.41, 1201.58 [now &#x00A7; 1201.59] ; <span class="Italic">Williams</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 64 MSPR 37, 40 (1994); <span class="Italic">Gavette v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 44 MSPR 166, 174 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lawrence v. VA</span>, 18 MSPR 381, 383 (1983), determined that an unsupported claim of mental illness will not carry the employee's burden of proof. The same result was reached in <span class="Italic">Davis v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 268, 270-71 (1986): although the employee's actual mental condition at the time of the resignation rather than the employer's knowledge of that condition is determinative under <span class="Italic">Manzi v. United States</span>, 198 Ct. Cl. 489, 494 (1972), conclusory assertions surrounding a claim of mental illness or incapacity are insufficient to prove the contentions. Medical evidence is significant, and the medical evidence and opinions should relate to the appellant's state of mind at the time of the resignation. Although the appellant's testimony concerning her state of mind is of some evidentiary value, if it is "uncorroborated," it will be given little weight. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Nat'l Science Found.</span>, 47 MSPR 159, 163 (1991) (noting that the appellant was able to work on an EEO complaint in a "coherent and relatively sophisticated manner," submit a "clear and coherent written resignation," and plan a trip). The Board expects a rather precise and focused medical report. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Paone v. Dept. of Army</span>, 10 MSPR 284, 288 (1982) ("[T]here is no evidence which would indicate more precisely when such deterioration began in relation to the resignation"; "the report does not indicate that the deterioration affected appellant's competency to the extent that he did not understand the consequences of his resignation."). Reports of mental disability rendered years after the appellant's resignation are not likely to be relied upon by the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blaske v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 76 MSPR 164, 169 (1997) (physician who started treating appellant in 1990 could not have known whether appellant was in a schizophrenic state on a specific date in 1984, particularly when appellant gave inconsistent accounts of the date she submitted her resignation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Adams v. USPS</span>, 108 MSPR 250, 2008 MSPB 46 (2008), considered competing medical evidence and determined that the appellant was not medically incapacitated on the date he resigned. The appellant had a benign brain tumor. The appellant's doctor provided an opinion that the disorder caused the misconduct--involving discarding mail--that precipitated an investigation that led to the resignation. The agency physician opined that the evidence did not support the contention that the appellant was incapable of properly considering a resignation on the date of the resignation. The Board noted that the appellant's physician did not focus upon the ability of the appellant to make a rational decision to resign, credited the analysis of the agency physician, and set aside an initial decision reversing the resignation as a constructive removal. A resignation was not involuntary by reason of PTSD when there was no evidence of the appellant's condition at the time of resignation or up through eight months after the resignation. <span class="Italic">Green v. VA</span>, 112 MSPR 59, 65 &#x00B6; 12, 2009 MSPB 142 (2009).</p>
