<h3 class="h3" id="sec4-8"><span class="space">A.</span> REGULATIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">The regulations governing negotiability determinations are at 5 CFR 2424.1-.59 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subpart A--Applicability of This Part and Definitions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2424.1&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Applicability of this part</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This part applies to all petitions for review filed on or after June 4, 2012.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_396"></span>2424.2&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Definitions</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this part, the following definitions apply:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Bargaining obligation dispute</span> means a disagreement between an exclusive representative and an agency concerning whether, in the specific circumstances involved in a particular case, the parties are obligated to bargain over a proposal that otherwise may be negotiable. Examples of bargaining obligation disputes include disagreements between an exclusive representative and an agency concerning agency claims that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;A proposal concerns a matter that is covered by a collective bargaining agreement; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Bargaining is not required over a change in bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment because the effect of the change is <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Collaboration and Alternative Dispute Resolution Program</span> refers to the Federal Labor Relations Authority's program that assists parties in reaching agreements to resolve disputes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Negotiability dispute</span> means a disagreement between an exclusive representative and an agency concerning the legality of a proposal or provision. A negotiability dispute exists when an exclusive representative disagrees with an agency contention that (without regard to any bargaining obligation dispute) a proposal is outside the duty to bargain, including disagreement with an agency contention that a proposal is bargainable only at its election. A negotiability dispute also exists when an exclusive representative disagrees with an agency head's disapproval of a provision as contrary to law. A negotiability dispute may exist where there is no bargaining obligation dispute. Examples of negotiability disputes include disagreements between an exclusive representative and an agency concerning whether a proposal or provision:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Affects a management right under 5 U.S.C. 7106(a);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Constitutes a procedure or appropriate arrangement, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 7106(b)(2) and (3), respectively; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;Is consistent with a Government-wide regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Petition for review</span> means an appeal filed with the Authority by an exclusive representative requesting resolution of a negotiability dispute. An appeal that concerns only a bargaining obligation dispute may not be resolved under this part.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal</span> means any matter offered for bargaining that has not been agreed to by the parties. If a petition for review concerns more than one proposal, then the term includes each proposal concerned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Provision</span> means any matter that has been disapproved by the agency head on review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7114(c). If a petition for review concerns more than one provision, then the term includes each provision concerned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(g)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Service</span> means the delivery of copies of documents filed with the Authority to the other party's principal bargaining representative and, in the case of an exclusive representative, also to the head of the agency. Compliance with part 2429 of this subchapter is required.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(h)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Severance</span> means the division of a proposal or provision into separate parts having independent meaning, for the purpose of determining whether any of the separate parts is within the duty to bargain or is contrary to law. In effect, severance results in the creation of separate proposals or provisions. Severance applies when some parts of the proposal or provision are determined to be outside the duty to bargain or contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(i)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Written allegation concerning the duty to bargain</span> means an agency allegation that the duty to bargain in good faith does not extend to a proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2424.3-2424.9 [Reserved]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">2424.22 <span class="Italic">Exclusive representative's petition for review; purpose; content; severance; service</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Purpose</span>. The purpose of a petition for review is to initiate a negotiability proceeding and provide the agency with notice that the exclusive representative requests a decision from the Authority that a proposal or provision is within the duty to bargain or not contrary to law, respectively. As more fully explained in paragraph (b) of this section, the exclusive representative is required in the petition for review to, among other things, inform the Authority of the exact wording and meaning of the proposal or provision as well as how it is intended to operate, explain technical or unusual terms, and provide copies of materials that support the exclusive representative's position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Content</span>. You must file a petition for review on a form that the Authority has provided for that purpose, or in a substantially similar format. You meet this requirement if you file your petition electronically through use of the eFiling system on the FLRA's Web site at <a href="https://www.flra.gov/">www.flra.gov</a>. That Web site also provides copies of petition forms. You must date the petition, unless you file it electronically through use of the FLRA's eFiling system. And, regardless of how you file the petition, you must ensure that it includes the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;The exact wording and explanation of the meaning of the proposal or provision, including an explanation of special terms or phrases, technical language, or other words that are not in common usage, as well as how the proposal or provision is intended to work;</p>

<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;A statement as to whether the proposal or provision is also involved in an unfair labor practice charge under part 2423 of this subchapter, a grievance pursuant to the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, or an impasse procedure under part 2470 of this subchapter, and whether any other petition for review has been filed concerning a proposal or provision arising from the same bargaining or the same agency head review; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;Any request for a hearing before the Authority and the reasons supporting such request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Severance</span>. The exclusive representative may, but is not required to, include in the petition for review a statement as to whether it requests severance of a proposal or provision. If severance is requested in the petition for review, then the exclusive representative must support its request with an explanation of how each severed portion of the proposal or provision may stand alone, and how such severed portion would operate. The explanation and argument in support of the severed portion(s) must meet the same requirements for information set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;Whether an extension of the time limits for filing the agency's statement of position and any subsequent filings is requested. The FLRA representative may, on determining that it will effectuate the purposes of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, and this part, extend such time limits.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">2424.24&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Agency's statement of position; purpose; time limits; content; severance; service</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Purpose</span>. The purpose of an agency statement of position is to inform the Authority and the exclusive representative why a proposal or provision is not within the duty to bargain or contrary to law, respectively. As more fully explained in paragraph (c) of this section, the agency is required in the statement of position to, among other things, set forth its understanding of the proposal or provision, state any disagreement with the facts, arguments, or meaning of the proposal or provision set forth in the exclusive representative's petition for review, and supply all arguments and authorities in support of its position.</p>

<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;The disapproval of the provision under 5 U.S.C. 7114(c); or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Set forth in full your position on any matters relevant to the petition that you want the Authority to consider in reaching its decision, including: A statement of the arguments and authorities supporting any bargaining obligation or negotiability claims; any disagreement with claims that the exclusive representative made in the petition for review; specific citation to any law, rule, regulation, section of a collective bargaining agreement, or other authority that you rely on; and a copy of any such material that the Authority may not easily access (which you may upload as attachments if you file your statement of position electronically through use of the FLRA's eFiling system). Your statement of position must also include the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;If different from the exclusive representative's position, an explanation of the meaning the agency attributes to the proposal or provision and the reasons for disagreeing with the exclusive representative's explanation of meaning;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;If different from the exclusive representative's position, an explanation of how the proposal or provision would work, and the reasons for disagreeing with the exclusive representative's explanation;</p>

<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Purpose</span>. The purpose of the exclusive representative's response is to inform the Authority and the agency why, despite the agency's arguments in its statement of position, the proposal or provision is within the duty to bargain or not contrary to law, respectively, and whether the union disagrees with any facts or arguments in the agency's statement of position. As more fully explained in paragraph (c) of this section, the exclusive representative is required in its response to, among other things, state why the proposal or provision does not conflict with any law, or why it falls within an exception to management rights, including permissive subjects under 5 U.S.C. 7106(b)(1), and procedures and appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b) (2) and (3). Another purpose of the response is to permit the exclusive representative to request the Authority to sever portions of the proposal or provision and to explain why and how it can be done.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time limit for filing</span>. Unless the time limit for filing has been extended pursuant to &#x00A7; 2424.23 or part 2429 of this subchapter, within fifteen (15) days after the date the exclusive representative receives a copy of an agency's statement of position, the exclusive representative must file a response.</p>

With the exception of a request for severance under paragraph (d) of this section, you must limit your response to the matters that the agency raised in its statement of position. You must date your response, unless you file it electronically through use of the FLRA's eFiling system. And, regardless of how you file your response, you must ensure that it includes the following:</p>

You are not required to repeat arguments that you made in your petition for review. If not included in the petition for review, then you must state the arguments and authorities supporting any assertion that the proposal or provision does not affect a management right under 5 U.S.C. 7106(a), and any assertion that an exception to management rights applies, including:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;Whether and why the proposal or provision concerns a matter negotiable at the election of the agency under 5 U.S.C. 7106(b)(1);</p>

<p class="noindent-3">(iii) Whether and why the proposal or provision constitutes an appropriate arrangement as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 7106(b)(3); and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(iv)&#x2003;Whether and why the proposal or provision enforces an "applicable law," within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 7106(a)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Any allegation that agency rules or regulations relied on in the agency's statement of position violate applicable law, rule, regulation or appropriate authority outside the agency; that the rules or regulations were not issued by the agency or by any primary national subdivision of the agency, or otherwise are not applicable to bar negotiations under 5 U.S.C. 7117(a)(3); or that no compelling need exists for the rules or regulations to bar negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Severance</span>. If not requested in the petition for review, or if the exclusive representative wishes to modify the request in the petition <span id="Page_398"></span>for review, the exclusive representative may request severance in its response. The exclusive representative must support its request with an explanation of how the severed portion(s) of the proposal or provision may stand alone, and how such severed portion(s) would operate. The exclusive representative also must respond to any agency arguments regarding severance made in the agency's statement of position. The explanation and argument in support of the severed portion(s) must meet the same requirements for specific information set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time limit for filing</span>.

<p class="noindent-1">2424.30&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Procedure through which the petition for review will be resolved</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exclusive representative has filed related unfair labor practice charge or grievance alleging an unfair labor practice</span>. Except for proposals or provisions that are the subject of an agency's compelling need claim under 5 U.S.C. 7117(a)(2), where an exclusive representative files an unfair labor practice charge pursuant to part 2423 of this subchapter or a grievance alleging an unfair labor practice under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, and the charge or grievance concerns issues directly related to the petition for review filed pursuant to this part, the Authority will dismiss the petition for review. The dismissal will be without prejudice to the right of the exclusive representative to refile the petition for review after the unfair labor practice charge or grievance has been resolved administratively, including resolution pursuant to an arbitration award that has become final and binding. No later than thirty (30) days after the date on which the unfair labor practice charge or grievance is resolved administratively, the exclusive representative may refile the petition for review, and the Authority will determine whether resolution of the petition is still required.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exclusive representative has not filed related unfair labor practice charge or grievance alleging an unfair labor practice</span>. Where an exclusive representative files only a petition for review under this part, the petition will be processed as follows:</p>

Where a bargaining obligation dispute exists in addition to the negotiability dispute, the Authority will inform the exclusive representative of any opportunity to file an unfair labor practice charge pursuant to part 2423 of this subchapter or a grievance under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure and, where the exclusive representative pursues either of these courses, proceed in accord with paragraph (a) of this section. If the exclusive representative does not file an unfair labor practice charge or grievance, the Authority will proceed to resolve all disputes necessary for disposition of the petition unless, in its discretion, the Authority determines that resolving all disputes is not appropriate because, for example, resolution of the bargaining obligation dispute under this part would unduly delay resolution of the negotiability dispute, or the procedures in another, available administrative forum are better suited to resolve the bargaining obligation dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2424.31&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Resolution of disputed issues of material fact; hearings</span>.</p>

If the Authority finds that the duty to bargain does not extend to the proposal, then the Authority will dismiss the petition for review. If the Authority finds that the proposal is bargainable only at the election of the agency, then the Authority will so state. If the Authority resolves a negotiability dispute by finding that a proposal is within the duty to bargain, but there are unresolved bargaining obligation dispute claims, then the Authority will order the agency to bargain on request in the event its bargaining obligation claims are resolved in a manner that requires bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cases involving provisions</span>. If the Authority finds that a provision, or any severable part thereof, is not contrary to law, rule or regulation, or is bargainable at the election of the agency, the Authority will direct the agency to rescind its disapproval of such provision in whole or in part as appropriate. If the Authority finds that a provision is contrary to law, rule, or regulation, the Authority will dismiss the petition for review as to that provision.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The exclusive representative may report to the appropriate Regional Director an agency's failure to comply with an order, issued in accordance with &#x00A7; 2424.40, that the agency must upon request (or as otherwise agreed to by the parties) bargain concerning the proposal or that the agency must rescind its disapproval of a provision. The exclusive representative must report such failure within a reasonable period of time following expiration of the 60-day period under 5 U.S.C. 7123(a), which begins on the date of issuance of the Authority order. If, on referral from the Regional Director, the Authority finds such a failure to comply with its order, the Authority will take whatever action it deems necessary to secure compliance with its order, including enforcement under 5 U.S.C. 7123(b).</p>

<p class="noindent">FLRA does not address the merits of the proposal in its negotiability adjudication and it does not order an agency to agree to the proposal. <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. FLRA</span>, 699 F.2d 1280, 1284 (D.C. Cir. 1983). FLRA stated that it attempts to ascertain the truthfulness of factual assumptions or statements made in proposals, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and DHHS, HCFA, Baltimore</span>, 44 FLRA 1405, 1465 (1992) (Proposals 17, 18), although the more recent regulations, at 5 CFR 2424.31 (2022), provide for factfinding procedures, including a hearing. If, through the adjudication of a negotiability appeal, FLRA determines that the union proposal is negotiable, the agency must either negotiate or seek judicial review. 5 USC 7123(a); <span class="Italic">California NG v. FLRA</span>, 697 F.2d 874, 877 (9th Cir. 1983). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-12-008.html#sec4-9">Development of Factual Record</a>."] FLRA noted the existence of sanctioning authority, including the dismissal of a petition for review, for noncompliance with case processing procedures. <span class="Italic">See FEA Stateside Region and DODDDESS</span>, 56 FLRA 473, 473-74 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA rules on negotiability disputes as directly as possible, without becoming involved in a theoretical, preliminary analysis of its subject matter jurisdiction. FLRA does not make an initial determination over its jurisdiction by examining the merits of the parties' arguments pertaining to the negotiability of proposals. Assuming a timely filed petition, FLRA decides the merits of the dispute, declining to become embroiled in preliminary jurisdictional wrangles, in <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Prison Locals, Local 171 and FCI El Reno</span>, 52 FLRA 1484, 1490-92 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency describes its contention that the proposals do not concern unit employees' conditions of employment as challenging whether the Authority has subject matter jurisdiction over the Union's petition for review. However, it is clearly within the Authority's jurisdiction to determine whether a proposal affects unit employees' conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers, Franklin Lodge No. 2135 et al. and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 50 FLRA 677, 681-85 (1995), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied</span> 88 F.3d 1279 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (mem.) and cases cited therein. Neither of the arguments advanced by the Agency in support of this jurisdictional claim has merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In characterizing as jurisdictional its arguments concerning the impact of the proposals on the Government services provided pursuant to the penal statute, the Agency seeks to extend the court's ruling in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> beyond the issues it decided. In <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, the court held that the Authority did not have subject matter jurisdiction over a grievance because the grievant claimed a violation of a customs inspection statute, which the court determined was not a law issued "for the very purpose of affecting working conditions of [unit] employees." <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 43 F.3d at 689. Applying the definition of grievance set forth in section 7103(a)(9)(ii) of the Statute, the court concluded that the claim at issue in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> was not a grievance within the meaning of that section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The case before us involves a petition for review of negotiability issues, not exceptions to an arbitration award. We are not persuaded that there is any basis in the Statute for extending the rationale of <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> to this case by examining the purpose of the penal statute in order to determine if the Authority has jurisdiction to decide the Union's petition. In the context of a negotiability appeal, it is necessary to determine whether a matter proposed to be bargained directly affects "conditions of employment" of bargaining unit employees, as defined in section 7103(a)(14)<span class="Italic">. Antilles Consolidated Education Association and Antilles</span> <span class="Italic">Consolidated School System</span>, 22 FLRA 235, 236-37 (1986). Even if the Agency is correct that the penal statute is not a law that was issued for the very purpose of affecting conditions of employment of unit employees, this does not, in our view, <span class="Italic">ipso facto</span>, deprive the Authority of jurisdiction under section 7105(a)(2)(E) of the Statute over a petition for review of proposals aimed at the design of unit employees, work stations, the installation of safety features in the work place, and the number of unit employees placed on particular watches. Further, the Agency's assertion that the principal impact of the proposals is on the services it is required to provide, rather than unit employees' conditions of employment, is a merits argument about whether there is a duty to bargain over the proposals, not an argument about whether the Authority has statutory jurisdiction over the petition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In rejecting the Agency's contentions that the Authority lacks jurisdiction over the proposals because they do not concern unit employees' conditions of employment, we note that the question whether a proposal concerns unit employees' conditions of employment under section 7103(a)(14) more typically arises in the context of an agency's assertion that the proposal is not within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 49 and U.S. Department of the Army, Army Corps of Engineers, South <span id="Page_400"></span>Pacific Division, San Francisco, California</span>, 52 FLRA 665 (1996); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3824 and U.S. Department of Energy, Western Area Power Administration, Phoenix, Arizona</span>, 52 FLRA 332, 334-35 (1996)....</p>
