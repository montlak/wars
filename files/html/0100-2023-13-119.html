<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-118"><span class="space">5.</span> Security Clearance or Other Investigation</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 48 MSPR 680 (1991), <span class="Italic">reaff'd</span>, 51 MSPR 607, 689-92 (1991) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 978 F.2d 1223 (Fed. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">post</span>) (rejecting a claim for back pay when the clearances were ultimately restored), expanded the scope of indefinite suspensions, allowing them to be used during security clearance revocation investigations and implying that they may also be used for other inquiries into conduct detrimental to government interests:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellants here contend that the agency could not effect their indefinite suspensions pending a security clearance investigation absent reasonable cause to believe that they had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, the Federal Circuit's decisions and OPM's regulations demonstrate that indefinite suspensions can be effected, pending criminal proceedings or agency inquiry, under certain other circumstances in which an agency believes that the employee's retention on active duty could result in damage to Federal property, be detrimental to government interests, or be injurious to the employee, his fellow workers, or the public. <span class="Italic">Thomas,</span> 756 F.2d at 89; 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.402(e)<span class="Italic">. See Engdahl,</span> 900 F.2d at 1574-75; <span class="Italic">Mercer,</span> 772 F.2d at 858.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board has not previously adjudicated any appeals of indefinite suspensions taken pending the completion of a security clearance investigation, we have determined that an agency may effect or continue an indefinite suspension based on possible criminal misconduct for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, even though no criminal proceedings are ongoing, pending the agency's completion of its investigation of the alleged criminal misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Farris v. <span id="Page_2142"></span>Department of the Air Force,</span> 29 MSPR 518, 521-23 (1985); <span class="Italic">Littlejohn v. United States Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 25 MSPR 478, 481 (1984). Because an agency may take an adverse action of removal against an employee based on the revocation or suspension of his security clearance under the United States Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v.</span> <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> 484 U.S. 518, 108 S. Ct. 818, 98 L. Ed.2d 918 (1988), we can discern no reason why an agency cannot take an indefinite suspension action against an employee based on the suspension of his security access, pending the agency's investigation of his security clearance, under circumstances in which the agency believes that his retention in a duty status would be detrimental to government interests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> that, in an appeal under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513, based on the denial or revocation of a security clearance, the Board does not have authority to review the substance of the underlying security clearance determination. The Court ruled that the grant of a security clearance to a particular employee is a sensitive matter and that the denial of access to classified information and areas is entrusted to the sole discretion of the agency. 108 S. Ct. at 824. The Court reasoned as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It should be obvious that no one has a "right" to a security clearance. The grant of a clearance requires an affirmative act of discretion on the part of the granting official. The general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when "clearly consistent with the interests of the national security."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Court held that an employee removed for cause under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513, when his required security clearance is denied, is entitled to the procedural protections of &#x00A7; 7513:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board may determine whether such cause existed, whether in fact clearance was denied, and whether transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible. <span class="Italic">Nothing in the [statute enacting &#x00A7; 7513]</span> <span class="Italic">directs or empowers the Board to go further.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">108 S. Ct. at 825-26. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the Board lacks the authority to review the merits of the agency's suspension of the appellants' security access that is the basis for their indefinite suspensions, including the nexus between their alleged conduct and the suspension of their security access. <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> 108 S.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find in these appeals that the agency has established by preponderant evidence that the appellants' positions require a security clearance, their security access was suspended on October 6, 1989, and their indefinite suspensions were effected because their security access had been suspended pending a security clearance adjudication by the agency's CAF. We concur with the determination of the administrative judge that the agency identified the conditions subsequent that will lead to the termination of the appellants' indefinite suspensions. The appellants do not challenge the administrative judge's determinations that all positions in the Shipyard require security clearance and that reassignment to nonsensitive positions is not required, and we do not find any basis to disturb these determinations. <span class="Italic">See Riddick v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy,</span> 41 MSPR 369, 371 (1989); <span class="Italic">Van Duzer v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy,</span> 41 MSPR 357, 361-62 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellants stipulated that the agency afforded them their adverse action procedural rights under 5 CFR Part 752 in effecting their indefinite suspensions. They received prior written notice of the allegation against them, an opportunity to reply orally and in writing to the allegation, a written decision on the merits of the allegation, and notice of their rights of appeal to the Board. Under <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, they were entitled to no further Board review of the merits and the procedures used under 5 USC Chapter 75 to effect their indefinite suspensions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants contend that the agency denied them minimal due process in suspending their security access. In <span class="Italic">Weissberger v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Information Agency,</span> 39 MSPR 370, 373-74 (1988), the Board found that the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> does not bar Board review of whether the agency provided an employee with such minimal due process. An employee's minimal due process rights include: (1) Notice of the agency's security clearance determination; (2) a statement of the reasons in support of the determination; and (3) an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Egan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 28 MSPR 509, 519 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 868 F.2d 1277 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the appellants received notice of the agency's decision to suspend their access to classified information and areas on October 6, 1989, they were informed of the reasons for the agency's decision, and they were afforded the opportunity to respond that same day at the agency's pre-action interviews. Thus, the Board finds that the agency accorded the appellants minimal due process in suspending their security access. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pangarova,</span> 42 MSPR at 326; <span class="Italic">Weissberger,</span> 39 MSPR at 374-75; <span class="Italic">Woroweski,</span> 39 MSPR at 368-70.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants assert, nevertheless, that the agency's reasons for suspending their security access and effecting their indefinite suspensions, and its procedures for reviewing their security clearance, deny them due process. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, assuming without deciding that a Federal employee has a protected property interest in not being indefinitely suspended, has held that three factors are to be considered in determining what process is due to an indefinitely suspended Federal employee: (1) The employee's interests affected by the government's adverse action; (2) the government's interests; and (3) the risk of an erroneous decision and whether more accurate procedures might not reduce that possibility. <span class="Italic">Engdahl,</span> 900 F.2d at 1575-76.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants' indefinite suspension without pay in these appeals, although temporary, is a significant interest that has been substantially affected. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1576. The agency's interests, however, are far more substantial. The agency has a "compelling interest" in withholding national security information from unauthorized persons, and its authority to withhold such information is not subject to Board scrutiny. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 108 S. Ct. at 824; <span class="Italic">Skees v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 864 F.2d 1576, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1989). Furthermore, the procedures followed by the agency before the appellants were indefinitely suspended provided them an opportunity consistent with <span class="Italic">Egan</span> to persuade the agency that its concerns were ill-founded. <span class="Italic">See Engdahl,</span> 900 F.2d at 1576.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Except for determining that the appellants were afforded minimal due process, the Board is precluded from reviewing constitutional claims in connection with the merits of the agency's suspension of their security access and its procedures for reviewing their security clearance. <span class="Italic">See Lyles v. Department of the Army,</span> 864 F.2d 1581, 1583 (Fed.

Thus, we reject the appellants' additional assertions that their rights to due process have been violated because such assertions are beyond the Board's authority to review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's approach in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> was affirmed in the Federal Circuit, <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 978 F.2d 1223, 1224-27 (Fed. Cir. 1992), deciding that the requisite due process is provided if the agency furnishes the employee with "some indication of the reasons for an agency's decision to suspend access to classified information before placing an employee on enforced leave," along with reply rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioners Jones and McDaniel worked respectively as a guard and a police officer at the Security Office of the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Both positions required security clearances, which they had.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following an interview in which the Navy informed the petitioners that it had been reported that they had used and possessed cocaine, the agency terminated their access to classified information. At the interview, both men were permitted to respond to the allegations. McDaniel denied the charge; Jones made no statement. The agency initiated an investigation to determine whether it should cancel the petitioners' security clearances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency then gave each employee thirty days written notice of a proposed suspension "for an indefinite period until a final decision on your security clearance has been made." The notice informed them that they could make personal and/or written replies, which they did. The agency suspended each employee, placing them in a "(non-duty, non-pay status) pending the completion of" the security clearance investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fourteen months later, the agency made a favorable determination regarding their security clearance, "reinstated" their "access to classified information," and restored them to their positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioners appealed their indefinite suspensions to the Board. The parties stipulated that the Navy afforded the petitioners the procedural rights required by law when it indefinitely suspended them. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7513 (1988); 5 CFR 752.404 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board upheld the suspensions. It ruled (1) that the pendency of the security clearance investigations was a proper basis for suspension pending completion of the investigation; (2) that the subsequent continuation of the petitioners' security clearances did not require reversal of the indefinite suspensions and the award of back pay for the period of suspension; and (3) that the agency did not deny petitioners minimum due process. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 48 MSPR 680 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioners contend that they were denied procedural due process in the termination of their access to classified information because the agency did not give them full information about the basis for such termination; that because access to such material was a condition of their continued employment, such termination necessarily would have resulted in their suspension from employment; and that their indefinite suspensions, therefore, were effected in violation of their constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2143"></span>The argument fails because it rests upon a faulty premise. The petitioners did not have a liberty or property interest in access to classified information, and the termination of that access therefore did not implicate any due process concerns. <span class="Italic">Board of Regents v. Roth</span>, 408 U.S. 564, 569, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 2705, 33 L. Ed.2d 548 (1972).

<p class="Block-Quote2">The Executive Branch has constitutional responsibility to classify and control access to information bearing on national security. A security clearance is merely temporary permission by the Executive for access to national secrets. It flows from a discretionary exercise of judgment by the Executive as to the suitability of the recipient for such access, consistent with the interests of national security. The notion of an individual property right in access to the nation's secrets--by definition a limitation on Executive discretion--is utterly inconsistent with those principles. Whatever expectation an individual might have in a clearance is unilateral at best, and thus cannot be the basis for a constitutional right<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, no employee has a property "right" to a security clearance or access to classified information. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 528, 108 S.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Navy did not make public the allegation of the petitioners' use of cocaine or the suspension of their security clearances. <span class="Italic">Doe v. Cheney</span>, 885 F.2d 898, 910 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (agency actions do not stigmatize employee when agency did not make public accusations against employee that might damage his standing in the community). The petitioners had no liberty interest in their security clearance, since its loss did not reflect upon their characters. <span class="Italic">See Dorfmont</span>, 913 F.2d at 1403; <span class="Italic">Jamil</span>, 910 F.2d at 1209; <span class="Italic">Hill</span>, 844 F.2d at 1411; <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 743 F.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, the petitioners stipulated that the procedures the Navy followed in indefinitely suspending them--which included thirty days advance written notice and the opportunity to make written and/or oral responses--satisfied legal requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioners apparently do not question that the Navy's termination of access to classified information justified the agency in indefinitely suspending them pending its determination whether to cancel their security clearances. The regulations that govern <span id="Page_2144"></span>indefinite suspensions provide that the suspensions may continue "pending investigation, inquiry, or further agency action." 5 CFR 752.402(e) (1992). The Board previously had upheld indefinite suspensions to allow an agency to examine an employee's conduct when it had reasonable cause to believe that the employee committed a crime punishable by imprisonment. <span class="Italic">Canevari v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 50 MSPR 311, 315 (1991). We have sustained indefinite suspensions for that reason, <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. Department of Justice</span>, 956 F.2d 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1992), and also, pending the results of psychiatric fitness-for-duty examinations. <span class="Italic">Mercer v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 772 F.2d 856 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. General Servs. Admin.</span>, 756 F.2d 86 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 474 U.S. 843, 106 S. Ct. 129, 88 L. Ed.2d 106 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The same principle supports an indefinite suspension pending an agency's determination of whether it should revoke an employee's security clearance. In all three situations, the suspension "will promote the efficiency of the service," 5 USC 7513 (1988)--here by enabling the agency to determine whether its employees should have access to classified information before permitting them to return to the job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioners challenge their indefinite suspensions, however, on the ground that they were invalid because they had no ascertainable duration or expiration date. The governing regulation imposes no such requirement. To the contrary, it states that an indefinite suspension places</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an employee in a temporary status without duties and pay pending investigation, inquiry, or further agency action. The indefinite suspension continues for an indeterminate period of time and ends with the occurrence of the pending conditions set forth in the notice of action which may include the completion of any subsequent administrative action. 5 CFR 752.402(e) (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The indefinite suspensions of the petitioners satisfied that standard. In its notice of proposed indefinite suspension, the agency informed the petitioners that the suspensions would continue until the "completion of the final decision by the Central Adjudication Facility" on whether to continue or cancel their security clearances. It set forth in detail the circumstances under which and the time when the suspensions would terminate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The suspensions necessarily took this form, since at their outset, the Navy could not predict how long it would take to complete the security clearance investigations. It was clear, however, that the suspensions would last only as long as necessary to perform that task. <span class="Italic">See Jarvis v. Department of Justice</span>, 45 MSPR 104, 109 (1990) ("at the time the suspension was effected, its exact duration, while not ascertainable, was temporary, as it was subject to a condition subsequent"); <span class="Italic">Canevari</span>, 50 MSPR at 315 ("An essential requirement of a valid indefinite suspension is that the suspension have a condition subsequent, such as the completion of a trial or an investigation, that will terminate the suspension.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The duration of the suspensions was no more indefinite than other indefinite suspensions we have upheld. In <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1151, we upheld a suspension during the pendency of criminal charges against the employee. In <span class="Italic">Mercer</span>, 772 F.2d at 858, we sustained a suspension pending a psychiatric evaluation of an employee's ability to perform his job. In <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 756 F.2d at 87, we upheld a suspension that would "run until GSA decided whether to apply for disability retirement on petitioner's behalf." <span class="Italic">See also Jarvis</span>, 45 MSPR at 109. There were no specific final dates for the suspensions in any of those cases. Rather, the suspensions continued for the time necessary for the completion of the underlying proceedings that had engendered the suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioners argue that the suspensions in this case were different from those in the other cases because here the agency did not explicitly state that it would investigate the petitioners' security clearances to determine whether they should be cancelled. There was no doubt, however, that the agency would be conducting such investigations. The notice of proposed suspension stated that the suspensions would continue "until a final decision has been made on your security clearance." The agency investigated the possible revocation of the petitioners' security clearances and decided not to cancel them. The indefinite suspension of the petitioners' security clearances was valid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The result in this case is harsh, since the petitioners were without pay for the fourteen months during which the investigation continued, but did not receive back pay after the agency rejected the allegations against them. As the law now stands, however, since we have upheld the suspensions, there is no basis upon which we could award them back pay for that period. <span class="Italic">See Wiemers v. MSPB</span>, 792 F.2d 1113, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Perhaps Congress will consider the problem and decide to remedy the situation to permit the award of back pay to employees in that position for the period of their suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Either an indefinite suspension or enforced leave may be used to remove the employee from duty and pay status during the investigation into his security clearance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chapman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 62 MSPR 267, 269 (1994) ("The agency's enforced leave action constitutes a constructive indefinite suspension, an adverse action under 5 USC 7512."). An indefinite suspension may be used for an employee who holds a noncritical sensitive position, but agency procedures must be followed if the appellant's eligibility to hold that position is suspended. Temporary suspension of the employee's clearance does not justify an indefinite suspension based on inability to hold the noncritical sensitive position if agency procedures for revoking that privilege are not followed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 120 MSPR 607, 611 &#x00B6; 11, 2014 MSPB 10 (2014).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The indefinite suspension is used for loss of required access to classified information, not for loss of eligibility to occupy a noncritical sensitive position. Although under <span class="Italic">Kaplan v. Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d 1148 (Fed. Cir. 2013), the Board may not substantively review national security determinations concerning eligibility of an individual to occupy a sensitive position, regardless of whether the position requires access to classified information, under <span class="Italic">Williams v. DOD</span>, CH-0752-11-0075-A-1 (NP 11/25/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has held in no uncertain terms that the denial or suspension of eligibility to occupy a sensitive position cannot serve as a basis for an indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">Williams,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 675, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18; <span class="Italic">see also Hall</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 687, &#x00B6; 12. In light of that holding, an indefinite suspension such as the one on appeal cannot be sustained as a matter of law, and is thus clearly without merit regardless of the merits of the charge or the underlying eligibility determination. <span class="Italic">See Siedle v. Department of the Interior,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 211, 215 (1990) (fees were warranted under the "clearly without merit" standard when a performance action was taken on the basis of non-work-related behavior, even though the behavior may have been actionable misconduct).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the merits of the underlying eligibility determination are immaterial, it is likewise immaterial whether the Board has authority to review them. Consequently, the Federal Circuit's holding in <span class="Italic">Conyers</span> that the Board lacks authority to review eligibility determinations does not abrogate <span class="Italic">Williams</span> and <span class="Italic">Hall</span>. <span class="Italic">Cf. Gonzalez,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 381, &#x00B6; 22 (distinguishing the scope of the Board's review authority over an agency's decision to suspend or revoke access to classified information from "the nature of the underlying cause for the indefinite suspension"). Nor is there anything in the court's <span class="Italic">Conyers</span> decision to contradict the statement in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> and <span class="Italic">Hall</span> that access to classified information is "not synonymous" with eligibility to occupy a sensitive position. <span class="Italic">See Williams,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 675, &#x00B6; 18; <span class="Italic">Hall,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 687, &#x00B6; 12. Indeed, the court noted that the Supreme Court had previously made clear in <span class="Italic">Cole v. Young,</span> 351 U.S. 536, 546 (1956), that the two concepts are "parallel but not identical." <span class="Italic">Conyers,</span> 733 F.3d at 1159 n.12; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 1157 (observing that "categorizing a sensitive position is undertaken without regard to classified information").

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit entered the picture in 1996, reviewing the <span class="Italic">Alston</span> series and determining that the Board had the jurisdiction to ensure that employees were provided minimal due process before they were suspended pending inquiry into their security clearance. The court noted, however, that the appellant had received due process, <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 659-63 (Fed. Cir. 1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 5, 1989, the agency temporarily suspended Alston's access to classified information and to restricted areas. In a letter to Alston, the agency informed him that his access was temporarily suspended because "[he] may suffer from a medical condition which requires further investigation and evaluation." The agency did not identify any specific medical condition. Subsequently, because Alston no longer had access to his work site, the agency placed him on administrative leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 1, 1989, the agency proposed to place Alston on enforced <span id="Page_2145"></span>leave, presumably without pay, pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-14 pending completion of an investigation and adjudication as to whether his security clearance should be revoked. In its notice of the proposed action, the agency stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;This is a notice of proposed action to place you on enforced leave for such time as you are eligible for access to classified information....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;The specific circumstances supporting the proposed enforced leave are:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">b.&#x2003;The position you currently hold, Instrument Mechanic, WG-11, requires that you work and perform in nuclear controlled areas and have access to classified documents. Further, your position requires that you hold a security clearance with access to the controlled industrial area and other restricted areas of the shipyard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">c.&#x2003;On 5 July 1989, you were notified by the Administrative Officer that your access to classified information, the Controlled Industrial Area, as well as other restricted areas of the shipyard was being temporarily suspended pending further investigation and adjudication insofar as your security clearance was concerned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;Eligibility for a security clearance is a condition of employment in your position at this Shipyard. Your services cannot be fully utilized without a clearance. You are not currently eligible to perform the duties for which you were hired due to the status of your security clearance. An effort has been made to locate a non-critical sensitive position in the Production Department which you could perform without a security clearance, however, none was found.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">4.&#x2003;You are advised of your right to reply to this notice both orally and/or in writing, to submit affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of your reply, including medical documentation if you wish to have any medical condition considered which may have contributed to the reasons for this proposed action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, Alston's attorney submitted medical documentation to the agency and met with them to discuss the proposed action. During this meeting, Alston's attorney discussed the possibility of placing Alston on disability or worker's compensation. Despite these discussions, the agency placed Alston on enforced leave on January 18, 1990 until such time as he became eligible for access to classified information. Alston appealed the agency decision to the board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision, the administrative judge (AJ) reversed the agency action. The AJ held that the agency, when it placed Alston on enforced leave, did not act according to its own regulations. In particular, the AJ held that the agency failed to show that the placement of Alston on enforced leave promoted the efficiency of the service. The AJ further held that the agency failed to demonstrate that a lesser penalty could not have been imposed. The agency petitioned the board for review and the board affirmed the result of the AJ's decision, but used different reasoning. In its decision, the board held that the agency denied Alston his due process rights when it failed to provide him with an opportunity to reply to its notice concerning the suspension of his security clearance. <span class="Italic">Alston v. Department of Navy</span>, 48 MSPR 694 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM petitioned the board for reconsideration. In a split decision on June 22, 1993, the board granted OPM's petition and reversed its previous decision. <span class="Italic">Alston v. Department of Navy,</span> 58 MSPR 158 (1993). Relying on <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Navy</span>, 978 F.2d 1223 (Fed. Cir. 1992), the board held that constitutional due process rights do not attach to the suspension of an employee's access to classified information. Thus, the board found that Alston was not entitled to notice of the reasons for the agency's access determination prior to being placed on enforced leave. Accordingly, the board affirmed the agency's decision to place Alston on enforced leave pending completion of its investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After a change in the board's composition, the board reopened and reconsidered its June 22, 1993 decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B) (1994) (agency decision final unless the board reopens and reconsiders a case on its own motion). In another split decision, the board reversed its June 22, 1993 decision. <span class="Italic">Alston v. Department of Navy,</span> 62 MSPR 19 (1994). The board held that Alston was denied meaningful due process under the Constitution, as well as the procedural protections to which he was entitled pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b). The board based its decision on the agency's failure to provide adequate notice of the reasons for the suspension such that Alston had a meaningful opportunity to respond to the agency's action placing Alston on enforced leave. OPM now appeals<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(d) (1994) ("The Director of the Office of Personnel Management may obtain review of any final order or decision of the Board...if the Director determines, in his discretion, that the Board erred interpreting a civil service law, rule or regulation affecting personnel management....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it is clear that no one has a "right" to a security clearance or access to classified information, <span class="Italic">see Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy v. Egan,</span> 484 U.S. 518, 108 S. Ct. 818, 98 L. Ed.2d 918 (1988), an employee, as defined by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7501, has a property right in his continued employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(a) (1994) (agency may take an action under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-14 against an employee only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service). <span class="Italic">See also Cleveland Bd. of</span> <span class="Italic">Educ. v. Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. 532, 538-39, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 1491, 84 L. Ed.2d 494 (1985) (Ohio statute creates property interest in continued employment). An employee cannot be deprived of that interest without the procedural protections provided by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language of the statute is clear. Prior to an adverse action, the agency must provide an employee with "written notice...stating the specific reasons for the proposed action." A notice of a proposed adverse action "is sufficient under [5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1)] when it apprises the employee of the nature of the charges 'in sufficient detail to allow the employee to make an informed reply.'" <span class="Italic">Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (quoting <span class="Italic">Brewer v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 227 Ct. Cl. 276, 647 F.2d 1093, 1097 (1981)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, section 7513(b) entitles an employee to notice of the reasons for the suspension of his access to classified information when that is the reason for placing the employee on enforced leave pending a decision on the employee's security clearance. Such notice provides the employee with an adequate opportunity to make a meaningful reply to the agency before being placed on enforced leave. Merely providing the employee with information that his access to classified information is being suspended, without more, does not provide the employee with sufficient information to make an informed reply to the agency before being placed on enforced leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency provided Alston with sufficient notice to satisfy his statutory guarantees. The agency notified him in a notice of "Suspension of Access to Classified Information" that his access was being suspended because of a potential medical condition. Moreover, in the agency's "Notice of Proposed Enforced Leave," the agency informed Alston that he was being placed on enforced leave based on the suspension of his access to classified information and that he had the right to reply, including the opportunity to "submit medical documentation if you wish to have any medical condition considered." Such notice provided Alston with sufficient information to permit him to make an informed reply to the agency's proposed decision to place him on enforced leave, and Alston does not assert otherwise. Alston was thus able to focus his response on his medical status, rather than to have to guess whether the agency's action was based on disloyalty, unreliability, or other possible ground for suspension of access to classified information. In fact, Alston did meet with agency officials and offered medical evidence, which the agency considered, before it decided to place him on enforced leave. Section 7513(b) does not require more procedural protection than that which was provided by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 108 S. Ct. 818, 98 L. Ed.2d 918 (1988), deprives this court and the board of the power to review the agency's actions in suspending Alston's access. In <span class="Italic">Egan</span> the Supreme Court was faced with the "narrow question...whether the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) has authority by statute to review the substance of an underlying decision to deny or revoke a security clearance in the course of reviewing an adverse action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 520, 108 S. Ct. at 820. The Court held that the board did not have such authority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The [Civil Service Reform Act of 1978] by its terms does not confer broad authority on the Board to review a security-clearance determination.... [T]he Board does have jurisdiction to review "adverse actions," a term, however, limited to a removal, a suspension for more than 14 days, a reduction in grade or pay, and a furlough of 30 days or less. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(d), 7512. A denial of a security clearance is not such an "adverse action," and by its own force is not subject to Board review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 530, 108 S. Ct. at 825-26. We agree with OPM that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> precludes our court and the board from reviewing the substance of an agency decision to suspend access or to revoke a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See Drumheller v. Department of Army</span>, 49 F.3d 1566, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("To the extent Drumheller's arguments go to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the Army's decision to revoke her security clearance, the clear answer is that the MSPB does not have jurisdiction to review the merits of such a decision.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, OPM misconstrues what is at issue in this case. Neither this court nor the Board is reviewing the merits of the agency's decision to <span id="Page_2146"></span>suspend Alston's access to classified information. Nor are we reviewing the procedures the agency followed in denying such access. We are only determining that the agency provided Alston with the procedural protection guaranteed by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b) when it placed him on enforced leave. <span class="Italic">See Covington v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Health and Human Servs.,</span> 750 F.2d 937, 944 (Fed. Cir. 1984) ("Congress has charged the Board with the job of protecting the procedural rights of federal employees.")<span class="Italic">. Egan</span> does not foreclose board review of the procedures used by the agency in placing Alston on enforced leave. Although the action was based on the suspension of access to classified information, the agency was still required to comply with the statute, and in this case it did. <span class="Italic">See Egan,</span> 484 U.S. at 530, 108 S. Ct. at 825-26 ("An employee who is removed for 'cause' under &#x00A7; 7513, when his required clearance is denied, is entitled to the several procedural protections specified in that statute.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor is our decision inconsistent with our previous decision in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Navy</span>, 978 F.2d 1223 (Fed. Cir. 1992). In <span class="Italic">Jones,</span> we held that a federal employee has no liberty or property interest in access to classified information and therefore that no due process protection applies to a suspension of access to classified information. 978 F.2d at 1225. However, our decision in that case did not deal with the mandate of section 7513(b) when an agency places an employee on enforced leave. In <span class="Italic">Jones,</span> the Navy informed two employees that they were being placed on enforced leave and their access to classified information suspended indefinitely pending an investigation into reports that the employees possessed and used cocaine. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The agency further provided the employees with an opportunity to reply. Moreover, the employees stipulated that the Navy provided them with the procedural rights required by law. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1224-25. Thus, the employees in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> did not challenge and we did not address whether the employees were provided with the statutory procedures required by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the board may not review the substantive reasons for a suspension of access to classified information when an employee is placed on enforced leave, it still must ensure that the agency provides the statutory procedural protections guaranteed by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b). In this case, the agency provided Alston with all the process required by law. Therefore, we hold that the board's decision to the contrary was in error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a challenge to an indefinite suspension based on suspension of a clearance is sustained by the Board for lack of procedural due process, the AJ must consider the appellant's claims of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 85 MSPR 130, 134 &#x00B6; 10 (2000). [Refer to n Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-20-154.html#sec13-146">Security Clearance Suspension, Revocation; Other Certification</a>" for decisions concluding that the Board lacks IRA jurisdiction to consider issues pertaining to security clearance suspensions or revocations; refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-079.html#sec8-79">Security Clearance Revocation; Sensitive Position</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-15-085.html#sec8-85">EEO Issue; Whistleblowing Reprisal; Disparate Treatment; USERRA</a>" for decisions denying the Board's authority to consider various affirmative defenses in response to adverse actions based on security clearance suspensions and revocations.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The indefinite suspension based on security reasons is based on a loss of access to classified information. The rule that the Board cannot go behind the reasons for the suspension of a clearance was, at least through the 2013 Federal Circuit decision in <span class="Italic">Kaplan v. Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d 1148 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant held the position of Accounting Technician, GS-0525-05, with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) in Cleveland, Ohio. By memorandum dated May 27, 2008, Linda L. Patten, the Branch Chief for the agency's Central Adjudication Facility (CAF), Washington Headquarters Service (WHS), advised the appellant that CAF had made a "tentative determination" to deny her eligibility to occupy a "sensitive position."[1] In support of this determination, the agency attached a "Statement of Reasons" and advised that "[a] vailable information tends to show [the appellant] ha[d] a history of not meeting [her] financial obligations" demonstrating she was "unable or unwilling to satisfy [her] debts."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The agency alleged that CAF had tentatively denied the appellant "eligibility for access to classified information and/or occupancy of a sensitive position." However, the unrefuted record demonstrates the appellant was not in a position that required her to maintain eligibility for access to classified information and CAF's decision was based solely on its determination to deny eligibility to occupy a sensitive position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency notified the appellant that she could respond to CAF's "tentative determination" and, on September 5, 2008, she submitted a written response. In her response, the appellant stated that her financial difficulties were the product of circumstances beyond her control, to include "sickness and illnesses within the family," and other pressing financial familial obligations. She also stated that she had "sought professional guidance" and started "making the necessary arrangement with the creditors to have this matter taken care of," noting that she had "contacted the creditors via telephone and regular mail" in order to "settle [her] outstanding debt[s] with them."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 9, 2010, CAF informed the appellant that her financial considerations remained a concern and that she had not provided sufficient information to mitigate that concern. The CAF Letter of Decision informed the appellant of her right to appeal that decision in writing to the WHS Clearance Appeal Board (CAB), or to request a personal appearance before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 106. On July 16, 2010, the appellant made a written election to request a personal appearance before DOHA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a memorandum dated July 30, 2010, the agency proposed to indefinitely suspend the appellant from her position after concluding she was no longer qualified for her non-critical sensitive position based on CAF's decision "to deny [her] access to sensitive [ ] information," which is a requirement for her position. The agency also notified the appellant that she could respond to the proposed action orally and/or in writing. Finally, it advised that the indefinite suspension would remain in effect "until WHS CAB [sic] issues its decision and we take any necessary follow-on administrative actions related to their [sic] decision." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant did not respond to the proposed action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 31, 2010, the agency issued a "Notice of Decision" in which it sustained the proposed action and indefinitely suspended the appellant from her position effective September 1, 2010. In its decision letter, the agency notified the appellant that the suspension would remain in effect "until a final decision on [her] appeal is issued and we take any necessary follow-up administrative actions related to that decision."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a timely Board appeal from the suspension action. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal without prejudice on the appellant's motion. The appellant refiled her appeal and argued, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that there was no nexus between her alleged financial difficulties and the efficiency of the service. She also argued that the agency committed harmful procedural error when it failed to consider the requisite mitigating and aggravating circumstances as required by <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Finally, she argued that the penalty imposed was overly harsh. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Administrative Judge Properly Determined That the Appeal Was Governed by the Conyers/Northover Standard</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, in an adverse action appeal, the agency must prove its charge by a preponderance of the evidence, establish a nexus between the action and the efficiency of the service, and establish that the penalty it imposed is within the tolerable bounds of reasonableness. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(a); 7701(c)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 306-07. More specifically, in appeals such as this, when the charge involves the agency's withdrawal of its certification or approval of an employee's fitness or other qualification for the position, the Board has consistently recognized that its adjudicatory authority generally extends to a review of the merits of that withdrawal. <span class="Italic">See Adams v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board narrowly construed the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> rule in two subsequent interlocutory appeals: <span class="Italic">Conyers</span> and <span class="Italic">Northover.</span> In <span class="Italic">Conyers,</span> the Board held that the rule limiting the scope of Board review when an adverse action appeal is based on loss of a "security clearance" was not applicable to an indefinite suspension based on the denial of an employee's eligibility to occupy a non-critical sensitive (NCS) position which did not require that she have a security clearance or access to classified information. <span class="Italic">See Conyers,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13. In <span class="Italic">Northover,</span> the Board held that the rule limiting the scope of Board review when an adverse action appeal involves loss of a "security clearance" applies only when the agency has made a decision to deny, revoke, or suspend access or eligibility for access to classified information and was not applicable to a reduction in grade which was based on the denial of an employee's eligibility to occupy an NCS position. <span class="Italic">See Northover,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's circumstances are very similar to those of the appellant in <span class="Italic">Conyers. See Conyers,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 3, 13. The appellant holds a position with DFAS that requires that she maintain <span id="Page_2147"></span>eligibility to hold a sensitive position, but that does not require access to classified information. We therefore find that the administrative judge correctly determined that the Board has the authority to review the merits of the adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Agency May Not Indefinitely Suspend the Appellant Under the Circumstances in This Case</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To sustain an indefinite suspension, the agency must show: (1) It imposed the suspension for an authorized reason, <span class="Italic">see Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 13 (2010); (2) the suspension has an ascertainable end, i.e., a determinable condition subsequent that will bring the suspension to a conclusion<span class="Italic">, e.g., Drain v. Department of Justice,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 562, &#x00B6; 8 (2008); (3) the suspension bears a nexus to the efficiency of the service, <span class="Italic">Harding v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 284, &#x00B6; 21 (2010), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 451 Fed. Appx. 947 (Fed. Cir. 2011); and (4) the penalty is reasonable, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> &#x00B6; 22.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to what constitutes an authorized reason for indefinitely suspending an employee, the Board and its reviewing court have approved indefinite suspensions under three limited circumstances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;when an agency has reasonable cause to believe an employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed, pending the outcome of the criminal proceeding or any subsequent agency action following the conclusion of the criminal process;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;when the agency has legitimate concerns that an employee's medical condition makes his continued presence in the workplace dangerous or inappropriate, pending a determination that the employee is fit for duty; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;when an employee's access to classified information has been suspended and the employee must have such access to perform his job, pending a final determination on the employee's access to classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Gonzalez,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 13. Although it is not a finite list, the Board has yet to identify any further circumstances under which it would approve indefinitely suspending an employee. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">None of the three limited circumstances that allow for an indefinite suspension exists in this case. Moreover, we do not find that the facts of the case at bar present a basis for expanding the list. The agency did not suspend the appellant under the crime provision, because of a medical condition, or because her access to classified information had been suspended and she needed such access to perform her job.[4] As the Board explained in <span class="Italic">Conyers,</span> eligibility for access to classified information is not synonymous with eligibility to occupy a sensitive position. <span class="Italic">See Conyers,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6; 17. Accordingly, the agency has failed to prove by preponderant evidence that it properly placed the appellant on an indefinite suspension. Therefore, we find that the indefinite suspension cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;As noted above, the appellant was not required to have access to classified information to perform her job.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v. DOD</span>, 117 MSPR 687, 2012 MSPB 47 (2012) (same type of personnel action, analysis, and result as in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, <span class="Italic">supra.</span> [Some analysis of <span class="Italic">Williams</span> and <span class="Italic">Hall</span> and like decisions was effectively overruled by the Federal Circuit's 2013 decision in <span class="Italic">Kaplan v. Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d 1148 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), discussed in Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-089.html#sec8-89">Sensitive Duties Not Requiring a Clearance: <span class="Italic">Conyers</span></a>."] But the Board's opinion that an indefinite suspension cannot be based on an agency determination that an individual can not hold a sensitive position, regardless of the need for access to classified information, was confirmed as to a counsel fee application in <span class="Italic">Williams v. DOD</span>, CH-0752-11-0075-A-1 (NP 11/25/2013), <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At issue in an indefinite suspension based on a clearance suspension may be whether the position actually required a clearance. [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-083.html#sec8-83">Decision to Require a Clearance; Whether Clearance Required as Employment Condition</a>," and discussion of <span class="Italic">Gamboa v.
