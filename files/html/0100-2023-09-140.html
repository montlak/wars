<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-138"><span class="space">a.</span> Withdrawal to Pursue EEO Complaint; Withdrawal of EEO Claim</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appeal is withdrawn because an appellant wants to pursue his case or a related matter in another forum, e.g., EEOC, it seems that the Board may treat the withdrawal as one without prejudice--or it may not--so the appellant should be specific as to the nature of the withdrawal sought in her motion. If the withdrawal is treated as being without prejudice to refiling, the appellant can then refile the appeal if the refiling is otherwise timely and the appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Cavanagh v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 485, 490, 487-90 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency argues that the administrative judge erred in declining to apply the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res</span> <span class="Italic">judicata</span> in this case. In connection with this issue, it notes that the appellant first appealed his removal to the regional office shortly after the agency took that action, and that the appeal was dismissed with prejudice. It also maintains that all the necessary elements of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> are present here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted in his order declining to apply the doctrine to this case, the appellant's first appeal of his removal was dismissed after the appellant informed the administrative judge who was handling that case (a different administrative judge from the one who handled the appellant's second appeal) that he had "elected to have [his] complaint processed through E.E.O." and that he was withdrawing the appeal. The order declining to apply <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to this case also included a statement that the dismissal had been made "with prejudice," and that it had been issued after the agency had filed its response to the appellant's appeal. The administrative judge in this second appeal then stated, citing Wright &#x0026; Miller, <span class="Italic">Federal Practice and Procedure</span> (hereinafter cited as <span class="Italic">Federal Practice</span>): Civil &#x00A7; 2367 (1971), that, "by analogy to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2), the dismissal decision could be given <span class="Italic">res judicata effect."</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rule 41(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in part that, "[e]xcept as provided in [Rule 41(a)(1)], an action shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper." Rule 41(a)(1) provides in part that "an action may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court...by filing a notice of dismissal at any time before service by the adverse party of an answer or of a motion for summary judgment, whichever first occurs." We do not concur in the administrative judge's apparent finding that these provisions (and <span class="Italic">Federal Practice)</span> support application of the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to this appeal. Instead, the provisions indicate that, when a plaintiff requests dismissal of his complaint after the other party has filed an answer to the complaint, and when he does not specify that the dismissal should be with or without prejudice, the decision as to whether the dismissal is to be made with or without prejudice is left to the discretion of the court. <span class="Italic">Federal Practice</span> &#x00A7; 2367. Because the appellant in this case withdrew his appeal after the agency had filed its response to the administrative judge's initial order, and because he did not specify in his notice of withdrawal whether his appeal was to be dismissed with or without prejudice, these provisions of Rule 41(a) lend support only to the view that the administrative judge had discretion with respect to the manner in which she was to dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the agency has pointed out, the administrative judge who dismissed the appellant's appeal stated that she was dismissing it with prejudice. For the reasons stated below, we find that the appeal should have been dismissed without prejudice to its refiling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we note that a voluntary dismissal of an action at the request of the party bringing that action generally is not regarded as barring a new action on the same subject matter. 50 C.J.S. <span class="Italic">Judgments &#x00A7;</span> 633 (1947). <span class="Italic">See In Re Piper Aircraft Distribution</span> <span class="Italic">System Antitrust Litigation,</span> 551 F.2d 213, 219 (8th Cir. 1977); <span class="Italic">Markham v. Anderson,</span> 465 F. Supp. 541, 543 (E.D. Mich. 1979); <span class="Italic">Schupak v. Califano,</span> 454 F. Supp. 105, 113 (E.D.N.Y. 1978). Although this rule is not followed when the party making the request "affirmatively appears [to have] intended to abandon the action," 50 C.J.S. <span class="Italic">Judgments</span> &#x00A7; 633 (1947), there is no indication in this case that the appellant had any such intention. Instead, his withdrawal is consistent with 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(a), which provides that an appellant may pursue a discrimination complaint in his agency and later pursue an appeal arising from the same action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we note, as did the administrative judge, that denying the appellant the opportunity to obtain Board review of his refiled appeal would be inconsistent with the regulatory provision cited above. When an appellant who already has filed a formal discrimination complaint with his agency later files an appeal of the action that is the subject of the complaint, and when the appellant chooses to withdraw his appeal in order to pursue his complaint first, the Board's practice is to dismiss the appeal without prejudice to its later refiling. <span class="Italic">See Bradley v. Department of the Navy,</span> 3 MSPR 69, 70-71 (1980). This practice has the effect of preserving the appellant's right to Board review while allowing the appellant to obtain review in his own agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that this case differs somewhat from <span class="Italic">Bradley</span> in that the appellant filed his appeal before he filed his discrimination complaint.[6] In some cases, this circumstance could cause the agency to be unwilling to review the merits of an appellant's complaint. When an agency is willing to review the merits of the complaint, however--as it was in this case--the fact that the appellant filed his appeal before he filed his formal complaint should not preclude Board review of appealable matters that are the subject of the complaint.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The administrative judge's ruling on the <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> issue indicates that he believed that the appellant had filed his discrimination complaint before he had filed his initial appeal. As we have indicated below, however, the order in which the complaint and the appeal were filed does not affect our decision regarding this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We do not rule out the possibility that, under some circumstances, an appellant who withdraws his appeal in order to pursue a complaint within his agency might be precluded from <span id="Page_1082"></span>obtaining a later review of the merits of his refiled appeal. This result might be appropriate, for example, if the administrative judge has taken substantial steps toward the adjudication of the appeal. In this case, however, there is no indication that the administrative judge, before dismissing the appeal, had taken any steps other than that of obtaining the agency file.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we find that the initial decision dismissing the appeal does not operate as a bar to the appellant's subsequent refiling of his appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 474, 477-78 (1996) ("[W]here an appellant requests withdrawal of an appeal in order to file a formal EEO complaint with the agency, the appeal should be dismissed without prejudice.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the unwary appellant may find herself without a remedy if an appeal is withdrawn to pursue an EEO complaint. If the appellant initially elects MSPB as the forum of choice, then withdraws the MSPB appeal in favor of an EEO complaint, the agency may reject the EEO complaint because of the earlier election of the MSPB, leaving the employee without a forum if the MSPB will not resume jurisdiction of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vinieratos v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 939 F.2d 762 (9th Cir. 1991) (vacillation between the EEOC and the MSPB, coupled with other factors, left the employee without a forum to hear his removal appeal); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. DOD</span>, 107 MSPR 317, 319-21 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4, 7-8, 2007 MSPB 279 (2007) (treating as dismissal without prejudice the withdrawal of an appeal to pursue an EEO complaint that the agency then dismissed based on the prior filing of the Board appeal); <span class="Italic">Bankston v. Dept. of Army</span>, 87 MSPR 507, 510-11 &#x00B6; 8 (2001) (unconditional withdrawal of an appeal to pursue an EEO case in court would not be set aside when the court stayed action on the case to permit the appellant to pursue administrative remedies). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Ikossi v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 516 F.3d 1037 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (distinguishing the situation of the appellant who properly elected the MSPB as a mixed-case forum, apparently requested a stay of adjudication of the civil service claims, and proceeded to district court as a mixed case; the court's opinion was not clear on how the district court was to handle the civil service matters on remand); <span class="Italic">Natividad v. DHHS</span>, 63 MSPR 114, 116-17 (1994) (erroneous or confusing agency advice concerning EEO and MSPB review rights: the Board may reinstate a withdrawn appeal when the decision to withdraw is based on misleading or incorrect information about Board jurisdiction and nothing indicates that the employee intended to forfeit the right to challenge the action before the Board).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A withdrawn appeal may be later reinstated if the withdrawal is undertaken without an accurate notice from the employing agency concerning the right to elect various review remedies, e.g., the right to pursue an EEO complaint, that would toll the period for filing a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dawson v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 194, 196-97 (1990) (appellant withdrew a Board appeal to pursue an EEO complaint without being advised of his remedial election rights and then appealed to the Board after receiving an unfavorable EEO decision). Under <span class="Italic">Wilson v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 499, 502-03 (1990), however, if the agency did not violate a notice requirement concerning filing options--for instance, if the agency was not informed of the appellant's belief that he was the victim of discrimination and the agency had no obligation to notify the appellant of the right to file an EEO complaint--the appellant's withdrawal of a Board appeal may not later be rescinded because the appellant does not fare well with arbitration and sought to reactivate his Board case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, the Board will give effect to an appellants withdrawal of an appeal, and absent unusual circumstances such as misinformation or new and material evidence, will not reinstate an appeal once it has been withdrawn because an appellant now wishes to proceed before the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lewis v. United States</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service,</span> 38 MSPR 602, 604 (1988). We recognize that in <span class="Italic">Dawson,</span> the Board found that it had jurisdiction over an appeal filed after the appellant withdrew a previous appeal to the Board concerning the same action. There, the Board deferred to the finding of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) that the appellant's previous appeal to the Board did not constitute an informed election, between his right to file an appeal of the agency's action with the Board and his right to file a formal complaint of discrimination with the agency, because he had not been informed of his right to appeal the agency's action through the agency's formal discrimination complaint process. <span class="Italic">Dawson,</span> at 196-197.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although here the agency also did not inform the appellant of his right to proceed through the formal discrimination complaint process, we find that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Dawson.</span> An agency is required to inform every employee who is the subject of an action which is appealable to the Board, and <span class="Italic">who has raised the issue of discrimination</span> <span class="Italic">either orally or in writing</span> of his right to file a mixed case complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.403. (Emphasis added). In <span class="Italic">Dawson,</span> the agency was on notice, at the outset, that the appellant would raise the issue of discrimination as an affirmative defense. Despite this, however, it failed to inform him of his right to file a mixed case complaint. After the appellant withdrew his Board appeal, the agency sought to foreclose his equal employment opportunity grievance "election" by claiming that he had elected to file with the Board. Noting that under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702, the EEOC has the primary responsibility for the equal employment opportunity process, the Board deferred to EEOC's finding that the appellant did not have an opportunity to make an informed election. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 196-197.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, however, there is nothing in the record to show that the agency had reason to believe that the appellant would raise discrimination as an affirmative defense. In both his first Board appeal and his grievance filings, the appellant did not mention discrimination. Only in his EEOC complaint did he allege discrimination, and that was filed the same day as his Board appeal. In the absence of a determination by EEOC or some other obvious indication that the agency's decision letter violated 29 CFR 1613.403, there is no basis for finding that the appellant's election was not valid.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to relieve an appellant of the withdrawal of her appeal when the agency rejected her EEO complaint, <span class="Italic">Wolfe v. Dept. of Army</span>, 77 MSPR 175, 177-80 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant timely filed an August 15, 1995 appeal of her removal from the position of General Communications Equipment Operator, GS-6, effective July 28, 1995. The appellant, by her designated counsel, alleged disability and sex discrimination, and noted that she had filed a formal complaint of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In its response, the agency stated, in part, that: The appellant had not filed a discrimination complaint of her removal; she had previously filed a discrimination complaint concerning her placement on leave restriction, the suspension of her access to classified information, and her receipt of a previous December 1994 removal proposal notice (which was subsequently withdrawn); and this discrimination complaint was currently being processed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, by her counsel, thereafter withdrew her appeal before the Board, stating that she "will be proceeding with her appeal before the [EEOC]." The administrative judge therefore issued an October 31, 1995 initial decision dismissing the appellant's appeal as withdrawn. Neither party filed a petition for review of the initial decision, which became final on December 5, 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 16, 1997, the Board's regional office received a submission from the appellant dated June 12, 1997, based on the instructions she received that were contained in an April 18, 1997 letter from an agency equal employment opportunity (EEO) officer. The EEO officer's letter stated, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant's allegation that her July 28, 1995 removal was based on sex and disability discrimination was first raised in an appeal to the Board and that no written request to amend her formal discrimination complaint to include the effected removal action was ever received by the agency. The EEO officer therefore dismissed the issue of the removal action from the appellant's discrimination complaint and advised her to bring the allegations of discrimination contained in the rejected complaint of her removal to the attention of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regional office subsequently forwarded the appellant's June 16, 1997 submission to the Board for adjudication. The Clerk of the Board notified the parties that the appellant's filing with the regional office would be considered an untimely petition for review of the October 31, 1995 initial decision that dismissed the appeal as withdrawn, and that she must file a motion that establishes that there is good cause for waiver of the time limit for filing a petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her motion on timeliness, as supported by her declaration, the appellant asserts that she dealt directly with the agency's EEO office on a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> basis, and that her counsel "was involved late in her tenure for purposes of consultation, on a limited and 'as requested' basis." She further states, in relevant part, that: She contacted agency personnel and EEO offices concerning amendment of her prior discrimination complaint to include her July 28, 1995 removal; subsequent to filing her Board appeal, "in connection with the EEO Charge, [she] sought the inclusion of the removal as a continuing discrimination action on the part of the agency"; the EEOC ordered the matter remanded to the agency for clarification of the issues; the appellant and her counsel were advised by the agency that the removal appeal pending before the Board needed to be withdrawn and the discrimination complaint would proceed as amended with the EEOC; and, pursuant to the direction of the agency, she withdrew her removal appeal before the Board. The appellant therefore asserted that she was misled by the agency to withdraw her appeal and believed that the agency would accept an amendment of her discrimination complaint to include the removal action. The agency has filed a response in opposition to the appellant's motion, asserting that certain statements by the appellant are incorrect and unsupported by any corroborating evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's July 21, 1995 removal decision notice informed the appellant that she had the right to appeal that decision to the Board and that, if she believed the action discriminated against her, she could file a complaint with the agency's EEO officer or file a Board appeal. The appellant was expressly informed "[h]owever, you may not file both an appeal and a complaint of discrimination on the same matter. Whichever is filed first is your election to proceed in the forum." As noted above, the <span id="Page_1083"></span>appellant, by her designated counsel, elected to file an appeal with the Board on August 15, 1995. The appellant, by her counsel, then withdrew the appeal by letter dated October 25, 1995, to proceed with an "appeal" before the EEOC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The withdrawal of an appeal is an act of finality that has the effect of removing the appeal from the Board's jurisdiction....&#8197;The Board will give effect to the withdrawal of an appeal, and, absent unusual circumstances such as misinformation or new and material evidence, will not reinstate an appeal once it has been withdrawn because an appellant now wishes to proceed before the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is indisputable that the appellant was aware of her Board appeal rights regarding her removal and of her right to elect to file a discrimination complaint with the agency's EEO office regarding her removal. We are not persuaded, nor is there evidence in the record, that the agency misled the appellant into believing that her allegations of discrimination concerning her removal had been accepted as part of her prior discrimination complaint, or that she was advised by the agency that she must withdraw her Board appeal in order to proceed with her prior discrimination compliant. The appellant has been represented by counsel almost from the outset in both the EEO matter and in her appeal to the Board. We note that the appellant's November 30, 1994 discrimination complaint was investigated by the agency, a copy of the investigative file was sent to the appellant by letter dated July 10, 1995, and the appellant's attorney, by letter of August 1, 1995 (after the appellant's July 28, 1995 removal), requested a hearing on the complaint but did not attempt to raise any issue of discrimination regarding the appellant's removal. Indeed, there is no evidence in the record before the Board that the issue of the appellant's removal was specifically raised in the EEO proceedings, as the appellant now contends. Nor is there any indication that the appellant or her counsel were confused or failed to understand the clear guidance set forth in the removal decision notice that, by first filing a Board appeal of her removal, she gave up her right to elect to first pursue that matter in EEO proceedings. Although the appellant claims that her counsel was "involved late...for purposes of consultation," it is well-established that an appellant is responsible for the actions or inactions of her chosen representative. <span class="Italic">See Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service,</span> 7 MSPB 493, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 18, 1997, the agency dismissed from the appellant's discrimination complaint her allegations that she was removed based on sex and disability discrimination because she had elected to appeal the removal to the Board, and no written request to amend her formal complaint of discrimination to include the removal action was ever received by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the appellant was properly informed by the agency in its removal decision notice, she may not have both an EEO complaint and a Board appeal pending simultaneously on the same action and the first filing shall be considered an election to proceed with the case in that forum. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.302(b); <span class="Italic">Shalwala v. Small Business Administration</span>, 70 MSPR 168, 170-71 (1996). The removal decision notice charged the appellant with making inquiry as to whether she could appeal her removal to the Board and then withdraw that appeal without jeopardy to her election rights. <span class="Italic">See Mendenhall v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 430, 434 n.2 (1997); <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 MSPR 332, 341-42 (1995). Since the appellant received correct notice of her appeal right options, the Board will not waive its timeliness requirements because she consciously elected to proceed in another forum. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 51 MSPR 186, 188 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 967 F.2d 577 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">see also Jones v. Department of Transportation</span>, 69 MSPR 21, 27 (1995) (the discovery of, or the decision to pursue, a new legal argument after the period of filing a petition for review has expired does not constitute good cause for waiving the time limit), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 111 F.3d 144 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant may also withdraw a claim or defense that is a component of an appeal, e.g., an EEO allegation. If the AJ then adjudicates that claim or defense, the Board may vacate the initial decision to the extent it decides the withdrawn issue or claim. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR 212, 216 (1991). An appellant may withdraw a claim for compensatory damages. The withdrawal is an act of finality, and an AJ should not then decide that claim. <span class="Italic">See Boyd v. Dept. of Labor,</span> AT-0752-10-0687-P-1 (NP 9/1/2011) ("[W]e find the appellant clearly and unequivocally withdrew her motion for compensatory damages, and thereby withdrew her compensatory damages appeal. <span class="Italic">See Rosso</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 271, &#x00B6; 9. The administrative judge should have dismissed the appeal as withdrawn with prejudice to re-filing, and erred in deciding the appellant's motion for compensatory damages."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Coppedge v. Dept. of Army</span>, 68 MSPR 690 (1995) (Table) (Board vacated the initial decision after the appellant notified the Board that he wanted to discontinue his appeal).</p>
