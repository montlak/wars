<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-22"><span class="space">a.</span> Concept of Disability</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 8337: (CSRS)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An employee who completes 5 years of civilian service and has become disabled shall be retired on the employee's own application or on application by the employee's agency. Any employee shall be considered to be disabled only if the employee is found by the Office of Personnel Management to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position and is not qualified for reassignment, under procedures prescribed by the Office, to a vacant position which is in the agency at the same grade or level and in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 8451 (FERS):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)(1)(A)&#x2003;An employee who completes at least 18 months of civilian service creditable under section 8411 and has become disabled shall be retired on the employee's own application or on application by the employee's agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;For purposes of this subsection, an employee shall be considered disabled only if the employee is found by the Office to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)(A)&#x2003;Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee shall not be eligible for disability retirement under this section if the employee has declined a reasonable offer of reassignment to a vacant position in the employee's agency for which the employee is qualified if the position--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;is at the same grade (or pay level) as the employee's most recent grade (or pay level) or higher;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;is within the employee's commuting area; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(iii)&#x2003;is one in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Comparing CSRS and FERS disability annuity requirements, <span class="Italic">Royster v. OPM</span>, 68 MSPR 655, 658 (1995), observed that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding this error, however, we note that the relevant regulatory requirements for establishing disability retirement claims under CSRS and FERS are broadly similar. <span class="Italic">See Schwaier v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 49, 54 n. (1994). In an appeal from OPM's denial of a voluntary disability retirement application, an applicant bears the burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)] ; <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 404, 417 (1981). To be eligible for a disability retirement under FERS, an applicant must establish that she has completed 18 months of creditable civilian service, that she is unable to render useful and efficient service in her position because of disease or injury, and that she has not declined a reasonable offer of reassignment to a vacant position for which she is qualified. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451. OPM's implementing regulations additionally require that the disabling medical condition must be expected to continue for at least one year from the date the application is filed, and that accommodation of this condition in the position held must be unreasonable. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103; <span class="Italic">see Mansfield v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 40, 42 (1995)</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The requisites for CSRS disability retirement were noted in <span class="Italic">Humbles v. OPM</span>, 22 MSPR 424, 425, 427 (1984), explaining the concept of inability to perform useful and efficient service in the appellant's position and stating that the disability need not place the employee in a condition of complete helplessness to qualify for an annuity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Currently, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a) there are three basic determinations to make when an application for a voluntary disability retirement annuity is denied. The first is whether the employee suffers from an injury or disease. The second is whether the disease or injury is so disabling that the employee is prevented from performing useful and efficient service in her position. Finally, an analysis must be made to determine if the employee is qualified for reassignment. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Useful and efficient service is measured by performance or job related factors. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1203(c)(1). The definition of disability does not require complete helplessness, <span class="Italic">Meighen v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 7 MSPB 82, 83 (1981), but does require a showing of inability to perform a major or substantial part of one's duties. <span class="Italic">See French v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 7 MSPB 152, 153 (1981). Furthermore, the ultimate determination of disability is based on the probative value of all the evidence. <span class="Italic">Chapman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 10 MSPB 91 (1982). Taken into consideration are: (1) objective clinical findings (2) diagnoses and expert medical opinions (3) subjective evidence of pain and disability together with (4) all evidence relating to the effect of appellant's condition upon his or her ability to perform. <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 MSPB 343, 358 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statute was amended in 1980 to delete the word "totally," <span class="Italic">Brown v. OPM</span>, 22 MSPR 139, 140 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching his conclusion affirming OPM, the presiding official stated that the appellant had not established that he was <span class="Italic">totally</span> disabled for useful and efficient service. The presiding official referred to the standard articulated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6) which was repealed by Pub. L. 96-499, Title IV, &#x00A7; 403(b), December 5, 1980, 94 Stat. 2606. The new definition of disability which is found at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a), as amended, does not contain the word "totally." That definition should be applied to this case, since the appellant's application for disability retirement was filed after the effective date of the amendment. <span class="Italic">See Oglesby v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 19 M.S.P.R. 112 (1984). In applying that standard, we conclude that the appellant has established by preponderant evidence that he was unable to render useful and efficient service in his position. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(a); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the earlier statute, the statutory definition of ability to perform useful and efficient service was quantified, as it related to the appellant's condition, <span class="Italic">Meighen v. OPM</span>, 7 MSPR 164, 165-68 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the definition of "disability" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6) does not contemplate a condition of complete "helplessness" or inability to perform any of the functions of the particular position. Rather, as the statute clearly states, total disability is determined by the employee's ability or inability to perform in a useful and efficient manner. We perceive no sound reason for straining the plain meaning of the statute. <span class="Italic">See Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. Occupational Safety &#x0026; Health Commission,</span> 573 F.2d 157, 161, (3rd Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">United States v. Canadian Vinyl Industries, Inc.,</span> 555 F.2d 806, 811 (C.C.P.A. 1977). Thus, in the instant case, appellant need only show that, because of her medical condition, she was unable to perform her duties usefully and efficiently.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant asserts that she has satisfied the criteria for disability under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6). She states that the nine physicians who reported on her condition were not requested to determine her ability to continue working but that, nevertheless, two of them found her unable to resume her employment. We have held that where a physician has not been requested to evaluate an employee's ability to continue working, his medical report may not be discounted because it contained no such finding. <span class="Italic">Agnes v. United States Postal Service,</span> 4 MSPB 258, 260, 4 MSPR 176, 179 (1980). Thus, in the instant case, the failure of the seven physicians to report on appellant's employment prognosis cannot be used to defeat her disability claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the record contains a statement by appellant's former supervisor indicating that, of 251 working days in 1979, appellant was on leave 144 days. The supervisor also stated that the falls caused by the blackouts could possibly result in injury to appellant and others. She further stated that appellant was charged with supervising 9 to 26 subordinates and that her frequent absences severely disrupted the operation of the unit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant alleges that 95 percent of her absences were due to illness. She concludes that she was therefore able to work only 45 percent of the normal work period. She contends that a 45 percent capacity does not amount to "'substantial continuity' or even, 'reasonable continuity'" and that, consequently, she was totally disabled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find under the circumstances of this case that the ability to perform 45 percent of the normal work period, although such performance may be satisfactory, or even above average, does not constitute the performance of useful and efficient service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6). The fact remains that, in this case, the efficiency of the service was seriously disrupted for more than half the work period. Furthermore, the record shows that appellant's fainting spells were sudden, unpredictable, posed the threat of injury to herself and her co-workers, and interfered substantially with her work. Also, the two physicians (one of whom, Dr. Mills, was referred to appellant by the agency) who commented on her ability to continue working recommended against her doing so. Under these circumstances, we find that the preponderance of the evidence shows that appellant could not perform usefully or efficiently and that she was totally disabled within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6). <span class="Italic">See Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 MSPB 343, 6 MSPR 404 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hite v. OPM</span>, 48 MSPR 27, 30-31 (1991), added as to the inability of an appellant to perform in at least one of her critical elements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In agreeing with OPM's argument that the appellant did not show that she suffers from a medical condition severe enough to warrant total restriction from the workplace, the administrative judge appears to have denied her disability retirement because she was not totally disabled to perform all her duties. This finding however is at odds with the statutory scheme and OPM's guidelines regarding the standard upon which to base a grant of disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(a); <span id="Page_4123"></span>FPM Letters 831-64 and 831-78. The initial decision's characterization of the appellant's back condition as being insufficiently "serious" to justify disability retirement effectively reads into the definition of disability an element of "severity" that is totally absent in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(a). <span class="Italic">See Turner v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 707 F.2d 1499, 1505 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Conversely, Congress's and OPM's definition of disability speaks only in terms of rendering an employee incapable of "useful and efficient service" in the employee's <span class="Italic">specific</span> position and does not in any way measure the disabling nature of a disease or injury by any abstract notion of "seriousness."<span class="Italic">See</span> Omnibus Reconciliation Act, Pub. L. No. 96-499, Title IV &#x00A7; 405, 94 Stat. 2606 (Dec. 5, 1980); 5 C.F.R. 831.502(a). Thus, the court in <span class="Italic">Turner</span> stated, "the effect of this definition is that the statutory definition of disability is itself 'situational' varying with the effects of a disease or injury on different employees' specific positions."<span class="Italic">Turner,</span> 707 F.2d 1499, 1506; <span class="Italic">see also Cerrano v. Fleishman,</span> 339 F.2d 929, 931 (2d Cir. 1964), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 382 U.S. 855 (1965); <span class="Italic">Bridges v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 21 M.S.P.R. 716 (1984). In this case, the standard is even less stringent than that found in <span class="Italic">Turner,</span> which was decided under an earlier version of the present statute, where a finding of "total" disability was required. Under the current standard, it is enough if one's disability detrimentally affects just one of the critical elements of his or her position. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM letters 831-64 and 831-78. Indeed, if the appellant proved, by the preponderance of the evidence, that she was unable to render useful and efficient service in one of her critical elements due to an injury or disease, and the agency was unable, because of her qualifications or disability, to reassign her to another position in the same grade or level, she has established entitlement to disability retirement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McGhee v. OPM</span>, 20 MSPR 372, 374 (1984) ("We have previously made it clear that complete disability for purposes of entitlement to disability annuity does not mean a condition of complete helplessness or inability to perform any of the functions of a particular position.

OPM</span>, 23 MSPR 148, 151 (1984) (CSRS: "Although the record shows that she suffers from a recognized mental illness, depression, there is no evidence connecting this underlying condition with the specific performance failures outlined in Appellant's Exhibit 2. Further, consideration was properly given to testimony from appellant's doctor that improvement in appellant's condition can be expected with continued therapy. Nowhere does her supervisor state in Appellant's Exhibit 2 that she is unable to perform her duties, and he expresses his opinion that, 'you can improve in all of these areas to receive a satisfactory performance rating.' The Board has held that although an employee's performance may suffer, the approval of an application for disability retirement must be based on an individual's inability to perform specific job tasks. Stress, anxiety, depression, and discomfort at work are not sufficient to meet this standard. <span class="Italic">Banks v. OPM,</span> 19 MSPR 414 (1984); <span class="Italic">Goodall v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fenlon v. OPM</span>, SF-844E-12-0398-I-1 (NP 6/27/2013), summarized FERS disability retirement eligibility:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be eligible for a disability retirement annuity under the Federal Employees' Retirement System, an employee must have completed at least 18 months of creditable civilian service, must be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in her position, and must not have declined a reasonable offer of reassignment to a vacant position in the agency at the same or greater grade or pay level in the employee's commuting area in which she is able to render useful and efficient service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a). Two methods exist for demonstrating such eligibility; the employee can establish entitlement by either "showing that her medical condition affected her ability to perform specific work requirements, prevented her from being regular in attendance, or caused her to act inappropriately" or by showing "that her medical condition is inconsistent with working in general, in a particular line of work, or in a particular type of work setting." <span class="Italic">Rucker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 669, &#x00B6; 10 (2012). OPM's implementing regulations further require that the disabling medical condition be expected to continue for at least 1 year from the date the application is filed and that accommodation of the condition in the appellant's position be unreasonable. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a)(3), (4).</p>
