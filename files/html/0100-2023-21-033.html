<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-33"><span class="space">b.</span> Workplace Stressor May Be Insufficient</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If a disability is tied to the workplace environment, but does not occur outside the workplace, and if the appellant does not demonstrate that he is unable to perform the duties, the Board may affirm denial of disability benefits, <span class="Italic">Pitzak v. OPM</span>, 11 MSPR 93, 95-97 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, we find that the presiding official properly evaluated the evidence in finding that appellant's condition was alleviated when he was outside his particular work environment. In his report of March 13, <span id="Page_4130"></span>1980, Dr. Imus stated that if there was no comparable job in another area, he would advise disability retirement based on his diagnosis of appellant as having a reactive type depression. Dr. Southwick similarly diagnosed appellant as suffering from a moderately severed reactive depression caused by the agency's failure to accept his recommendations and stated that his condition had lessened on his being away from his job. Dr. Nillson diagnosed appellant's condition as "Reactive depression. Anxiety reaction." Dr. Baker stated that appellant had a "Function-nonpsychotic disorder" and concluded that he would be disabled as long as he worked in the same work environment. The presiding official properly gave less weight to Dr. Warden's testimony at the hearing that appellant's diagnosis of situational agitated depression was a major psychiatric disorder which made him "unable to perform in any other position." Although Dr. Warden testified that his qualifications established "his ability to understand the relationship of industrial problems with the problems of psychiatric and physical illness," his qualifications reveal no specifications in psychiatry such as that of Dr. Imus who was identified as such a specialist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bagian v. OPM,</span> 9 MSPB 168, 169 (1982), where the appellant applied for disability retirement based on his allergic reaction to certain environmental factors, we held the poor air environment was not a natural and necessary condition of his employment since the air quality in the work place was amenable to improvement. There, we further stated that since appellant has not shown that poor air quality operated as a permanent condition of his employment, he had not established, by a preponderance of the evidence, his inability to perform useful and efficient service in the grade or class of position under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6). Here, appellant's condition, which was caused by the degrading work environment and his frustration when his recommendations were rejected, was similarly alleviated when appellant was outside that environment. This conclusion that his depression is caused by this treatment is further supported by appellant's own statement, in describing his condition, that he has not had these symptoms of depression since he "left" his position except on two occasions related to his application for disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, as the presiding official found, appellant did not allege that he was unable to perform any of the specific duties contained in his position description. The Superior Officer's Statement stated that appellant was not performing "any of his assigned duties or responsibilities at the level he previously performed at," but did not state that he was unable to perform his duties. At the hearing appellant did not testify that he could not perform his duties, or explain how his performance was affected, except that he went on leave without pay status when his sick leave ended. That he was on leave is, however, not conclusive in light of the other evidence. Furthermore, the fact that appellant's performance at work has suffered as a result of his condition does not constitute a basis for a finding of disability where he nevertheless can perform his duties. <span class="Italic">See Anderson-Winans v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 7 MSPB 13 (1981). Therefore, we find that appellant has not established that he is totally disabled for useful and efficient service in his position by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Compare Sullivan v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 MSPB 636 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Situational stress was insufficient to qualify for disability retirement in <span class="Italic">Boss v. OPM</span>, 23 MSPR 234, 237 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The medical evidence does not explain exactly how appellant's condition renders him disabled, that is, how the cluster headaches affect his ability to maintain satisfactory attendance at work. The medical reports do not describe whether it is the pain alone which is disabling, whether the pain can be controlled to the extent appellant can continue working, or whether appellant may be disabled by pain on some occasions but able to work on others. <span class="Italic">See D'Agostino v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 10 MSPB 481, 482, 11 M.S.P.R. 559, 561(1982); <span class="Italic">Wagoner v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 7 MSPB 174, 175, 7 M.S.P.R. 277, 279 (1981). Moreover, the medical evidence shows that appellant was only disabled for work in the Portland office. Although in February 1983 Dr. Pennington found appellant disabled for work in that office because the headaches would likely recur if appellant went back to work there, he did not believe appellant was disabled from seeking employment elsewhere....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant also testified that he experienced work-related stress as a result of frequent criticism and personality conflicts with rotating personnel in the office. In <span class="Italic">Burton v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 7 MSPB 542, 8 M.S.P.R. 46 (1981), the Board found that an individual who was depressed because of the work situation, and not the duties, was not eligible for disability retirement. In addition, stress, anxiety, depression and discomfort at work are not sufficient to show that an individual is unable to perform the specific duties of a position. <span class="Italic">See Goodall v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 13 M.S.P.R. 216 (1983); <span class="Italic">Hill v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 9 MSPB 824, 10 M.S.P.R. 622 (1982). Appellant's testimony that the headaches interfered with his typing and other job duties is not corroborated by his superior officer's statement. Although the evidence shows appellant suffers from headaches as a result of work-related stress, there is insufficient evidence appellant was unable to perform in a useful and efficient manner as a result of the headaches.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cited in <span class="Italic">Boss, supra,</span> was <span class="Italic">Burton v. OPM</span>, 8 MSPR 46, 48, 7 MSPB 542 (1981), denying the appellant's disability annuity application:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's medical evidence was to the effect that due to his depression and paranoid tendencies he lacked interest in his job and had the potential to become argumentative or violent on the job. He is resentful towards minorities and women because he feels that he will not get a promotion due to agency efforts to increase the percentage of women and minorities in higher grades. The medical opinions, however, are outweighed by the fact that the appellant's performance was considered satisfactory by the agency notwithstanding his absences from August to December 1979. Thus, while the record confirms the diagnosis of depressive neurosis and the aggravation to his paranoia presented by the situational element at his work site, a deficiency in service related to his medical condition has not been demonstrated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Goodall v. OPM</span>, 14 MSPR 588, 589-90, 13 MSPB 216 (1983), cited by <span class="Italic">Boss,</span> denied an annuity application based on symptoms that seemed to be linked to distress over appellant's working situation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Appellant, a Photographic Reproduction Equipment Operation Foreman, alleges as the basis for his disability retirement the following <span id="Page_4131"></span>conditions: chest pains, inability to swallow, and periodic episodes of vomiting during the night.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official found that the evidence of record showed that appellant's condition was diagnosed as reflex esophagitis (hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter). The presiding official noted evidence which showed that appellant's tendency to vomit at night increased when he was scheduled to work the next day, and that this in turn had caused appellant to use his sick leave accumulated during his 26 years of federal service and to suffer reduced efficiency at work. The presiding official nonetheless found that neither appellant nor his supervisor had identified any specific duties which appellant was unable to perform as a result of his medical condition. He concluded that pursuant to the Board order in <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 6 MSPR 404 (1981), appellant had not met his burden of persuasion by a preponderance of evidence that he meets the "total disability" standard set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Moreover, we also concur with that official's determination that although appellant experiences anxiety and work-related stress, the evidence of record does not establish a specific mental disease or illness. The Board has held that although an employee's performance may suffer, the approval of an application for disability retirement is based on an individual's being unable to perform specific duties of a position. Stress, anxiety, depression and consequent discomfort at work are not sufficient to meet this standard. <span class="Italic">Hill v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 10 MSPR 622 (1982). <span class="Italic">Also see Piccone v. United States,</span> 407 F.2d 866, 872 (1969), holding that a person may be too disabled to work, but not disabled enough to qualify for disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hill v. OPM</span>, 10 MSPR 622, 625 (1982), also noted in <span class="Italic">Boss,</span> determined that evidence of depression was insufficient to establish entitlement to disability retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our view, appellant has not met this burden of proof. The record is almost totally devoid of evidence as to whether appellant's condition is permanent or untreatable by medication. As set forth above, the most recent medical evidence of record seemed to indicate that appellant was somewhat improved. It is impossible to discern from the record whether such progress is expected to continue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, appellant's brief time at work after what she stated was the most severe onset of symptoms (December, 1979-March, 1980) makes it impossible to determine the extent to which her performance was actually effected by her condition. The Board has made clear that although an employee's performance may suffer, the approval of an application for disability retirement is based on an individual's being unable to perform the duties of a position. Discomfort at work is not sufficient. <span class="Italic">See, Miller v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 7 MSPB 621 (1981), and <span class="Italic">Anderson-Winons v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 7 MSPB 621 (1981). Thus, although appellant has shown that she suffered emotional flare-ups and her supervisor has stated that she could not cope with the daily routine, there is no evidence in the record of duties which she could not perform on a sustained basis. It is also unclear from the record what elements with respect to appellant's work or her work environment may contribute to her anxiety. In <span class="Italic">Burton v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 7 MSPR 542 (1981), the Board found that an individual who was depressed because of the work situation and not the duties was not eligible for disability retirement. In the instant case it is not clear whether the nature of appellant's work as a grade 4 Statistical Clerk, the people at her work place, or the physical environment was the source of her discomfort. <span id="Page_4132"></span>While the record does indicate that appellant had an aversion to her work and was afraid of pressure, nothing in the record connects these vague assertions with specific performance failures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An annuity was denied in <span class="Italic">Anderson v. OPM,</span> 96 MSPR 299, 306-07 &#x00B6; 20-22 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the appellant's claims of stress resulting in depression and anxiety, the Board has recognized that job stress, as manifested in mood disorders such as depression and in the various anxiety disorders, can be disabling depending on the severity of the symptoms and the nature of an appellant's job duties. <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 23. However, the mere diagnosis of depression or an anxiety disorder is not informative enough to allow either OPM or the Board to conclude, based on the diagnosis alone, that an employee is disabled from useful and efficient service. <span class="Italic">See Wilkey-Marzin v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6; 10 (1999) (the mere existence of diagnosed Major Depressive Disorder and PTSD is not, by itself, dispositive evidence of the appellant's inability to perform the duties of her position). Rather, the medical evidence must show that the employee's symptoms are so severe as to prevent her from performing the specific duties of the job in question. <span class="Italic">Tan-Gatue,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 116, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">see also Wilkey-Marzin,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 200, &#x00B6; 16 (job-related stress resulting in physical and mental ailments that prevent an employee from performing the duties required in his position can warrant the granting of disability retirement); <span class="Italic">Marczewski v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 343, 347 (1998) ("the record shows that it was not stress or anxiety alone that rendered the appellant incapacitated for purposes of work, but rather, that the work-related stress and anxiety that he suffered caused his mental condition which was, itself, incapacitating"). Here, there is simply no evidence to explain why the appellant's depression and anxiety render her unable to perform her duties. Because depression and anxiety, although often serious, are not conditions which are obviously incapacitating in connection with the appellant's job, application of the <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> line of cases is not appropriate under the circumstances of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the record in this case indicates that the appellant's performance and attendance were fully satisfactory prior to the incident which led to her removal. In short, there is no corroboration from the appellant's former employing agency that her performance was impaired. <span class="Italic">See Johnson,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 18; <span class="Italic">see also Burckley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 617, &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (evidence from the appellant's supervisor and a co-worker that the appellant was able to perform his assigned job tasks supported a conclusion that he was able to successfully perform the duties of his accommodated position until his removal for misconduct), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds by Sangenito v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 211 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the appellant's depression and anxiety caused her misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1203(a)(2); <span class="Italic">Powitz v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10 (1999). Ms. Feronti-Dickinson's statement falls short of actually opining a causal link between the appellant's psychological condition and the misconduct, and the AJ did not find a causal connection between the appellant's condition and her misconduct, <span class="Italic">see Johnson,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 19. Further, the Board has considered an appellant's failure to apply for disability retirement until after a removal action as a factor discounting the force of that application. <span class="Italic">Tan-Gatue,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 116, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Burckley,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 617, &#x00B6; 8 (the probative weight of the appellant's subjective evidence of pain and discomfort was diminished by the fact that he did not seek disability retirement until after he received a notice of proposed removal for falsification).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Tebay v. OPM</span>, 24 MSPR 92, 95 (1984) ("Moreover, the subordinates' statements are concerned almost entirely with descriptions of asserted adverse working conditions and pressures under which appellant worked and which the subordinates attributed to conflict between appellant and her supervisors. The affidavits describe appellant's physical problems, which the subordinates only generally attest to, and the adverse work environment, and note appellant desired reassignment before ultimately being forced to leave her position. However, any possible future aggravation of appellant's condition does not justify finding disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Phenious v.
