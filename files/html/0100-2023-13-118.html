<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-117"><span class="space">4.</span> Nexus</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Martin v. Customs Serv.</span>, 12 MSPR 12, 10 MSPB 568 (1982), <span class="Italic">supra,</span> determined that an indefinite suspension must be supported by a nexus between the crime charged and agency employment, e.g., an assault on a coworker; and there must be a demonstration that no lesser penalty would be effective. In practice there is little attention by the Board to approaches other than an indefinite suspension. Most of the discussion is reserved for nexus. However, relying on <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, <span class="Italic">Novak v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 12 MSPR 455, 458 (1982), affirmed the absence of an effective alternative to indefinite suspension of an employee whose position involved some public contact and who was charged with assaulting another employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we find that the fourth and last requirement in our <span class="Italic">Martin</span> formulation, namely, that the agency must show that a lesser penalty than indefinite suspension would have been insufficient, has been met. Anything less than a temporary suspension of appellant from a position in which he dealt with the public would not have been sufficient to meet the agency's reasonable desire to remove the risk of a physical attack by appellant against another individual.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The issue of alternative actions is relevant in an appeal from an indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">Ikramullah v. GSA</span>, 34 MSPR 425, 427 (1987). The Board defers to the agency's evaluation of whether the indefinite suspension is a reasonable course of action under the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> standards. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jarvis v. DOJ</span>, 32 MSPR 380 (1987). Although <span class="Italic">Martin v. Customs Serv.</span>, 12 MSPR 12, 10 MSPB 568 (1982), suggested that an indefinite suspension may be inappropriate if alternate means involving a less severe action against the employee exist to protect the agency's interests, it was not until <span class="Italic">Vega v. DOJ</span>, 37 MSPR 115, 117 (1988), that the Board reviewed the propriety of an indefinite suspension for less severe actions. In <span class="Italic">Vega</span>, the indefinite suspension was imposed after the appellant was criminally charged with violating a federal statute when the appellant gave a sandwich to an inmate. Over the dissent of the Board's Chairman, the Board concluded that despite a showing of nexus, the filing of criminal charges was insufficient to justify the agency's failure to consider an action less severe than indefinite suspension. The agency should have considered the nature of the charges and whether a lesser action would have been ineffective. The Board rejected the agency's argument that it was intolerable to have a correctional officer, criminally charged, working in a facility with inmates, criminally convicted. <span class="Italic">Vega</span> concluded that the indefinite suspension was inappropriate for an appellant with four years of service who was involved in an isolated, <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> incident:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An indefinite suspension is proper it is based on a finding that there is reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed and if it has an ascertainable end in sight. <span class="Italic">Martin,</span> 10 MSPB 568, 12 M.S.P.R. at 17-19. In addition, the agency must show that there is a nexus between the charge and the employee's position and that the imposition of an indefinite suspension was reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> 10 MSPB 568, 12 M.S.P.R. at 19. There may be an alternative means of protecting the agency's interests, and the action may not stand if a less severe action would safeguard its interests. <span class="Italic">Brown,</span> 715 F.2d at 668 n.3; <span class="Italic">Martin,</span> 10 MSPB 568, 12 M.S.P.R. at 19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The imposition of an indefinite suspension is not a form of punishment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> 10 MSPB 568, 12 M.S.P.R. at 17-20; <span class="Italic">see also Littlejohn v. United States Postal Service,</span> 25 M.S.P.R. 478, 481 (1984), It is based not on provable misconduct but on the examination into that misconduct. <span class="Italic">Martin,</span> 10 MSPB 568, 12 M.S.P.R. at 17-19. The administrative judges consideration of the appellant's explanations for the misconduct is inappropriate, as that was not pertinent to the indefinite suspension action. <span class="Italic">See Torres v. U.S. Customs Service,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 315, 318 n.3 (1986). Rather the inquiry concerning the existence of less severe actions centers on whether any such actions would be ineffective based on the charge in the information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we find that there is a nexus between the appellants charged alleged criminal on-duty misconduct and his position as a correctional officer, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency did not prove that a lesser action would be ineffective under the circumstances of this case.</p>

DOJ</span>, DE-0752-13-0228-I-2 (NP 2/6/2015), considered reasonable a deciding official's decision to indefinitely suspend an employee who worked in a correctional facility was who was indicted by a federal grand jury "for obstruction of justice under 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1519 for knowingly making a false record entry regarding the use of force during an incident that occurred while he was on duty":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will review an agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 306 (1981). Relevant factors include the nature and seriousness of the offense, the employee's past disciplinary record, the supervisor's confidence in the employee's ability to perform his assigned duties, the consistency of the penalty with the agency's table of penalties, the consistency of the penalty with those imposed on other employees for the same or similar offenses, and the adequacy of alternative sanctions. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 5 (2010); <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06. Not all of the factors will be pertinent in every instance, and so the relevant factors must be balanced in each case to arrive at the appropriate penalty. <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 306. The Board will modify a penalty only when it finds that the agency failed to weigh the relevant factors or that it clearly exceeded the bounds of reasonableness in determining the penalty. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 306</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that the indefinite suspension was reasonable because the deciding official "affirmatively refused" to consider any of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and relied exclusively on the agency "practice" of "summarily suspending all employees[ ] who are indicted." Although the term "<span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors" does not appear in the decision letter, it is clear that the deciding official considered several relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, including the nature and seriousness of the offense and its relation to the appellant's duties. In the decision letter, the deciding official explained that, as a federal law enforcement officer, the allegations set forth in the indictment undermined the appellant's responsibilities as a correctional worker, which included supervising and caring for the inmates, enforcing rules and regulations, and serving as a role model to all of the staff. He noted that the appellant was expected to obey the letter and spirit of the law and to avoid any action that could adversely affect the public's confidence in the integrity of the federal government. Given the nature of the allegations and the appellant's responsibilities and duties, the deciding official concluded that the allegations contained in the indictment were serious. Although the deciding official considered the appellant's acceptable performance as a mitigating factor, he found that it did not outweigh the seriousness of the indictment. Based on the allegations in the indictment, the deciding official concluded that the agency could not risk the appellant's continued presence in the workplace and that he could not be entrusted with the care and custody of inmates unless he was cleared of the charges. At the hearing, the deciding official testified that the prison did not have any non-law enforcement positions or positions without any inmate contact that the appellant could have been placed in rather than being indefinitely suspended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the above, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency responsibly exercised its managerial judgment and that an indefinite suspension was not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nexus for an indefinite suspension must be demonstrated or apparent, but no established set of factors governs the analysis. Nexus supporting an indefinite suspension imposed for arrest and indictment is demonstrated by publicity surrounding the charge that tends to erode public confidence in the agency if the petitioner continues in his duties. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brogdon v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-2425) (letter carrier was suspended after an indictment for unauthorized possession of food stamps); <span class="Italic">Smith v. GPO</span>, 60 MSPR 450, 454 (1994) (publicity attendant to the charges supported nexus; aside from publicity, "the egregiousness of the charged conduct [drug distribution] raises a rebuttable presumption of nexus which the appellant has not rebutted"); <span class="Italic">Cox v. DHHS</span>, 21 MSPR 336 (1984) (newspaper article, coupled with the testimony of managers who lost trust and confidence in the appellant); <span class="Italic">Hobbs v. DHHS</span>, 12 MSPR 679, 681 (1982) (indictment based upon a drug offense: "The Board finds that internal disruption of agency functions, as well as adverse publicity tending to damage the agency's image is sufficient to establish nexus in this case.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency need not prove that the appellant's conduct caused actual <span id="Page_2140"></span>harm or interfered with the agency's mission. If there is an apparent conflict between the agency mission and the conduct of the appellant resulting in an indictment, the agency need not wait for the damage of the appellant's conduct to take effect before acting to protect the public's confidence and trust in the integrity of the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. IRS</span>, 12 MSPR 615, 616-17 (1982) (indictment for a violation of state gambling laws). The Board said of an indefinite suspension of a Postal Service tour supervisor for alleged receipt of stolen merchandise, <span class="Italic">Hall v. USPS</span>, 13 MSPR 69, 71 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for nexus, the record on appeal shows that, as a tour supervisor, appellant had responsibility for distributing and dispatching mail to Government agencies, and for supervising over 100 employees, including two other supervisors on his tour. By the nature of his position, appellant had to have the trust of both his subordinates and his superiors. The criminal charge against him cast doubt on his trustworthiness. We therefore find a clear linkage between the alleged misconduct of appellant in receiving stolen property and his employment supervising employees who distribute and dispatch mail, thus meeting the second criterion....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the third requirement, <span class="Italic">viz.</span>, the reasonableness of the penalty, has also been met. As a management official in a position of trust and responsibility, appellant was obligated to conduct himself in a manner so as not to discredit the agency. Appellant's first-line supervisor testified that employees on the tour questioned him about appellant's predicament, that retention of appellant as a management official would have been detrimental to the interests of the agency, and that employees would lose respect for supervisors if something were not done. The Board agrees that anything less than a temporary suspension of appellant would not resolve these adverse effects.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nexus is shown by the testimony of agency employees who express reluctance to work with an appellant while criminal charges are pending. Nexus may be presumed if the misconduct is egregious or if there is internal disruption of agency functions, as might occur if the position occupied by the appellant involves public contact. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 548, 550 (1986) (letter carrier was indicted for rape) (citing <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 727 F.2d 1535 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">Nexus supported the indefinite suspension of a mine inspector involved in an off-duty shooting. His was a sensitive position requiring trust. Appellant's supervisors testified in a conclusory manner to their lack of confidence in appellant. There was "also evidence of at least some degree of adverse publicity surrounding the incident." <span class="Italic">Honeycutt v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 22 MSPR 491, 494-95 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Honeycutt v. Dept. of Labor</span> (Fed.

OPM</span>, 22 MSPR 457, 460-61 (1984) (nexus was established for an off-duty shooting and the apprehension of some people over the appellant's return to work; discounting a psychiatric report favoring the appellant that did not explain the type of examination performed or factors considered in rendering the opinion). Nexus to support an indefinite suspension was based on findings that the appellant used government property and time to carry out his allegedly illegal acts. That conduct, in turn, supported a finding that the agency lost trust and confidence in the appellant's ability to perform the duties of his position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pararas-Carayannis v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 9 F.3d 955, 958 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Reed v. Dept. of Army</span>, 292 Fed. Appx. 60, 61-62 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP), set aside an indefinite suspension resulting from an indictment for alleged off-duty misconduct when the evidence of nexus comprised no more than speculative assertions by supervisors of possible harm to the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The pertinent facts are not in dispute. During the relevant period of time, Mr. Reed was employed as an Information Technology manager at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. On July 28, 2005, he was indicted in state court in New York on two counts of criminal conduct. On May 16, 2006, after learning of the indictment, Raymond Russomano, the Director of the Directorate for Information Management at Fort Monmouth, informed Mr. Reed that he was proposing his indefinite suspension pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings. Ten days later, George Fitzmaier, Deputy to the Garrison Commander, informed Mr. Reed that he was indefinitely suspended.<span class="Italic"></span> On January 18, 2007, however, the indictment against Mr. Reed was dismissed. As a result, the agency terminated the indefinite suspension and restored Mr. Reed to his position. He remains employed at Fort Monmouth.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Reed appealed his suspension to the Board. Following a hearing, the administrative judge ("AJ") to whom the appeal was assigned issued an initial decision in which he sustained the agency's action. The AJ determined that the agency had established by a preponderance of the evidence that the requirements for an indefinite suspension, <span class="Italic">see Morrison v. Nat'l Sci. Found.</span>, 423 F.3d 1366, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 956 F.2d 1151, 1155 (Fed. Cir. 1992), had been met. The AJ found that the agency had had reasonable cause to believe that Mr. Reed had committed a crime for which a term of imprisonment could be imposed; that the suspension had an ascertainable end; that there was a nexus between the criminal charges against Mr. Reed and the efficiency of the service; and that the suspension was reasonable. <span class="Italic">See generally id.</span> The <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span> became the final decision of the Board when the Board denied Mr. Reed's petition for review for failure to meet the criteria for review set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Reed's sole argument on appeal is that the Board's finding that there was a nexus between the charges against him and the efficiency of the service is not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, Mr. Reed contends that the agency failed to establish a "demonstrable connection" between his job duties and the off-duty offense with which he was charged. The agency responds that substantial evidence does support the Board's nexus finding. In making this argument, it relies upon the testimony of Mr. Fitzmaier and Robert Zona, Mr. Reed's immediate supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Mr. Reed that the Board's finding of a nexus between the charges against him and the efficiency of the service is not supported by substantial evidence. Having reviewed the pertinent evidence--the testimony of Mr. Reed, Mr. Fitzmaier, and Mr. Zona--we are left with the conclusion that, when the agency decided to suspend Mr. Reed, it relied overwhelmingly on speculation in determining that he posed a danger to the Fort Monmouth community and that his presence at Fort Monmouth while charges were pending against him would be disruptive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reason, the final decision of the Board sustaining Mr. Reed's indefinite suspension is reversed. The case is remanded to the Board for a determination of the relief to which Mr. Reed is entitled as a result of the agency's improper action in suspending him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Reed</span> may be compared with <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572 n.5 (Fed. Cir. 1990), sustaining an indefinite suspension based on evidence that the employee, charged with an off-duty sexual offense involving a family member who was a minor, was arrested at the Naval base, there was some publicity in a newspaper, the employee worked in areas of the Naval base where children lived, and where there was evidence from a couple coworkers expressing their concerns about working with the employee after the arrest:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Administrative Judge presented the most complete description of these two affidavits in the record:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In her affidavit, Kathleen T. Quinn noted that she is a supply clerk...[who] comes into contact with [Engdahl] probably a couple of times a week. Quinn first learned of [Engdahl's] arrest when she was shown a newspaper article reporting the incident by a co-worker. She is aware that some of the charges were dropped at [Engdahl's preliminary] hearing, but would feel uncomfortable and extremely uneasy if she would come in contact with [Engdahl]. She characterized her feelings as being disgust and revulsion, and would not want to work around him anymore.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In her affidavit, Carmen I. Castro stated that she is a clerk-typist...and first became aware of [Engdahl's] arrest when she was shown a newspaper article...by Ms. Quinn. She works in the office with Quinn, and regularly sees [Engdahl] at least twice a week in the office, and almost every day on the agency premises outside of the office. She is aware that certain of the charges against [Engdahl] were dropped, but still feels strongly that she would be very uncomfortable if she ever came in contact with him again. Castro is fearful of her well being in that she might sometimes be alone in the office when [Engdahl] would be about the agency premises.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nexus between an indictment for off-duty conduct, involving an alleged firearms violation, and job duties was established by a bar order preventing the appellant from entering the worksite (apparently by reason of the arrest preceding the indictment), in <span class="Italic">McCulloch v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-15-0353-I-1 (NP 9/25/2015).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Harding v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 284, 293-94 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-22, 2010 MSPB 241 (2010), expressions by supervisors of lack of trust in the appellant, a housekeeping aid, were sufficient to establish the nexus required for his indefinite suspension following an indictment described in the Board's opinion as based on two felony drug charges and two misdemeanors, and a special indictment as a habitual felon based upon prior criminal history:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To show that an indefinite suspension promotes the efficiency of the service, the agency must establish a nexus between an employee's alleged misconduct and the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, 956 <span id="Page_2141"></span>F.2d at 1155, 1158. In <span class="Italic">Kruger v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 71, 74 (1987), the Board held that an agency may show a nexus between off-duty misconduct and the efficiency of the service by three means: (1) a rebuttable presumption in certain egregious circumstances; (2) preponderant evidence that the misconduct adversely affects the appellant's or coworkers' job performance or the agency's trust and confidence in the appellant's job performance; or (3) preponderant evidence that the misconduct interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Brown v. Department of the Navy</span>, 229 F.3d 1356, 1360-61 (Fed. Cir. 2000). In the present case, we find that the agency proved a nexus between the appellant's alleged misconduct and the efficiency of the service under the second category. Specifically, the deciding official indicated in his declaration that the misconduct with which the appellant was criminally charged had a negative impact on the efficiency of the operations at the appellant's workplace and "led to his supervisors losing confidence in [the appellant's] ability to carry out the performance of his duties." The deciding official also expressed his concern that the light duty position to which the appellant was assigned at the time of his suspension gave him access to veterans' personal information. <span class="Italic">See Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1158 (upholding the Board's finding of nexus where, given the nature of the pending criminal charges, the appellant had lost the confidence of his supervisors and could not be trusted as a law enforcement officer); <span class="Italic">see also Adams v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 551, 555-56 (1994) (the agency established a nexus between an employee's off-duty possession of marijuana and his removal for the efficiency of the service by the deciding official's unrebutted testimony that the agency had lost confidence in the appellant's job performance).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Board has at times stated the nexus requirement in this type of case somewhat differently, indicating that a nexus must exist between the criminal charge itself and the efficiency of the service, rather than between the appellant's alleged misconduct underlying the criminal charge and the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Albo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 166, &#x00B6; 6 (2006). We need not resolve any disparity in the applicable standard in the present case, however, because we find that the agency established nexus under either characterization of the standard. Specifically, the deciding official indicated that he had lost confidence in the appellant's ability to perform his duties due to the misconduct with which the appellant was criminally charged and that the appellant's indictment under the habitual felon statute itself was an important factor in his decision. We find that such unrebutted testimony establishes a nexus between the existence of the criminal charges and the efficiency of the service under the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to support an indefinite suspension (or any other adverse action under chapter 75), the agency must establish that the penalty is reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1154; <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. at 19-20. The appellant has not raised any particular argument that his suspension was unreasonable under the circumstances, other than his general claim that he should be presumed innocent until convicted. The Board and its reviewing court have found that an agency may reasonably decide to suspend an employee based on pending criminal charges even though there has been no conviction. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1156-58; <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. at 19-22. Considering the serious nature of the charges against the appellant, the agency's evidence that the appellant's supervisor lost confidence in his ability to carry out the performance of his duties, and the undisputed evidence suggesting that the agency could not finalize its investigation until the criminal proceedings concluded, we find that the agency reasonably decided to impose an indefinite suspension pending resolution of the criminal proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Pararas-Carayannis</span>, 9 F.3d at 956, 958 (sustaining the employee's indefinite suspension "pending the disposition of felony charges against him").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Beauford v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-14-0104-I-1 (NP 9/24/2014), involving an indefinite suspension based on an indictment, said of the nexus established by management's lack of confidence in the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency may show a nexus between off-duty misconduct and the efficiency of the service by three means: (1) a rebuttable presumption in certain egregious circumstances; (2) preponderant evidence that the misconduct adversely affects the appellant's or coworkers' job performance or the agency's trust and confidence in the appellant's job performance; or (3) preponderant evidence that the misconduct interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Kruger v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 71, 74 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his letter of decision, the deciding official noted that the appellant is held to a high standard of conduct as a manager, and indicated that he had lost confidence in her ability to serve as a facility head or manager. He also noted the seriousness of the criminal charges brought against the appellant and determined that those charges would bring about unnecessary disruption to the agency from coworkers and customers. Additionally, the deciding official stated that the criminal charges were suspected or became known to some of the appellant's subordinates and reflected negatively on the agency. He also found that the appellant would cause "unnecessary disruption" in the day-to-day operations of the agency; the deciding official therefore determined that the appellant should be suspended pending the disposition of the criminal charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A deciding official's declaration that he lost confidence and trust in an employee may satisfy the nexus requirement. <span class="Italic">See Ellis v. Department of Defense</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 407, &#x00B6; 9 (2010) (finding that nexus had been established based upon the declaration of the deciding official). Additionally, an unsworn document such as a proposal notice or decision, as opposed to a declaration, may serve as valid proof where it is "not merely conclusory," sets forth the misconduct in great detail, and is supported by other evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Delancy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6; 8 (2001). We find that the deciding official's statements regarding nexus are supported by other evidence. For instance, the deciding official stated that the appellant's subordinates suspected or became aware of the criminal charges. This assertion is supported by the report of investigation, which indicated that the appellant was arrested on-site at the agency. It is therefore possible that the subordinates could have witnessed the appellant's arrest. The seriousness of the charged crimes, mentioned by the deciding official in his decision, is also detailed in the grand jury indictment. We therefore find the record as a whole supports a finding that the agency established nexus by the preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Ellis</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 407, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
