<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-78"><span class="space">1.</span> Mixed Case</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Two decisions issued in 1993 by the D.C. Circuit define the judicial review route for EEO claims taken to arbitration that are destined for district court review. The D.C. Circuit decided that in mixed cases the plaintiff must first seek the MSPB's review before going to district court. If cases going to arbitration would not be within MSPB's purview, a party must take the arbitration award to the EEOC before proceeding to district court. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-24-076.html#sec17-72">Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies</a>," for discussion involving the process of obtaining judicial review of EEO components in MSPB decisions."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to mixed cases, an arbitrator's award becomes judicially reviewable in district court through MSPB review of the award, according to <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2052 v. Reno</span>, 992 F.2d 331, 332-35 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (not discussing the possibility and effect of EEOC review of an arbitration award). <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2052</span>, navigated the currents of mixed cases and arrived at its conclusion through complex statutory analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Acting pursuant to the negotiated grievance procedure provided by the collective bargaining agreement between the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE or Union) and the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), an arbitrator upheld a grievance brought by the AFGE on behalf of one of its members against the BOP. Subsequently, the arbitrator denied the AFGE's application for attorneys' fees. The AFGE sought judicial review of the denial but the district court dismissed its complaint, concluding that the AFGE was first required to seek review by either the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The AFGE appeals and we affirm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1987, the BOP terminated Stephen Michniak, a case manager, for allegedly unacceptable performance. Michniak filed a grievance with his union, the AFGE, claiming reverse discrimination, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC 2302(b)(1), and sought reinstatement under the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA). 5 USC 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> Because Michniak's case involved both a discrimination claim and a job action complaint, Michniak's complaint fell into the "mixed case" category under the CSRA, that is, his complaint challenged both the job action (termination) and the illegally discriminatory reason for the job action (reverse discrimination).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For a mixed case, the CSRA establishes a special procedure. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7702(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Romain v. Shear</span>, 799 F.2d 1416, 1419 (9th Cir. 1986) (employee's complaint constituted mixed case because it involved "an adverse action normally appealable to the MSPB and an allegation that a basis for the action was discrimination"). The procedure requires the aggrieved employee to make an initial binding choice. He may seek relief either under a statutory procedure or under the negotiated grievance procedure but not under both. 5 USC 7121(d); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Kaldor</span>, 869 F.2d 999, 1005 (6th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Vinieratos v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 939 F.2d 762, 768 (9th Cir. 1991) (noting irrevocability of choice).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the <span class="Italic">statutory</span> procedure, the employee may first raise the complaint with his employing agency which has 120 days to reach a decision. 5 USC 7702(a)(2). If the agency decides against the employee, the employee may either appeal to the MSPB or seek direct judicial review. 5 USC 7702(a). If the employee appeals to the MSPB, it must reach a decision within 120 days, at the end of which period the employee may either proceed directly to court or seek further administrative review. 5 USC 7702(a)(3). An employee who wishes to follow the administrative route may appeal the MSPB's decision to the EEOC which, under the statute, has 30 days to decide whether to hear the case. 5 USC 7702(b)(1). If the EEOC rejects the case or if it accepts the case and agrees with the MSPB's decision, the employee may then proceed to court. 5 USC 7702(b)(5)(A). If the EEOC accepts the case but disagrees with the MSPB, however, it must remand the case to the MSPB for further consideration. 5 USC 7702(b)(3)(B), (b)(5)<span id="Page_5286"></span>(B). Upon reconsidering the case, the MSPB issues an opinion that either agrees with the EEOC or rejects the EEOC's findings. If the MSPB agrees with the EEOC, the employee may seek judicial review. 5 USC 7702(c). If the MSPB rejects the EEOC's findings, however, the statute calls for the creation of a special panel to make a final decision. 5 USC 7702(d)(1). The special panel's final decision is then subject to judicial review. 5 USC 7702(d)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">negotiated grievance</span> procedure is usually much simpler. Here, the collective bargaining agreement between the AFGE and the BOP provides for binding arbitration of claims involving both job actions and discrimination. Not surprisingly, Michniak, represented by the Union, chose to avoid the statutory procedure by pursuing his claims through the negotiated grievance procedure. Pursuant to the agreement, the AFGE submitted Michniak's claims to arbitration. After a hearing, the arbitrator concluded that Michniak had been the victim of reverse discrimination and ordered him reinstated with back pay. He denied, however, the Union's request for attorneys' fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AFGE then sought judicial review in the district court. The district court dismissed the complaint, holding that the Union had not exhausted its administrative remedies in not first seeking either MSPB or EEOC review of the arbitrator's decision as required by section 7702 of the CSRA. The AFGE appeals the dismissal, asserting that the statute <span class="Italic">allows</span>, but does not <span class="Italic">require</span>, an employee with a mixed case to proceed before the MSPB or the EEOC before seeking judicial review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AFGE maintains that review of an arbitration decision in a mixed case is governed by the following language of subsection (f) of section 7121 of the CSRA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure in accordance with this section, section 7703 of this title pertaining to judicial review shall apply to the award of an arbitrator in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the [MSPB] .[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">[1]&#x2003;Section 7703 of the CSRA makes a final order or decision of the MSPB judicially reviewable on the employee's application. 5 USC 7703(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC 7121(f). A close reading of section 7121 in its entirety, however, makes clear that subsection (f) does not apply to a mixed case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7121, divided into subsections (a) through (f), establishes in subsection (a) that a collective bargaining agreement affords the <span class="Italic">exclusive</span> procedure for resolving a covered grievance between the employee and his employer unless the employee's grievance falls under either subsection (d) or subsection (e). Subsection (d) applies when an employee is "affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1) of this title."[2] Section 2302(b)(1) lists as prohibited personnel practices certain forms of discrimination. 5 USC 2302(b)(1) (prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status or political affiliation). Because subsection (d) encompasses section 2302(b)(1) claims, it applies to pure discrimination cases and because it alludes to section 7702, as explained <span class="Italic">infra</span>, it also applies to mixed cases. Unlike subsection (a), which makes the negotiated grievance procedure exclusive, subsection (d) directs an employee to make an initial election between the negotiated grievance procedure and "a statutory procedure." 5 USC 7121(d). In a pure discrimination case, the statutory procedure consists of the EEO complaint format under 42 USC 2000e-16. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 29 CFR 1613 (1992). In a mixed case like Michniak's, the statutory alternative is set forth in the multi-tiered and multiple choice procedure of section 7702 discussed earlier.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The relevant language of subsection (d) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2301(b)(1) of this title which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both.... &#8197;Selection of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee to request the [MSPB] to review the final decision pursuant to section 7702 of this title in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board, or, where applicable, to request the [EEOC] to review a final decision in any other matter involving a complaint of discrimination of the type prohibited by any law administered by the [EEOC] . 5 USC 7121(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to subsection (d), subsection (e) does not encompass discrimination claims. Instead, it applies only to "matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title." 5 USC 7121(e).[3] Section 4303 addresses actions based on unacceptable performance; section 7512 covers removals, reductions in grade or pay and certain furloughs and suspensions. Like subsection (d), subsection (e) also allows the employee to choose between the negotiated grievance procedure and the statutory procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The relevant portion of subsection (e) provides: Matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which also fall within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures of section 7701 of this title or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. 5 USC 7121(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It might be argued that a mixed case could fall under subsection (e) inasmuch as a mixed case includes job actions covered by sections 4303 or 7512 as well as discrimination claims. Subsection (e), however, contains language manifesting that it is inapplicable to a mixed case. It directs an employee who chooses the statutory procedure to section 7701, which contains the MSPB review route, rather than to section 7702, which sets forth the procedure to be followed in a mixed case. Subsection (d), in contrast, expressly refers to section 7702. To preserve the integrity of the structure of subsections (d) and (e) as separate statutory provisions, we must give effect to the different language used in those sections.... &#8197;By so doing, we conclude that subsection (d) applies to mixed cases and that subsection (e) applies only to job actions, that is, cases arising under sections 4303 and 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now come to subsection (f). It provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure in accordance with this section, section 7703 of this title pertaining to judicial review shall apply to the award of an arbitrator in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the [MSPB] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC 7121(f). The AFGE argues that subsection (f) allows it to take the arbitrator's decision to the district court without first seeking MSPB review. The beginning language of subsection (f), providing that it applies to "matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512," is the same language that begins subsection (e) and therefore must be interpreted <span class="Italic">in</span> <span class="Italic">pari</span> <span class="Italic">materia</span> to apply to the same class of cases covered by subsection (e). So interpreted, subsection (f), like subsection (e), applies only to job action (that is, nondiscrimination) cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given this reading of subsections (e) and (f), the only other source of authority for an employee to seek direct judicial review of an arbitration decision in a mixed case is subsection (d) itself. As noted earlier, it provides that "[s]election of the negotiated grievance procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee to request the [MSPB] to review the final decision." 5 USC 7121(d). But subsection (d) does not <span class="Italic">expressly</span> authorize direct judicial review of an arbitrator's final decision. It does no more than allow the employee to seek MSPB review. Thus, neither subsection (d), subsection (e) nor subsection (f) of section 7121 expressly gives the employee the right to direct judicial review of an arbitrator's decision in a mixed case. The language in subsections (e) and (f) allowing direct judicial review applies only to nondiscrimination cases while subsection (d), which covers mixed cases, contains no language affording direct judicial review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are left with the question of how the employee who chooses the negotiated grievance procedure obtains review in district court. The answer lies not in section 7121 but in section 7703, entitled "Judicial review of decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board." 5 USC 7703. Under section 7703 an employee with a discrimination claim may proceed to court after receiving notice of a "judicially reviewable action" under section 7702. 5 USC 7703(b)(2). Because under subsection 7121(d) an employee who chooses the negotiated grievance procedure initially forfeits the statutory procedure, it would seem, at first glance, that the employee could not obtain notice of a judicially reviewable action under section 7702 and thus that section 7703 would be unavailable. But, as noted earlier, section 7121(d) provides a mechanism by which an employee who elects to use the negotiated grievance procedure may obtain judicial review under section 7702. The employee, as subsection (d) spells out, may seek MSPB review of the arbitrator's decision. Under section 7703, the MSPB's decision is then subject to judicial review because it is a "judicially reviewable action under [&#8197;] 7702." 5 USC 7703(a)(1), 7703(b)(2). Accordingly, in a mixed case an employee who chooses the negotiated grievance procedure must take the arbitrator's decision to the MSPB before seeking judicial review. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the CSRA, the negotiated grievance procedure prescribed in a collective bargaining agreement is generally the exclusive path to redress for a federal employee with a grievance. 5 USC 7121(a). Exceptions to the general rule, however, are found in subsections (d) and (e) of section 7121. Subsection (d) covers both pure discrimination and mixed discrimination cases.[1] Subsection (e) of section 7121 provides another exception for <span id="Page_5287"></span>grievances related solely to job actions appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) under 5 USC 4303 and 5 USC 7512. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7121(d), (e); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">American Fed. of Gov't Employees, Local 2052 v. Reno</span>, 992 F.2d 331, 333-34 (D.C. Cir. 1993) [hereinafter <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>] . Johnson and Parker brought a pure discrimination claim; thus, subsection (d) governs this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;A pure discrimination case complains of discrimination only; a mixed case includes both a complaint of discrimination and a challenge to certain types of job actions taken by the agency and ultimately appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). 5 USC 7702.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsection (d) requires an employee with a pure case to make a binding choice between pursuing the matter "under the statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure but not both." 5 USC 7121(d); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, at 333; <span class="Italic">Smith v. Kaldor</span>, 869 F.2d 999, 1005 (6th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Vinieratos v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 939 F.2d 762, 768 (9th Cir. 1991) (noting irrevocability of choice). The statutory grievance procedure for a pure case is outlined in 42 USC 2000e-16 and the EEOC's accompanying regulations. If the employee wishes to pursue the statutory path, he must first consult an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselor at the employing agency "within 30 calendar days of the date of the alleged discriminatory event." 29 CFR 1613.213. The EEO counselor has 21 days to resolve the matter or to notify the employee of his right to file a formal complaint. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under EEOC regulations, the employee is not deemed to have chosen the statutory path until he files the formal complaint. 29 CFR 1613.219. Having filed a formal complaint with his agency, the employee who thus chooses the statutory procedure may appeal the agency's ultimate decision in one of two ways. He may bypass further administrative procedures and seek <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review in district court within 30 days after receiving notice of the agency's final decision.[2] 42 USC 2000e-16(c). Alternatively, he may appeal an adverse decision to the EEOC. 29 CFR 1613.231. If he objects to the EEOC's final decision, he may seek <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review in district court.[3] 42 USC 2000-e16(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;If the agency fails to reach a decision within 180 days after the filing, the employee may also proceed directly to district court. 42 USC 2000e-16(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The employee may also proceed to district court if the EEOC fails to make a decision within 180 days. 42 USC 2000e-16(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Johnson and Parker, however, did not follow the statutory procedure. Instead, they elected to pursue the negotiated grievance procedure which required them to submit their claim ultimately to arbitration. Once the arbitrator ruled, they sought direct <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review in district court under 42 USC 2000e-16. Because Johnson and Parker did not first appeal to the EEOC, the district court dismissed their claims. We affirm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin our analysis with section 7121(d) which requires the employee to make an irrevocable choice between the statutory and the negotiated grievance procedures. Subsection (d) also provides that "[s]election of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee... to request the [EEOC] to review a final decision... involving a complaint of discrimination of the type prohibited by any law administered by the [EEOC]." Implementing this provision, the EEOC promulgated a regulation that authorizes the employee to appeal the arbitrator's decision to the EEOC. 29 CFR 1613.231(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both parties agree that subsection (d) <span class="Italic">allows</span> Johnson and Parker to appeal the arbitrator's decision to the EEOC. If they had done so, they would have been able to proceed to district court within 30 days after the EEOC reached a decision. 42 USC 2000e-16(c). The parties part company, however, on the question whether subsection (d)'s language is permissive or mandatory. Johnson and Parker rely on section 2000e16(c) as well as the permissive language of the EEOC regulation ("a [c]omplainant <span class="Italic">may</span> appeal to the Commission" (emphasis added)) to establish their right to seek direct district court review. 29 CFR 1613.231(b). The government, on the other hand, insists that subsection (d) <span class="Italic">requires</span> Johnson and Parker to appeal first to the EEOC. Interpreting the language otherwise, according to the government, would undermine subsection (d)'s requirement that the employee must choose either the statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure. We agree.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Under the CSRA, the employee can submit exceptions to an arbitrator's award to the Federal Labor Relations Authority instead of appealing to the EEOC. 5 USC 7122(a). He may then appeal the Authority's decision to the EEOC. 29 CFR 1613.231(b). Nothing in this opinion forecloses that option.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, Johnson and Parker base their claim to direct judicial review on section 2000e-16(c). Section 2000e-16(c) allows the employee to initiate a civil action in district court "within 30 days of receipt of notice of <span class="Italic">final action taken by a department agency, or unit</span> referred to in... this section or by the [EEOC] upon appeal." 42 USC 2000e-16(c). But section 2000e-16(c) does not define "final action." Because the statute is silent, Johnson and Parker rely on the EEOC regulation to assert that the arbitrator's decision constitutes final action and therefore is directly reviewable in district court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Analysis of the EEOC regulation, 29 CFR 1613.231(b), reveals the weakness of their argument. It provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A complainant may appeal <span class="Italic">to the Commission</span> on issues of employment discrimination raised in a negotiated grievance procedure.... &#8197;A complainant may appeal the decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Of the agency head or designee on the grievance;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Of the arbitrator on the grievance; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Of the Federal Labor Relations Authority on exceptions to the arbitrator's award.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 CFR 1613.231(b). Thus, section 1613.231(b) lists the types of decisions the employee may appeal <span class="Italic">not</span> to the district court but to the EEOC. It says nothing about the employee's authority to seek judicial review. Indeed, because section 7121(d) of the CSRA expressly authorizes the employee to appeal the arbitrator's decision to the EEOC, its regulation could hardly provide otherwise. The EEOC regulation, then, does not provide support for direct district court review of the arbitration award.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More important, section 2000e-16(c) itself does not support direct district court review. It authorizes a civil action in district court <span class="Italic">only</span> after either (1) appeal to the EEOC or (2) "final action taken by a department, agency, or unit referred to in subsection (a) of this section." 42 USC 2000e-16(c). Thus, section 2000e-16(c) does not apply to the arbitrator's decision. Our interpretation of section 2000e-16 is reinforced by the fact that it lays out in part the statutory procedure the employee may use to pursue his grievance. In light of section 7121(d)'s mandate that the employee choose between the <span class="Italic">negotiated</span> procedure and the <span class="Italic">statutory</span> procedure, section 2000e-16(c) cannot be used to authorize direct district court review of arbitration (part of the <span class="Italic">negotiated</span> procedure).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless we must determine how the employee who chooses the negotiated grievance procedure seeks judicial review of the final administrative decision. The answer lies in the integration of section 7121(d) and section 2000e-16(c). Subsection (d) allows the employee to appeal the arbitration decision to the EEOC. Section 2000e-16(c) provides that the employee may bring suit in district court after the EEOC either renders its decision or fails to take action within 180 days. Accordingly, in a pure discrimination case, the employee who chooses the negotiated grievance procedure must first appeal the arbitrator's award to the EEOC before bringing suit in district court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additional factors support our interpretation. First, in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, at 336, we held that an employee with a <span class="Italic">mixed</span> case cannot seek judicial review of an arbitration award without first appealing to the MSPB. To reach that result, we relied on the same language of section 7121(d) that we consider here. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 335. The language allows, but does not require, the employee with a mixed claim to appeal the arbitrator's decision to the MSPB. 5 USC 7121(d). We concluded that section 7121(d)'s preservation of the mixed claim employee's right to appeal to the MSPB created the bridge by which the employee following the negotiated procedure could revert to the statutory path and seek judicial review. <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, at 335. The employee with a mixed claim has the same type of discrimination claim as the employee with a pure claim; the only difference is that the former combines that claim with a job action claim covered under different sections of the CSRA. Accordingly, there is no reason that the language of section 7121(d) should not have the same effect on a pure claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we have consistently read the CSRA narrowly, refusing to imply remedies that cannot be found in the language of the statute. Personnel management is "peculiarly within the ken and concern of Congress." <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Bowen</span>, 815 F.2d 1505, 1515 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Thus, "reading between the lines [of the CSRA] to interpolate remedies Congress did not provide can only lead the Court into error." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, we decline to create a method by which the employee can short-circuit the administrative process without the explicit authorization of Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, section 7121(d) requires a federal employee with a pure discrimination complaint to choose between the statutory and the negotiated grievance procedures. The employee who chooses the negotiated procedure may appeal the arbitrator's decision to the EEOC. Only after the EEOC has rendered a decision or failed to do so within 180 days may the employee use section 2000e-16(c) and initiate suit in district court. After the arbitrator ruled against them, Johnson and Parker attempted to bring suit in district court without first appealing to the EEOC. They failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and, as a consequence, their lawsuit was properly dismissed by the district court. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is <span class="Italic">Affirmed</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Macy v. Dalton</span>, 853 F. Supp. 350, 355 (E.D. Cal. 1994) ("It is important to note that plaintiffs are not now barred from pressing their discrimination claims in the grievance procedure, then to the EEOC or MSPB, and ultimately (again) to a federal court. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). The election of remedies requirement does not cut off access to the courts. It simply requires that parties try to resolve their claims through arbitrators and agencies with special expertise <span id="Page_5288"></span>in discrimination claims <span class="Italic">before</span> filing a lawsuit. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Marsh</span>, 777 F.2d 8, 14 (D.C.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fernandez v. Chertoff</span>, 471 F.3d 45, 48-60 (2d Cir. 2006), allowed for exceptions to the exhaustion requirement. The trial court dismissed the complaint filed by Fernandez because a union grievance was filed challenging a personnel action and the union did not take the case to arbitration, leaving the plaintiff without a final award or decision of an arbitrator to pursue to EEOC and then to court. Although the case did not involve an action that could have been appealed directly or indirectly to MSPB, the mixed-case process was described and, significantly, the case was remanded to the district court for consideration of factors that might allow the court to excuse the administrative exhaustion requirement and consider the complaint on the merits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">... Fernandez, who is of Puerto Rican ethnicity, commenced this action <span class="Italic">pro se</span> under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> ("Title VII"), alleging employment discrimination on account of his race, sex, and national origin after the Department denied his request to be reinstated to his former position as a Canine Enforcement Officer ("CEO") following a two-year medical leave of absence. In his Complaint, Fernandez alleged that his labor union, the National Treasury Employees Union ("NTEU"), initially challenged the Department's decision denying his reinstatement by invoking arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement but later withdrew his grievance from arbitration when he rejected a proposed settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department moved to dismiss the Complaint, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, contending that Fernandez had not appealed to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") following the NTEU's withdrawal from arbitration and therefore failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 before filing his Title VII lawsuit....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 7, 2001, Larry Tanacredi, president of the local chapter of the NTEU representing employees in the Customs Service, filed a grievance on behalf of Fernandez challenging the Department's decision to deny reinstatement and requesting a meeting to discuss dispute resolution. The collective bargaining agreement between the Department and the NTEU in place at that time permitted allegations of discrimination to be raised through the negotiated grievance process....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 22, 2001, an Equal Employment Opportunity ("EEO") Counselor in the Department was notified by NTEU that a grievance had been filed on Fernandez's behalf. Two days later, Fernandez was advised that he could not seek relief from the Equal Employment Opportunity ("EEO") Counselor because he had elected to resolve his complaint through the grievance process: "the filing of the NTEU grievance indicates that [Fernandez] has elected to pursue this matter via non-EEO process," and "[t]he same issue cannot be pursued through the EEO process." He was also advised that if he were dissatisfied with the result of the grievance proceeding, "he could contact an EEO Counselor within 45 days of completion of gr[ie] vance process (final action)." Despite this notice, on October 31, 2001, Fernandez contacted an EEO Counselor and filed an informal complaint alleging retaliation in connection with the Department's refusal to reinstate him. Fernandez then filed a formal EEO complaint on November 15, 2001. The formal complaint was dismissed by letter on December 13, 2001. The letter advised Fernandez that his complaint of discrimination was being dismissed "because the matter was raised in a negotiated grievance procedure that permits allegations of discrimination." Significantly, the letter also indicated that "[t]he final decision on the grievance may be appealed to the EEOC."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 22, 2002, the NTEU, pursuing the dispute resolution process, invoked arbitration of Fernandez's grievance. On January 6, 2003, Fernandez authorized the appointment of NTEU Assistant Counsel Ralph Talarico as his representative. In December 2003, the Department offered to settle Fernandez's grievance by, among other things, placing him in a CEO position at John F. Kennedy International Airport, along with a promotion to GS-11. The NTEU, through Talarico, advised Fernandez to accept the offer or it would withdraw the grievance from arbitration. Dissatisfied with the terms of the proposed settlement, however, Fernandez refused to sign the agreement, which he believed to be a "trap door to termination" by the Department. On March 24, 2004, the NTEU withdrew the grievance from arbitration. Fernandez contends that he was not permitted to participate in the arbitration process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly thereafter, Fernandez contacted the EEOC to seek a right-to-sue letter, but his efforts were unsuccessful. Fernandez filed the instant Complaint on May 5, 2004. The form Complaint provided to Fernandez indicated that "[t]his action is brought for discrimination in employment pursuant to... Title VII" and noted that "[i]n order to bring a suit in federal district court under Title VII, you must first obtain a right to sue letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission." In a letter to the District Court accompanying the Complaint, Fernandez advised that he "returned to the EEOC in New York to request an updated right to su[e] letter, as I was told by the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> office[,] but the EEOC said that I did [not] need it."</p>

The CSRA requires unions and federal employers to include procedures for settling grievances in their collective bargaining agreements. The term "grievance" is defined to include any complaint "by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(A). With limited exception, the CSRA provides that the grievance procedure in any collective bargaining agreement "shall be the exclusive administrative procedure[&#8197;] for resolving grievances which fall within [the agreement's] coverage." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1). Where the employee is aggrieved by discrimination, however, he may elect to seek relief under an alternative procedure, designated as the statutory procedure. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7121(d). To further "balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration," the CSRA "prescribes in great detail the protections and remedies applicable to [adverse personnel] action[s], including the availability of administrative and judicial review." <span class="Italic">U.S. v. Fausto,</span> 484 U.S. 439, 443, 445 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the CSRA, an employee of the United States Customs and Border Protection who is aggrieved by discriminatory personnel practices may, in the first instance, pursue his grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure or the statutory complaint procedure, <span class="Italic">but not both</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Peterson,</span> 996 F.2d 397, 398-99 (D.C. Cir. 1993).

[5 U.S.C.] &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4). A collective-bargaining agreement must provide procedures "for the settlement of grievances," [5 U.S.C.] &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1), which are defined as "complaint[s] ... concerning... any claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment," [5 U.S.C.] &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii); and the agreement must "provide that any grievance not satisfactorily settled under the negotiated grievance procedure shall be subject to binding arbitration" which may be invoked by either party.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, by invoking the statutory procedure, an employee pursues his grievance under the statutory and regulatory framework created to resolve original complaints of employment discrimination under Title VII and related statutes. Under the statutory procedure, the CSRA distinguishes between "pure" discrimination cases and "mixed" discrimination cases. A "pure" discrimination case, <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> 996 F.2d at 398 n.1, involves claims of discrimination only. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) (prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, marital status or political affiliation). For example, an employee may claim that his termination was prompted by discrimination without challenging the employer's stated reasons for his termination. Or, the employee may claim that the penalty imposed, although authorized, was applied only to members of his or her race. These scenarios are examples of "pure" discrimination cases. An aggrieved employee may pursue a "pure" discrimination case in the first instance by filing a complaint with the EEO Office of his employing agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.106.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5289"></span>By contrast, a "mixed" case involves both a claim of discrimination and a challenge to other types of prohibited personnel actions taken by the agency that are ultimately appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB"). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702; <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 2052 v. Reno,</span> 992 F.2d 331, 332 (D.C. Cir. 1993).

<p class="Block-Quote1">As relevant to this appeal, once an employee elects to pursue the negotiated grievance procedure and that process is carried out to completion, administrative review becomes available.

<p class="Block-Quote2">An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1) of this title which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both. An employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise the matter under either a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure at such time as the employee timely initiates an action under the applicable statutory procedure or timely files a grievance in writing, in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated procedure, whichever event occurs first. <span class="Italic">Selection of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee to request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review the final decision pursuant to section 7702 of this title in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board, or, where applicable, to request the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review a final decision in any other matter involving a complaint of discrimination of the type prohibited by any law administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</span></p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Fernandez's Grievance</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Nature of Fernandez's Claim</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department contends--for the first time on appeal--that Fernandez pursued a mixed discrimination case because "his claim involves a prohibited personnel action over which the Merit Systems Protection Board has jurisdiction." The significance of the Department's argument is that, in a mixed case, Fernandez would have been required to appeal to the MSPB under &#x00A7; 7121(d) before commencing this action in the District Court, which he clearly did not do. Based upon our review of the Record, however, we conclude that Fernandez raised a pure discrimination claim and, therefore, that he was required to pursue his administrative remedies in the EEOC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, Fernandez was advised by letter dated December 13, 2001 that his EEO complaint was being dismissed "because the matter was raised in a negotiated grievance procedure that permits allegations of discrimination." That letter characterized Fernandez's claim as a "formal complaint of discrimination" that "raise[d] an allegation of retaliation" identical to the one raised in the negotiated grievance procedure. Significantly, the letter specifically notified Fernandez that, while "any allegations of discrimination must be raised in the grievance process" because he elected to pursue his grievance in that forum, <span class="Italic">"[t]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">he final decision on the grievance may be appealed to the EEOC</span>." (emphasis added). The letter mentioned nothing of a "mixed" claim, a claim involving a prohibited personnel action under the exclusive jurisdiction of the MSPB, or a right to appeal to the MSPB if the result of arbitration was not favorable. As far as Fernandez knew, he had raised a pure discrimination claim and could appeal the final decision of the arbitrator to the EEOC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the Department's own motion to dismiss recognized that Fernandez had raised a pure discrimination claim that could be exhausted only in the EEOC. In support of the motion, the Department asserted that "[e]ven if the decision to withdraw the arbitration was made by the union and not [Fernandez], [Fernandez] was still required to appeal <span class="Italic">to the EEOC</span> before filing the present lawsuit if he was dissatisfied either with the [Department] 's offer, with the NTEU's decision to withdraw the arbitration, or with any other aspect of the grievance process." The Department further stated that Fernandez "did not appeal to the EEOC, or take any other steps to pursue his grievance" and "[c]onsequently, he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the union grievance process, thereby precluding him from bringing suit in court." Finally, the Department recognized that it had "informed [Fernandez] in December 2001 that his EEO claim was barred by his prior decision to file a union grievance... . It also informed him that he could appeal the outcome of the grievance to the EEOC." The District Court relied on the Department's arguments and concluded that Fernandez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by "not appeal[ing] the result of the grievance process to the EEOC."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, the form Complaint provided to Fernandez at the time that he commenced this action characterized his claim as "brought for discrimination in employment pursuant to... Title VII." The Complaint contained a notice advising that "[i]n order to bring a suit in federal district court under Title VII, you must first obtain a right to sue letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission." In reliance upon this notice, Fernandez contacted the EEOC office to request a right to sue letter, but his request was denied. Based upon the foregoing, we find no evidence to support the Department's novel claim that Fernandez pursued a mixed case or was notified of his right to appeal to the MSPB and, in fact, find evidence to the contrary. Accordingly, we conclude that Fernandez pursued a pure discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Fernandez's Election of Remedies</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that Fernandez irrevocably elected to pursue the negotiated procedure to resolve his pure discrimination claim. Based upon the collective bargaining agreement in place between the Department and NTEU at the time that Fernandez was denied reinstatement, the NTEU requested a dispute resolution meeting on behalf of Fernandez and thereafter invoked arbitration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An aggrieved employee who files a grievance with an agency whose negotiated agreement permits the acceptance of grievances which allege discrimination may not thereafter file a[n EEO] complaint <span id="Page_5290"></span>on the <span class="Italic">same matter</span> under this part 1614 irrespective of whether the agency has informed the individual of the need to elect or of whether the grievance has raised an allegation of discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.301(a) (emphasis added). Because Fernandez elected to proceed with the negotiated grievance procedure in the first instance, his EEO complaint filed on November 15, 2001 was properly dismissed inasmuch as arbitration of the same matter already had been invoked.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Fernandez now attempts to avoid the preclusive effect of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) by arguing that the NTEU invoked the negotiated grievance procedure without notifying him, that objection is not properly before us inasmuch as it is being raised for the first time on appeal. In any event, even assuming that Fernandez was unaware of the NTEU's September 7, 2001 letter requesting formal dispute resolution, the Record reveals that Fernandez was notified of this fact in the December 13, 2001 correspondence dismissing his EEO complaint on the basis of the ongoing grievance procedure and that he subsequently supported the NTEU's role in the procedure by specifically designating Talarico as his bargaining representative. Moreover, nothing in the Record demonstrates that Fernandez ever requested that the NTEU cease negotiations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, when Fernandez rejected a proposed settlement that the NTEU viewed to be reasonable, the union abandoned his grievance by unilaterally withdrawing from arbitration. Therefore, the issue presented on this appeal is what, if any, avenue of relief was available to Fernandez <span class="Italic">after</span> the NTEU withdrew from arbitration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Fernandez's Right to Appeal</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we have concluded that Fernandez pursued a pure discrimination claim cognizable in the EEOC, we reject the Department's argument that Fernandez failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by not appealing to the MSPB. We also reject the Department's strained reading of &#x00A7; 7121(d) as barring an employee from seeking review of a final arbitration decision in the EEOC in all instances. Under &#x00A7; 7121(d),</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[s]election of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee to request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review the final decision pursuant to [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702] of this title in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board, or, where applicable, to request the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review a final decision <span class="Italic">in any other matter</span> involving a complaint of discrimination of the type prohibited by any law administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department contends, for the first time on appeal, that because Fernandez is pursuing the "same matter"--discrimination underlying the Department's refusal to reinstate him--that he previously pursued in his grievance, "&#x00A7; 7121(d) does not authorize him to seek review before the EEOC." The Department argues that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]f Congress had intended the EEOC to review grievances, it could have provided in &#x00A7; 7121(d) that an employee has the right to request the EEOC to review "the final decision" of the grievance process (like it did with respect to the MSPB) or "the matter" that was raised in the grievance process. Instead, Congress wrote that such an employee has the right to request the EEOC to review "<span class="Italic">any other matter</span>" involving a complaint of unlawful employment discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department therefore interprets "any other matter" to mean any other act of discrimination not previously alleged in the negotiated grievance process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "any other matter" in &#x00A7; 7121(d), however, refers to the nature of the employee's claim, not to whether the claim was raised previously. Where the employee raises a mixed claim, an appeal from an arbitrator's decision lies in the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See Johnson,</span> 996 F.2d at 401 ("[S]ection 7121(d)'s preservation of the mixed claim employee's right to appeal to the MSPB created the bridge by which the employee following the negotiated procedure could revert to the statutory path and seek judicial review."). Where, as here, the employee raises a pure discrimination claim, an appeal from an arbitrator's decision lies in the EEOC. The provision in &#x00A7; 7121(d) allowing an employee to request the EEOC to review a final decision "in any other matter involving a complaint of discrimination" therefore refers to cases of pure discrimination as opposed to the cases within the jurisdiction of the MSPB to review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.401(d) ("A grievant may appeal the final decision of the... arbitrator... on the grievance [to the EEOC] when an issue of employment discrimination was raised in a negotiated grievance procedure that permits such issues to be raised. A grievant may not appeal under this part, however, when the matter initially raised in the negotiated grievance procedure is still ongoing in that process, is in arbitration, [or] <span class="Italic">is appealable to the MSPB</span>." (emphasis added)). Accordingly, we read "any other matter" to refer to pure employment discrimination claims as distinguished from the other types of claims involving prohibited personnel practices cognizable by the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Fernandez elected to proceed along the negotiated grievance route, the NTEU chose not to go forward with arbitration. We note that only parties to the collective bargaining agreement may pursue binding arbitration of a grievance not otherwise satisfactorily settled. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(b)(1)(C)(iii). The NTEU both submitted Fernandez's grievance to arbitration and withdrew it, and the Record does not reveal that Fernandez was provided with an opportunity to represent himself or that he had the right to do so. Moreover, Fernandez could not be compelled to accede to a settlement agreement that was unacceptable to him. The failure by Fernandez to exhaust administrative remedies available under the CSRA was therefore attributable to the NTEU's actions in preventing a "final decision" from which he could have otherwise appealed. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). Since the CSRA left Fernandez with no avenue of relief after the NTEU unilaterally withdrew from arbitration, the District Court should consider this fact on remand in determining whether the failure to exhaust EEOC remedies can be excused.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Equitable Relief</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Fernandez's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies is not a jurisdictional defect, it is subject to equitable defenses. We have previously held in the employment discrimination context that "the exhaustion requirement, while weighty, is not jurisdictional." <span class="Italic">Boos v. Runyon,</span> 201 F.3d 178, 182 (2d Cir. 2000). Thus, "filing a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling." <span class="Italic">Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</span> 455 U.S. 385, 393 (1982); <span class="Italic">see Paese v. Hartford Life Accident Ins. Co.,</span> 449 F.3d 435, 444 (2d Cir. 2006). Moreover, exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required if adequate remedies are not reasonably available. <span class="Italic">J.G. by Mrs. G. v. Bd. of Educ. of Rochester City Sch. Dist.,</span> 830 F.2d 444, 447 (2d Cir. 1987). Thus, courts may, in their discretion, waive administrative exhaustion requirements under circumstances where the administrative remedy is inadequate because the agency cannot provide effective relief. For instance, administrative remedies need not be pursued if "(a) '[the agency] lacks institutional competence to resolve the particular type of issue presented, such as the constitutionality of a statute'; (b) the challenge is to 'the adequacy of the agency procedure itself'; or (c) the agency 'lack[s] authority to grant the type of relief requested.'" <span class="Italic">Bastek v. Fed. Crop Ins. Corp.,</span> 145 F.3d 90, 94 n.4 (2d Cir. 1998) (quoting <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. Madigan,</span> 503 U.S. 140, 146-48 (1992)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing the Complaint, the District Court declined to apply equitable principles to excuse Fernandez's failure to exhaust administrative remedies on the grounds that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Fernandez has not shown... that he acted with reasonable diligence, [&#8197;] or that there are extraordinary circumstances at play. Fernandez apparently believes that he was discriminated against in the grievance process, that the settlement offer was a "trap door," and that the union was not acting as a good[-] faith negotiator on his behalf. Fernandez was told, however, on October 24, 2001, that the filing of the NTEU grievance indicated that he elected to pursue the matter through the non-EEO process, and that he could contact an EEO counselor within 45 days of completion of the grievance process... . Additionally, after filing his EEO[&#8197;] complaint, Fernandez was informed that though his complaint was being dismissed because of his election, the final decision on the grievance may be appealed to the EEOC... . Thus, Fernandez had clear notice of the procedures which he must follow, and he has not established any "extraordinary circumstances" that prevented him from following them. Likewise, Fernandez has not identified any factor that would warrant waiver of the exhaustion requirement. Accordingly, I decline to apply these equitable doctrines to this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Fernandez v. Ridge,</span> 2004 WL 3088664, at *7. Significantly, the District Court's determination is based on the assumption that Fernandez could appeal "the final decision on the grievance" to the EEOC under the circumstances. There simply was no "completion of the grievance process," and therefore no final decision to be appealed, and the District Court erred in assuming otherwise. The court also erred in not considering whether Fernandez's application for relief in the EEOC after the NTEU's withdrawal from arbitration satisfied the exhaustion requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Fernandez was required to appeal to the EEOC within 30 days of the final decision in arbitration, the possibility of a final decision was foreclosed by the NTEU's unilateral withdrawal. Thus, the EEOC had no final decision before it to review. As the EEOC has itself recognized, "the Commission only has authority [to] review discrimination claims where there has been a final decision issued by... an arbitrator." E.E.O.C. Dec. 01A40558, 2004 WL 717088 at *1 (dismissing grievant's appeal as premature in the absence of a final decision issued by the arbitrator). Fernandez alleges that he contacted the EEOC after the NTEU withdrew from arbitration and was told "there was no way that you could go back into the EEOC because you already have acted at one time." Fernandez further alleges that he "returned to the EEOC in New York to request an <span id="Page_5291"></span>updated right to su[e] letter... but the EEOC said that [he] did [not] need it."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mindful that this Court must, on this Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, assume the truth of all well-pleaded factual allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of Fernandez, we cannot say, at this early stage in litigation, that it appears beyond doubt that Fernandez can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. <span class="Italic">See Conley,</span> 355 U.S. at 45-46. Accordingly, a remand to the District Court to consider whether equitable principles excused Fernandez's failure to exhaust his administrative remedies is in order. Factors which may be considered by the District Court include, but are not limited to, the extent of the role Fernandez was entitled to play in the negotiated grievance process, the absence of a final decision by the arbitrator and its effect on the EEOC's authority to grant relief, the reasonableness of the proposed settlement agreement, the reasonableness of Fernandez's rejection of the settlement, and the allegations by Fernandez that he sought relief in the EEOC after the NTEU withdrew from arbitration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On summary judgment or after trial on remand, it may well appear to the District Court, depending on the totality of the circumstances, that the NTEU's abandonment of Fernandez's claim and his consequent inability to seek EEOC review of a final decision constituted equitable considerations sufficient to justify failure to exhaust in this case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Pietras v. Bd. of Fire Comm'rs of Farmingville Fire Dist.,</span> 180 F.3d 468, 474 (2d Cir. 1999) (holding that the district court acted within its discretion by excusing absence of notice-of-right-to-sue letter from EEOC where plaintiff made diligent effort to obtain notice-of-right-to-sue letter from EEOC and was denied one on erroneous basis that she was not an employee). Whatever the final result, our expectation is that the District Court will fairly consider all of the relevant facts in making this determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To summarize: The unique circumstances of this case are not specifically addressed by the CSRA's statutory scheme. Although Fernandez irrevocably elected to pursue his pure discrimination case under the negotiated procedure--a choice which prevented him from pursuing the statutory process in the first instance--his grievance was withdrawn without his consent before a final decision in arbitration could be given. An appeal from the result of arbitration thus was foreclosed. Given Fernandez's application for relief from the EEOC following the NTEU's withdrawal from arbitration, however, we conclude that the District Court should consider whether equitable considerations excused his failure to exhaust EEOC remedies. In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is vacated, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee seeks Board review of an arbitrator's award and the Board lacks jurisdiction because the employee does not allege discrimination before the Board, the Board's decision is not properly appealable to the Federal Circuit. The merits of the underlying arbitration award are then not considered by the court. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bass v. MSPB</span>, 482 Fed. Appx. 591, 592 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP) ("Bass did not raise allegations of discrimination before the arbitrator, before the Board, or even before us on appeal. The Board therefore did not have jurisdiction under section 7121(d) to review the arbitrator's decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 804 F.2d 673, 676 (Fed. Cir. 1986). While Bass contends that the arbitrator improperly failed to consider his twenty years of prior federal service in determining whether he had appeal rights under title 5, that is irrelevant to the issue of appealability.").</p>
