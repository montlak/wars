<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-198"><span class="space">g.</span> Classification; Accretion of Duties</h5>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator cannot award pay for a position that has not been classified to a particular grade level. <span class="Italic">SEIU Local 200 and VAMC</span>, 10 FLRA 49, 50 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3615 and SSA ODAR</span>, 65 FLRA 647, 649-50 (2011) (arbitrator properly rejected, as involving classification, grievance that employees were entitled to special pay rate when grievance itself characterized matter as one involving classification); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987 and Dept. of Air Force, Robins AFB</span>, 58 FLRA 619, 620 (2003) (grievance claiming promotion based on performance of permanently assigned duties sought reclassification of employee's position). An arbitrator cannot award back pay for a period that an employee performs higher-level duties unless the duties are part of a position that was classified at a higher level. <span class="Italic">Army Aviation Ctr., Ft. Rucker and Wireglass Metal Trades Council</span>, 6 FLRA 209, 211-12 (1981) (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392 (1976)).</p>
<p class="noindent">The classification limitation is jurisdictional, meaning it may be considered by FLRA at any time, <span class="Italic">HUD and AFGE Local 222</span>, 70 FLRA 605, 607 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (vacating prior related decisions involving grievance pertaining to promotion potential and claimed promotion rights) (recon. den., <span class="Italic">DHUD and HUD Local 222</span>, 71 FLRA 17 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Statute, &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) excludes from the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure any grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee."[33] Therefore, the central question in this case always has been whether the underlying grievance concerns classification and is therefore not arbitrable under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This statutory exclusion "appl[ies] irrespective of whether a party makes such a claim before the Authority" because "[t]o hold otherwise would be inconsistent with clearly expressed congressional intent to bar grievances over such matters altogether."[34] Not only can the Authority consider classification matters <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, but "the Authority is <span class="Italic">required</span> to address that statutory issue, regardless of whether the issue was also presented to the arbitrator."[35] Consequently, we consider the issue of classification because it has been the central issue throughout this saga.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[34]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Office &#x0026; Prof'l Emps. Int'l Union, Local 2001</span>, 62 FLRA 67, 69 (2007) (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Fort Polk, La</span>., 61 FLRA 8, 12 (2005) (Member Pope dissenting)); <span class="Italic">see also USDA, Food &#x0026; Consumer Serv., Dall., Tex</span>., 60 FLRA 978, 981 (2005) (<span class="Italic">USDA I</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. EEOC, Memphis Dist.

<p class="noindent-2">[35]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">USDA I</span>, 60 FLRA at 981 (emphasis added).</p>

<p class="noindent">FLRA rejected an accretion of duties promotion theory when the grade sought by the grievant was not associated with a classified position. As a matter of classification, it was excluded from the grievance procedure as a matter of law, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1858 and Dept. of Army, Redstone Arsenal</span>, 59 FLRA 713, 715 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the grievant is entitled to a permanent promotion based on an accretion of higher-graded duties to her existing position. We note, in addition, that the Arbitrator specifically found that the substance of the grievance in this case concerned the assignment of some higher-graded duties to the grievant and, thus, raised issues as to the appropriate grade level for her position, a classification matter. Given the Union's accretion of duties argument, and taking into account the Arbitrator's findings in that regard, we find that the Arbitrator's legal conclusion that the grievance is excluded from the grievance procedure as a matter of law is consistent with &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See Local 2142</span>, 58 FLRA at 417<span class="Italic">. See also AFGE, Local 987</span>, 52 FLRA 212, 215 (1996); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Air Education and Training Command, Randolph AFB, San Antonio, Tex.</span>, 49 FLRA 1387, 1389 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union attempts to distinguish this grievance from the precedent cited above by claiming that the grievance concerned a non-competitive promotion based on an accretion of higher-graded duties to the grievant's position. The Union's argument is unavailing. As the Authority made clear in <span class="Italic">Local 2142</span>, discussing such a non-competitive promotion:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[i]n those circumstances, at least one condition precedent to a promotion is a classification determination upgrading the position.... The mere performance of additional duties is not sufficient in and of itself to warrant an upgrade.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 417 (citation omitted). Thus, even assuming that the grievant in this case was performing some higher-graded duties as a part of the work of her position, her remedy does not lie in a grievance, but, as the Arbitrator pointed out, in a classification appeal. In this regard, the Union does not demonstrate that AR 690-300, chapter 335 mandates a non-competitive promotion based on an accretion of duties.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2142 and Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot</span>, 61 FLRA 194, 196 (2005), determined as to a claimed promotion from GS-9 to GS-11:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As his award, the Arbitrator, among other things, ordered the grievant non-competitively promoted to GS-13. Given the facts of this case, the only basis for such a permanent promotion is the permanent accretion of higher-graded duties to the grievant's position.[5] <span class="Italic">See EPA</span>, 59 FLRA at 520. As the Authority has made clear, "where a grievance concerns the accretion of higher-graded duties to an existing position, the grievance concerns a classification matter." <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2142</span>, 61 FLRA 194, 196 (2005) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1858</span>, 59 FLRA 713, 715 (2004) (<span class="Italic">Local 1858</span>)). <span class="Italic">See also AFGE, Local 2142</span>, 58 FLRA 416, 417 (2003) ("at least one condition precedent to a promotion is a classification determination upgrading the position.").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;There is nothing in the record of this case to suggest that the grievance concerns: (1) a non-competitive promotion based on an existing career ladder for the grievant's position, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., NTEU</span>, 60 FLRA 226, 228 (2004); (2) a non-competitive promotion based on priority consideration, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., SSA, Chicago Region, Cleveland Ohio Dist. Office, University Circle Branch</span>, 56 FLRA 1084, 1088 (2001); or (3) a merit promotion based on the Agency's competitive procedures, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Panama Canal Commission</span>, 56 FLRA 451, 460 (2000). <span class="Italic">See also United States Dep't of the Air Force, Air Education and Training Command, Randolph AFB, San Antonio Tex.</span>, 49 FLRA 1387, 1388-89 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's analysis of the propriety of the classification process under the Act involved a determination of the grade level of the grievant's position by comparing it to that of the Team Leader. The Authority has held that such a comparison involves classification determinations within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Serv.</span>, 60 FLRA 192, 195 (2004); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., Muskogee, Okla.</span>, 47 FLRA 1112, 1116-17 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Medical Center, Muskogee</span>). As a result of that comparison, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's position should be upgraded to GS-13. Consequently, in resolving the question of whether the Agency's classification of the grievant's position was improper, the Arbitrator rendered a classification determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, the Authority has consistently held that, "[w]here the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of duties assigned to and performed by [a] grievant, the grievance concerns the classification of a position within [the] meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Scott AFB, Illinois</span>, 38 FLRA 32, 36 (1990). <span class="Italic">See also Medical Center, Muskogee</span>, 47 FLRA at 1116. Stated differently, the Authority has held that when the essential nature of a grievance is integrally related to the accuracy of the classification of the grievant's position, the grievance concerns a classification matter within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Veterans Administration Medical Center, Tampa, Fla.</span>, 19 FLRA 1177, 1178-79 (1985); <span class="Italic">FAA, Dep't of Transportation, Tampa, Fla.</span>, 8 FLRA 532, 534 (1982). <span class="Italic">See also United States Dep't of Defense, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, Ga.</span>, 57 FLRA 275, 277 (2001). It is clear, given the facts of this case, that the substance of the grievance concerned, and is integrally related to, the classification of the grievant's position. The grievance itself sought a promotion for the grievant to a GS-13 position, the Arbitrator's analysis involved a determination of the grade level of the duties assigned to and performed by the grievant, and, based on his conclusions as to the proper classification of those duties, he awarded the grievant a promotion to the next available GS-13 position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Authority has held that "nothing in the equal pay principles of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5101 is inconsistent with an award finding that grievances concerning the classification of a position are precluded by law under [&#x00A7;] 7121(c)(5) of the Statute from coverage by a negotiated grievance procedure." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2142,</span> 51 FLRA 1140, 1142-43 (1996). <span class="Italic">See also OEA</span>, 15 FLRA at 359 (enforcement of equal pay principle does not prevent award from conflicting with &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union's analysis of the structure of &#x00A7; 7121 misses the point. The provisions of &#x00A7; 7121 referenced by the Union, e.g., &#x00A7; 7121(c) and (d), relate to the status of given subject matters with respect to the negotiated grievance procedure. That is, those provisions, along with &#x00A7; 7121(e) and (g), specify which matters can and cannot be processed through the grievance procedure. The relative positions of those provisions with respect to one another within &#x00A7; 7121 have no significance as to their meaning in connection with the coverage of the grievance procedure. And, in an analogous situation, the Authority stated that a discrimination allegation under &#x00A7; 7121(d) does not establish jurisdiction by the Authority over a matter otherwise outside the jurisdiction of the Authority where the two issues were "inextricably intertwined" with each other. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Ofc., Arlington, Va., </span>61 FLRA 476, 477-78 (2006) (&#x00A7; 7121(d) discrimination claim did not grant the Authority jurisdiction over a "mixed case" that was otherwise excluded from the jurisdiction of the Authority per &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(f) and 7122(a)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, because the Arbitrator had no jurisdiction to determine the classification of the grievant's position, the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, and we will set the award aside.</p>
<p class="noindent">Distinguishing its treatment of temporary and permanent promotions, FLRA implied in <span class="Italic">OPEIU Local 2001 and Dept. of Energy, Oak Ridge</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-019.html">62 FLRA 67</a>, 69 (2007), that a claim to a retroactive permanent promotion based on reclassification of a job will involve a nonarbitrable classification issue:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, a grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction of grade or pay of an employee" is excluded from the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure. The Authority has held that this and the other statutory exclusions set forth in &#x00A7; 7121(c) "apply irrespective of whether a party makes such a claim before the Authority" because "[t]o hold otherwise would be inconsistent with clearly expressed congressional intent to bar grievances over such matters altogether." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Ar</span>my,<span class="Italic"> Fort Polk, La.,</span> 61 FLRA 8, 12 (2005) (Member Pope dissenting) (<span class="Italic">Fort Polk</span>). In <span class="Italic">Fort Polk,</span> the Authority found that it had jurisdiction to address <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> the effect of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) even where, as here, no exceptions were filed on the jurisdictional point by any party. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying <span class="Italic">Fort Polk </span>here, we note that the Authority has construed the term "classification" in &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) as involving "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by [the Office of Personnel Management] under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin., Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals, Mobile, Ala.,</span> 55 FLRA 778, 779-80 (1999) (quoting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c)). The Authority has distinguished between two situations in assessing whether a grievance concerns the classification of a position. Where the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties permanently assigned to, and performed by, the grievant, the Authority finds that the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev., La. State Office, New Orleans, La.,</span> 53 FLRA 1611, 1616 (1998). However, where the substance of the grievance concerns whether the grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion under a collective bargaining agreement by reason of having performed the established duties of a higher-graded position, the Authority has long held that the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the absence of a stipulated issue, the Arbitrator determined that the present case concerned "the proper GS pay grade, GS-13 or GS-14," for the grievants. There was no assertion that the grievants were entitled to a temporary promotion under a collective bargaining agreement, nor did the Arbitrator consider that issue. The Arbitrator considered solely whether the grievants were entitled to permanent, retroactive promotions from GS-13 to GS-14 from the time the Facility Representative position was reclassified to GS-14 in July 2002 to the time the grievants actually received their promotions to GS-14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Authority precedent, it is clear that the substance of the grievance <span id="page_2047"></span>concerned whether the grievants were entitled to permanent promotions and not whether they were entitled to temporary promotions under the parties' collective bargaining agreement for performing previously classified duties of higher-graded positions. As such, the grievance involves a classification matter within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute and is excluded from the grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 987,</span> 58 FLRA 453, 454-55 (2003) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 987</span>) (grievance seeking permanent promotion involved classification); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2142,</span> 51 FLRA 1140, 1142 (1996) (grievance involving performance of duties assigned to permanent position involved classification). Thus, we find that the Arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to resolve the merits of the grievance and set aside the award. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2142,</span> 61 FLRA 194, 198 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 63 FLRA 216, 217-18 (2009), concluded that a claim for permanent promotion based on a theory of equivalence of duties of jobs across organizational subdivisions was barred because it involved position classification:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, a grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction of grade or pay of an employee" is excluded from the scope of any negotiated grievance procedure.

Consequently, when the substance of a grievance concerns whether the grievants are entitled to permanent promotions based on the grade level of the duties performed by the grievants, the grievance concerns classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">Id.</span>;<span class="Italic"> LIUNA Local 28</span>, 56 FLRA 324, 326 n.2 (2000) (Member Cabaniss concurring). Moreover, nothing in the equal pay principles of &#x00A7; 5101 or the Equal Pay Act makes such grievances grievable. <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 61 FLRA at 675-76. Grievances disputing the journeyman or career-ladder level and promotion potential of grievants' permanent positions likewise concern classification. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev., Wash., D.C.</span>, 59 FLRA 630, 632 (2004) (<span class="Italic">HUD</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this established precedent here, we conclude that the grievance concerns classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). In this regard, the grievance alleges that attorneys of BRB and ECAB are entitled to be permanently promoted to GS-14 or GS-15 based on the asserted grade level of the work performed by these attorneys. Moreover, the Union concedes that the grievance challenges the grade level of the career-ladder or journeyman level warranted for the attorneys of BRB and ECAB.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that grievances concerning whether grievants are entitled to temporary promotions on the basis of having temporarily performed the established duties of a position other than their own are not barred by &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">E.g., FAA, Atlanta</span>, 62 FLRA at 521. We also note that, in the grievance, the Union cites an agreement provision pertaining to temporary promotions. Nevertheless, the grievance requests permanent promotions and, as a result, does not involve a dispute over a temporary promotion based on the temporary performance of the duties of another position. <span class="Italic">See LIUNA Local 28</span>, 56 FLRA at 326 n.2 (mere claim of a temporary promotion will not cure a grievance that pertains to the grievants' permanent positions). For the same reason, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">VAMC, Buffalo</span>, a temporary promotion case, is misplaced. Also misplaced is reliance on the equal pay principle, which, as noted, does not make grievable a grievance that concerns classification. <span class="Italic">E.g., EPA</span>, 61 FLRA at 675-76. For the same reason, the alleged violations of the Equal Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301, and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302 do not make the grievance in this case grievable. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>Finally, the fact that the Union agrees that the attorneys involved herein are properly placed in the 905 classification series does not render the grievance arbitrable because position classification involves the placement of positions in grade levels, as well as in series. <span class="Italic">E.g., HUD</span>, 59 FLRA at 632.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we modify the award to strike the portions of the award finding that the grievance is grievable and ordering the parties to schedule a hearing on the merits. We also modify the award to strike the order that the Agency provide specified information to the Union to permit it to process the grievance because the conclusion that the grievance is barred by &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) moots the information request. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Air Force, San Antonio Air Logistics Ctr., Kelly Air Force Base, San Antonio, Tex.</span>, 58 FLRA 71, 72 (2002) (Member Pope concurring) (after underlying award was set aside, the arbitrator's supplemental order set aside as moot).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although an arbitrator properly resolved that a promotion grievance was justified based upon a claim to a position that was already classified, the remedy, requiring the agency to reclassify the grievants' positions, was improper and the award was set aside in <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Local 222</span>, 65 FLRA 433, 435-36 (2011) (following remand, <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Nat'l Council of HUD Locals 222</span>, 66 FLRA 867, 868-69 (2012), recon. den., <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Local 222</span>, 69 FLRA 60 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting), <span class="Italic">Local 222 decisions vacated</span>, <span class="Italic">HUD and AFGE Local 222</span>, 70 FLRA 605 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (recon. den., <span class="Italic">DHUD and HUD Local 222</span>, 71 FLRA 17 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting))):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has repeatedly held that where the essential nature of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties assigned to and performed by the grievant in his or her permanent position, the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Labor, Wash., D.C.</span>, 64 FLRA 829, 830 (2010) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. EPA, Region 2</span>, 61 FLRA 671, 675 (2006) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>)); <span class="Italic">SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 20 FLRA 694, 694-95 (1985).

<p class="noindent-1">In response to the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">HUD</span>, the Arbitrator found that the grievants "alleg[ed] a right to be placed in previously-classified positions[.]" The Arbitrator identified the previously-classified positions at issue as those newly-created positions--similar to the grievants' positions--with promotion potential to GS-13, and the Arbitrator credited the grievants' unrebutted testimony that they were "told by their supervisors that their applications to [these] various positions would be destroyed, or not considered, and they should not apply." The Arbitrator concluded that, "but for these inequitable and unfair situations[,]" the grievants would have been promoted to positions with GS-13 potential. These findings support the Arbitrator's determination that the grievance was arbitrable because it did not concern classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the remedy chosen by the Arbitrator--directing the Agency to perform an organizational <span class="Italic">upgrade </span>of affected <span class="Italic">positions </span>by <span class="Italic">upgrading the journeyman level </span>for all the subject positions to GS-13 retroactively--involves classification. <span class="Italic">See DOL</span>, 63 FLRA at 218; <span class="Italic">cf. EPA, Region 2</span>, 59 FLRA at 525 (finding "substance of the grievance...[was not] barred by &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5)[,]" but setting aside award, in part, because remedial directions concerned classification, in part). In this regard, although the Arbitrator found that the grievance involved "previously-classified positions[,]" her remedy directs the Agency to <span class="Italic">re</span>classify the grievants' <span class="Italic">existing positions </span>by raising their journeyman level. As the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">HUD</span>, the Statute does not authorize the Arbitrator to change the "promotion potential of employees' permanent positions[.]" <span class="Italic">HUD</span>, 59 FLRA at 632. Moreover, although the Union asserts that a permanent-promotion remedy based on an accretion of duties to the grievants' positions would not involve classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5), the Authority has held to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 61 FLRA at 675 (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2142</span>, 61 FLRA 194, 196 (2005)). For these reasons, the Arbitrator's remedy is contrary to law because it concerns classification matters, and we set it aside.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases where the Authority sets aside an entire remedy, but an arbitrator's finding of an underlying violation is left undisturbed, the Authority remands the award for determination of an alternative remedy. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, Salt Lake City, Utah</span>, 63 FLRA 673, 676 (2009). As we have set aside the MA's entire remedy, we remand the MA to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to formulate an alternative remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">Promotion based on the performance of higher-level duties was nonarbitrable, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 62 FLRA 516, 517-18 (2008):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, a grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction of grade or pay of an employee" is excluded from the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure. The Authority has construed the term "classification" in &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) as involving "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by OPM under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin., Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals, Mobile, Ala</span>., 55 FLRA 778, 779-80 (1999) (quoting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c)). The Authority has further stated that, "the mere fact that [an] [a]gency has discretion to establish pay without regard to chapter 51 of title 5 does not preclude a finding <span id="page_2048"></span>that the grievance and award concern classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5)." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin.</span>, 61 FLRA 634, 635 (2006) (quoting <span class="Italic">SEC</span>, 61 FLRA at 253).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has distinguished between two situations in assessing whether a grievance concerns the classification of a position.&#x2003;Where the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties permanently assigned to, and performed by, the grievant, the Authority finds that the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev., La. State Office, New Orleans, La</span>., 53 FLRA 1611, 1616 (1998). However, where the substance of the grievance concerns whether the grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion under a collective bargaining agreement by reason of having performed the established duties of a higher-graded position, the Authority has long held that the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, the stipulated issue was whether the Agency violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement when it denied the grievants promotions to CLD 4. There is no evidence that the Arbitrator considered whether the grievants were entitled to temporary promotions under the collective bargaining agreement. The Arbitrator considered solely whether the grievants were entitled to permanent, retroactive promotions from CLD 3 to CLD 4 based on the performance of the duties assigned to the grievants' permanent positions. This is evidenced by the Arbitrator's award directing that the grievants "shall be promoted to CLD 4[,]" effective, respectively, as of the date the first grievant accepted the change of duty to his position, and as of the date the second grievant's position designation was changed from 801 General Engineer to 805 Electrical Engineer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Authority precedent, the substance of the grievance concerned whether the grievants were entitled to permanent promotions based on the grade level of the duties permanently assigned to, and performed by, the grievants and not whether they were entitled to temporary promotions under the parties' collective bargaining agreement for performing previously classified duties of higher-graded positions. As such, the grievances involve classification matters within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute and is excluded from the grievance procedure.[5] <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 987</span>, 58 FLRA 453, 454-55 (2003) (grievance seeking permanent promotion involved classification); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2142</span>, 51 FLRA 1140, 1142 (1996) (grievance involving performance of duties assigned to permanent position involved classification).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;As the grievance concerns classification, it is irrelevant whether the grievants sought noncompetitive promotions. Indeed, under applicable government-wide regulations, a reclassification <span class="Italic">is</span> a noncompetitive promotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(2)(i), "Noncompetitive actions." ("A promotion resulting from the upgrading of a position without significant change in the duties and responsibilities due to issuance of a new classification standard or the correction of an initial classification error" is not subject to competitive procedures).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to resolve the merits of the grievance and set aside the award. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2142</span>, 61 FLRA 194, 196 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and PASS</span>, 62 FLRA 519 (2008) (setting aside award, as involving a classification matter, that granted permanent promotions based on assignment of higher-level duties to grievants' positions); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Redstone Arsenal and AFGE Local 1858</span>, 73 FLRA 210 (2022) (grievance concerned classification and was not arbitrable when it sought permanent promotion based on assignment of additional duties). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-010.html#sec9-11">Classification</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-17-014.html#sec9-15">Constructive Demotion</a>," and to <span class="Italic">Russell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 698, 6 MSPB 585 (1981), and to "<a href="0100-2023-17-012.html#sec9-13">Claim for Back Pay, Promotion</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">If the claim is that the employee performed higher-level duties in a position that was classified, an award of back pay will not be set aside on the ground that the arbitrator has reclassified the lower-level position held by the grievant, <span class="Italic">Lexington Blue Grass Army Depot and IAM Local 859</span>, 32 FLRA 256, 257-59 (1988):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the vehicle operated by the grievant, a modified scoop loader, was in fact heavy equipment. He also found that the operation of that type of equipment is included in the position description of the Engineering Equipment Operator, WG-10, and not in the position description of the Motor Vehicle Operator, WG-8. He further found that the grievant had operated the scoop loader and that he had not been properly compensated for operating WG-10 heavy equipment. He concluded that the Agency violated the collective bargaining agreement when it refused to compensate the grievant at the WG-10 rate of compensation, the rate normally paid to operators of oversized equipment. Thus, he ordered that the grievant be compensated for the work in question at the overtime rate of a WG-10 employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the grievant's classification was not the issue in this case. The classification of a position, as defined in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c), involves "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it under a class under the position classification plan established by OPM under Chapter 51 of title 5 of the United States Code." A position is defined in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(e) as "the work, consisting of the duties and responsibilities, assigned by competent authority for performance by an employee."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant did not claim that his position should be reclassified because he performed duties of a higher grade.&#x2003;The grievant merely requested compensation at the higher rate of pay for the times he performed the duties of the WG-10 position. The Arbitrator did not reclassify the grievant as a WG-10, rather the Arbitrator merely interpreted the position descriptions and duties of the WG-10 and WG-8 positions as classified by the Agency....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we conclude that the grievance at issue pertained to whether the grievant should have been compensated at the higher rate of pay during the times he performed the duties of the WG-10 position. The grievance did not concern the classification of a position....</p>
<p class="noindent">If the question is whether the grievant should have been placed into a GS-7 position that was offered and accepted rather than the GS-6 position that was actually assigned, the arbitrator could direct retroactive placement into the GS-7 job to remedy a contract violation without becoming involved in a classification dispute, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 65 FLRA 1017, 1020-21 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 7121(c)(5) </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5), a grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee" is removed from the scope of the negotiated grievance procedures. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, Nw. Div., Portland, Or.</span>, 59 FLRA 443, 445 (2003) (<span class="Italic">Army</span>). The Authority has viewed the meaning of "classification" under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) in the context of 5 C.F.R. chapter 511. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.101(c) defines classification of a position as "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by OPM under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." Under the system established by OPM, classification entails the identification of the appropriate title, series, grade, and pay system of a position. <span class="Italic">See Army</span>, 59 FLRA at 445 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.701(a)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the essential nature of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties assigned to and performed by the grievant in his or her permanent position, the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of HUD</span>, 65 FLRA 433, 435 (2011) (<span class="Italic">HUD</span>). In addition, a grievance concerns classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) if it contends that the grievant's permanent position warrants a change in its journeyman level or promotion potential. <span class="Italic">Id. See also U.S. DoL</span>, 63 FLRA 216, 218 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, a grievance that alleges a right to be placed in previously classified positions does not concern classification. <span class="Italic">See HUD</span>, 65 FLRA at 436. Similarly, a grievance alleging that an agency failed to promote a grievant under a competitive procedure does not concern classification matters. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In this regard, the Authority has held that where an arbitrator determines that a grievant is entitled to a career-ladder, temporary, or other noncompetitive promotion based on previously classified duties, the award does not concern a classification matter. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of HUD, Wash., D.C.</span>, 59 FLRA 630, 631 (2004); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of HHS, Nat'l Inst. for Occupational Safety &#x0026; Health, Cincinnati Operations, Cincinnati, Ohio</span>, 52 FLRA 217, 221 (1996). Further, a grievance concerning a delay in receiving a career-ladder promotion does not concern classification. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of HUD</span>, 47 FLRA 1053, 1061 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, there is no dispute that the journeyman level of the grievants' positions is GS-7. In addition, the grievance did not challenge the journeyman level of the positions or require the Arbitrator to assess the grade level of the duties assigned to and performed by the grievants in those positions. Instead, it argued that the Agency erred by processing the grievants' paperwork, and paying them, at the GS-6 level, rather than the full journeyman level of GS-7. As such, the grievance is more analogous to a grievance alleging a right to be placed in a previously classified GS-7 position, or a grievance challenging a delay in a career-ladder promotion, than it is to a grievance alleging that a position is improperly classified. Accordingly, we find that the grievance did not involve classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5), and we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.604(b) </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.604(b) provides, in pertinent part, that "[c]andidates for advancement to a position at GS-6 through GS-11 must have completed a minimum of [fifty-two] weeks in positions...[n]o more than one grade lower (or equivalent) when the position to be filled is in a line of work properly classified at [one]grade intervals[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.604(b)(2). The Agency asserts that the award is contrary to this regulation because the record evidence does not support a conclusion that the grievants were qualified for promotions to the GS-7 level at the time they were hired.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2049"></span>Even assuming that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.604(b) applies to the hiring of the grievants, the Arbitrator found that the evidence supported a conclusion that the grievants were qualified at the GS-7 level when they were hired, and that the Consultant had made such a determination. The Agency provides no basis for concluding that the Arbitrator erred in making these findings. Thus, the premise of the Agency's exception regarding 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.604(b) is incorrect, and we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The BPA </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of backpay is authorized under the BPA when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army, Headquarters, I Corps &#x0026; Fort Lewis, Fort Lewis, Wash.</span>, 65 FLRA 699, 703 (2011). A violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the BPA. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the parties' agreement, which supports a conclusion that the Agency committed an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>Although the Agency argues that its action was not unjustified or unwarranted because it was complying with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(3), which requires the Agency to comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.604(b), we have rejected the Agency's claim that the award is contrary to 300.604(b). As such, the premise of the Agency's claim--that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.604(b) compelled the Agency's action--is unfounded.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether the violation resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievants' pay, allowances, or differentials, the Agency argues that the grievants did not suffer such a loss because they were never paid at the GS-7 level. However, the Arbitrator found that the Agency improperly "downgraded" the grievants from GS-7 to GS-6. Thus, he implicitly found that, but for the Agency's improper action, the grievants would have been paid at the GS-7 level. This finding supports a conclusion that the violation resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievants' pay, allowances, or differentials.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although recent decisions suggest greater liberality in raising jurisdictional exceptions, the agency should protect its position by making its position known to both the arbitrator and to FLRA on exceptions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Dugway Proving Ground and NAGE Local R14-9</span>, 57 FLRA 224, 227 (2001) (if agency does not raise classification issue before arbitrator in promotion case, agency barred from doing so in exceptions).
