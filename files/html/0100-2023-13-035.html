<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-36"><span class="space">b.</span> Deceit; Misrepresentation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The voluntariness of a resignation need not be measured against a test <span id="Page_1941"></span>requiring duress or coercion. Deceit alone is enough. Nor is there a requirement that the employee be intentionally deceived about his options. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Essman v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 71 MSPR 107, 109 (1996) ("The misleading information can be negligently or even innocently provided; if the employee materially relies on such information to her detriment, based on an objective evaluation of surrounding circumstances, her [resignation] is considered involuntary."); <span class="Italic">Lary v. OPM</span>, 65 MSPR 291, 304 (1994) (suggesting that a resignation may be involuntary if the appellant depends on the agency to correctly assess her eligibility for a known retirement benefit refund, the agency incorrectly notifies OPM of the retirement system applicable to the appellant, and, as a result, OPM is unable to provide the amount of the refund that the appellant expected); <span class="Italic">Gordon v. VA</span>, 28 MSPR 258, 259 n.2 (1985) (citing <span class="Italic">Covington</span> and <span class="Italic">Scharf</span>, discussed in the section on involuntary retirement). The information provided by the agency must be correct in nature and adequate in scope to allow the employee to make an informed choice. The agency is required to correct any erroneous information if it has reason to know that the employee is relying on that information. <span class="Italic">Powers v. VA</span>, 43 MSPR 626, 630 (1990) (relying on <span class="Italic">Wills v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 137, 141 (1988)) ("[T]he appellant did not have to allege that he was affirmatively misinformed or that he specifically spoke to agency officials about whether the notation would appear on the SF-50. We find that the appellant raised a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness when he averred that, because of a lack of information, he was not fully informed concerning his decision to retire with a clean record.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The error or omission must, under <span class="Italic">Powers</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, be material; it must have been the object of reasonable reliance. It was not materially misleading that a personnel specialist did not specifically advise the appellant, who was considering resignation, of Board appeal rights. The Board determined from the circumstances that the employee was aware of avenues of redress for various adverse employment actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Holland v. FDIC</span>, 112 Fed. Appx. 733, 735 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP) (allegedly incorrect information concerning retirement options did not influence the appellant's decision to resign); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-14-0098-I-1 (NP 7/8/2014) (agency did not mislead the appellant when it informed him that if he did not return to work, the agency would propose his removal but the agency did not provide the appellant retirement counseling: "And, because the letter merely cautioned him that an action would be proposed (at some undefined future date) if he did not report for duty on a regular basis and he resigned on his own initiative shortly thereafter, we fail to discern an obligation on the agency's part to set forth the appellant's retirement options, regardless of any particular stress the appellant was under.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Drummonds v. VA</span>, 58 MSPR 579, 583-84 (1993), the appellant resigned after the agency failed to correct his misunderstanding that he could appeal his resignation. The agency's failure to correct the appellant's erroneous belief, known to the agency before the effective date of the resignation, made the resignation involuntary:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee-initiated action such as a resignation or retirement is presumed to be voluntary, and is not appealable to the Board, unless the appellant establishes that the action was obtained through duress or coercion or shows that a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 941-42 (Fed. Cir. 1984). A resignation is considered to be involuntary not only when it results from an agency's affirmative misrepresentation, but also if it results from the agency's failure to correct erroneous information that it has reason to know an employee is relying on. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Army</span>, 44 MSPR 449, 451 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's contention that he believed he could still appeal his demotion and reassignment after resigning is corroborated on the face of his memorandum of resignation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;I resign my position as Veterans Benefits Counselor with the Department of Veterans Affairs effective at close of business, November 30, 1990.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;The decision to demote and transfer will be appealed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This memorandum was received in the agency's Personnel Office on November 21, nine days before the effective date of the appellant's resignation. The initial decision suggests that it was too late for the agency to correct the appellant's mistaken belief once he had submitted his resignation. This is incorrect; the submission of a resignation, to become effective at some future date, is ordinarily not an irrevocable action. An agency must allow an employee to withdraw a resignation at any time before it becomes effective unless it has a valid reason for refusing to allow the withdrawal and explains that reason to the employee. 5 CFR 715.202(b). The agency thus had a duty to inform the appellant that he would not be able to appeal his demotion and reassignment if his resignation became effective, and that he was entitled to withdraw his resignation prior to its effective date. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 44 MSPR at 454. As the agency presented no evidence that it so informed the appellant, we conclude that his resignation was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Drummonds, supra</span>, 58 MSPR at 584-85, modified the jurisdictional model for analysis of procedural improprieties claimed as to resignations resulting from procedurally defective advice--the claim in <span class="Italic">Drummonds</span> being that the appellant resigned when the agency led him to believe that he could appeal an agency decision to demote and reassign him after he resigned from his position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the past, the Board has reversed an employee's involuntary resignation or retirement on the basis that it is tantamount to a removal, that the individual did not receive any of the procedural protections required by 5 USC 7513, and that the removal action therefore resulted from harmful error in violation of 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hammond v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 644, 649 (1987), <span class="Italic">modified in part on other grounds</span>, 50 MSPR 174 (1991); <span class="Italic">McBeen v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 27 MSPR 207, 211 (1985). This rationale must be reexamined in light of the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672 (1991), which prescribed a two-step approach to allegations of agency procedural error. An administrative judge must first determine whether the agency's action comported with the minimum procedures that satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process of law under <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed.2d 494 (1985), and whether the action is lawful in its entirety<span class="Italic">. Stephen</span>, 47 MSPR at 685. The action must be reversed if it does not meet both of these requirements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If it does meet these requirements, the administrative judge should then consider whether the action should be reversed for "harmful error" under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, an agency's failure to provide a nonprobationary Federal employee with prior notice and an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an agency action appealable to the Board, deprives him of his property right in his employment and constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 470 U.S. at 546, 105 S. Ct. at 1495; <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, 47 MSPR at 680. The appellant in the instant case was given notice of, and an opportunity to respond to, a demotion action. His involuntary resignation constituted a constructive removal, however, and the appellant was given no notice of, or an opportunity to respond to, a removal action. We therefore find that the agency violated the appellant's due process rights in separating him pursuant to the resignation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Porter v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining issue is whether the AJ correctly found that the appellant's resignation was involuntary and therefore tantamount to a removal. A retirement action is involuntary if the agency made misleading statements upon which the employee reasonably relied to his detriment. <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1574-75 (Fed. Cir. 1983). After considering the hearing testimony, the AJ concluded that the appellant agreed to resign only after objecting to her termination and being told by agency officials that she had no Board appeal rights. Thus, when the appellant was deciding whether to resign or face imminent termination, she was making that decision with the agency's false information regarding her appeal rights. "A decision made 'with blinders on,' based on misinformation or a lack of information, cannot be binding as a matter of fundamental fairness and due process." <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 943 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Gutierrez v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 171, 183 (2003) (McPhie, Board Member, separate opinion) (where the agency incorrectly informed the appellant that he had no appeal rights to the Board, the appellant was not merely given a choice between unpleasant alternatives, but rather a choice between false alternatives).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency emphasizes that the information it provided to the appellant was "factually and legally correct at the time it was provided. Indeed, the appellant resigned in February 2002 and the Federal Circuit issued <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> in October 2002. Prior to <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, it was considered well established that a probationary employee in the competitive service had no statutory right of appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g,</span> <span class="Italic">Von Deneen v. Department of Transportation</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 420, 422, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 837 F.2d 1098 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table). Nevertheless, the appellant is not required to show that the agency actually intended to deceive her into resigning. As the Federal Circuit has explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee is not required to show an intent to deceive on the part of the agency in order for his retirement [or resignation] to be held involuntary. Rather, it is sufficient if the employee shows that a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency's statements.... Applying this test, the court will neither inquire into the subjective perceptions of the employee, nor the subjective intentions of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Scharf</span>, 710 F.2d at 1575. It is clear that that agency misled the appellant by informing her that she had no appeal rights and that the appellant justifiably relied on this misleading advice to her detriment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board concludes that the appellant's resignation was involuntary, the Board not only has jurisdiction, but the appellant also wins on the merits and is entitled to reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, <span id="Page_1942"></span>810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (the Board's jurisdiction and the merits of an alleged involuntary separation are inextricably intertwined). Thus, the AJ correctly reversed the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Gutierrez v. USPS</span>, 90 MSPR 604, 608 &#x00B6; 9 (2002) (resignation may be involuntary if an agency incorrectly tells an employee that he would not have appeal rights from a removal, leading the employee to resign: "a choice between false alternatives can support a finding that the decision to resign was involuntary").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without mention of <span class="Italic">Porter</span> or <span class="Italic">Guiterrez,</span> <span class="Italic">O'Brien v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> DC-0752-12-0100-I-1 (NP 10/31/2012), decided that the appellant did not make out a case of involuntary resignation through misleading information when the agency advised her, at the onset of a PIP, that she would not have Board appeal rights at the conclusion of the PIP process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether a resignation or retirement is voluntary, the fact finder must examine the surrounding circumstances to test the ability of the employee to exercise free choice. <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1983). One means by which an appellant may overcome the presumption that her resignation or retirement was voluntary is by showing that it was obtained as a result of agency misinformation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1574-75. To do so, the appellant must show: (1) that the agency made misleading statements; and (2) that the appellant reasonably relied on the misinformation to her detriment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1575; <span class="Italic">Salazar v. Department of the Army</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 296, &#x00B6; 9 (2010). We need not decide whether the appellant raised a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency provided her with misinformation regarding her Board appeal rights because we find based on the totality of the undisputed circumstances that she failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that she reasonably and materially relied on the alleged misinformation to her detriment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The uncontested facts show that the appellant had worked for several agencies and was most recently appointed as a Contract Data Analyst for the agency's Office of Financial Stability effective February 28, 2010. As a result of the agency's finding that the appellant's performance was deficient over several months, the agency placed the appellant on a 90-day performance improvement plan (PIP) for the period of October 28, 2010, through January 28, 2011. The appellant asserted that, at the commencement of the PIP period, she had determined based on alleged agency misinformation that she did not have Board appeal rights regarding her possible PIP-based removal. On December 7, 2010, the appellant began the equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint process regarding the agency's treatment of her and the fact that "the Agency was trying to force me out."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the appellant's speculation that she would fail the PIP and that the agency would then initiate a PIP-based removal action, the appellant submitted a January 27, 2011 letter of resignation, one day prior to the expiration of the 90-day PIP period, which she was subsequently allowed to convert to a retirement under the Federal Employees' Retirement System. The appellant has acknowledged that, "[t]hinking I would not have the right to appeal my removal before the MSPB, I resigned my position to avoid removal from the federal service, to preserve my eligibility for future government employment, and to avoid being subject to false claims of poor performance." After resigning, the appellant continued with the EEO complaint process through a formal mixed-case complaint filed on February 3, 2011, in which she alleged that she was "forced to resign," and she requested "back pay from January 27, 2011 onward, and reinstatement to a GS-14 or GS-15 position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the appellant's bare assertion that she would not have retired if she had not been misinformed regarding her Board appeal rights, the appellant failed to allege any facts to show that the agency could not have properly taken a removal action as a result of her deficient performance under the PIP. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Terban v. Department of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (noting that the appellant had the burden to show that the agency lacked the authority or sufficient reason to threaten to take the potential personnel action). By resigning "to avoid removal from the federal service, to preserve [her] eligibility for future government employment, and to avoid being subject to false claims of poor performance," she was also able to obtain review of her separation from service through the EEOC mixed-case complaint process. Thus, we find that the appellant failed to allege facts that would show that agency's alleged misadvice had any material effect on her decision to resign or that she reasonably relied on the agency's alleged misadvice to her detriment. Further, the appellant's own anticipation that the agency would propose to remove her is not evidence of coercion on the part of the agency. The agency had not even proposed to remove the appellant at the time she resigned. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 15, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 469 F. App'x 852 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Holman v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 9 M.S.P.R. 218, 220 (1981), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 703 F.2d 584 (Fed. Cir. 1982) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gibeault v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 114 MSPR 664, 667-68 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9, 2010 MSPB 195 (2010), remanded for a hearing on the appellant's assertion that when he was given the choice between resignation and removal, he would essentially be barred from future federal employment if he were removed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As noted, the appellant in this case submitted an affidavit in which he set forth statements that the agency made upon which he allegedly relied in determining to resign and which he asserts were misleading. Specifically, he stated that he was told that he was going to be terminated and that, if he fought the action, he would not be eligible for future employment with the government.<span class="Italic"></span> While an individual who has been removed may not be viewed as favorably as other candidates, he is not <span class="Italic">per se</span> ineligible for future employment with the government. Moreover, the statement in question does not allow for the possibility that the individual might successfully challenge the adverse action. In fact, according to the appellant's affidavit, he was not told that he had a right to have an impartial third party, that is, the Board, review the action.<span class="Italic"></span> Similarly, the appellant stated that he was told that, if he resigned immediately, he would be eligible for future employment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The administrative judge found that, under such circumstances, the appellant would have a "clean" record, whereas if he waited until after the agency issued a proposal notice, the record would reflect that he resigned pending an adverse action, and that such a notation would severely hamper the appellant's efforts to secure employment with the Federal government. Even if the agency placed such a notation in the appellant's record, it is not a certainty that his efforts to be reemployed would necessarily be thwarted. As part of its hiring process, a new agency might deem it appropriate to inquire as to the circumstances surrounding his resignation and to consider the information he provided by way of explanation. Moreover, the appellant stated that he was not told that the agency was, at that time, only contemplating a proposal to remove him, nor that, if such a proposal was issued, he would have a right to respond to it. As stated previously, the agency offered nothing to contest the appellant's statements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, we find that the appellant has alleged that, by these statements, the agency provided him with, if not incorrect, then at least misleading or incomplete, information as to his options. That is so regardless of whether the agency was aware that its statements were misleading. <span class="Italic">See Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984). We further find that the appellant alleged that, as a long-time employee who had never been disciplined, he reasonably relied upon those statements in concluding that he had no real choice but to immediately resign, which he did. In light of these allegations, supported by the appellant's affidavit, we find that he raised a nonfrivolous allegation that his resignation was involuntary based on misleading statements, and that he is therefore entitled to a hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Spearman v. MSPB</span>, 530 Fed. Appx. 936, 938 (Fed.

Department of Transportation</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 203, 208-09 (finding that the agency's failure to advise an employee of an inapplicable policy and that he would have appeal rights if his demotion were involuntary did not render his acceptance of the demotion involuntary), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 837 F.2d 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table). Likewise, the fact that the appellant resigned in lieu of obtaining a final draft of the termination letter did not cause his resignation to be coerced. He had the choice to wait until the agency issued the termination letter to fight it, but he instead chose to resign. Once the appellant resigned, there no longer was any need for the agency to complete the termination letter."). <span class="Italic">But cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Aurandt v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 53 MSPR 591, 597 (1992) (agency should not set the date of the resignation, since it is the employee's option; a resignation may be involuntary if the agency in essence sets the date and if it does so after failing to comply with its own regulations governing a grant of leave requested by an employee).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A resignation was not involuntary because an agency official opined to the appellant that the agency case would be sustained by the Board, <span class="Italic">Scott v. DHS,</span> SF-0752-15-0643-I-1 (NP 2/25/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued below that the facts asserted in the proposed removal were inaccurate and incomplete. He also alleged that when the proposing official presented him with the proposed removal, he told the appellant that he "should not be fighting [the] case because [the proposing official] knew that the MSPB would rule against [the <span id="Page_1943"></span>appellant]." The appellant argued that the aforementioned statement was misleading and coercive, causing him to resign. He reasserts the argument on review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In addition, although the appellant argues that he relied upon the proposing official's statement concerning the likelihood of him succeeding in a Board appeal, we disagree with the assertion that the statement rendered his resignation involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The test for involuntariness is an objective one, requiring the appellant to show that a reasonable employee in the same circumstances would have felt coerced into resigning or retiring. <span class="Italic">Conforto v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 713 F.3d 1111, 1121 (Fed. Cir. 2013). In this case, the allegedly coercive statement amounts to little more than the proposing official's opinion that the agency had a strong case. We are not persuaded that a reasonable employee under the same circumstances would have felt coerced into resigning due to that off-hand comment. This is especially so given the fact that the appellant had his own attorney representative to consult about the matter, an attorney who prepared a detailed response to the proposal, extensively citing Board precedent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances, the appellant may have faced an unpleasant choice, but he has failed to meet his burden of nonfrivolously alleging that his resignation was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (stating that the fact that an employee faces an unpleasant choice of either resigning or facing removal for cause does not render his decision involuntary). We therefore affirm the administrative judge's decision, dismissing the involuntary resignation appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A resignation is involuntary if it is based on an agency promise that the agency actually did not intend to fulfill. <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 136, 141 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 983 F.2d 226 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">It is not uncommon for an employee to be hired with general promises of advancement. When those promises are not fulfilled, the disappointed employee may resign. Do the promises constitute sufficient deceit to warrant reversal of the resignation? The Board addressed the problem in <span class="Italic">Filliben v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 31, 32-35 (1987), and also noted that a resignation is not necessarily invalid if an appellant is not advised of appeal rights. Under <span class="Italic">Filliben</span>, there must be a material and reasonable reliance on the agency action or inaction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant alleged that when he was hired in January of 1984 [as a GS-7 Management Analyst], the agency indicated that it would convert him to a permanent GS-12 position as an Industrial Engineer in October of 1984 (a new fiscal year). He also claimed that after further discussions with, and promises from, his superiors, he expected his position to be reclassified various times in 1985 and by the spring of 1986. The appellant also asserted that in a February 1986 meeting with the new Director of Industrial Engineering, he was told that he would be laid off, either by the spring of 1986 or no later than December of that year, and that the Director saw no future for him.... [S]ubsequently, he unwillingly gave two weeks' notice and resigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The crux of the appellant's argument is that he was told that he would be reclassified, or promoted, for over a year and a half, and that he was never advised he could file a grievance or in any way object to the agency's action, or inaction. The appellant claims he was told he had no appeal right as a temporary employee, and in effect, was given the "run-around." We are not persuaded, however, that the appellant's resignation was involuntarily extracted through coercion or duress, or significant misinformation, as to be within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant expected a reassignment and pursued it to no avail. In addition to coercion or duress as a test for an involuntary action, a resignation is involuntary if it is obtained by agency misinformation or deception.... The measure is whether a reasonable person would have been misled.... The notification of appeal rights or the lack of such notification, however, is not relevant to the determination of whether the resignation action was involuntary....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant maintains that his resignation was involuntary because the agency told him that as a temporary employee he had no right to file a classification appeal, we disagree.... The appellant has not shown that he materially relied on the agency's erroneous information in this regard, particularly in view of his asserted extensive education and professional experience. As a reasonable person, the appellant has not established he was so misled by the agency's statement that he had no right to file a classification appeal, or that this information was so pivotal to his decision to resign as to render his resignation involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The focus in an alleged involuntary resignation is on the circumstances immediately preceding the appellant's action.... [T]he appellant stated...that the new Director...informed him that he was going to be laid off either by the spring of 1986 or no later than December of 1986; that his work level and assignments would be at the GS-7 level; that the Director saw no future for the appellant in the department. The appellant later variously stated that he would not accept a "demotion" of job responsibilities, and "with his back to the wall," he resigned...and also, that when he was finally going to be "stripped" of his professional responsibilities and "reduced to performing tasks as a GS-7, he drew the line and involuntarily resigned."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's decision to resign was not "with blinders on," based on misinformation or lack of information...but rather based on personal concerns regarding his professional standing and status....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[R]ather than resigning...he could have remained in his GS-7 position and been separated at the expiration of his temporary appointment.... Even if the appellant subjectively believed that management officials were unresponsive to his situation, he has not established that circumstances were so intolerable or his continued employment under the terms of the appointment so untenable, that the agency's actions rose to the level that his apparently voluntary action was actually coerced.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 88 MSPR 169, 174-75 &#x00B6; 12 (2001) (appellant should have received a jurisdictional hearing on nonfrivolous allegations of the denial of advancement and placement following the successful completion of a training program).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A resignation is involuntary if the employee conditions it on the agency's promise to provide him a clean record and the agency then reneges on its pledge by annotating his SF-50 to show that the resignation was submitted while adverse action was proposed against the employee. If the agency agrees to settle a disputed personnel matter by agreeing to omit adverse notations in the personnel record of an individual who, because of the agreement, resigns rather than faces and fights removal, the employee should not be expected to uphold his end of the bargain if the agency fails to abide by the promise it expressly made as a condition for the resignation. A contrary result would not favor the policy of settlement of personnel disputes. The provisions of the (now defunct) Federal Personnel Manual regarding annotation of SF-50 forms in resignation were only guidance to agencies and did not negate the involuntary nature of the resignation. As to the harmfulness of the error, it was within an appreciable range of probability that the agency would not have removed the appellant for 19 minutes of AWOL had he appealed from a removal action. The Board did not expressly hold, however, that it would review the merits of the proposed personnel action to determine whether it would sanction a resignation made through an agreement that the agency failed to meet. <span class="Italic">Carter v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Freeborn v. DOJ</span>, 119 MSPR 290, 295, 296-97 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13, 15, 2013 MSPB 23 (2013), set aside a resignation as involuntary when a correctional facility warden explained to the appellant that he had the choice of resigning without blemish to his record to avoid an immediate 10-day suspension. The warden did not clarify <span id="Page_1944"></span>the employee's confusion as to the difference between home leave, a nonduty but paid status imposed during an investigation, and a suspension without pay, and the warden did not explain to the employee that a suspension was only a possibility, not a certainty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These questions by the appellant at the time of his resignation establish by preponderant evidence that he believed that he was being disciplined by means of a "suspension," and that he decided to immediately resign because he did not want a disciplinary suspension in his personnel file. This testimony reflects incorrect information upon which the appellant was relying that was not corrected by the warden or anyone else at the agency. If the appellant had been placed in a home duty status instead of resigning, there would still not have been a disciplinary suspension in his file. In this regard, the warden testified that home duty status is nondisciplinary and that, before issuing a disciplinary suspension, the agency would have to issue a written notice of proposed discipline before any discipline would take place.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the above testimony demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant erroneously believed that he needed to resign to avoid having a disciplinary suspension placed in his personnel file, that the warden was aware of this erroneous belief, and that the warden did not correct this erroneous belief. The warden did not, for example, inform the appellant that if he did not resign, i.e., even if the agency placed him in a home duty status, he would not have a disciplinary suspension in his record because no such discipline had been proposed, nor had an administrative investigation taken place. Thus, we find that the appellant has shown that his resignation was involuntary and therefore tantamount to a forced removal within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a PS-3 Custodial Laborer with the U.S. Postal Service in Memphis, Tennessee, resigned from his position for personal reasons effective February 22, 2005. Subsequently, the appellant made several requests for reinstatement beginning in February 2006. The agency denied the appellant's requests to return to work on August 23, 2006, stating that the appellant's former supervisor recommended that the appellant not be rehired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his November 14, 2006 appeal, the appellant alleged, in pertinent part, that "I was told that there would not be a problem when I got ready to be reinstated to my USPS position....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant asserted that:</p>

Also my Human Resource Representative told me that I could resign and that I could return with no problem. I resigned because of theses [sic] promises.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One means by which an appellant may rebut the presumption of voluntariness is by presenting sufficient evidence to show that his resignation was based on agency-supplied misinformation. In particular, a resignation is involuntary if the agency made misleading statements upon which the employee reasonably relied to his detriment. <span class="Italic">Scharf</span>, 710 F.2d at 1574-75. The appellant, however, need not show that the agency intentionally misled him. <span class="Italic">Covington</span>, 750 F.2d at 942. That is, the agency could have provided the misleading information negligently or even innocently; if the appellant materially relied on the misinformation to his detriment, his resignation is considered involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's submissions below suggest that his resignation was involuntary because, before he resigned, he received assurances from his supervisors and a Human Resources representative that he would be rehired when he had resolved his personal issues. The appellant also indicates that he relied to his detriment upon these "promises." Taking these allegations as true, they present a non-frivolous allegation that the appellant's resignation for personal reasons was involuntary based upon agency-supplied misinformation. <span class="Italic">See Tanner v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 12 (2003) (a resignation may be involuntary based upon misinformation relating to the appellant's reinstatement rights that the agency provided to him when he resigned).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee who alleges that he resigned rather than challenge a RIF because he was not properly informed of related job placement rights should receive a hearing on whether the resignation was obtained by duress or coercion, or whether a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency statements or omissions. <span class="Italic">Bingham v. DHHS</span>, 20 MSPR 165, 167 (1984). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Barajas v.

USDA</span>, 14 MSPR 497, 498 (1983) (resignation was not involuntary because the agency RIF notice provided information to the appellant concerning resignation as an option available to him). If the appellant alleges that he resigned right before a RIF and did so due to misleading information or omissions regarding transfer of function rights, he is entitled to a hearing on the voluntariness of his resignation. <span class="Italic">Rafferty v. DHHS</span>, 22 MSPR 4, 5 (1984). If an appellant resigns after being misinformed by an agency official that he could resign before the effective date of the RIF and still appeal the RIF, his resignation can be deemed an appealable constructive removal brought about by agency misrepresentation. <span class="Italic">Perez v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/PEREZ_RAY_A_DC_0752_98_0846_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248409.pdf">86 MSPR 168</a>, 170 &#x00B6; 6 (2000). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DOD,</span> CH-0351-14-0649-I-1 (NP 4/9/2015) (resignation was not involuntary when, after the appellant learned of a RIF she signed a contract of employment with an outside company, but the agency canceled the RIF and the appellant knew of the cancelation when she resigned: she was faced with an unpleasant choice but she was not misled). [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-17-001.html#sec10-1">Chapter 10</a>, concerning reductions in force.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee was entitled to a hearing based on assertions that the agency misled her as to a promise to provide consideration to her, before the effective date of a resignation, for any job in a different location (the site where her husband, also an agency employee, was being reassigned), and who was dissuaded from attempting to withdraw her resignation before its effective date, <span class="Italic">Levy v. DHS</span>, 109 MSPR 444, 451-52 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18, 2008 MSPB 174 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant's primary argument is that her resignation was involuntary because: the agency knew she was resigning solely because it had directed the geographic reassignment of her husband to the MRO but had not also reassigned her; when she submitted her notice of resignation in April 2005 to be effective August 20, 2005, the agency promised her that she would be assigned to any vacancies in the MRO which arose prior to the effective date of her resignation; and the agency failed to inform and assign her to a vacancy that became available in and was filled in the MRO prior to the effective date of her resignation. The appellant asserts that the agency deliberately failed to inform and assign her to the MRO vacancy because she is a female and a parent; and she asserts that this discrimination is evident through: the agency's filling the MRO vacancy with a new male Special Agent; SAIC Murphy's comment to her husband to the effect of "a mother belongs at home with her children"; and SAIC Lindsay's comment to her that the agency was generous by allowing her to continue to work until her husband's transfer date. The appellant also asserts that she attempted to revoke her notice of resignation and instead request a period of LWOP, but that the agency denied her request and discouraged her from taking any further action concerning her pending resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge erred in dismissing this appeal for lack of a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction. The appellant's assertions that: (1) the agency told her she could remain at the HFO without her husband or resign from the agency to move with her husband; (2) the agency assured her that, if she elected to resign, it would assign her to any vacancies that arose in the MRO before her August 20, 2005 resignation became effective; and (3) her resignation was involuntary because the agency deliberately failed to inform her of, and assign her to, a vacancy which arose in the MRO prior to the effective date of her resignation, constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Paige</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 299, &#x00B6; 10 (the appellant raised a nonfrivolous allegation that his resignation was involuntary based on his assertions that he received assurances from the agency that he would be rehired when he had resolved his personal issues and his reliance on these promises to his detriment); <span class="Italic">Tanner v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 17 (2003) (a resignation may be involuntary based upon misinformation relating to the appellant's reinstatement rights that the agency provided to him when he resigned).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, an employee has a right to withdraw a resignation or a retirement at any time before it is effective, unless the agency has a valid reason for refusing to permit the withdrawal. <span class="Italic">Green v. General Services Administration</span>, 220 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2000); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 715.202(b). An employee's separation may be deemed involuntary, and therefore within the Board's jurisdiction, if the agency improperly denied his request to withdraw his resignation before its effective date. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. <span id="Page_1945"></span>Department of Defense</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 244, &#x00B6; 9 (2008); <span class="Italic">Berg v.

Thus, the appellant's assertions that the agency denied her request to revoke her resignation letter before its effective date and that the agency actively discouraged her from pursuing alternative options to resigning also constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation that her resignation was involuntary.

<p class="Body-Text">A resignation may be involuntary if it is based on incorrect information the employing agency provided to the appellant about his rights to a discontinued service annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gammill v.

Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 42, 43 n.* (1985) (resignation in lieu of an involuntary separation is not a forced resignation; the Federal Personnel Manual provisions concerning discontinued service retirement pertained only to an employee's entitlement to retirement and did not deal with the circumstances of an appeal that would be accepted for adjudication by the Board (citing <span class="Italic">McClure v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 19 MSPR 83 (1984))). <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 701 F.2d 36, 39-40 (5th Cir. 1983) (following remand, 19 MSPR 605 (1984)), explained as to a resignation that resulted from agency advice to the appellant that he could resign, appeal his RIF, and secure discontinued service retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations require that a party be informed of applicable rights. The record in this case does not indicate that Gonzalez was adequately so informed. Partly because of this failure and the lack of adequate notice to her as to the issue of the voluntariness of her resignation, we conclude that its voluntariness may not be presumed on the record before us and, therefore, remand is required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is true that a resignation is presumed to be voluntary, <span class="Italic">Christie</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 518 F.2d at 587, this presumption is negated by the facts shown in the record of the present case. Gonzalez filed an appeal with the Board immediately before she resigned, indicative of an intention on her part not to give up her right to appeal and also indicative that she was not informed that, by accepting an involuntary separation instead of "retiring," she could both continue her appeal and also receive discontinued retirement pay, which was the cumulative intended effect of her both appealing and also applying for such retirement pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the contentions of the Agency, the voluntariness of Gonzalez's resignation need not be measured against a rigid test requiring that she prove, as where "duress" is contended,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...(1) that one side involuntarily accepted the terms of another; (2) that circumstances permitted no other alternative; and (3) that said circumstances were the result of coercive acts of the opposite party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Christie</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 518 F.2d at 587; <span class="Italic">McGucken</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 407 F.2d at 1351.[3] On the contrary, this is a case in which her apparent ignorance of her rights creates a substantial question as to whether she was able to make a conscious choice at all between resigning and appealing. On the basis of the record before us, it appears that the Agency made no distinction between the two alternatives, notifying her only that she could do either and still receive the retirement annuity. This failure was in contravention of the applicable regulations requiring that the Agency give an employee adequate notice of "any applicable rights." 5 CFR 1201.21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;These cases dealt with employees who, knowing their alternatives, chose to resign and later asserted that their resignations had been involuntary as under duress<span class="Italic">. See also Coffman v. Bolger</span>, 590 F.2d 1366, 1368 (5th Cir. 1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This failure on the part of the Agency to inform Gonzalez (in addition to the other circumstances of this case--the appeal filed immediately before the resignation and the failure of the Board to inform of the basis for its jurisdictional concerns), casts sufficient doubt upon any presumption of the voluntariness of Gonzalez's resignation so that it does not, by itself, entitle the Board to presume the resignation was voluntary and, thereby, to refuse jurisdiction of this timely appeal and deny Gonzalez her timely-sought hearing as to the issues thereby raised. A federal employee who is unaware of the proper procedures to follow, due to her employer's failure to inform her sufficiently of her rights and remedies, may not be prejudiced by the employer's failure to comply with these requirements<span class="Italic">. See Broussard v. United States Postal Service</span>, 674 F.2d 1103, 1111 (5th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">McCormack v. United States</span>, 204 Ct. Cl. 371, 378 (1974).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Accordingly, we REVERSE the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board and REMAND for further proceedings to determine whether Gonzalez's resignation was intended to be voluntary upon an informed basis (rather than having been intended merely to be an application for discontinued employment retirement, without intention to moot her immediately prior appeal of the separation as involuntary). If the Board finds that no voluntary separation was intended, the Board shall determine the merits of her claim pursuant to her timely appeal and request for hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency gives the employee incorrect information about retirement options and the employee then resigns based on that information, the agency can avoid the involuntariness of the resignation by offering to reinstate the employee retroactively. Should the employee not accept that offer, the employee cannot later complain that the resignation was involuntary, <span class="Italic">Rocco v. USPS,</span> PH-0752-10-0049-I-1 (NP 10/28/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The documentary evidence indicates that the agency processed the appellant's resignation, which was to be effective October 31, 2009, on October 10, 2009, before it informed him that he was ineligible for the early-out incentive option. However, to the extent that the agency ever misled the appellant into believing that he was eligible for the early-out incentive option or that his resignation under that option was approved, the agency unequivocally cured any misrepresentation in the November 13, 2009 letter. The letter not only explained the reason for the appellant's ineligibility, but also explicitly, in bold print, notified the appellant that he could rescind his resignation by acting on or before November 24, 2009. It is undisputed that the appellant failed to respond to the November 13, 2009 letter, and thus his resignation became effective October 31, 2009.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">We add to the category of cases involving deceit or misrepresentation that rare case involving an individual who, during a retirement appeal, contends that he would have had sufficient creditable service for retirement if he had not been led to resign from a position by one or another suspect reason. The Board treats the tainted resignation arising during the retirement appeal by requiring the region to adjudicate the resignation issue by docketing a separate appeal against the employing agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Funesti v.

<p class="Body-Text">A resignation based on incorrect information, even if offered in good faith by an agency official, concerning the necessity of the resignation to continue health insurance coverage, may be involuntary. <span class="Italic">Wallendorf v.

<p class="Body-Text">A resignation may be involuntary if a tenured employee (who could appeal a termination) is incorrectly induced by the agency to believe that he is a probationer whose appeal rights are limited or nonexistent. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ward v.

<p class="Body-Text">If an employee resigns from one agency to take a job with another agency and if the employee is then terminated because of misrepresentation by the second agency that the employee was qualified to work there, the employee may be precluded from claiming an involuntary resignation from the first agency.

<p class="Body-Text">The decisions in this section assume some act by the agency, misleading or deceitful, that the appellant relies on as to a resignation. If the misrepresentation is from a union representative ostensibly acting on the appellant's behalf, an involuntary resignation is not made out, <span class="Italic">Green v. VA</span>, 112 MSPR 59, 64 &#x00B6; 9, 2009 MSPB 142 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted that he resigned after his union representative told him to do so because he might later get his job back or be rehired. (referring to the union president's "promise of being able to get my job back if I did in fact resign"). The appellant's assertions suggest that if he was misled it was by his union representative rather than by the agency. He claims that he "was compelled to not fight by the union" and that the union representative advised him that it "will be in your best int[e]rest...to resign, and maybe you will get your job back and return to work." While the appellant may feel that he was misled by the union representative, the union representative is not a representative of the agency and her acts cannot be imputed to the agency. The only allegation of coercion that can be attributed to the agency is an assertion that the proposing official, Robert Manness, notified the appellant on the effective date of <span id="Page_1946"></span>the removal that he needed to choose between resigning and being removed on that date. The appellant does not dispute that he was informed of the agency's decision to remove him on August 3, 2007, two weeks before the effective date of the removal, and the appellant states that he discussed his options with his union representative before he chose to resign. Therefore, the fact that Mr. Manness indicated to the appellant that he must choose between resigning and being removed on the effective date does not suggest that his resignation was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Schultz</span>, 810 F.2d at 1136-37.
