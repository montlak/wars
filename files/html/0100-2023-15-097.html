<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-96"><span class="space">1.</span> Conflicts; Improper Business Dealings</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee may not faithfully serve two masters with opposing or divergent interests. The government has an interest in ensuring that its agents and employees are not compromised in the performance of their duties as a result of outside influences. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR Part 2635 (2021); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 6 MSPR 84, 87, 6 MSPB 82 (1981), <span class="Italic">post</span>. To prove a conflict of interest, an agency must establish that its employee was acting in two separate capacities, at least one involving his official duties. The nature of his interests or duties in one capacity must have a direct and predictable effect on his interests or duties in his other capacity. A conflict charge will not be sustained for a conflict not specified in the agency's charges. <span class="Italic">Fontes v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 51 MSPR 655, 663 (1991). Under <span class="Italic">Ryan v. DHS,</span> 123 MSPR 202, 207-09 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13, 16-17, 2016 MSPB 7 (2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prove the existence of a conflict of interest, an agency must establish that its employee was acting in two separate capacities, at least one of which involved his official duties and that the nature of his interests or duties in one capacity had a "direct and predictable effect" on his interests or duties in his other capacity. <span class="Italic">Fontes v. Department of Transportation</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 655, 663 (1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2635.401-.402. To prove the existence of an appearance of a conflict of interest, an agency must show that the employee's interests or duties in one capacity would "reasonably create an appearance" of having an effect on his interests or duties in the other capacity. <span class="Italic">Fontes</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 664. If an employee knows that a matter is likely to have a direct and predictable effect on the financial interest of a member of his household or knows that a person with whom he has a covered relationship is a party to the matter, and the employee determines that the circumstances would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question his impartiality in the matter, the employee should not participate in the matter unless he has received authorization from the agency to participate. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.502(a). "A particular matter will have a direct effect on a financial interest if there is a close causal link" between the action to be taken in the matter and "any expected effect of the matter on the financial interest." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.402(b)(1). A particular matter will not have a direct effect on the financial interest "if the chain of causation is attenuated or is contingent upon the occurrence of events that are speculative or that are independent of...the matter." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Employees shall endeavor to avoid any actions creating the appearance that they are violating...ethical standards." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.101(b)(14). "Whether particular circumstances create an appearance that ethical standards have been violated shall be determined from the perspective of a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Fundamental fairness precludes disciplining an employee for creating the appearance of an ethical violation unless he should have known it would appear improper to a reasonable observer under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Nichols</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 445, 455 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cause under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 generally connotes some action or omission on the part of an employee. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). The Board consistently has found that creating the appearance of an ethical violation requires some action by the employee. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Burnett v. U.S. Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. 311, 313-15 (1982) (finding that the appellant created the appearance of using his public office for private gain by cashing checks belonging to a resident over a 1-year period); <span class="Italic">Moffer v. Department of the Interior</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. 453, 455-57 (1981) (finding that an employee created the appearance that he had used his public office for private gain by purchasing land from a prohibited seller), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 690 F.2d 1037 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence establishes that once the appellant began considering a future plan for TBA to participate in Government contracts related to call center service, he raised the matter with agency officials. However, there is insufficient evidence of any action taken by the appellant or TBA that would support a finding that his conduct created the appearance of a conflict of interest or the appearance that he lost his impartiality. <span class="Italic">Cf. Wilson v. Department of Justice</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 287, 297 (1995) (holding that charge of encouraging illegal sick leave use could not be sustained where there was no suggestion that the officer persuaded others to call <span id="Page_2591"></span>in sick or that anyone acted on his statements); <span class="Italic">Capozzella v. Federal Bureau of Investigation</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. 552, 557 (1982) (stating that a charge related solely to an employee's thought process cannot be considered misconduct). Because we have found insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the appellant took action to advance TBA's interest in bidding for call center or bilingual call center contracts prior to seeking advice from the agency's ethics counselor, we find that there is insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the appellant's actions created the appearance of a conflict of interest or the loss of impartiality.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal of an employee for conflict of interest is justified if an employee has an interest in a corporation having as its central purpose a function closely related to the appellant's duties, <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 6 MSPR 84, 87-89, 6 MSPB 82 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Government clearly has an interest in prohibiting such conduct, and in ensuring that its agents and employees are not compromised in the performance of their duties as a result of any outside influences.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That interest is reflected in decisions of federal courts holding that the removal of federal employees who have engaged in outside activities or accepted any gratuities which might call into question their undivided loyalty to the Government regarding the performance of their duties promotes the efficiency of the service. For example, in <span class="Italic">Womer v. Hampton,</span> 496 F.2d 99 (5th Cir. 1974), the removal of a supervisory inspector for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, who performed work for pay for government contractors on contracts which he was responsible to supervise, was upheld. In <span class="Italic">Heffron v. United States,</span> 405 F.2d 1307, 186 Ct. Cl. 474 (1968), the court upheld the removal of a contract administrator for the Department of Defense who upon being scheduled to be transferred, accepted a farewell gift from the contractor whose contracts he had been administering. <span class="Italic">See also Jones v. United States</span>, 617 F.2d 233, 223 Ct. Cl. 138 (1980). Similarly, in the current case, appellant's interest in a data processing company with which his agency did substantial business, conflicted with his position as a computer system administrator, and violated the Department of Interior regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant has also argued that regardless of any conflict of interest on his part, the punishment of removal was excessive. The Board decided in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280 (1981), that "the Board does have authority to mitigate penalties when the Board determines that the agency penalty is clearly excessive, disproportionate to the sustained charges, or arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 313, 5 MSPR 284. However, the Board is not free simply to substitute its judgment for that of management, which has the primary responsibility for maintenance of the productivity and discipline of the federal workforce. In view of the serious nature of appellant's wrongdoing, we do not believe that the agency's penalty was so excessive as to be unreasonable or arbitrary or capricious. In this regard, we believe it relevant to note the court's statement in <span class="Italic">Heffron</span> when it considered the severity of the penalty in that case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It may not be unreasonable, therefore, to believe that what is required is a combination of emphatic warnings and drastic penalties. If at times, as here, this results in tragically wrecking an honorable career for an infraction apparently not of the gravest, this is part of the price that must be paid to maintain the respect and the self-respect of our Government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">405 F.2d at 1313. Here it was made clear to appellant that he must divest his interest in CEI in order to be hired by the Department, and he had represented that he had done so. Therefore, in light of the government's compelling interest in avoiding conflicts of interest on the part of its employees, and in upholding the integrity of the federal service, appellant's argument that his punishment was too harsh must fail.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal was sustained of an employee, a supply technician, involved in a business selling to the prison commissary. The appellant's business partner approved government purchases for the prison commissary warehouse where the appellant and his business partner both worked. <span class="Italic">Deal v. DOJ</span>, 11 MSPR 370, 373 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lavelle v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 9 MSPR 234, 236 (1981) (contract negotiator, an attorney, was properly removed when he acted as the legal representative for a party engaged in a contract dispute with a company doing business with the appellant's agency); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Reynolds v. USDA</span>, 54 MSPR 111, 115 (1992) (employee's interaction with a relative in a business regulated by the agency).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A government investigator sold (and then refused to divest) the exclusive interview rights concerning his participation in a significant, highly publicized investigation. The exclusivity might have denied information even to his employer concerning aspects of the investigation; the conflict was considered to be clear, <span class="Italic">Ferrone v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 797 F.2d 962, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the whole, it appears that the legal relationship of government investigators to the story of their own investigations is one of an obligation to keep the lip buttoned, until the proper authorized time and place, rather than one of a right to exploit dramatic histories by sale of stories to the media at the investigator's option.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lane v. Dept. of Army</span>, 19 MSPR 161, 163 (1984), involved an administrative officer removed because her husband was the controller of a contractor operating a government-owned plant. The AJ found and the Board affirmed a finding of no conflict. The appellant's duties as administrative officer and the decisions she made or the advice she offered would not directly and predictably affect operations of the contractor that employed her spouse. The Board rejected an apparent conflict of interest theory that required, in the Board's judgment, a demonstration that the performance of official functions would reasonably have, or create the appearance of having, an effect upon the outside interest. The Board cited <span class="Italic">Lavelle v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 9 MSPR 234, 236-37 (1981), for the proposition that a removal based upon a nonexistent "real or apparent conflict of interest" is unwarranted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Connett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 322 (1986), the appellant was employed at a facility that accepted a bid for some construction by a firm that was loaned money by the appellant before the firm did contract work with the government. The appellant did not disclose the loan on a financial interest statement that he filed with the agency. The Board was unclear about the relation between the appellant's duties and control over the contractor's work or approval of its bid, but the Board concluded that his duties involved peripheral contact with the contractors. The appellant acted on the firm's behalf by attempting to obtain favorable consideration from a bonding company whose endorsement was apparently needed by the contractor. Noting and distinguishing <span class="Italic">Lane</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board determined that there was an actual conflict of interest and concluded that the charge had a direct impact upon the appellant's responsibilities and public trust. The conflict, coupled with the improper disclosure statement, resulted in removal despite long satisfactory service and an otherwise clear record. <span class="Italic">Zukowski v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 43 MSPR 51, 56-57 (1989), concluded that somewhat analogous circumstances involving a conflicting investment, surreptitiously made and directly related to the appellant's job responsibilities, warranted dismissal despite long and satisfactory prior service. Individuals involved in somewhat surreptitious contracting with their own agency to perform some waste removal were held properly removed and demoted, depending on the degree of their involvement in the operation. The conflict violated agency standards of conduct prohibiting actions that might adversely affect public confidence in the agency. <span class="Italic">Bilger v. DOJ</span>, 33 MSPR 602, 610 (1987). Dealings with government clients led to the removal of a deputy marshal who sought to enter business with witnesses whose safety it was his job to protect. <span class="Italic">Lappin v. DOJ</span>, 24 MSPR 195, 198 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board occasionally overstates the significance of alleged conflicts and has been reversed as a result. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VanFossen v. DHUD</span>, 748 F.2d 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1984) [discussed below in "<a href="0100-2023-15-107.html#sec8-106">Outside Employment</a>"] ; <span class="Italic">Dimaggio v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 758 F.2d 666 (Fed. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">on remand</span>, 28 MSPR 321, 324 (1985) (reducing removal to a reprimand for discipline that was grossly disproportionate to the offense). But the Board may sustain removals based on conflicts resulting from outside employment without a detailed examination of the impact of that employment upon agency operations<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Schumacher v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 575, 583 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An actual or apparent conflict may be mitigated by the employee's attempts to obtain advice concerning the problem. The action may also be mitigated if the agency was in the position to warn the employee and avoid disciplinary action, but failed to do so, <span class="Italic">Frickey v. Dept. of Army</span>, 61 MSPR 475, 481-82 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant sought legal advice regarding the presence of a conflict of interest from an agency attorney who was assigned to the base where he worked. However, the attorney informed the appellant that he was unable to provide him with any guidance, since an advisory opinion could be given only at the request of management. Thus, despite the appellant's request, he was unable to obtain ethics advice from the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even though the appellant's supervisors knew that the appellant had sought legal advice and guidance regarding a possible conflict and that he believed that there was none, the agency did not inform the appellant until after his proposed removal that they had requested and received a legal memorandum from the agency attorney which found actual and apparent conflict of interest. Indeed, the memorandum set forth the necessary recommendations or guidelines to correct the situation, specifying that the agency should notify the appellant in person and in writing, if necessary, of the conflict of interest and the possible remedies; but, the agency ignored it. Thus, it appears that the appellant never received notice that he was in violation of the agency regulations. <span class="Italic">See Faitel v. Veterans Administration</span>, 26 MSPR 465, 469 (1985) (lack of notice of a regulation alleged to be violated is considered a mitigating factor rather than a defense to the charge).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously mitigated a removal penalty where it found that the appellant's insubordination was partially the fault of the supervisor's attitude and behavior. <span class="Italic">See Stockton v. Department of Transportation</span>, 7 MSPB 539, 8 MSPR 43 (1981). By ignoring the recommendations of its legal counsel to notify the appellant in person and in writing of the conflict and the possible remedies, the appellant's supervisors did not make a good faith effort to remedy the situation at the early stages. Thus, it appears <span id="Page_2592"></span>their behavior is partially to blame for the appellant's insubordination. Given the administrative judge's finding of contrition, there is no reason to believe that, had the agency followed the recommended procedure, the appellant would have committed the infraction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, with regard to the "conflict of interest" charge, the Board has previously found that mitigation to a 14-day suspension was appropriate where the employee solicited small personal loans from an employee of an outside contractor in violation of the agency's standards. <span class="Italic">See Faitel</span> at 26 MSPR 468-469. Similarly, the Board found that the maximum reasonable penalty was a demotion rather than a removal where the appellant improperly accepted a reduced room rate for a personal stay from a person with whom he was doing official business. <span class="Italic">See Fontes v. Department of Transportation</span>, 51 MSPR 655 (1991). Here, the appellant had been allowed to operate his photography business on base for several years and it was not until 1990, when the agency realized that it could financially profit from a photography studio, that appellant was advised of a conflict.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, under all these circumstances, we find that a 60-day suspension is an appropriate penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wallace and Martin v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 106 MSPR 23, 23, 37-35 &#x00B6; 19, 2007 MSPB 141 (2007), involved allegations of nepotism and violation of regulations governing conflicts of interest stemming from the agency's assertion that Mrs. Wallace advocated the hiring of her sister, Ms. Martin, for a position with the Patent and Trademark Office. The Board found no nepotism. As to the conflict issue:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the combined charge that Wallace violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.502 and therefore engaged in conduct unbecoming a federal employee, the regulation provides in pertinent part that, "[w]here an employee's participation in a particular matter...would raise a question in the mind of a reasonable person about [her] impartiality, the agency designee[6] may authorize the employee to participate." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.502(d). Further, "unless [she] receives prior authorization, an employee should not participate in a particular matter involving specific parties which [she] knows is likely to affect the financial interests of a member of [her] household, or in which [she] knows a person with whom [she] has a covered relationship[7] is...a party[.] " 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.501(a). While the regulation is "intended to ensure that an employee takes appropriate steps to avoid an appearance of loss of impartiality in the performance of [her] official duties[,] " the lynchpin of the regulation is the employee's participation in the particular matter. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, if the employee refrains from participation in the matter, the regulation is not implicated and the employee therefore is not required to take the steps dictated in the regulation to seek out ethics advice and obtain the approval of the agency's designee. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.502(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;An "agency designee" is any employee to whom the agency has delegated the authority to make any determination or approval under, or to take any other action required or permitted by, part 2635 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.102(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;A "covered relationship" exists between an employee and "a relative with whom the employee has a close personal relationship." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.502(b)(1)(ii). The appellants have not argued that their relationship is not "covered" under the terms of the regulation.</p>
