<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-204"><span class="space">7.</span> Employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs; Professional Standards Boards</h4>
<p class="noindent">Distinguished from the commonplace discussion between supervisor and employee concerning performance is a more formal system for peer review of performance when that review is conducted in a structured manner. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Jackson and NFFE Local 589</span>, 48 FLRA 787, 795-99 (1993), <span class="Italic">reconsideration granted</span>, 49 FLRA 171 (1994), <span class="Italic">post</span>, concluded that the agency was required to permit union representation to probationary professional employees whose work was reviewed by Nursing Professional Standards Boards, but it was subsequently determined that the broad discretion vested in the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in matters of professional employment decisions precluded a role for the union:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we turn to the Respondent's arguments that the NPSB review is not an examination within the meaning of section 7114 (a)(2)(B), and that a probationary separation is not a disciplinary action within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(B). The General Counsel argues, and we agree, that the circumstances in this consolidated case are analogous to those presented in <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, a physician requested union representation when he appeared before a credentials committee which was investigating information regarding his professional competence. The agency refused the request, and the union filed a ULP charge, alleging that the agency failed to comply with section 7114(a)(2)(B). On review of the charge, the Authority held that the Agency did not violate the Statute because the credentials committee hearing did not constitute an examination under section 7114(a)(2)(B)....&#8197;The Authority determined that the committee hearing, which was convened to review an audit report concerning the physician's competence and to make recommendations based on that review, would take place whether or not the physician attended or participated in the hearing. The Authority held that the fact that the employee was given an option to attend and participate in the hearing did not alter the nature of the hearing and concluded that the hearing was not an examination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the court disagreed with the Authority and determined that the hearing constituted an examination for purposes of section 7114(a)(2)(B), and that union representation should have been allowed. The court noted that, as in <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, the decisive factors governing the affected employee's right to union representation were that the employee desired union representation, and that, as stipulated by the parties, he reasonably believed he faced disciplinary sanctions. The court stated that the statutory right to have a representative present attached where the physician was willing to attend the hearing, and, "as a practical matter, he [had] no choice but to attend." <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 837 F.2d at 499. The court determined that, in reality, the physician was "compelled to attend[&#8197;]" the hearing if he wished to be heard on the issues relating to his continued career<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the court's decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>. Like the physician in <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, the nurses were, in reality, compelled to attend the NPSB hearings if they wished to be heard. Although neither employee in this case was required to attend the hearings, one was informed that the board would review her clinical practice, and the other was informed that the board would review AWOL charges she incurred. Each was notified that she could appear before the board to "present [her] side of the case...."...&#8197;Additionally, each employee was informed that she could request assistance "in preparing [her] case...." Each NPSB hearing was taped and transcribed, and, at the start of the proceedings, the board chairperson stated that the board would gather "as much factual information as possible, relevant to the alleged charge."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As part of that fact-gathering process, both employees provided oral statements to the board, and one employee was required to answer questions from the board members. Further, the results of each hearing were summarized and submitted to the Medical Center director, along with the board's recommendation regarding each employee's continued employment. In addition to the statements given by each employee, the board called additional witnesses, including supervisory officials, who provided information bearing on the circumstances under review. The record reflects that the affected employees' only opportunity to be heard on those issues was to attend the NPSB hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the employees knew the specific reasons for the NPSB reviews, and they were informed that the information obtained during the reviews would have a direct impact on their employment. Further, each had requested Union representation. Based on those circumstances and consistent with the court's decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, we find that the NPSB hearing constituted an examination in connection with an investigation within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(B). Moreover, we note in this connection that, in <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Charleston Naval Shipyard, Charleston, South Carolina</span>, 32 FLRA 222, 231 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>), we held that "the right of representation at an examination is not contingent on the subject matter of the examination" and we concluded that "Congress intended that the focus of the right under section 7114(a)(2)(B) be on the timing of the examination and, more particularly, the employee's need for protection due to the confrontational nature of the examination." Further, as we stated earlier, the Court in <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> noted that an employee who is confronted by an employer may be too fearful or inarticulate to raise extenuating factors, and a knowledgeable union representative could assist the employer by eliciting favorable facts and save time by getting to the bottom of the incident occasioning the interview. <span class="Italic">See Weingarten</span>, 420 U.S. at 263.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whether or not a probationary separation is part of the appointment process, we find that section 7114(a)(2)(B) applies. According to the Respondent, its regulations permit the imposition of an admonishment or reprimand during the probationary period, in lieu of separation, for an employee's "violation of...specified responsibility which is not serious enough to justify separation from service."...&#8197;The Respondent states that these "[p]enalty actions may be imposed as a result of a review of an employee's service by a [p]rofessional [s]tandards [b]oard...."...&#8197;Thus, the board can impose sanctions that traditionally are considered disciplinary in nature for performance-related, as well as conduct-related, matters. At a minimum, the employees were put on notice that their jobs were in jeopardy, although at the time of the examination the employees could not reasonably have anticipated the outcome of the NPSB review. In light of these factors, we agree with the General Counsel that the employees had a reasonable belief that disciplinary action may have occurred as a result of the hearings. In this regard, the intent of section 7114(a)(2)(B) is to afford protection to an employee who is confronted by his or her employer at an examination in connection with an investigation, when the employee reasonably believes that disciplinary action may result....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no basis on which to conclude that the employees' status as probationers affects their statutory rights as Federal employees under section 7114(a)(2)(B). Nothing in the Statute or legislative history indicates that the rights afforded by section 7114(a)(2)(B) are based on an employee's tenure status. Moreover, probationary employees are not deprived of other statutory rights which are available to Federal employees, such as the right to challenge certain discriminatory actions, or the right to engage in union activity....&#8197;Thus, we conclude that each of the employees was entitled to have the assistance of her Union representative, as requested.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have determined that the NPSB hearing is an examination covered by section 7114(a)(2)(B), we also agree with the General Counsel and the Charging Party that the Union must be allowed to actively participate in the examination in order for the Respondent to comply with that section. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Safford</span>,...the "purposes underlying section 7114(a)(2)(B) and the benefits intended for the various parties cannot be achieved if the union representative is prohibited from taking an active role in assisting an employee in presenting facts at an examination." <span class="Italic">Safford</span>, 35 FLRA at 440. Further, the Court in <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> stated that the role of the union representative at examinations "is to assist the employee, and [the representative] may attempt to clarify the facts or suggest other employees who may have knowledge of them." <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, 420 U.S. at 260 (quoting brief of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, although the Respondent permitted the Union representative to attend the NPSB reviews and to confer with each employee off the record, the Respondent would not allow the representative to either address the board while the proceedings were on the record or otherwise participate in the proceedings. As noted earlier, the information elicited during the taped proceedings was summarized and forwarded to the Medical Center director, along with the NPSB recommendation regarding the employees' continued employment. According to the record, the taped NPSB proceeding was the only opportunity for the employees to make a statement regarding the charges under investigation by the NPSB, and, consequently, was the only opportunity to present their position to the person who made the final decision regarding their continued employment. If the employees did not appear, or at least submit a written statement, there is no indication in either title 38 or the Respondent's regulations that any other avenue existed which would allow the employees to offer an explanation or proffer a defense to the charges against them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1449"></span>We have long held that for the right to representation to be meaningful, the representative must have freedom to assist, and consult with, the affected employee. In our view, precluding the Union representative from speaking or otherwise participating on the record in the formal proceedings does not equate to meaningful representation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To summarize, the NPSB proceedings were the only opportunity for the employees to be heard with respect to the specific issues bearing on their employment. The Respondent refused to allow the designated Union representative to speak or otherwise participate on the record in assisting the employees when they presented their cases before the NPSB. According to the Respondent, the board's recommendation is based solely on the board's review of the records and facts of each case, and on the information furnished by each employee and others who may be called by the board. There is no indication in the record that any Union statements made off-the-record are, or would be, considered by the board. Consequently, we conclude that the Respondent violated section 7116 (a) (1) and (8).</p>

FLRA</span>, 73 F.3d 390, 390-95 (D.C. Cir. 1996), <span class="Italic">post</span>, FLRA reversed itself, bowing to an intervening court decision defining VA's statutory control over working conditions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent contends that the Authority's decision in 48 FLRA 787 is inconsistent with the subsequently issued decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</span> <span class="Italic">v. FLRA</span>, 9 F.3d 123 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (<span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs v. FLRA</span>). In this regard, the Respondent asserts that, although <span class="Italic">Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs v. FLRA</span> concerned the Respondent's authority to prescribe regulations regarding working conditions for "hybrid" employees, the court found that such authority was derived from the Respondent's authority to prescribe regulations governing the working conditions of "non-hybrid" employees.[3] According to the Respondent, the court found that Respondent's authority to prescribe regulations existed "'[n]otwithstanding any law, Executive [O]rder, or regulation[.]'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 5 (quoting <span class="Italic">Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs v. FLRA</span>, 9 F.3d at 127).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(3) provides that "hybrid" employees include non-medical professional employees such as licensed physical therapists, and pharmacists. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(a)(2) provides that "non-hybrid" employees include, among others, the nurses involved in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs v. FLRA</span>, the court held, as relevant here, that the Respondent was free to prescribe regulations governing peer review procedures for nonhybrid employees without regard to bargaining obligations set forth in the Statute. 9 F.3d at 129. The court noted that, although Congress amended certain provisions of title 38 in 1991, the Respondent remained free, after the 1991 amendments, to "prescribe, without negotiating, regulations governing, for example, peer review procedures with respect to nonhybrid employees<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. The court observed that the Respondent's "absolute" power in this regard was underscored by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7421(a), which authorizes the Respondent to "prescribe by regulation the...conditions of employment" of nonhybrid employees "[n]otwithstanding any law, Executive [O]rder, or regulation<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 127, 129. Moreover, the court held that, under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7425, such regulations could override rights set forth in the Statute other than those statutory rights which specifically reference title 38 employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have decided to adhere to and will henceforth follow the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs v. FLRA</span>. Consistent with that decision, the Respondent is authorized to prescribe regulations governing, among other things, probationary peer review proceedings for nonhybrid employees without regard to the bargaining and representational rights and obligations set forth in the Statute. Also consistent with the court's decision, such regulations may override statutory rights other than those specifically referencing title 38 employees. Nothing in section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute specifically references title 38 employees. Therefore, we reverse our finding in 48 FLRA 787 that the Respondent could not, by regulation, limit or override those rights by regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted previously, the Respondent has promulgated a regulation, VA Manual MP-5, Part II, Chapter 4.06(4), which precludes Union representation in probationary peer review hearings. The Respondent acted consistent with that regulation, in refusing to permit Union representatives to participate in the disputed peer reviews. Accordingly, those actions do not constitute a violation of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">On review the D.C. Circuit affirmed FLRA's treatment of representational rights before Nursing Professional Standards Boards, <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 589 v. FLRA</span>, 73 F.3d 390, 390-95 (D.C. Cir. 1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Ass'n v. FLRA</span> 851 F.2d 1486, 1487 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the court concluded that under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7421 (Supp. V 1993), Congress had granted the Secretary of Veterans Affairs exclusive discretion to establish regulations relating to the working conditions of certain medical personnel in the Veterans Health Administration ("VHA"), including registered nurses, and hence the Secretary need not engage in collective bargaining with regard to such conditions. Thereafter, in 1991, Congress enacted legislation to provide that such employees would, in fact, have the same fundamental rights of collective bargaining as other federal employees under chapter 71 of title 5 of the United States Code, but with three exceptions, including that peer review would be non-negotiable. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(a), (b)(2) (Supp. V 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant consolidated appeals the VA denied three registered nurses the right to have a union representative participate on the record in a peer review investigation of such peer review of the employee's work history, and the nurses were fired. Before the court, the National Federation of Federal Employees Locals 589 and 1765 ("the Union") contend that because the right to have a union representative at a disciplinary interview is not among the exclusions made in the 1991 amendments and is not barred by any provision of chapter 74 of title 38 governing VA medical personnel, the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA") impermissibly expanded the residual exemptions of title 38. We deny the Union's petitions for review....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The VA hires registered nurses for a two-year probationary period. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(b)(1) (Supp. V 1993). If at the end of the probationary period a nurse's work record is not satisfactory, she will be discharged. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7403(b)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Briefly stated, most federal employees have been governed since 1978 by the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act, chapter 71 of title 5, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-7135 (1994). Those labor rights did not necessarily apply to VA medical personnel, however, because Congress had declared when it established the Veterans Health Administration in 1946 that "[n]otwithstanding any law, Executive order, or regulation, the Secretary shall prescribe by regulation the hours and conditions of employment." Veterans' Administration, Department of Medicine and Surgery, Pub. L. No. 79-293, sec. 7(b), 59 Stat. 675, 677 (1946), <span class="Italic">codified as amended at</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7421(a) (Supp. V 1993). In 1980 Congress reaffirmed that VA medical personnel remained governed exclusively by chapter 74 of title 38, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7401-7474 (Supp. V 1993), whenever title 5 "is inconsistent with" title 38. Veterans Administration Health-Care Amendments of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96-330, sec. 116(a)(1), 94 Stat. 1030, 1039, <span class="Italic">codified as amended at</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7425(b); <span class="Italic">see also Veterans Affairs</span>, 9 F.3d at 125-26. In 1983, for purposes largely irrelevant here, Congress created a new category of VA medical personnel ("hybrid" employees). Veterans' Health Care Amendments of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-160, secs. 201, 203(a), 97 Stat. 993, 1000, <span class="Italic">codified as amended at </span>38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7401(3), 7403(f)(1), (2). Five years later Congress established that such "hybrid" employees are subject to title 38 except that "all matters relating to adverse actions, disciplinary actions, and grievance procedures" are governed by chapter 71 of title 5. Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-322, sec. 221, 102 Stat. 487, 531, <span class="Italic">codified at</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3). The registered nurses in the instant cases are "nonhybrid" employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1991 Congress granted "non-hybrid" VHA employees the right "to engage in collective bargaining" in accordance with chapter 71 of title 5. Department of Veterans Affairs Health-Care Personnel Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-40, sec. 202, 105 Stat. 187, 200-01, <span class="Italic">codified at</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(a). In the 1991 amendments, Congress carved out three exceptions to &#x00A7; 7422(a); there would be no right to engage in collective bargaining with respect to "any matter or question concerning or arising out of (1) professional conduct or competence, (2) peer review, or (3) the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(b). The Secretary determines whether a matter falls within one of the three exceptions, and the Secretary's determination is not itself subject to collective bargaining and is unreviewable by any other agency<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7422(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the nurses in these consolidated appeals were subject to all provisions of chapter 71 of title 5, they would enjoy the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights that they claim. Federal employees, in general, have the right to have a union representative present at "any examination of an employee in the unit by a representative of the agency in connection with an investigation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). However, the court has already indicated how these appeals must be resolved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequent to congressional enactment of the 1991 amendments to title 38, the court in <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs</span>, relying on the three exceptions set forth in &#x00A7; 7422(b) pursuant to the 1991 amendments, concluded that the Secretary retained "plenary power to prescribe regulations" over "non-hybrid" employees relating to "peer review<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> at 129. Although the court in <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs</span> discussed only the collective bargaining rights enjoyed by "non-hybrid" employees under &#x00A7; 7422 and not rights under chapter 71 of title 5 unrelated to collective bargaining, the limitation of the discussion to collective bargaining rights necessarily follows from the fact that &#x00A7; 7422 deals only with collective bargaining rights, however defined. Consequently, the FLRA persuasively argues, in light of <span class="Italic">Colorado <span id="Page_1450"></span>Nurses</span>, that because registered nurses are subject to the Secretary's authority under &#x00A7; 7421(a), the Secretary has unfettered discretion with regard to the regulations governing registered nurses. Section 7425 makes clear that chapter 71 of title 5, or any other section of that title, will not override or modify title 38 provisions, absent an express statement of such intent. In the FLRA's view, either the collective bargaining rights conferred in &#x00A7; 7422(a) do not include <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights or, alternatively, if the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights are collective bargaining rights they fall within the peer review exception of &#x00A7; 7422(b). Under &#x00A7; 7422(d), the decision whether the procedures at issue are "peer review" procedures under &#x00A7; 7422(b) lies in the sole discretion of the Secretary (subject to judicial review). Therefore, we agree with the FLRA's view that the Secretary exercises complete discretion over peer review procedures--whether the rights in question are characterized as representational rights that fall within &#x00A7; 7421(a), or as collective bargaining rights that fall within &#x00A7; 7422(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's responses are unpersuasive in the face of this court's precedent. First, it maintains that "non-hybrid" employees have statutory rights to union representation, unrelated to collective bargaining, that do not depend on the 1991 amendments. However, the Union's interpretation of the interaction between chapter 71 of title 5 and chapter 74 of title 38 would effectively repeal the broad authority granted to the Secretary under &#x00A7; 7421(a) to prescribe regulations "[n]otwithstanding any law." Since the enactment of &#x00A7; 7422 in 1991, the court has reaffirmed the interpretation of &#x00A7; 7421(a) set forth in <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span>, that Congress created the exemption in order to afford the Secretary control over the conditions of employment for VA medical personnel unrestricted by the regular civil service system for federal government employees<span class="Italic">. Veterans Affairs</span>, 9 F.3d at 125; <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses</span>, 851 F.2d at 1489.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Union contends that when Congress enacted &#x00A7; 7422 in 1991, it intended to bring VA medical personnel under chapter 71 of title 5 except for the three exceptions in &#x00A7; 7422(b), which apply only to collective bargaining. In other words, even though the Union cannot bargain over peer review procedures, the Union maintains that it is assured representational rights at the peer review hearings even when the Secretary has promulgated contrary regulations under &#x00A7; 7421(a). The Union relies on a passage in the explanation of the 1991 amendments by Senator Cranston, the bill's principal sponsor and chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, who stated that one purpose of the amendments was "[t]o ensure that title 38 employees are afforded the same fundamental rights as other Government employees in terms of their employee-management relations, while protecting the special professional nature of title 38 employment." 137 Cong. Rec. S4543 (daily ed. Apr. 17, 1991). Yet this general language, as well as the Senator's other remarks on the bill, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at S4544, recognizes that the statute as enacted is a compromise between potentially conflicting purposes. Moreover, the Union has no explanation for why the "collective bargaining" rights in &#x00A7; 7422(a) should be more extensive than the exception for "collective bargaining" over "peer review" in &#x00A7; 7422(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the Union maintains that the FLRA's interpretation of &#x00A7; 7425 is incorrect because chapter 71 of title 5 is not among the statutes specifically listed in &#x00A7; 7425(a) as inapplicable to VA medical personnel. The Union then reads &#x00A7; 7425(b) to allow federal statutes not specifically enumerated to govern VA medical personnel unless there is a direct conflict with a provision in chapter 74 of title 38. In the Union's view, because there is no such direct conflict between the representational right in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7114 and the exclusion of peer review from the scope of bargaining in 38 USC &#x00A7; 7422, &#x00A7; 7114 governs. But the Union's reliance on the omission of chapter 71 of title 5 from &#x00A7; 7425(a) is misplaced because &#x00A7; 7425(a) serves the limited purpose of exempting VA medical personnel from the Senior Executive Service of title 5<span class="Italic">. See</span> Explanatory Statement of Compromise Agreement on H.R. 71021/S. 2534, 126 Cong. Rec. 20,760 (1980), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2557, 2561. More important, &#x00A7; 7425(b), which was originally codified in a different section from &#x00A7; 7425(a), was enacted to ensure that "no provisions from title 5 or elsewhere (whether heretofore or hereafter enacted) shall be considered to supersede, override, or otherwise modify title 38 provisions unless such other provision does so expressly by specific reference to the title 38 provision<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> at 20,761, reprinted in 1980 USCCAN at 2565, <span class="Italic">quoted in Colorado Nurses</span>, 851 F.2d at 1491. Thus, the Union's argument that chapter 71 of title 5 controls except for a "direct conflict" cannot overcome &#x00A7; 7425(b)'s requirement that Congress clearly express an intent to override chapter 74 of title 38.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress has gradually extended some of the protections in chapter 71 of title 5 to VA medical personnel, for example by creating the "hybrid" class of employees in 1983 and by granting all VA medical personnel limited collective bargaining rights in 1991. Unless and until Congress decides to further extend chapter 71 of title 5 to Veterans Health Administration employees, however, Congress has made clear in &#x00A7; 7421(a) the presumption that the Secretary has complete discretion over the conditions of employment of VA medical personnel. Accordingly, we deny the petitions for review.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the Secretary of Veterans Affairs does not issue a regulation precluding union representation, the employer commits a ULP by not permitting representation, as in <span class="Italic">VAMC Hampton and AFGE Local 2328</span>, 51 FLRA 84, 87-88 (1995), <span class="Italic">reaff'd on reconsideration</span>, 51 FLRA 1741 (1996), involving a quality assurance investigation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that we are not divested of jurisdiction in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7421 of title 38 authorizes the Secretary to prescribe regulations governing the hours and conditions of employment of title 38 employees.&#x2003;Regulations issued pursuant to the Secretary's authority under section 7421 may override rights granted by the Statute, including the rights to representation under section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.[4] <span class="Italic">VAMC II</span>, 49 FLRA at 174-75, citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs v. FLRA</span>, 9 F.3d 123, 127, 129 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Under section 7422(a), the authority to prescribe regulations under section 7421 "is subject to the right of Federal employees to engage in collective bargaining" under the Statute, with certain enumerated exceptions. Section 7422(d) operates to divest the Authority of jurisdiction to review the Secretary's determination that a matter concerns one of the enumerated exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;It is not disputed that, in general, title 38 employees may exercise rights under the Statute, including rights to representation under section 7114(a)(2)(B). <span class="Italic">VAMC I</span>, 48 FLRA at 793-94. <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs v. FLRA</span>, 1 F.3d 19, 21 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (prior to the grant of collective bargaining rights to title 38 employees in 1991, the court recognized that title 38 employees "had and retain other rights protected by the [Statute]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VAMC II</span>, the Authority found that the respondent had promulgated a regulation precluding union representation in the peer review hearings at issue in that case. The facts in this case are different. Here, there is no assertion by the Respondent that it has exercised its authority under section 7421 to prescribe a regulation overriding unit employees' rights to union representation at quality assurance investigations. Nor has the Union sought to bargain over the authority of the Secretary to prescribe regulations under section 7421. Therefore, by its terms, section 7422 does not apply and section 7422(d) does not limit the Authority's jurisdiction to review a claim that the Respondent violated the right to representation under section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
