<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-158"><span class="space">a.</span> Self-Interest in Arbitrator Selection Dispute</h5>
<p class="noindent">Arbitrators occasionally become involved in disputes over the validity or duration of their appointments. <span class="Italic">EEOC and AFGE Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216</span>, 53 FLRA 465, 474-83 (1997), adopted the principle from the private sector that arbitrators may be required to disqualify themselves from proceedings when there are disputes concerning their own extended employment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his Interim Award, the Arbitrator specifically addressed his own appointment to the position of National Arbitrator. Although the issue has been only rarely litigated, the Authority has held that where a "grievance directly concerns the arbitrator's own employment for what may be an extended period of time, impermissible self-interest requires [the arbitrator's] disqualification [from that case]." <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 29 FLRA at 1578 (quoting <span class="Italic">Pitta v. Hotel</span> <span class="Italic">Association of New York City, Inc.</span>, 806 F.2d 419, 423 (2d Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">Pitta</span>)). As the Authority held in <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, allowing an arbitrator to rule on his or her own contested extended appointment "create[s] a risk of unfairness so inconsistent with the basic principles of justice that the arbitration award must be automatically vacated." 29 FLRA at 1578 (quoting <span class="Italic">Pitta</span>, 806 F.2d at 423-24).[10]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;The Authority emphasized that an arbitrator need not recuse himself or herself from every decision that might have a bearing on his or her compensation, such as a decision to continue a hearing for an additional day when circumstances warranted. <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 29 FLRA at 1578-79 (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Pitta</span>, 806 F.2d at 423-24). Both the Authority and the court limited their holdings to cases where continued employment was at issue. 806 F.2d at 424. The Authority also emphasized that it was not finding that the arbitrator was biased, but only that in this unusual circumstance, the risk of unfairness required disqualification. <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 29 FLRA at 1579. Similarly, no finding is made with respect to the Arbitrator's actual bias in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Like <span class="Italic">SSA</span> and <span class="Italic">Pitta</span>, this case concerns a contested appointment that would be for "an extended period of time." [11] The issue that the Arbitrator ruled upon was the validity of his own selection as a "National Arbitrator" under the parties' agreement. Article 44 of that agreement provides for three such National Arbitrators to serve in a "permanent capacity." Under the National Agreement, National Arbitrators serve, on a rotating basis, for the term of the contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Pitta</span>, the arbitrator's status as a "permanent umpire" was at stake. 806 F.2d at 420-21. The arbitrator in <span class="Italic">SSA</span> ruled that all grievances involving the application of certain (official time) provisions of the parties' agreement were required to be submitted to him during the term of the parties' contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, we find that impermissible self-interest disqualified the Arbitrator from ruling on his own extended appointment. However, under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that directing the parties to refer this matter to another arbitrator would not be an appropriate remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed in section IV.C., below, we hold that under the parties' agreement, an arbitrator's award on the validity of the selection of National Arbitrators is subject to <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review by the Authority. Were we to refer the matter to another arbitrator and review was sought, we would thereafter be reviewing the second arbitrator's award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. As such, it is not clear that a useful purpose would be served by an additional arbitral proceeding. Rather, such a course of action would appear merely to extend what has already become a protracted dispute. Accordingly, as the case is before us now, we will resolve it without further delay. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility v. U.S. Secret Service</span>, 72 F.3d 897, 903 (D.C. Cir. 1996) ("in the interest of judicial economy," where matter reviewed <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, appellate court made final determination instead of remanding to lower court); <span class="Italic">National Coal Association v. Lujan</span>, 979 F.2d 1548, 1549 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (to avoid "unwarranted protraction," court declined to remand case to lower court). As set forth below, we conclude that the Arbitrator was not validly selected under the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator's Award Is Deficient Because the</span> <span class="Italic">Arbitrator Had No Authority under the National</span> <span class="Italic">Agreement</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing the Arbitrator's determination that he was properly selected under the National Agreement, we must first determine the proper standard to employ. As discussed below, we find that a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> standard is appropriate. Upon such review, we find that the National Agreement did not authorize the Union's unilateral selection of Arbitrator Lazar and that accordingly, he was without authority to decide the PARS grievances.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Standard of Review</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the Interim Award, the Arbitrator interpreted Article 44 of the National Agreement, and concluded that under its terms, he was properly selected as a National Arbitrator. In reviewing contract interpretations by arbitrators, the Authority typically applies a deferential "essence" standard of review (analyzing whether an award draws its essence from the parties' agreement). Nonetheless, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator's contract interpretations in this case relating to his selection should be reviewed <span class="Italic">de novo</span> because, like "substantive arbitrability" determinations, they involve a determination with respect to the Arbitrator's authority to hear the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has discussed the issue of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of arbitrator contract interpretations in one previous decision. In that decision, the Authority acknowledged that "in the private sector...Federal courts review substantive arbitrability determinations by arbitrators <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, unless the parties have waived the right to a judicial determination independent of the arbitrator's determination." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Kansas City, Missouri and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1336</span>, 51 FLRA 725, 731 n.5 (1996) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Kansas City</span>). However, the Authority did not reach the standard of review question in that case, finding that the arbitrator's award was deficient even under the deferential "essence" standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's claim that we should review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the Arbitrator's determination that he was properly selected under the National Agreement does not present a question of substantive arbitrability.[12] That is, the Agency has not asserted that an arbitrator would be without jurisdiction to consider this issue. Rather, the Agency challenges the basis for deferring to the Arbitrator's determination on the selection question, asking instead for the Authority's independent review of the Arbitrator's resolution of the issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;Substantive arbitrability is a question of subject matter jurisdiction: whether the parties have agreed to arbitrate a particular category or type of dispute. Elkouri &#x0026; Elkouri, <span class="Italic">How Arbitration Works</span> 301 (Marlin M. Volz &#x0026; Edward P. Goggin eds., 5th ed. 1997) (<span class="Italic">"Elkouri &#x0026; Elkouri"</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed below, even though the issue raised by the Agency is not one of substantive arbitrability, we find instructive the underlying principles employed in private sector cases dealing with the standard of review issue in substantive arbitrability cases. Analogous to substantive arbitrability cases, answering the standard of review question here requires deciding whether the arbitrator or the reviewing forum should make the primary determination on the underlying question--whether the Arbitrator's selection was valid under the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">De Novo Review Is Appropriate Where the</span> <span class="Italic">Parties Have Not Granted the Arbitrator the</span> <span class="Italic">Primary Power to Decide a Matter</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">De novo</span> review of certain types of arbitral contract interpretations is firmly embedded in the private sector. The determination whether to use the standard rests on what the parties have agreed to in their collective bargaining agreement relating to their contractual grievance and arbitration procedure. The Supreme Court described this principle as follows: "[A]rbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit." <span class="Italic">AT &#x0026; T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers of America</span>, 475 U.S. 643, 648 (1986) (<span class="Italic">AT &#x0026; T</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">Steelworkers </span>v. <span class="Italic">Warrior &#x0026; Gulf Navigation Co.</span>, 363 U.S. 574, 582 (1960) (<span class="Italic">Warrior &#x0026; Gulf</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To decide whether to apply a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> standard, or the deferential "essence" standard, to a particular matter, the courts examine how the parties wanted the matter resolved. As the Supreme Court described the process, the courts ask "who"--court or arbitrator--"has the primary power to decide" the matter. <span class="Italic">First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan</span>, 115 S. Ct. 1920, 1923 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Kaplan</span>) [13]. The Supreme Court determined that "the question 'who has the primary power to decide [a matter]' turns upon what the parties agreed about <span class="Italic">that</span> matter." <span class="Italic">Kaplan</span>, 115 S. Ct. at <span id="page_1939"></span>1923. If the parties agreed to submit the particular matter to arbitration, "then the court's standard for reviewing the arbitrator's decision about <span class="Italic">that</span> matter should not differ from the standard courts apply when they review any other matter that parties have agreed to arbitrate"--that is, the deferential "essence" standard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">AT &#x0026; T</span> and <span class="Italic">Warrior &#x0026; Gulf</span>). In such a case, "where the party has agreed to arbitrate,...[t]he party still can ask a court to review the arbitrator's decision, but the court will set that decision aside only in very unusual circumstances<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;Under section 7122 of the Statute, it is the Authority, not the courts, that reviews arbitration awards. Accordingly, when adapting the private sector precedent discussed in this section to the federal sector, the Authority stands in the position of the reviewing courts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If, on the other hand, the Court explained, it was not established that a party agreed to submit a question to arbitration, "then the court should decide that question just as it would decide any other question that the parties did not submit to arbitration, namely independently"--employing a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> standard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1924. Thus, "a party who has not agreed to arbitrate will normally have a right to a court's decision about the merits of its dispute....<span class="Italic">" Id</span>. at 1923.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">AT &#x0026; T</span>, the Court established a strict standard for determining if a party agreed to submit a particular question to arbitration (leading to deferential review by the courts), or did not (leading to <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review). Discussing the specific question of who should determine arbitrability, the Court stated in <span class="Italic">AT &#x0026; T</span> that "[u]nless the parties <span class="Italic">clearly and</span> <span class="Italic">unmistakably</span> provide otherwise, the question whether the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be decided by the court, not the arbitrator." <span class="Italic">AT &#x0026; T</span>, 475 U.S. at 649 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court in <span class="Italic">Kaplan</span> clarified the reason for establishing a presumption against resolving such "who" questions in favor of arbitral determination. Characterizing such questions as "rather arcane," the Court explained that "[a] party often might not focus upon that question or upon the significance of having arbitrators decide the scope of their own powers." <span class="Italic">Kaplan</span>, 115 S. Ct. at 1924-25 (citing Cox, Reflections Upon Labor Arbitration, 72 Harv. L. Rev. 1482, 1508-09 (1959)). The Court thus held that a contract's silence or ambiguity with respect to the issue of "who" was granted primary power to decide such questions should be interpreted in favor of judicial, rather than arbitral power.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Court's analysis in <span class="Italic">Kaplan</span> and <span class="Italic">AT &#x0026; T</span> instructive in answering the standard of review question here. Like the question in <span class="Italic">Kaplan</span> and <span class="Italic">AT &#x0026; T</span> concerning who should have the primary power to decide substantive arbitrability issues, the question in this case concerning who should have the primary power to decide the legitimacy of a National Arbitrator's selection, relates to the scope of the arbitrator's own powers. As the Court recognized in <span class="Italic">Kaplan</span>, it is reasonable to assume that a party entering into a collective bargaining agreement might not focus upon the significance of granting arbitrators the primary power to decide the scope of their own authority. <span class="Italic">See Kaplan</span>, 115 S. Ct. at 1925. This characterization is consistent with the rarity of such cases in Authority case law. Accordingly, unless there is clear and unmistakable evidence in this case that the parties intended that an arbitrator would have the primary power to decide the validity of a contested National Arbitrator selection, we will review the matter <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">De Novo Review Is Appropriate in This Case</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the principles enunciated in <span class="Italic">Kaplan</span> and <span class="Italic">AT &#x0026; T</span>, and examining the relevant provisions of the National Agreement, we find no clear and unmistakable evidence that National Arbitrator selection issues were to be resolved primarily in arbitration. Thus, <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review is appropriate in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, neither the section of the parties' agreement dealing with National Arbitrator selection (Section 44.03), nor any other section of the agreement's "Arbitration" article (Article 44), addresses "who" should decide questions concerning the validity of a National Arbitrator's selection. Indeed, the agreement's Arbitration article does not even address procedures for dealing with the failure or refusal of a party to participate in the striking process prescribed for selecting National Arbitrators. The agreement is, thus, silent on the issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agreement's provision concerning National Arbitrator selection...contrasts with the section concerning selection of "Local Arbitrators." The latter, Section 44.06, establishes a striking process to select Local Arbitrators that is somewhat similar to the striking process established for selecting National Arbitrators. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> Section 44.03 <span class="Italic">with</span> Section 44.06. However, unlike the provision concerning National Arbitrators, the section controlling Local Arbitrator selection also explicitly anticipates and defines the consequences of a party's refusal or failure to participate in the process, stating:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If either Party refuses to act under this selection procedure or unduly delays the selection process,...the other Party shall return its list to the FMCS indicating its first (1st), second (2nd) and third (3rd) preferences of an Arbitrator, and it is agreed that the FMCS shall be empowered to appoint the available Arbitrator in accordance with the preference indicated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">National Agreement, Section 44.06. Thus, although the parties expressly provided for resolution of disputes concerning the selection of Local Arbitrators, there is nothing that indicates that the parties gave any consideration to resolution of similar matters with respect to National Arbitrators.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The questions unanswered in the provisions of the parties' agreement specifically concerning arbitrator selection are also not answered in other provisions of the agreement bearing on grievance/arbitration issues....&#8197;However, a broad scope arbitration clause by itself is insufficient to provide clear and unmistakable evidence concerning who has the primary power to decide a particular matter. <span class="Italic">Cf. AT &#x0026; T</span>, 475 U.S. at 644-45, 651 ("It was for the court, not the arbitrator, to decide in the first instance whether the dispute was to be resolved through arbitration," notwithstanding that the parties' agreement contained a broad arbitration clause); <span class="Italic">Hinkley</span>, 76 F.3d at 164-65 (presence of "open-ended arbitration clause" did not constitute unmistakable evidence of intent that arbitrator was to decide arbitrability issue). <span class="Italic">But cf. Carpenters</span>, 94 F.3d at 1311 ("[A] broad arbitration clause--even one that does not specifically mention <span class="Italic">who</span> decides arbitrability--is sufficient to grant the arbitrator authority to decide his or her own jurisdiction."). Further, as to Section 43.03, even though arbitrability is to be decided by an arbitrator, nothing indicates that the distinct question of arbitrator selection is to be decided primarily through arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, the fact that the agreement expressly deals in several contexts with questions concerning "who" should decide a particular issue, but does not deal with "who" should decide National Arbitrator selection issues, weighs against a finding of clear and unmistakable evidence that the parties agreed that an arbitrator was to have the primary power to decide issues of the latter type. Accordingly, we will review the matter of the validity of the Arbitrator's selection <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.[20]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[20]&#x2003;We emphasize, however, that our decision finding <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review appropriate in this case is limited to its specific facts, and is not intended to raise questions concerning the appropriate standard of review for substantive arbitrability determinations in the federal sector. As indicated in the text above, the Authority has applied the deferential "essence" standard to such questions. Nothing in this decision indicates a need to reevaluate this aspect of Authority precedent, especially in view of the presence in the Statute of a specific provision, section 7121(a)(1), requiring that "any collective bargaining agreement shall provide procedures for the settlement of...questions of arbitrability."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator Was Not Properly Selected Under</span> <span class="Italic">the Terms of the National Agreement</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having determined that our review is <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, we are persuaded that we should overturn the Arbitrator's determination that he was validly selected. There are two principal bases upon which we reach this conclusion. First, we find that one of the Arbitrator's key determinations, concerning the meaning of Section 44.03 of the parties' agreement, is contradicted by the section's language. Second, we find that a comparison of Section 44.03 with Section 44.06, the agreement's Local Arbitrator selection provision, indicates that National Arbitrators were not to be selected unilaterally.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the first matter, the language of Section 44.03 does not support the Arbitrator's determination that "[t]he duty to strike analytically was not only a <span class="Italic">right</span> to strike, but also constituted a legal <span class="Italic">power</span>. The Agency's refusal to exercise its right and power did not strip the Union's right and power." [21] Section 44.03 merely provides in this regard that the parties will strike arbitrator names "sequentially." Taking "sequentially" to mean "following each other in sequence," <span class="Italic">see</span> Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, the term implies the actions of both parties. From this, the most direct inference is that whatever "right and power" Section 44.03 establishes in each party, that "right and power" may only be exercised jointly. The Arbitrator's contrary interpretation, that the section gave the Union an independent "right and power," has no foundation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;When the Authority interprets contracts, it looks to the pertinent contractual language and to other relevant record evidence, such as the parties' bargaining history. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 1274, 1277 (1996) (determining whether certain changes in working conditions made by an agency were covered by terms of the parties' agreement). In the instant case, the record contains only the contract's language.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second basis for concluding that the Arbitrator was not validly selected rests on a consideration of the contrasting provisions in Section 44.03 and Section 44.06, discussed above. Section 44.06 explicitly provides for the unilateral selection of Local Arbitrators by a party where the other party refuses to participate, or unduly delays <span id="page_1940"></span>participating, in the striking process. The existence of express provisions for unilateral selection of Local Arbitrators in circumstances similar to those that generated this case strongly implies that the omission of comparable language concerning the selection of National Arbitrators was intentional. <span class="Italic">Cf., e.g., Russello v. United States</span>, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (Congress' inclusion of particular language in one section of a statute and omission of it from another implies an intent to deal with the two sections disparately). Therefore, on this basis as well, we conclude that the parties' agreement reflects an intent that National Arbitrators would not be selected unilaterally.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, based upon the language of the parties' agreement, we conclude on <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review that the Union's unilateral selection of the arbitrator was unauthorized, and thus overturn the Arbitrator's award.</p>
<p class="noindent">Key to <span class="Italic">EEOC</span> was long-term employment of the arbitrator, determined by the arbitrator. The limited scope of <span class="Italic">EEOC</span> was addressed by <span class="Italic">Indep. Union of Pension Employees and PBGC</span>, 68 FLRA 999, 1005-06 (2015) (recon. den., 69 FLRA 158 (2016)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also alleges that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to law and the Arbitrator exceeded his authority because he lacked the authority to determine his own long-term appointment. The Union argues that allowing the Arbitrator to determine his own long-term appointment is contrary to the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>.[82]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[82]&#x2003;53 FLRA 465 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, the Authority affirmed that, where a "grievance directly concerns the arbitrator's own employment for what may be an extended period of time, impermissible self-interest requires [the arbitrator's] disqualification [from that case],"[83] and "allowing an arbitrator to rule on his or her own contested extended appointment 'create[s] a risk of unfairness so inconsistent with the basic principles of justice that the arbitration award must be automatically vacated.'"[84] The Authority also noted that "[b]oth the Authority and the [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <span class="Italic">Pitta v. Hotel Ass'n of New York City, Inc</span>. (<span class="Italic">Pitta</span>)[85]] limited their holdings to cases where continued employment was at issue."[86] The Authority first adopted <span class="Italic">Pitta</span> in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>.[87] In <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, the Authority emphasized that the issue of an arbitrator determining his own long-term appointment "is fundamentally different, in our view, from other issues involving an arbitrator's authority to hear and decide cases."[88]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[83]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 474 (quoting <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 29 FLRA 1568, 1578 (1987) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[88]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1579.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator concluded that "[n]o legitimate basis has been established in support of the Union's assertions that this Arbitrator is not the proper neutral to hear and resolve this grievance." The Arbitrator only found that he was properly appointed to resolve this particular grievance. Thus, we find that the Arbitrator did not make a determination concerning his own long-term appointment and that <span class="Italic">EEOC</span> does not apply. Consequently, we deny these exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In limiting <span class="Italic">EEOC</span> to long-term appointments, we acknowledge that the Authority suggested otherwise in <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, U.S. ICE</span> (<span class="Italic">DHS</span>).[90] In <span class="Italic">DHS</span>, the Authority applied <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, including a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the parties' agreement, where an arbitrator's decision only implicated his selection to a single arbitration, not a long-term position.[91] However, the Authority in <span class="Italic">DHS</span> never addressed the first step in <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>--determining whether there was a presumption of an impermissible self-interest--before vacating the award. <span class="Italic">DHS</span> expanded <span class="Italic">EEOC</span> without explanation and did not reconcile the expansion's tension with long-standing Authority precedent holding that procedural-arbitrability determinations may be found deficient only on grounds that do not challenge those determinations themselves.[92] As far as <span class="Italic">DHS</span> conflicts with the approach taken here, we overrule <span class="Italic">DHS</span> and its application of <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>.</p>
