<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-299"><span class="space">C.</span> GROOMING AND DRESS CODES</h3>
<p class="noindent">Grooming standards ensuring that officers are readily recognized as representatives of the agency in their dealings with the public are a means of performing agency work under 7106(b)(1); however, as long as proposed grooming standards are defined so that they do not impede public recognition of personnel as agency employees, the grooming standards are negotiable. The agency argument that a grooming proposal interfered with its right to determine its organization was not accepted. The term "organization" generally refers to the administrative and functional structure of the institution. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l INS Council and DOJ, INS</span>, 8 FLRA 347, 351-53 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 31 FLRA 1123, 1135-36 (1988) (approving negotiability of proposal concerning sideburns, mustaches, beards). But FLRA also states that, because "grooming standards are so inextricably related" to uniform requirements, proposals seeking to abrogate the application of those standards are negotiable only at the election of the agency. <span class="Italic">NAGE, SEIU and Nat'l Guard Bureau, Adjutant Gen.</span>, 26 FLRA 515, 526-27 (1987). The result concerning grooming standards in the <span class="Italic">Nat'l INS Council</span> decision was called into question after <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-87 and Kansas Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">The analysis becomes more complex when the agency asserts that dress codes or grooming standards are required by the agency or cannot be changed at the request of the union by reason of concerns for national security. If the linkage between the standards and national security is established by what amounts to a rational explanation, the union has the burden of proving that its proposals do not excessively interfere with the security interests that the agency seeks to protect. <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, Bureau of Customs &#x0026; Border Protection</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-051.html">62 FLRA 267</a>, 269-74 (2007) (aff'd in part,<span class="Italic"> NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 550 F.3d 1148 (D.C. Cir. 2008), <span class="Italic">post</span>), explained the analysis of several related proposals that sought to allow uniformed officers a measure of freedom as to grooming standards, and the decision modified the standard for establishing an internal security interest to be rational articulation of the interest alone, coupled with a deviation from agency policy established by the proposal under appeal, leaving the union to demonstrate a lack of impact of the proposal on security interests through analysis under the excessive interference test:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties agree that the official uniform, when worn in its entirety, affords sufficient identification of the officer as a representative of CBP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 3</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Officers will be neat, clean and professional in attire and appearance at all times while on duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 4</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Officers may conform to contemporary apparel and grooming standards (when not in uniform) and, when in uniform, contemporary grooming styles, subject to the terms of this MOU, provided that the styles do not create a health or safety hazard, or interfere with or tend to interfere with the accomplishment of the mission of CBP in a particular situation by reducing the ability to deal effectively with either the public, fellow employees, other government agencies or other organization entities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Analytical Framework</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that Proposals 2, 3, and 4 affect, and excessively interfere with, its right to determine internal security practices under &#x00A7; <span id="page_845"></span>7106(a) of the Statute and its right to determine the means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). In response, the Union contends that the proposals do not affect these management rights and that, if they do, then the proposals are negotiable as appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addressing these arguments, we first determine whether a proposal affects the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. If it does, then we determine whether it constitutes an appropriate arrangement for the exercise of that right or whether it does not because it excessively interferes with the right. If a proposal excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices, then we do not determine whether, as the Agency asserts, the proposal also excessively interferes with its right to determine the means of performing work. If a proposal does not affect or does not excessively interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices, then we will resolve the parties' claims regarding the Agency's right to determine the means of performing work. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, HUD Council of Locals 222, Local 2910</span>, 54 FLRA 171, 175-76 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Proposals 2, 3, and 4 affect management's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, management's right to determine its internal security practices includes the right to determine the policies and practices that are part of its plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property, and operations against internal and external risks. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2143</span>, 48 FLRA 41, 44 (1993) (Member Talkin concurring as to other matters). Review of precedent demonstrates that the Authority has used two different approaches in determining whether a proposal, which deviates from or modifies an agency policy, affects management's right to determine its internal security practices. As such, we take this opportunity to address these different approaches and clarify our law in this respect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held, in cases concerning an agency decision to implement a uniform or identification card policy, that a proposal that modified an agency's policy, but did not conflict with the agency's stated security purpose or "defeat the purpose" for which the agency adopted the internal security measure, did not affect management's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1625</span>, 25 FLRA 1028, 1031-32 (1987) (AFGE, Local 1625); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 217</span>, 21 FLRA 62, 66-67 (1986); <span class="Italic">see also AFGE, Local 1904</span>, 56 FLRA 787, 789-90 (2000) (referencing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1625</span>, 25 FLRA at 1031). However, in other precedent regarding internal security practices, the Authority has required an agency to establish only: (1) a link between the agency's policy and its internal security measure, and (2) that a union's proposal deviated from or modified the agency's policy. <span class="Italic">See NTEU,</span> 60 FLRA 367, 374-75 (2004) (Proposal 11) (Chairman Cabaniss and Member Pope dissenting on other grounds) <span class="Italic">petition for review granted, remanded in part, reversed in part</span>, 437 F.3d 1248 (D.C. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA 978, 981 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having reviewed these two approaches, the Authority will no longer follow the earlier precedent holding that a proposal must conflict with or defeat the purpose of an agency's internal security measure in order to affect management's right to determine its internal security practices and will, instead, apply the "affects" test used in more recent precedent, including <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>60 FLRA 367, and <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA 978. In determining whether a proposal affects management's right to determine its internal security practices under this test, the Authority does not examine the extent to which the practices adopted by an agency to achieve its security objectives actually facilitate the accomplishment of those objectives. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFSCME, Locals 2910 &#x0026; 2477</span>, 49 FLRA 834, 839 (1994). We note that this approach is consistent with the Authority's application of the "affects" test with respect to other &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights. <span class="Italic">See AFSCME, Local 2830</span>, 60 FLRA 671, 673 (2005); <span class="Italic">AFSCME, Local 2830</span>, 60 FLRA 124, 127 (2004);<span class="Italic"> Laborer's Int'l Union of N. America, Local 28</span>, 58 FLRA 605, 606 (2003). As such, it makes more consistent the standards for determining whether a proposal affects various management rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, for the Agency's grooming standards policy to constitute an exercise of the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices, the Agency must establish a link between the policy and its internal security goals. If the Agency establishes such a link and a proposal deviates from or modifies the Agency's policy, then the proposal will be found to affect management's right to determine its internal security practices. A proposal affecting management's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) is outside the duty to bargain, unless it is encompassed by an exception set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether the Agency has established a link between its grooming standards policy and its internal security goal of safeguarding Agency personnel, the Agency states that its mission is "preventing terrorists and terrorists['] weapons from entering the United States" and that a grooming standards policy for its officers is consistent with the Agency's effort to present "one face at the border." The Agency also contends that its policy ensures that its officers are readily recognizable and identifiable as law enforcement officials. According to the Agency, "officer's presence" is the first level in the "Use of Force continuum," a law enforcement technique, and an officer's appearance "increases his or her effectiveness." As such, the Agency claims that implementing a "well-defined policy" promotes officer effectiveness and safety.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's claims establish that it is tasked with the critical mission of preventing terrorism. As a method of accomplishing its mission, the Agency implemented the grooming standards policy for its uniformed officers. According to the Agency, the purpose of the policy is to safeguard its uniformed officers by ensuring that they are readily identifiable to the public and by increasing the officers' ability to effectively employ law enforcement techniques. As such, consistent with Authority precedent, we find that the Agency has established a reasonable link between its grooming standards policy and its internal security goals. <span class="Italic">See AFSCME, Local 2910, </span>49 FLRA at 839-40 (agency established link between its policy that employees carry identification cards and its goal of safeguarding personnel); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Nat'l Archives and Record Admin. Council of AFGE, Locals (Council 1260)</span>, 31 FLRA 878, 881 (1988) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Council 1260</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 217</span>, 21 FLRA at 65-66 (agencies established link between uniform policies and goals of safeguarding personnel). <span class="Italic">Cf. NTEU</span>, 61 FLRA 48, 51 (2005) (Member Armendariz dissenting) (agency did not establish link between policy of permitting only certain employees to wear cargo shorts and goal of safeguarding employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether the proposals deviate from or modify the agency's internal security policy, Proposal 2 provides that grooming standards are not necessary to identify officers to the public. As we have determined that there is a reasonable link between the Agency's grooming standards policy and the purpose of identifying its officers to the public, the proposal, which would establish that there is no such relationship, modifies the Agency's grooming standards policy. As such<span class="Italic">, </span>we find that Proposal 2 affects the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices<span class="Italic">. See NTEU, </span>59 FLRA at 981.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 3 requires that, when they are on duty, officers' attire and appearance will be neat, clean, and professional. We note that the Agency's grooming standards policy states that officers "are expected to present a neat, clean, and professional image consistent with the high regard in which this agency and its officers/employees are held. As the meaning of the proposal and the Agency's policy--requiring officers to present themselves in a neat, clean, and professional manner--is the same, it does not appear that Proposal 3, on its face, requires a modification to or deviation from the Agency's policy. However, even assuming Proposal 3 is consistent with the Agency's policy, that alone would not establish that the proposal is negotiable because, under Authority precedent, proposals that are nonnegotiable because they affect a management right do not become negotiable because they simply restate an existing agency policy or practice. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3509</span>, 46 FLRA 1590, 1617-18 (1993). As the inclusion of the policy in the agreement would prevent an agency from changing the policy during the life of the agreement, a proposal restating that policy affects the applicable management right. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Accordingly, as Proposal 3 would limit the Agency's ability to change its policy in the future, we find that the proposal affects the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 4 would permit officers to exhibit "contemporary grooming styles," consistent with any grooming standards MOU negotiated by the parties, provided such deviations do not create safety hazards or reduce the officers' ability to deal with the public. There is no indication that the proposal would require officers to abide by any grooming standards that were not negotiated into an MOU by the parties. As such, the proposal would permit officers to deviate from the Agency's grooming standards policy and effectively require the Agency to grant exceptions to its grooming standards policy. Accordingly, Proposal 4 affects the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See Def. Logistics Council of AFGE Locals</span>, 20 FLRA 166, 168 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds by Def. Logistics Council of AFGE Locals v. FLRA</span>, 810 F.2d 234, 240 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (proposal providing exceptions to agency's policy affected right to determine its internal security practice) (<span class="Italic">Def. Logistics Council</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Proposal 3 constitutes an appropriate arrangement and Proposals 2 and 4 do not constitute appropriate arrangements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority applies the framework in <span class="Italic">NAGE</span>, <span class="Italic">Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Doing so, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 31; <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those <span id="page_846"></span>effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31. The claimed arrangement must be sufficiently tailored to compensate employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NAGE, Local R1-100</span>, 39 FLRA 762, 766 (1991). If the proposal is an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management right. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33. In making this determination, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the purposes of this decision, we assume that Proposal 2 is a sufficiently tailored arrangement. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, </span>59 FLRA 844, 847 (2004). With regard to whether the proposal is appropriate, the Union claims that it benefits employees by providing them with discretion over their appearance. Nevertheless, as the Agency contends, the proposal would prevent the Agency from requiring officers to adhere to any grooming standards designed to ensure that the officers are readily identifiable to the public. Accordingly, the proposal would significantly burden the Agency by preventing it from carrying out its internal security practice and the purposes for which it was adopted. On balance, we conclude that the significant burden on management's right outweighs the benefit the proposal would afford employees. Therefore, the proposal excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices and is not an appropriate arrangement.[11] <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA at 982.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11] Consistent with this finding, it is unnecessary to address the Agency's contention that Proposal 2 also excessively interferes with its right to determine the means of performing work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding whether Proposal 3 is an appropriate arrangement, the Agency does not dispute that it is an arrangement; the Agency argues only that it is not an appropriate arrangement because it excessively interferes with management's right. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 55 FLRA 1174, 1175 (1999) (Member Wasserman dissenting on other grounds). The Union claims that the proposal benefits employees by providing standards concerning appropriate personal appearance and, thus, helps officers avoid discipline. The Agency, on the other hand, does not establish how a proposal requiring that officers be neat, clean, and professional burdens the Agency's exercise of its management rights, especially since there is no argument or other basis to conclude that the Agency would ever desire a different policy. For the same reason, the fact that the proposal prevents the Agency from modifying its standards does not, by itself, justify finding that the proposal's burden on management's right outweighs the proposal's benefits to employees. In this connection, &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute entitles the Union to bargain over proposals that do not excessively interfere with the Agency's rights, including proposals that modify the Agency's decision regarding that right. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R5-</span>184, 51 FLRA 386, 392 (1995). In these circumstances, we find that Proposal 3 does not excessively interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices and, thus, is an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to Proposal 4, assuming the proposal constitutes a sufficiently tailored arrangement, we find that it is not appropriate. The Union asserts that the proposal benefits officers by giving them discretion over their personal appearance and allowing them to abide by contemporary grooming styles when on duty. The Agency contends that, by allowing employees "latitude" in their grooming choices, the proposal distracts Agency officials and negatively impacts the accomplishment of the Agency's mission. Although Proposal 4 would provide employees with greater discretion over their appearance, the proposal would require the Agency to permit employees to exhibit undefined and ambiguous "contemporary grooming styles." As such, the proposal significantly interferes with the Agency's decision to have a "well-defined" grooming standards policy. In addition, the proposal would limit the Agency's discretion to prohibit any contemporary grooming styles it deems in conflict with its grooming standards policy and security goals. On balance, the burden on the Agency's ability to exercise its management right outweighs the benefit the proposal would afford to the officers. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA at 982. Accordingly, we find that the proposal excessively interferes with the Agency's internal security practices right and does not constitute an appropriate arrangement.[12]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12] Consistent with this finding, it is unnecessary to address the Agency's contention that Proposal 4 also excessively interferes with its right to determine the means of performing work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;Proposal 3 does not affect management's right to determine the means of performing work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have found that Proposal 3 does not excessively interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices, it is necessary to address whether, as the Agency contends, the proposal affects management's right to determine the means of performing work. In determining whether a proposal affects the right to determine the means of performing work, the Authority first examines whether the proposal concerns a "means." In this regard, the Authority construes the term "means" to refer to "any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work." <span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local 49</span>, 52 FLRA 813, 818 (1996). Second, it must be shown that: (1) there is a direct and integral relationship between the particular methods or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission; and (2) the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Council of GSA Locals, Council 236</span>, 55 FLRA 449, 452 (1999) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Council 236</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the above, the Authority has held that an agency's determination that "uniformed officers must adhere to grooming standards to ensure that such officers are readily recognized" constitutes a determination regarding the means of performing work. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv</span>, 31 FLRA 1123, 1136 (1988) (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>);<span class="Italic"> see NAGE</span>, 26 FLRA at 526-28; <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Nat'l Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv. Council,</span> 8 FLRA 347, 351 (1982) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>). The Authority also held that, with respect to National Guard technicians, grooming standards "are so inextricably related to the wearing of the military uniform that the standards...must be considered an inextricable part of the uniform wearing requirement." <span class="Italic">NAGE</span>, 26 FLRA at 527.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, not all proposals to modify an agency's determination regarding grooming standards affect the right to determine means of performing work. In this regard, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the Authority have determined that proposals providing grooming standards that vary from an agency's standards but do not impede the public's recognition of an agency's uniformed officers do not affect the right to determine the means of performing work. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Indian Health Serv., Okla. City v. FLRA</span>, 885 F.2d 911, 916-17 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">DHHS</span>);<span class="Italic"> DOJ</span>, 31 FLRA at 1136; <span class="Italic">see also NAGE, Serv. Employees Int'l Union, AFL-CIO</span>, 23 FLRA 730, 731-32 (1986); <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 8 FLRA at 353. In <span class="Italic">DHHS</span>, the court--addressing proposals involving uniform and dress code requirements, including grooming standards--found that the determination of whether a proposal affects management's right to determine the means of performing work depends on "the degree of departure from agency policy implicit in a particular union proposal, the type of agency involved, and the agency's specific needs and requirements." <span class="Italic">DHHS</span>, 885 F.2d at 917. The court found that a proposal to "completely eliminate, vitiate, or make optional an agency's requirements...is not subject to bargaining." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 916. By contrast, according to the court, proposals providing grooming standards that vary from those adopted by an agency "are not beyond the scope of collective bargaining even if they differ in details from the methods and means adopted by that agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 916-17. As the court observed in another decision concerning the uniforms worn by prison guards, the appropriate inquiry is "whether a union counter-proposal permits the accomplishment of the agency's mission-related purpose while modifying some particulars of its policy." <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 2441 v. FLRA,</span> 864 F.2d 178, 187 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2441 v. FLRA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency states that its mission is "preventing terrorists and terrorists['] weapons from entering the United States[.] This critical mission supports the Agency's decision to implement a grooming standards policy designed to ensure that its officers are readily identifiable to the public and effectively employ law enforcement techniques. However, nothing in Proposal 3 or its requirement that officers be neat, clean, and professional is at odds with the Agency's stated mission. Further, Proposal 3 is not of such a "degree of departure" from the Agency's policy so as to affect the Agency's right to determine the means of performing work. In fact, the proposal is consistent with the Agency's goal of having professional, identifiable officers and does not "completely eliminate" or "make optional" the Agency's grooming standards policy. <span class="Italic">See DHHS</span>, 885 F.2d at 916-17; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2441 v. FLRA</span>, 864 F.2d at 184. In this regard, <span class="Italic">DHHS</span> makes clear that where, as here, the proposal only "provid[es] for grooming standards which vary" from those adopted by the agency, the proposal does not "completely eliminate" the agency's policy and, thus, does not affect management's right. <span class="Italic">DHHS</span>, 885 F.2d at 917, 916. Accordingly, applying the <span class="Italic">DHHS </span>factors, we conclude that the proposal does not affect the Agency's right to determine the means of performing work.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> grooming standards decision was affirmed on judicial review as to Proposals 2 and 3, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 550 F.3d 1148, 1150-54 (D.C. Cir. 2008):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case presents the question whether the Federal Labor Relations Authority reasonably concluded that customs officers endanger themselves by growing certain styles of hair, beards, and mustaches. Petitioner National Treasury Employees Union argues that the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) must negotiate over three union proposals to modify CBP's grooming standards policy. CBP claims that because these proposals would affect its right to determine its internal security practices, they are nonnegotiable. The union disagrees and argues in the alternative that its proposals were appropriate <span id="page_847"></span>arrangements that did not excessively interfere with CBP's management rights. While we agree that CBP has no obligation to negotiate over two of the union's proposals, we remand the third proposal to the Authority to determine whether it represents an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-7135, requires federal agencies to bargain with public employee unions over employment conditions, but renders certain management rights nonnegotiable, including an agency's right to determine its "internal security practices," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). When a union submits a proposal that would affect an agency's internal security practices, the agency can invoke this provision to relieve it of the obligation to negotiate over the proposal. To find that a proposal would affect the agency's right to determine its internal security practices, the Federal Labor Relations Authority must determine that the agency's policy is reasonably linked to the security of its operations, and that the union's proposal deviates from or modifies the policy. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span> ("NTEUI"), 404 F.3d 454, 456-57 (D.C. Cir. 2005). An agency may nevertheless be required to negotiate over a proposal which would affect its right to determine its internal security practices if the union can establish that the proposal represents an "appropriate arrangement[ ] for employees adversely affected" by the agency's exercise of that right. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing whether a proposal that would affect an agency's right to determine its internal security practices is nonetheless negotiable as an appropriate arrangement, the Authority applies the "KANG test." <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span> ("<span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>"), 437 F.3d 1248, 1252-53 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citing <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Employees, Local R14-87</span> ("<span class="Italic">Kansas Army National Guard</span>" or "<span class="Italic">KANG</span>"), 21 F.L.R.A. 24 (1986)). Under this test, the Authority requires the union to establish that the proposal is in fact intended as an arrangement to benefit employees. If the union does so, then the Authority balances the "'practical needs of employees and managers" to see if the proposal "'excessively interferes" with management rights. <span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>, 437 F.3d at 1253 (quoting <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. at 31-32).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, in order to conclude that an agency has no obligation to negotiate over a proposal, the Authority must determine, first, that the proposal would affect the agency's right to determine its internal security practices and, second, that the proposal does not qualify as an appropriate arrangement. While the Authority may make the first determination without requiring the agency to produce evidence if the connection is obvious, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Def. Fort Bragg Dependents Sch.</span>, 49 F.L.R.A. 333, 343 (1994), its second determination must be supported by record evidence, e.g., <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, 404 F.3d at 458.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As part of the process of establishing the Department of Homeland Security, Congress created the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) from components of the Department of Agriculture and the former Immigration and Naturalization Service and U.S. Customs Service. Although CBP employees perform various customs-related functions, this case concerns only those uniformed officers stationed at ports of entry to the United States and charged with preventing illegal entry of individuals and contraband.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In late 2003, several months after CBP's formation, the agency replaced the various predecessor agency uniforms with a single uniform worn throughout the agency. The next year, CBP unilaterally implemented a grooming standards policy that superseded those of the predecessor agencies. In addition to requiring officers to style their hair in accordance with several specifications, the policy prohibited all facial hair other than beards maintained for medical reasons and "conservative" mustaches kept within "the corners of the mouth" and above "the upper vermillion of the lip." CUSTOMS &#x0026; BORDER PROTECTION, DEP'T OF HOMELAND SEC., CBP NATIONAL UNIFORM PROGRAM ch. 3, at 6 (2004) ("CBP POLICY").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner National Treasury Employees Union filed a grievance over CBP's unilateral implementation of these policies. Agreeing with the union on this point, the Authority affirmed an arbitrator's award prohibiting the agency from implementing the policy until the completion of bargaining.<span class="Italic"> Nat'l Treasury Employees Union</span>, 62 F.L.R.A. 263 (2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As part of the bargaining process, the union submitted several proposals to modify the grooming standards policy, of which only Proposals 2, 4, and 6 are at issue here. Proposal 2 sought to secure CBP's agreement that "the official uniform, when worn in its entirety, affords sufficient identification of the officer as a representative of CBP." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Employees Union</span> ("Negotiability Order"), 62 F.L.R.A. 267, 269 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under Proposal 4, uniformed officers could exhibit "contemporary grooming styles, subject to the terms of [the agreement between the union and CBP], provided that the styles do not create a health or safety hazard, or interfere with or tend to interfere with the accomplishment of the mission of CBP in a particular situation by reducing the ability to deal effectively with either the public, fellow employees, other government agencies or other organization entities."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> (internal quotation marks omitted). The relevant portion of Proposal 6 would permit neatly-trimmed beards and facial hair of no more than one inch in length "except where there is a reasonable likelihood that an officer will need to use a respirator or other device in the performance of his job duties and the device requires a cleanly shaven face."<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>at 274.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority concluded that all three proposals were nonnegotiable.&#x2003;Proposals 2 and 4, it found, would affect CBP's right to determine its internal security practices by interfering with CBP's linked goals of identifying officers as such and presenting a professional image to the public.<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>at 270-72. The Authority then concluded that because each proposal would excessively interfere with management rights Proposal 4 by injecting an "undefined and ambiguous" element into CBP's policy, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 273, and Proposal 2 by preventing CBP from requiring any grooming standards policy on the basis of officer identification,<span class="Italic"> id.</span> at 272--neither qualified as an appropriate arrangement. As to Proposal 6, the Authority found that the relevant language would affect CBP's right to determine its internal security practices because the proposal failed to account for emergency situations where officers might have to use respirators to save their own or others' lives and there was no time to shave. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 278. It also found that Proposal 6 did not qualify as an appropriate arrangement because the risk of such emergency situations outweighed the benefit the proposal would confer on officers.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 278-79.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioning for review, the union argues that the Authority failed to base its findings on record evidence and reached an unreasonable conclusion. As to Proposals 2 and 4, the union points out that the only evidence CBP submitted was the grooming standards policy itself and similar policies of other law enforcement agencies and military units, and argues that the Authority did not rely on the evidence in any event. Regarding Proposal 6, the union counters the Authority's concerns about respirators by pointing to uncontroverted record evidence that the officers were neither subject to any respirator policy nor even issued respirators. Reviewing under the arbitrary and capricious standard, e.g.,<span class="Italic"> Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms v. FLRA</span>, 464 U.S. 89, 97 n.7 (1983), we consider Proposals 2 and 4 in Section II and Proposal 6 in Section III.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union argues that the Authority erred in finding that Proposals 2 and 4 would affect CBP's right to determine its internal security practices and that they did not qualify as appropriate arrangements. We reject both contentions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority accepted CBP's explanation that its grooming standards policy was intended to "safeguard its uniformed officers by ensuring that they are readily identifiable to the public and by increasing the officers' ability to effectively employ law enforcement techniques." Negotiability Order, 62 F.L.R.A. at 271. Accordingly, it found CBP to have established a reasonable link between its grooming standards policy and its internal security goals.<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>It then found that Proposal 2, by entirely negating the link between officer grooming and officer identification, and Proposal 4, by "effectively requir[ing] the Agency to grant exceptions," would each modify the grooming standards policy.<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>at 272. As a result, the Authority concluded that both proposals would affect CBP's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union first argues that the Authority should have based its conclusion on record evidence and didn't. But it did. CBP submitted as evidence its judgment that "[a] good personal appearance adds to [CBP officers'] prestige, and is an essential part of 'officer presence,' i.e. officer safety." CBP POLICY, ch. 3, at 3;<span class="Italic"> see also id.</span> ("It is...imperative to the CBP mission that officers project a neutral image that minimizes public antagonism and ensures approachability by the broadest possible spectrum of the domestic and international public. Extremes and fads in personal appearance and attire are, therefore, prohibited...."). Though this assessment appears in the document setting forth the grooming standards policy's requirements, it clearly represents an independent statement of CBP's judgment regarding the connection between the policy and its security, and the union has provided no reason for treating this evidence as outside the record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Authority included no citation to this evidence, referring only to CBP's statements of its litigation position, those litigation statements articulated the same reasoning as the record evidence. <span class="Italic">Compare Negotiability Order</span>, 62 F.L.R.A. at 271-72, with CBP POLICY, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> ch. 3, at 2-3. To be sure, the Authority would have aided our review by actually citing the record evidence, but we have no doubt that the evidence formed the basis of its decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2366, AFL-CIO v. FLRA</span>, 114 F.3d 1214,1218 (D.C. Cir. 1997) ("'[W]e will...uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency's path may reasonably be discerned.'..." (quoting <span class="Italic">Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.</span>, 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983))).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the union's claim that even if the Authority relied on record evidence, its finding of a reasonable link between the agency's policy and its internal security was nonetheless substantively arbitrary and capricious. According to the union, the Authority should have followed its reasoning in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 61 F.L.R.A. 48 (2005), where it found aspects of CBP's uniform policy not reasonably linked to <span id="page_848"></span>its internal security practices. But that case considered a uniform policy not applied consistently to all officers. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 51 ("[T]he Agency fails to explain why uniformed personnel at the locations excepted from the policy [requiring trousers] are sufficiently identifiable for security purposes while wearing shorts, but such personnel in every other Class 3 work environment would not be."). As CBP applies the grooming standards policy at issue here consistently, the Authority's earlier decision is of little relevance. That some of CBP's predecessor agencies had different grooming standards policies alters this conclusion not at all: CBP need show only that its policy is reasonably linked to its internal security, not that the policy is the only possible way to preserve internal security. We therefore have no basis for second-guessing the Authority's reasonable conclusion that officer grooming provides incremental benefits to officer identification and self-presentation beyond the mere wearing of a uniform, and thus that CBP's grooming standards policy is reasonably linked to its internal security practices. As the Authority reasonably concluded based on record evidence contained in CBP's policy that Proposals 2 and 4 would affect CBP's right to determine its internal security practices, we need not decide whether it relied on the evidence of practices of other law enforcement agencies, or whether it could properly have reached this conclusion without relying on any evidence whatsoever.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For similar reasons, the Authority reasonably concluded that Proposals 2 and 4 are not appropriate arrangements under the KANG test. Given the Authority's acknowledgment that the proposals were intended as arrangements, the only remaining issue is whether the Authority reasonably found that they would "excessively interfere[ ]" with management rights,<span class="Italic"> KANG</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. at 31. The Authority reasoned that Proposal 2, by deeming grooming standards irrelevant for the identification of uniformed officers, would completely "prevent the Agency from requiring officers to adhere to any grooming standards designed to ensure that the officers are readily identifiable to the public." Negotiability Order, 62 F.L.R.A. at 272. Similarly, the Authority found that Proposal 4's license to display "undefined and ambiguous 'contemporary grooming styles,'"<span class="Italic"> id. </span>at 273, would prevent CBP from enforcing a clearly-defined grooming standards policy. For these reasons, the Authority concluded that Proposals 2 and 4 would excessively interfere with CBP's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relying on the record evidence discussed above, the Authority identified and considered the interests at stake, and we have no cause to overturn its reasonable weighing of those interests. Contrary to the union's argument, this case is unlike two recent decisions where we concluded that the Authority failed to address record evidence that suggested internal inconsistencies in the agency's policy. <span class="Italic">See NTEU I</span>, 404 F.3d at 458;<span class="Italic"> NTEU II, </span>437 F.3d at 1254-55. Here, relying on evidence demonstrating the connection between CBP's grooming standards policy and its internal security, the Authority reasonably found that the union's proposals would excessively interfere with agency security by effectively nullifying CBP's decision to adopt a clear and standardized policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union leans heavily on<span class="Italic"> American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, National INS Council,</span> 8 F.L.R.A. 347 (1982), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, INS v. FLRA</span>, 709 F.2d 724 (D.C. Cir. 1983), in which the Authority found a proposal similar to Proposal 4 negotiable as an appropriate arrangement.<span class="Italic"> Nat'l INS Council,</span> 8 F.L.R.A. at 353. But the Authority decided that case under its pre-KANG standard. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 353. And although in one post-KANG case the Authority applied National INS Council's mode of analysis in order to answer a different legal question than the one at issue in KANG, <span class="Italic">see Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 31 F.L.R.A. 1123, 1136 (1988), numerous cases have since made clear that KANG sets forth the standard for appropriate arrangement determinations, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, P.R. Army v. FLRA</span>, 534 F.3d 772, 777 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Neither of these cases, therefore, provides a reason to upset the Authority's balancing of interests under the KANG test. Finally, the union's contrary argument notwithstanding, the Authority's decision in the related grievance proceeding, <span class="Italic">supra</span> at 4, has no bearing upon the present controversy, as it involved a different legal question and was not part of the record before the Authority here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We thus conclude that the Authority acted neither arbitrarily nor capriciously in determining that Proposals 2 and 4 are nonnegotiable.</p>
