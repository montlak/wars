<p class="noindent">Assuming an arrangements clause properly interpreted by an arbitrator, and a personnel action (or failure to implement one), the violation of a collective bargaining agreement supports a determination of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Anniston Army Depot and AFGE Local 1945</span>, 46 FLRA 974, 976 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 59 FLRA 511 (2003) (violation of contract provision resulting in unwarranted broadening of area of consideration supported award of back pay when arbitrator properly concluded that grievant would have been selected but for expanded area of consideration); <span class="Italic">USDA, FGIS and AFGE Local 3157</span>, 59 FLRA 411 (2003) (breach of collective agreement supported arbitrator's finding of unjustified or unwarranted personnel action); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3134 and SBA Region 2</span>, 56 FLRA 983, 984 (2000) (back pay properly awarded for failure to promote grievant in violation of negotiated agreement when grievant successfully completed training program); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 55 FLRA 1019, 1022-23 (1999) (sustaining award of promotion based on violation of negotiated agreement); <span class="Italic">Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr. and Bremerton Metal Trades Council</span>, 55 FLRA 884, 887 (1999) ("[A]n arbitrator may properly order an employee to be selected for promotion when the arbitrator finds that the employee was affected by an improper agency action that directly resulted in the failure of the employee to be promoted.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The critical findings in a back pay award involving a promotion are that: an agency personnel action involving the grievant was unjustified or unwarranted; the action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials; and but for the action, the grievant would otherwise not have suffered the withdrawal or reduction of pay, allowances, or differential. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 31 and VAMC, Cleveland</span>, 41 FLRA 514, 517 (1991). The "but for" test was explained in <span class="Italic">VA Hosp. and AFGE Lodge 2201</span>, 4 FLRA 419, 423-25 (1980), considering an exception based upon the agency's interpretation of the Back Pay Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its third exception the Agency contends that the Arbitrator's award of retroactive promotion with backpay is contrary to the Back Pay Act of 1966. In support of this exception, the Agency argues, on the basis of the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>[, 424 U.S. 392 (1976)], that the grievant has not suffered a withdrawal or reduction of pay within the meaning of the Back Pay Act because the grievant has never been appointed to the higher grade level of the foreman position....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Agency has failed to demonstrate in what manner the Arbitrator's award, ordering the grievant retroactively promoted with backpay, is inconsistent with the Back Pay Act. It is well established that the Back Pay Act provides the appropriate authority to remedy an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that has denied an aggrieved employee a promotion that the employee would otherwise have received.... The Arbitrator...specifically found that the "Grievant, who was the only other candidate rated as 'highly qualified,' would have been selected but for the improper selection of the [employee selected]." Thus, the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator failed to make the findings requisite to a proper order of retroactive promotion with backpay pursuant to the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Instead, the Agency has argued, citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Tistan, supra</span>, that the grievant has not suffered withdrawal or reduction of pay...because the grievant had never been appointed to the higher grade level of the foreman position. However, as was noted, it is well established that the Back Pay Act provides the appropriate authority to remedy an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that has denied an aggrieved employee a promotion that the employee would otherwise have received. Moreover, the relevant holding of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Testan</span> was only that the Back Pay Act did not provide a statutory entitlement to recover pay or allowances for a period of an alleged wrongful civil service classification....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has also argued, citing the Comptroller General's decision in <span class="Italic">Matter of Janice Levy</span>--<span class="Italic">Arbitration Award of Retroactive Promotion and Backpay</span>, B-190408 December 21, 1977, that only violations of negotiated agreement provisions constituting nondiscretionary agency policies will support retroactive promotion with backpay.... In <span class="Italic">Janice Levy</span> the arbitrator determined that the grievant would have received her career ladder promotion on an earlier date but for the agency's violation of a provision of its negotiated agreement. The Comptroller General determined that the agreement provision was not nondiscretionary.... That provision provided:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Employer and the Union agree to the principle of equal pay for substantially equal work as well as providing distinctions in pay that are consistent with distinctions in work and work performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, however, the Arbitrator determined that the Activity violated the parties' negotiated agreement as a result of its failure to comply with prescribed requirements of its own merit promotion plan. The Arbitrator further determined that but for the improper selection, the grievant would have been selected for promotion. Thus, the Agency has not demonstrated that the prescribed requirements found violated by the Arbitrator in this case are in any manner similar to the agreement provision involved in <span class="Italic">Janice Levy</span>. As previously indicated, it is well established that in the circumstances of this case where the Arbitrator has specifically found that but for management's failure to follow prescribed requirements of its merit promotion plan, the selecting official would originally have selected the grievant, the Arbitrator may direct that the grievant be retroactively promoted with backpay to the position for which the grievant otherwise would have been selected....</p>
<p class="noindent">Remanding an award ordering a promotion by reason of a "but for" finding, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Redstone Arsenal and AFGE Local 1858,</span> 68 FLRA 123, 124 (2014) (Member Pizzella dissenting), concluded:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an arbitrator fails to make an explicit finding of the causal connection required under the Act, the Authority has stated that "the absence of such language will not be dispositive if the requisite finding of a causal connection is otherwise apparent."[15] However, the Authority has declined to find the required causal connection where, for example, an arbitrator's findings did not include any commentary on why the grievant was best qualified for the position,[16] or on what would have happened had the agency not violated the negotiated selection procedures.[17] In this case, the Arbitrator made no findings as to how the grievant--or the rest of the applicants--would have scored if the interviews had been conducted in accordance with the parties' agreement and the interview scores had been properly adjusted to reflect the weight agreed to by the parties. As such, we are unable to determine whether the Arbitrator evaluated the evidence cited by the Union in its opposition. And because the Arbitrator made no explicit finding that the grievant would have been selected, but for the Agency's violations, we are unable to determine whether the award is consistent with the Act.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the first requirement, a violation of an applicable law, rule, regulation, or provision of a collective-bargaining agreement constitutes an "unjustified or unwarranted personnel action."[19] As well, an arbitrator's finding of a contract violation satisfies the first requirement even if the arbitrator fails to specify what contract provision was violated.[20]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency committed an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action without finding a violation of law or provision of the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We read the award quite differently.&#x2003;The Arbitrator cited to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.203 and the grievant's right to be treated fairly under &#x00A7; 6(a)(3) of the parties' agreement. The Arbitrator found that the Agency's human resources manager failed to notice the discrepancy of the selectee's addresses because its hiring practices verified only the applicant's residential address, and the warden "simply ignored his own commuting area requirements." As a result, the Arbitrator found that the Agency improperly selected an unqualified applicant. Thus, read in context, the reasonable reading of the award is that the Arbitrator found the Agency's <span id="page_2035"></span>failure to implement its own local commuting area requirement violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.203 and the grievant's right to be treated fairly under &#x00A7; 6(a)(3) of the parties' agreement.[24] Therefore, the award satisfies the first requirement of the BPA.[25]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the second requirement, the Agency argues that the backpay award is deficient because there is no causal connection between the Agency's selection and grievant's reduction of pay. In the Agency's view, the grievant did not suffer any monetary loss when he was not promoted because the warden could have selected a candidate from the best-qualified list other than the grievant. As discussed in the preliminary matter, we note that there is no evidence that the Agency raised such an argument at arbitration; and merely providing the best-qualified list to the Arbitrator does not thereby raise related arguments, especially a speculative one, of the selection of another candidate.[27] Accordingly, we find that &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2425.4(c) and 2429.5 of the Authority's regulations bar the Agency's argument that another allegedly best-qualified applicant other than the grievant could have been selected for the position.[28]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The second BPA requirement is satisfied if there is a showing of a causal connection between the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action and the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay.[29] In this regard, the Authority has stated that a causal connection finding may be implicit in the record and the award.[30]</p>

The Arbitrator found that the position at issue was a "promotion." We defer to the Arbitrator's factual findings in the absence of a successful nonfact exception.[32] Thus, the Arbitrator's findings satisfy the requisite casual connection, had the Agency applied its local commuting area requirement, the grievant would have been selected for the promotion and been entitled to promotion pay.[33]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether a loss of promotion pay qualified as a reduction of pay under the BPA, the Authority has found that an arbitrator's award ordering retroactive promotion with backpay satisfied the requirements of the BPA when an arbitrator finds that the grievant would have been promoted but for the Agency's violation of the grievant's priority consideration under a collective-bargaining agreement.[34] Because the Arbitrator found, and the Agency concedes,[35] that the sports specialist position was a <span class="Italic">promotional</span> position for the grievant,[36] the Arbitrator thus found a direct causal connection between the Agency's violation of &#x00A7; 351.203 and the grievant's loss of promotion pay.

<p class="noindent">Although an arbitrator resolved that the agency violated the negotiated agreement by failing to select the grievant for promotion and that its actions were discriminatory, reflecting anti-union animus, and based on nonmerit factors rather than job related criteria, he did not find that the grievant would have been selected but for the unwarranted actions.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's role in reviewing arbitration awards depends on the nature of the exceptions raised by the appealing party. <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686 (D.C. Cir. 1994). In <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 24 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995), the Authority stated that if the arbitrator's decision is challenged on the ground that it is contrary to any law, rule, or regulation, the Authority will review the legal question <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. In applying a standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1437 and U.S. Department of the Army, Army Research, Development and Engineering Center</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has alleged that the remedy portion of the award violates its management rights under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. The Authority's framework for resolving exceptions alleging that an award violates management's rights under section 7106 of the Statute is set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C. and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 201</span>, 53 FLRA 146, 151-54 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>). Upon finding that the award affects a management right under section 7106(a), the Authority applies a two-prong test. Under prong I of this framework, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 153. If the award provides such a remedy, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong I of the framework and will then address prong II. Under prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 154. If the arbitrator's remedy reflects such a reconstruction, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong II. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that even though the award affects management rights, it satisfies both prong I and II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator's award affects management's rights</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that an award requiring an agency to make an actual selection for an appointment affects management's right to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Council 220 and Social Security Administration, Region VI, Dallas, Texas</span>, 54 FLRA No. 107, slip op. at 10 (1998) (Authority held that an award which placed the grievant in a position affected management's right to select); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, San Francisco Region and American Federation of Government Employees, Council 147</span>, 48 FLRA 293, 302 (1993) (Authority found that an award ordering retroactive promotion of the grievants affected, but did not interfere with, management's right to select). Here, the award orders the grievant to be placed, retroactively, into a GS-13 PA position. Based on Authority precedent, the award affects management's right to select.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator's award satisfies prong I of BEP</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to place the grievant in a PA position to remedy the Agency's conceded violation of Article 26, <span id="page_2036"></span>section 11(C) of the parties' agreement. Section 11(C), as interpreted by the Arbitrator, requires the Agency's selecting official to give serious consideration to applicants on the BQ list who have been stagnated in grade. The Arbitrator's interpretation of section 11(C), and his finding that the Agency violated this provision, demonstrates the Arbitrator's intention to enforce a provision in the parties' agreement within the meaning of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> prong I. As there is no contention that this provision was unenforceable within the meaning of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> prong I, we will proceed to evaluate the award under prong II. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Coatesville, Pennsylvania and National Association of Government Employees, Local R3-35</span>, 53 FLRA 1426, 1429 (1998) (Authority found that there was no contention that the provision at issue was unenforceable); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Warner Robins Air Force Base, Georgia and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 987</span>, 53 FLRA 1344, 1348 (1998) (Authority found that there was no contention that the provision at issue was unenforceable).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator's award satisfies prong II of BEP</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong II, the remedy awarded must reflect a reconstruction of what the agency would have done if management had not violated the agreement provision on a section 7106(b) matter. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 154. Here, the Arbitrator ordered the grievant to be placed in a PA position with full backpay, and any other attendant benefits, retroactive to the date of the initial selection for the PA position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously indicated, the Arbitrator made detailed findings that the grievant was more qualified than the selectee for at least one of the PA positions. Specifically, the Arbitrator found that, had the grievant been given serious consideration under the parties' agreement, "[the grievant] would have been selected over [the selectee]." In this connection, the Arbitrator stated that the presence of other grade-stagnated candidates on the BQ list did not "nullify" the Arbitrator's conclusion that the grievant would have been selected. The Arbitrator determined that "no evidence was submitted as to those candidates' respective qualifications, which may not be equal to the [g]rievant's qualifications." Based on these findings, the Arbitrator concluded that, had the Agency not violated Article 26, section 11(C) of the parties' agreement, the Agency would have selected the grievant over the selectee for the PA position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude from the foregoing that the award reflects the Arbitrator's reconstruction of what the Agency would have done, absent the Agency's violation of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Ogden Air Logistics Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1592</span>, 54 FLRA 487, 492-93 (1998). Accordingly, we find that the Agency has not established that the award is deficient under prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. In so finding, we conclude that the grievant's retroactive promotion, as ordered by the Arbitrator, was an appropriate remedy for the Agency's violation and is not contrary to management's right to select. Thus, the Agency's exception is denied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator's award does not violate the Back Pay Act</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also contends that the award is contrary to the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596. According to the Agency, the Arbitrator "did not expressly find that [the Agency's violation of Article 26, section 11(C)] resulted in the failure of the grievant to be promoted when she otherwise definitely would have been[.]" Therefore, the Agency claims that there was "clearly no way to know that 'but for' the [Agency's violation]...that the grievant would certainly have been selected."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Back Pay Act, an award of backpay is authorized only where an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances or differentials.[6] <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 54 FLRA No. 106, slip op at 9-10 (1998) (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Recently in <span class="Italic">HHS</span>, the Authority recognized that the "but for" step of the Authority's analysis was not a separate, independent element of the Back Pay Act, but instead "amplifie[d]" the statutory language of the Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 10. In clarifying the Act's legal requirements, the Authority stated that an award of backpay under the Act is authorized only if an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action "has resulted in" the withdrawal or reduction of an employee's pay, allowances or differentials. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, <span class="Italic">citing</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, contrary to the assertions of the Agency, the Arbitrator's explicit findings fulfill the criteria for an award of backpay under the Back Pay Act. With regard to the first requirement, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 26, section 11(C) of the parties' agreement by not seriously considering the grievant for selection to one of the three available PA positions. This finding represented the Arbitrator's determination that the Agency committed an unwarranted personnel action. As to the second requirement, the Arbitrator found that the unwarranted personnel action resulted in the grievant's nonselection for promotion, and loss of backpay and other attendant benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> Award at 17 ("had the [g]rievant's application been given serious consideration, [the grievant] would have been selected over [the selectee]"). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">HHS</span>, 54 FLRA slip op. at 11-12; <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Navajo Area Indian Health Service and Laborers' International Union of North America, Navajo Nation Health Care Employees, Local 1376</span>, 50 FLRA 383, 385 (1995). Thus, we find that the award of retroactive promotion with backpay complies with the Back Pay Act. Accordingly, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA, OHA and AFGE Local 3627</span>, 54 FLRA 609, 612-14 (1998), presents an award that failed properly to demonstrate the grievant would have been promoted were there no contract violation:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the second and third Back Pay Act requirements, the Authority has repeatedly stated that "the 'but for' test does not require a 'specific recitation of certain words and phrases' to establish a direct connection between an unwarranted or unjustified personnel action and an employee's loss of pay or differentials." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 987</span>, 52 FLRA 938, 942 (1997) (quoting <span class="Italic">Department of Justice</span>, 51 FLRA at 1098).

Thus, where an arbitrator awards a retroactive promotion and backpay under the Back Pay Act and an agency claims that such an award is deficient under that Act, the Authority reviews the award for evidence of finding by the arbitrator of a causal connection between an unwarranted agency personnel action and an agency's failure to promote an employee, not for a specific recitation the requisite Back Pay Act findings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VA Cleveland</span>, 41 FLRA at 518.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VA Cleveland</span>, 41 FLRA at 517-19, the Authority upheld an award of a retroactive promotion with backpay, finding that, implicit in the record and the award, was a direct connection between the unjustified and unwarranted inclusion of a particular evaluation factor in the rating and ranking process, and the grievant's failure to be one of the six candidates selected for promotion. In that case, the Arbitrator specifically reviewed the ratings of the candidates, found that the use of leave in those ratings was unfair and unjust, and ordered the grievant promoted. Reviewing the record, the Authority noted that if the ratings were reconstructed to delete the evaluation factor involving leave, the grievant's overall ranking would have placed her fourth among the top six rated candidates--all of which the Agency conceded were selected. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Air station Mirimar, San Diego, California and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3723</span>, 48 FLRA 47, 51-52 (1993) (upholding award where the arbitrator found that the grievant, being the second highest rated, was entitled to promotion because the agency improperly considered the application of the selected employee who had been ranked highest). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Family Support Administration, Washington, D.C. and National Treasury Employee Union, Local 250</span>, 42 FLRA 347, 359 (1991) ("but for" finding was not implicit from the record because the arbitrator's findings only established that the selection process violated the parties' agreement and did not support a conclusion that the grievant would have been selected if the violations had not occurred) (<span class="Italic">Health and Human Services</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator reviewed the selection process, including the ratings of the applicants and, rejecting the Agency's proffered justification for its selections, found that the selection process did not conform to the requirements set forth in the parties' agreement. The Arbitrator also found that the grievant was "qualified and could do the job" for which she applied. However, the Arbitrator's award does not reflect that if the appropriate promotion procedures were followed in this case, the grievant, rather than any of the other fifteen applicants on the BQL, would have been one of the top five candidates that were selected. In this regard, the Arbitrator's findings only address why the selection process was improper, and do not address, either explicitly or implicitly, what would have happened if a proper selection process had been used. Thus, nothing in the Arbitrator's review and findings sufficiently supports a conclusion that the Arbitrator implicitly found that, but for the "arbitrary and capricious" nature of the selection process, the grievant would have <span id="page_2037"></span>been selected and promoted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Health and Human Services</span>, 42 FLRA at 359. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the award is deficient as contrary to the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Arbitrator's order of a retroactive promotion with backpay is deficient as contrary to the Back Pay Act, we strike the order. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, New York Terminal Radar Control Facility, Westbury, New York and National Air Traffic Controllers Association, MEBA/NMU, AFL-CIO</span>, 54 FLRA No. 53, Slip. Op. at 7-8 (1998). Because we strike only the order of a retroactive promotion with backpay, the Arbitrator's finding that the selection process violated the parties' agreement is unaffected. In this respect, the Authority has noted that in such circumstances, the parties may submit the issue of an appropriate remedy to arbitration. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8 (citing <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1843 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Northport, New York</span>, 51 FLRA 444, 450 n.6 (1995); <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Newington, Connecticut and National Association of Government Employees, Local R1-109</span>, 19 FLRA 535, 537 n.2 (1985)).</p>
<p class="noindent">Following remand, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3627</span> was again arbitrated, and exceptions were filed to an award that required the agency to vacate the promotion actions and to provide priority consideration to the grievant, <span class="Italic">SSA OHA and AFGE Local 3627</span>, 55 FLRA 834, 836-37 (1999). FLRA considered the remedy unobjectionable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that, because the Arbitrator did not find that the selectees originally could not have been properly promoted, his order to vacate the promotion actions is contrary to: (1) Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Chapter 335, Appendix A, section A-4b and Authority decisions interpreting that FPM provision, (2) 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335, and (3) 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2301 and 2302. If the arbitrator's decision is challenged on the ground that it is contrary to any law, rule or regulation, the Authority reviews the legal question <span class="Italic">de novo. See National</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 24 and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service,</span> 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995).

<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;FPM Chapter 335, Appendix A, section A-4b and Authority Cases Interpreting that FPM Provision are Not Applicable to this Case</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FPM was abolished effective December 31, 1994. Specifically, FPM Chapter 335, Appendix A, section A-4b.(1)(b)(i) stated, in pertinent part, that an erroneously promoted employee "may be retained in the position only if...reconstruction of the promotion action shows that he or she could have been selected had the proper procedures been followed at the time the action was taken[.]" The principles set forth in that FPM provision have not been codified elsewhere.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the events that give rise to the grievance occurred during 1996. In view of the abolishment of the FPM in 1994, FPM Chapter 335, Appendix A, section A-4b.(1)(b)(i) and Authority cases interpreting that FPM provision are not applicable to this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The Award Is Not Contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335 is entitled, "Promotion and Internal Placement." The Agency does not specify the portion of this provision with which the award allegedly conflicts, and the record does not disclose a portion which is directly applicable to the Agency's claim. Thus, the Agency has not demonstrated that the award is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;The Award Is Not Contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2301 and 2302</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2301 and 2302 are entitled, respectively, "Merit system principles" and "Prohibited personnel practices." The Agency does not specify the portions of these provisions with which the award allegedly conflicts. Moreover, with respect to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301, the Authority has held that merit system principles are hortatory and are not self-executing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Armament Research,</span> <span class="Italic">Development and Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey and National Federation of Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local 1437, </span>48 FLRA 873, 881 (1993). Thus, the Agency has not demonstrated that the award is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2301 and 2302.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that the Agency's exception provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under law before 2010, the duty of an arbitrator to reconstruct what management should have done in a promotion case extends to cases applying procedural clauses of contracts that might otherwise serve to default management. In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Huntington, and AFGE Local 3729</span>, 52 FLRA 144, 145 n.1, 147-48 (1996), the parties' agreement provided that "the Employer agrees to the position of the employee" if management was late answering the union's grievance. The union grieved management's failure to consider the grievant's application for a position. Management's response to the grievance was late. The arbitrator directed that the grievant be promoted. FLRA set the award aside:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the award constitutes an enforcement of Article 19 of the parties' agreement in a manner that affects management's right under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute to make the actual selection for the appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example, Department of Defense v. FLRA</span>, 659 F.2d 1140, 1162 (D.C. Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 455 U.S. 945 (1982) (court held that the intent of section 7106(a)(2)(C) was, among other things, to ensure management's right to make the actual selection for appointments); <span class="Italic">Department of Agriculture, Food</span> <span class="Italic">and Nutrition Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 35 FLRA 1154, 1159-60 (1990) ("Under competitive selection procedures, management must maintain the right and discretion to make the actual selection from the promotion certificate or to make the appointment from any appropriate source.") (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving whether an arbitral remedy enforcing a contractual provision is deficient as inconsistent with a management right, the Authority will determine whether such remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if it had acted properly. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Birmingham, Alabama and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2207</span>, 51 FLRA 270, 274 (1995) (<span class="Italic">VA Birmingham</span>). In <span class="Italic">VA, Birmingham</span>, the Authority concluded that the award constituted the reconstruction of what the agency would have done had it not violated a provision of the parties' agreement that constituted a contractual arrangement under <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>. Accordingly, the Authority concluded that the award was not contrary to management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying <span class="Italic">VA, Birmingham</span> here, it is clear that the award does not constitute a reconstruction of what the Agency would have done had it not violated Article 19 of the parties' agreement. Thus, the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency would have selected the grievant for the position of Lock and Dam Operator if it had fulfilled its contractual obligations. Therefore, the selection of the grievant for the position of Lock and Dam Operator is not based on a reconstruction of what management would have done if it had acted in accordance with Article 19 or any other contractual provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the award ordering the selection of the grievant for the position of Lock and Dam Operator is deficient under section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute as contrary to management's right to make selections for appointments under section 7106(a)(2)(C). Accordingly, we set the award aside.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2532 and SBA, Cent. Office</span>, 3 FLRA 536, 439 (1980) (contract clause stating grievance would be resolved in employee's favor should there not be timely management response did not justify promotion).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Air Station Miramar, San Diego and AFGE Local 3723</span>, 48 FLRA 47, 50-51 (1993), provides an example of analysis supporting an award directing the grievant's promotion and back pay. The individual first selected for the job was disqualified because his application for the job was signed after the closing date for the vacancy announcement. Exceptions were denied:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7106(a)(2)(C) provides that management has the right in filling positions to select from a group of properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or from any other appropriate source. When an arbitrator is not enforcing an arrangement, management's right to make selections for promotion can be abridged by an award of an arbitrator only when the arbitrator finds a direct connection between improper agency action and the agency's failure to select a specific employee for promotion. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Chicago Region and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 242</span>, 45 FLRA 437, 443 (1992). The Agency contends that the Arbitrator failed to find a direct connection between the Agency's improper consideration of the selected employee's application and the Agency's failure to select the grievant for promotion. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We analyze arbitrators' awards of retroactive promotions with respect to section 7106(a)(2)(C) in the same manner as we would review such awards of retroactive promotions with backpay under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, we will review these awards for evidence of a finding by the arbitrator of a causal connection between an unwarranted agency personnel action and an agency's failure to promote an employee and not for a specific recitation of certain words and phrases. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the Arbitrator made the required finding of a direct connection between the grievant's failure to be selected for promotion and the Agency's improper consideration of the selected employee's untimely application. The Arbitrator specifically found that "[t]he selection was for the highest rated." The Arbitrator further found, as conceded by the Agency, that the grievant was the second highest rated applicant. Finally, the Arbitrator specifically found that the grievant should have received the promotion. Therefore, the Arbitrator made the required causal connection that the grievant, being the next highest rated applicant, should have received the promotion upon the disqualification of the selected employee. In this regard, we reject the Agency's contention that the requisite finding was not made because the Arbitrator stated that the grievant "should," rather than "would," <span id="page_2038"></span>have received the promotion. Accordingly, we will deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is insufficient for an arbitrator to arrive at an equitable solution, promoting the grievant because of a contract violation, even though it may be impossible to determine whether the grievant would have been promoted had the error not occurred. <span class="Italic">VA, Winston-Salem and AFGE Local 2880</span>, 27 FLRA 44, 46 (1987);<span class="Italic"> see</span> <span class="Italic">ACT and Pennsylvania NG</span>, 30 FLRA 779, 781 (1987) (promotion may not be awarded because grievant "should have" been selected; arbitrator must decide he would have been selected; that grievant only applicant did not meet test since management retained discretion whether to fill job at all). The "but for" determination must be made. FLRA occasionally requires arbitrators to spell out the determinants of promotion. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3553 and VAMC, New Orleans</span>, 18 FLRA 486 (1985), involved an individual who was selected for promotion from a certificate of eligibles. The promotion was not effectuated by the approving official because it was determined that the grievant would be supervising his brother in violation of the agency anti-nepotism regulation. But the arbitrator concluded that the agency waived the regulation in the past, with some protections against abuse of the personnel system, and the arbitrator ordered the agency to waive the regulation and retroactively promote the grievant. FLRA acknowledged that the arbitrator determined that the grievant was affected by an unwarranted personnel action. The agency did not demonstrate equality in the application of its nepotism policy, but FLRA went on to hold that the arbitrator "did not expressly find" that the unwarranted personnel action directly resulted in the failure of the grievant to be promoted when he otherwise "definitely would have been," so the award was set aside<span class="Italic">. <span class="Italic">But see Dept. of Educ. and AFGE Local 3896</span>, 59 FLRA 820, 824–25 (2004) (sustaining award of a career ladder promotion when the arbitrator concluded the appellant would have been promoted had the agency met its obligations under the negotiated agreement to provide specified forms of assistance to employees progressing through career ladders).</span></p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA may relent and decide that the "but for" analysis may be implied from the factual findings of the arbitrator and the circumstances of the case. The arbitrator need not recite magic words, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 31 and VAMC, Cleveland</span>, 41 FLRA 514, 517-19 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Back Pay Act, an award of backpay is authorized only when the grievant has been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted agency personnel action that has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. Accordingly, the Authority has advised that, in order to award backpay, the arbitrator must find that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; (2) the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials; and (3) but for such action, the grievant otherwise would not have suffered the withdrawal or reduction.... In our view, the Arbitrator's award in this case satisfies the requirements of the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the grievant had been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action when he specifically found that the promotion provisions of the parties' collective bargaining agreement were "complete[ly] disregard[ed]" and that the inclusion of the evaluation factor for use of leave in the rating and ranking process "was unfair and unjust." Furthermore, it is not disputed that the failure to be promoted resulted in a loss of pay of the grievant. However, the Agency claims that the Arbitrator failed to find that, but for the unwarranted actions, the grievant would have been promoted. We disagree. Based on the record and the award, we conclude that implicit in the Arbitrator's findings and award is the necessary finding of a causal connection between the unfair and unjust inclusion of the evaluation factor for use of leave in the rating and ranking process and the grievants failure to be promoted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As indicated by the decision in [<span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1915 and</span>] <span class="Italic">Wm. Jennings Bryan Dorn Veterans Hospital</span> [32 FLRA 1223 (1988)], cited by the Union, the Authority reviews these awards for evidence of a finding by the arbitrator of a causal connection between an unwarranted action and an employee's loss of pay and not for a specific recitation of certain words and phrases, such as "but for." Obviously, if an arbitrator makes a finding of a causal connection in the exact words that the Authority has used to state and set forth this requirement of the Back Pay Act, the requirement of the Act would clearly be satisfied. But the absence of such language will not be dispositive if the requisite finding of a causal connection is otherwise apparent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, in <span class="Italic">Wm. Jennings Bryan Dorn Veterans Hospital</span>, the Arbitrator vacated the 14-day suspension of the grievant because it was not for just cause and ordered that the grievant be remunerated for the pay that she lost during the term of her suspension. The Authority rejected the agency's claim that the arbitrator failed to make the explicit findings necessary for an award of backpay. The Authority found the requisite connection under the Back Pay Act. In other words, the direct connection between the unjustified suspension and the suspended employee's loss of pay was implicit from the Arbitrator's order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the direct connection between the unjustified and unwarranted inclusion of the evaluation factor for use of leave in the rating and ranking process and the grievant's failure to be one of the six candidates selected for promotion is implicit from the record and the award. The Arbitrator specifically reviewed the ratings of the candidates. This review, together with the Arbitrator's express ruling that the inclusion of the evaluation factor for use of leave in the rating and ranking for promotion was "unfair and unjust,"...lead us to conclude that the Arbitrator implicitly found that, but for the unfair and unjust use of the evaluation factor regarding leave, the grievant would have been one of the six highest-ranked candidates. In this regard, we have noted the Union's submission showing the full ratings of all eight candidates. If the ratings were reconstructed to delete the evaluation factor regarding leave, the grievant's overall rating would have placed her among the top six ranked candidates--she would have ranked fourth along with two other candidates with the same overall rating after the top three rated candidates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Agency concedes that the top six ranked candidates were selected and because the grievant would have been one of the top six ranked candidates if the evaluation factor regarding leave had not been improperly used to rate and rank candidates, as found by the Arbitrator, we conclude, as the Authority similarly concluded in <span class="Italic">Wm. Jennings Bryan Dorn Veterans Hospital</span>, that the direct connection between the improper evaluation of the grievant and her failure to be selected for promotion in February 1988 is implicit from the award. Moreover, we find that this conclusion is further supported by the fact that the Agency advised the Arbitrator that he could not order the grievant promoted unless he determined that she would have been promoted but for an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. Therefore, we hold that the award is properly supported and no basis is provided for finding the award to be contrary to the Back Pay Act. Accordingly, we will deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, San Francisco Region and AFGE Council 147</span>, 48 FLRA 293, 302 (1993) ("[W]e review such awards for evidence of a finding by the arbitrator of a direct connection between an unwarranted personnel action and the agency's failure to promote an employee and not for a specific recitation of certain words and phrases."); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 43 FLRA 692, 696 (1991) (noting series of awards involving retroactive permanent promotions of Wage Grade employees involved in agency's vocational technical training program); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 42 FLRA 1342, 1348 (1991) ("The specific findings of the Arbitrator, namely, that the grievant had met the requirements for a noncompetitive promotion to WG-9 and had performed such work from August 1984, and that positions were available at the WG-9 level as evidenced by the promotion of other employees, lead us to conclude that the Arbitrator implicitly found that, but for the unfair treatment of the grievant in violation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, the grievant would have been promoted. Therefore, we hold that the Arbitrator made all the necessary findings to support an award of backpay.").</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of retroactive promotion was set aside because, although the arbitrator resolved that an agency failed to provide priority consideration for a repromotion eligible, the arbitrator did not conclude or state that but for the agency error the grievant would have been promoted. FLRA determined that the arbitrator's assessment that the grievant should have been promoted was not the same as a finding that he would have been promoted. FLRA revised the award by striking entitlement to retroactive promotion and directing the agency to provide the appellant additional priority consideration in the future. <span class="Italic">Picatinny Arsenal, Army Armament Research, Dover and Dev. Command and NFFE Local 1437</span>, 7 FLRA 703, 707-09 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent">A retroactive promotion was overturned when the arbitrator found a violation of the collective bargaining agreement through the reassignment of the grievant, but he made no determination that the grievant would have been promoted had the reassignment not occurred. <span class="Italic">Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal and AFGE Local 1858</span>, 19 FLRA 265, 266 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal and AFGE Local 1858</span>, 25 FLRA 167, 170 (1987) ("We have consistently held that the same finding that must be made by an arbitrator under the Back Pay Act in order to authorize an award of a retroactive promotion must also be made by an arbitrator in order to award a prospective promotion consistent with section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. Section 7106(a)(2)(C) essentially reserves to management the right to make the actual substantive determination to select or not to select employees for promotion. This right may be constrained and an agency ordered by an arbitrator to select a particular employee for promotion only if the arbitrator finds that the employee was affected by improper agency action that directly resulted in the failure of the employee to be promoted when the employee otherwise would have been.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Another promotion award was vacated when the arbitrator incorrectly determined that 38 USC 2104 required that preference be given in the selection process to Vietnam-era veterans; the preference was, by law, not mandatory, and its application would properly have been at the point of initial rating rather than final selection. <span class="Italic">VARO, Waco and AFGE Local 2571</span>, 41 FLRA 681, 686-87 (1991). A determination that a grievant had a "probable expectation" of being promoted had a vacancy announcement not been improperly <span id="page_2039"></span>canceled was not enough to meet the "but for" test. The award was set aside, and FLRA ordered priority consideration instead of the promotion. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 15 FLRA 543, 548 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, Family Support Admin. and NTEU Local 250</span>, 42 FLRA 347, 356-57 (1991) (that agency could have selected grievant following cure of procedural defect did not demonstrate grievant's entitlement to promotion; priority consideration was appropriate for next vacancy); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1960 and Dept. of Navy, Dev. Ctr.</span>, 26 FLRA 250, 254 (1987) (lengthy detail to higher-level position was insufficient to warrant, under the Back Pay Act, directed noncompetitive promotion).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award directing that grievant be the next one promoted was set aside when the award was based on a finding that a prior promotion was tainted by favoritism. There was no determination that the selection for the position was erroneous. There was no demonstrable direct connection between improper agency action and the failure of a specific employee to be selected for promotion. <span class="Italic">Army Missile Command, Army Communications Command Agency, Redstone, Army Commissary, Redstone Arsenal and AFGE Local 1858</span>, 20 FLRA 792, 793 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Carswell AFB and AFGE Local 1364</span>, 35 FLRA 754, 759-63 (1990), after concluding both that the merit system principles of 5 USC 2301(b)(1) and (2) are not self-executing, but that "a violation of merit system principles would constitute an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action and an improper agency personnel action," FLRA determined that the violation of those principles in the promotion process did not, without more, allow an arbitrator to award a promotion. The causal connection required by the Back Pay Act still had to be established:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for a retroactive promotion with backpay to be authorized under the Back Pay Act, an arbitrator must find that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; (2) the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances or differentials; and (3) but for such action, the grievant otherwise would not have suffered the withdrawal or reduction. For example, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1698 and Department of the Navy, Aviation Supply Office</span>, 34 FLRA 939, 942 (1990). In order to have properly awarded the retroactive promotion with backpay in this case, the Arbitrator must have determined that the grievant would have been selected for the aircraft electrician foreman position but for an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 942-43.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Arbitrator failed to make the findings necessary in order for the award of a retroactive promotion with backpay to be authorized under the Back Pay Act.&#x2003;The Arbitrator found that the Activity's original point system to evaluate the candidates for promotion to the aircraft electrician foreman position was unfair in violation of merit system principles. The Arbitrator subsequently found that the Activity's ranking system revised as a result of the Interim Award was still unfair in violation of merit system principles. In the Final Award, the Arbitrator stated that because the Activity had not complied with the Supplemental Award that ordered the Activity to reevaluate the grievant and the selected employee under a ranking system devised by the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator had no choice but to sustain the grievance and award the grievant a retroactive promotion with backpay for the specified period. In the Final Award, the Arbitrator explained that the retroactive promotion and backpay were proper not only because the Activity failed to comply with the Supplemental Award, but also because the remedy was authorized by the merit system principles set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(1) and (2). He indicated that use of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301 to authorize his remedy was supported by the Authority's decision in SSA, 30 FLRA 1156. These findings and explanations do not satisfy the test for an award of a retroactive promotion and backpay under the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Arbitrator found that the point systems violated merit system principles and that the Activity refused to comply with the Supplemental Award, the Arbitrator acknowledged in his Supplemental Award that he did not know whether the grievant would have the higher point total under his revised point system and that the Activity, relying on its right to select the promotion candidate it prefers from a group of best-qualified candidates, could still decide not to promote the grievant. The Arbitrator never found, as required by the test under the Back Pay Act, that but for these actions the grievant would have been promoted to aircraft electrician foreman. Although the Arbitrator appeared to rely on the Union's ranking of the candidates as reported in the Union's August 24 letter (Memorandum of Clarification at 1), that ranking was self-serving and unverified.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the Arbitrator's finding that the Activity failed to comply with the Supplemental Award does not establish that, but for such action, the grievant would have been promoted. The Supplemental Award did not order the grievant promoted but, rather, ordered a reevaluation under the point system devised by the Arbitrator. Moreover, in his Memorandum of Clarification, the Arbitrator stated that although he considered the grievant more qualified, he would have denied the grievance if management's procedures had met the statutory requirement of fairness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also disagree with the Arbitrator's statement, relying on the Authority's decision in SSA, 30 FLRA 1156, that the violations of the merit system principles set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(1) and (2) authorized the award of a retroactive promotion with backpay. The Authority's decision in SSA provides no support for the Arbitrator's award of a retroactive promotion with backpay. In <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Des Moines, Iowa District and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 4</span>, 35 FLRA 144, 151 (1990), we noted that SSA concerned management's right to evaluate the performance of employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) and not management's right to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C). We held that nothing in SSA indicates that the standards established in that case were to be applied to selection actions under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The merit system principles set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(1) and (2) also provide no support for the Arbitrator's award of a retroactive promotion with backpay. Certainly, a violation of merit system principles would constitute an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action and an improper agency personnel action. However, simply finding violations of merit system principles does not establish that, but for the violations, the grievant would have been promoted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301 does not independently authorize the retroactive promotion with backpay of the grievant. Merit system principles set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301 are part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. The findings and statement of purpose of the Reform Act direct that Federal personnel management should be implemented consistent with merit system principles and state that the principles were specified to furnish guidance to Federal agencies in carrying out their responsibilities in administering the public business. In adopting the House provisions concerning the application of merit system principles, the Conference Committee stated, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Unless a law, rule or regulation implementing or directly concerning the principles is violated (as under section 2302(b)(11)), the principles themselves may not be made the basis of a legal action by an employee or agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">S.&#x2003;Rep. No. 1272, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 128 (1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the basis of the findings and statement of purpose of and the legislative history to the Reform Act, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) has held that the principles are stated in "hortatory terms [and] are not self-executing." <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris</span>, 1 MSPR 208, 215 (1979) (footnote omitted). An employee may be able to establish before the MSPB that an agency personnel action violated merit system principles and constituted a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11). <span class="Italic">For example, Bodinus v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 7 MSPR 536, 542 (1981). Because the merit system principles are not self-executing, however, the MSPB requires a two-step analysis for an employee to establish a prohibited personnel practice. The employee must show that (1) the personnel action violates a law, rule, or regulation; and (2) the law, rule, or regulation violated is one that implements or directly concerns merit system principles. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 543.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the basis of the legislative history to the Reform Act, quoted above, the Authority has similarly held that a merit system principle set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b), alone, is not a basis on which the Authority will find a proposal nonnegotiable as conflicting with law. <span class="Italic">For example, National Treasury Employees Union and Internal Revenue Service</span>, 21 FLRA 730, 731 (1986). In order for a proposal to be found nonnegotiable, it must be established that the proposal conflicts with a law, rule, or regulation implementing or directly concerning the merit system principle. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our opinion, because the merit system principles are not self-executing and, alone, may not form the basis of a legal action, the merit system principles set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(1) and (2) do not independently authorize and, therefore, cannot serve by themselves as the basis for the retroactive promotion with backpay of the grievant, as found by the Arbitrator. We find that the Arbitrator should have used a two-step analysis to support his award. Thus, after the Arbitrator found violations of merit system principles, he could not award the remedy that he did unless he based that award on a law, rule, or regulation implementing or concerning those merit system principles. In our view, that law is the Back Pay Act. The Back Pay Act authorizes arbitrators to make employees whole who have suffered a withdrawal or reduction in their pay, allowances, or differentials as a result of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, such as a personnel action in violation of merit system principles. However, as we found above, the Arbitrator failed to make the findings necessary to authorize his award of retroactive promotion with backpay under the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">An interesting promotion case is <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1698 and Dept. of Navy, Aviation Supply Office</span>, 34 FLRA 939, 942-45 (1990). The arbitrator found improper the appointment and deliberations of a Selection Advisory Panel convened to identify specific candidates to recommend to the selecting official. The arbitrator concluded that the grievant was entitled to, but denied, promotion and ordered that the grievant "be made monetarily whole" for the period <span id="page_2040"></span>from the denial of the promotion to the date of his subsequent promotion to another position<span class="Italic">. </span>Underlying the arbitrator's award was the point that despite the best qualified rating for the grievant prior to consideration by the panel, the chairman of the panel, who was the grievant's supervisor, unduly and improperly influenced fellow panel members in identifying and recommending other candidates for the vacancies under consideration. The arbitrator determined that the testimony of the selecting official was "not supportive" of the grievant's nonselection, and the arbitrator assessed the testimony of the selecting official as a haphazard endeavor to support the panel chairman's actions or opinions<span class="Italic">. </span>FLRA concluded that the award was properly supported by a determination of causal connection:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for an award of backpay to be authorized under the Back Pay Act, the arbitrator must determine that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; (2) the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances or differentials; and (3) but for such action, the grievant otherwise would not have suffered the withdrawal or reduction. <span class="Italic">The United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Worth, Texas and American Federation of Government Employees, Council of Prison Locals, Local Union 1298</span>, 32 FLRA 128, 131 (1988). In order properly to have awarded backpay in this case, the Arbitrator must have determined that the grievant would have been selected for promotion to one of the two vacancies but for an unwarranted or unjustified personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Arbitrator, the Agency conceded that "[t]he failure to notify the Union as to the decision to use a Selection Advisory Panel was error and was an oversight." The Arbitrator found that the Panel was convened in violation of the collective bargaining agreement because the agreement required such notification. In addition, the Arbitrator found no grounds in the negotiated agreement or in applicable regulations for convening the Panel at all. The Arbitrator further found that "the illegally and improperly appointed Selection Advisory [Panel]" did not proceed in a manner consistent with either contractual or regulatory requirements. The Arbitrator concluded that the appointment and deliberations of the Selection Advisory Panel violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Health Care Financing Administration, Region IV, Atlanta, Georgia and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 210</span>, 21 FLRA 910, 913 (1986). The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the collective bargaining agreement and that the grievant was affected by the Agency's violation. The award, therefore, satisfies the first part of the test in determining eligibility for backpay under the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second part of the test requires a finding that the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action directly caused a withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances or differentials. The Arbitrator found that the grievant's failure to be promoted was attributable to the Agency's violations of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. There is no question that the failure to be promoted constituted a withdrawal or reduction in the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. Therefore, the award satisfies the second part of the test for an award of backpay. <span class="Italic">See Veterans Administration Hospital and American Federation of Government Employees, Lodge 2201</span>, 4 FLRA 419, 424 (1980).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the Arbitrator's award of backpay satisfies the third part of the test for an award of backpay under the Act. We conclude that the Arbitrator found that, "but for" the Agency's unwarranted or unjustified personnel action in appointing a Selection Advisory Panel, the grievant would have been promoted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator observed that "something obviously occurred to the opinion" of the Selection Advisory Panel chairman in the period between the time he headed the Rating and Ranking Panel, which ranked the grievant as the best qualified candidate for both vacancies, and the time when he was designated to chair the Selection Advisory Panel. The Arbitrator noted that, after the Selection Advisory Panel was convened, the chairman "went out of his way to assure that any advantages that Grievant's favorable position as No. 1 gave him, were lowered." The Arbitrator stated that the Panel chairman "improperly and unfairly asserted that the Grievant had an attitude problem because the Grievant failed to show up at a meeting as [the chairman's] representative," and that chairman "offered no proof thereafter to support his assertion." The Arbitrator noted that the chairman made his assertions despite performance appraisals, prepared by the chairman in his supervisory capacity, which rated the grievant "as being 'outstanding' in April and also again in October of 1986. Also, despite the accolades by others as to Grievant's known capabilities for excellent work performance [the chairman] just did not give the Grievant 'full and fair consideration' as a candidate." In addition, the Arbitrator found that the chairman "was able to interject personal feelings about the Grievant's alleged attitude and to persuade the other [P]anel members that the Grievant should not be recommended for selection for either position."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the unwarranted appointment of a Selection Advisory Panel, the improprieties in the Panel's deliberations, and the unconvincing testimony in support of the grievant's nonselection provided by the Selection Official evidenced a purpose on the part of the Agency "to go outside the prescribed system to determine a candidate" for each vacancy. Consequently, the Arbitrator found that the appointment and deliberations of the Selection Advisory Panel deprived the grievant of a promotion to either of the two positions. The Arbitrator concluded that there was a "causal connection" between the improper Agency actions and the failure of the grievant to be promoted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the Arbitrator's finding of a "causal connection" constitutes a finding that, but for the Agency's improper conduct, the grievant would have been promoted. <span class="Italic">See Michigan Air National Guard, Adjutant General of Michigan, Department of Military Affairs and Michigan State Council of the Association of Civilian Technicians</span>, 30 FLRA 165, 169-70 (award sustained where Authority found that arbitrator's direction that grievant receive backpay lost because of nonselection for assignment in violation of parties' agreement satisfied statutory "but for" test). Consequently, we find that the award satisfies the requirement of the Back Pay Act in finding that the grievant was the victim of a personnel action, "but for" which he would not have suffered a withdrawal or reduction in pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we previously found, the Arbitrator properly identified both the Agency's appointment of the Selection Advisory Panel and the Panel's deliberations as an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. The Arbitrator also found that the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action directly caused the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances or differentials. The Arbitrator further determined that, but for the Panel's appointment and deliberations, the grievant would have been promoted. We conclude, therefore, that the Arbitrator satisfied the Back Pay Act's criteria for awarding backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent">For the failure of the agency to timely process a promotion action, "the Back Pay Act provides the statutory authority to award a retroactive promotion and back pay only if an unwarranted delay is subsequent to approval of the promotion by the properly authorized official." <span class="Italic">EEOC and AFGE Local 3504</span>, 18 FLRA 312, 312 (1985):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Authority has uniformly held with respect to cases where there has been a failure on the part of an agency to timely process a promotion action that the Back Pay Act provides the statutory authority to award a retroactive promotion and backpay only if an unwarranted delay is subsequent to approval of the promotion by the properly authorized official. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2369</span>, 10 FLRA 163 (1982); <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Air Defense Center, Fort Bliss, Texas and National Association of Government Employees, Local R-14-22</span>, 10 FLRA 161 (1982). Approval by the properly authorized official is essential because it confirms the promotion and permits a determination that the unwarranted action directly resulted in the aggrieved employee's promotion being delayed beyond the date that it otherwise would have been effective. <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Air Defense Center</span> at 162. In terms of this case, although the grievant was eligible for promotion before the freeze, the unwarranted delay occurred in recommending the grievant's promotion and the promotion was never approved....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA decided some promotion cases before recent developments or redevelopments in the law allowing arbitrators to enforce arrangements clauses in negotiated agreements, subject to an "abrogation" standard, now an "excessive interference" standard. Under prior law, reviewing an arbitration award rejecting a grievance concerning the change in the level of selecting officials for promotions, FLRA observed that an arbitrator may not interpret or enforce a provision of a collective bargaining agreement so as to deny an agency the authority to exercise its rights under &#x00A7; 7106. Those rights could not be infringed upon, waived, or relinquished through the award of the arbitrator. Although the rights of management set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(a) are subject to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2), that provision only authorized the establishment of procedures that do not prevent management from acting at all. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1712 and Army, 172nd Infantry Brigade</span>, 6 FLRA 466, 468 (1981) (relying upon <span class="Italic">PATCO and FAA</span>, 5 FLRA 763 (1981)). Not only was an arbitrator precluded from arriving at a result that violated a management right, he could not enforce a contract provision that violated a management right. An award was set aside that enforced a negotiated provision preventing management from selecting candidates from appropriate sources and limiting management's ability to fill certain professional and team leader positions. <span class="Italic">EPA Region 9 and Eng'rs and Scientists of California, MEBA</span>, 17 FLRA 365, 366 (1985). An arbitrator could not enforce a contract provision that, by shutting off one or another source of candidates, precluded management from making a selection "from a group of properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or from any other appropriate source." <span class="Italic">Defense Contract Admin. Servs. Mgmt. Area, Syracuse and NAGE Local R2-65</span>, 20 FLRA 783, 784 (1985). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-012.html#sec9-13">Claim for Back Pay, Promotion</a>."]</p>
