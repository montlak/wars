<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Price</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/PRICE_ELIZABETH_A_CB_7521_00_0015_A_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248715.pdf">94 MSPR 337</a><span class="Italic"></span> (2003), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Price v. SSA</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1088709.html">398 F.3d 1322</a> (Fed. Cir. 2005), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, examined the degree of prejudice (the length of a procedurally improper suspension) in determining whether an error was "gross." In <span class="Italic">Price</span>, the suspension lasted three months and the employee received back pay. In other cases involving more dramatic financial consequences, failure to provide adverse action procedural rights constitutes gross procedural error. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Woodall v. FERC</span>, 30 MSPR 271, 275 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fees were awarded against an agency that denied an employee the opportunity to respond to charges. Denial of the reply right constituted obstruction of a fundamental procedural right and gross procedural error: the right to make an informed reply at the agency level is granted in order to attempt to resolve the dispute before irreversible positions are taken and further proceedings are necessary. By denying the appellant a reply right, the agency prolongs the proceedings and severely prejudices the appellant. <span class="Italic">Hodnick v. FMCS</span>, 8 MSPR 508, 511 (1981). But in a removal reversed because the employee was not a probationer and had not been provided adverse action <span id="Page_4597"></span>procedural protections, the agency error was technical, and not so gross as to warrant an award of counsel fees. <span class="Italic">Jacobson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 6 MSPR 106, 108-09, 6 MSPB 102 (1981). The appeal was remanded to determine whether fees were properly awarded on the basis of bad faith and religious discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Silberman v. Dept. of Labor,</span> CH-0752-09-0322-A-1 (NP 4/18/2013), awarded fees based on a violation of due process rights during the adverse action reply process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official in the suspension action violated the appellant's due process rights by considering memoranda regarding the appellant's prior misconduct without affording the appellant notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">See Silberman v. Department of Labor</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-14 (2011). As a result, the Board reversed the adverse action. Although the appellant was given back pay and all benefits due to her after the Board reversed the suspension, it took her over two years to achieve that result, with the assistance of counsel. These facts support a finding of gross procedural error. In contrast, in its cross petition for review, the agency downplays its error, asserting that the rights it violated were "procedural, not substantive," the disciplinary action was based on "substantiated misconduct and a documented history of prior discipline," and that "at no point was [a]ppellant thwarted in her attempt to seek redress for the proposed action." Balancing the prejudice and burden caused to the appellant against the agency's excuse for committing the error, we find that the appellant has established gross procedural error. <span class="Italic">See Swanson,</span> 35 M.S.P.R. at 118 (finding that an agency's failure to comply with statutory adverse action procedures in removing an employee outweighed the agency's reliance on a Federal Personnel Manual provision and thus constituted gross procedural error); <span class="Italic">Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 127, 134 (1987) (finding gross procedural error where the agency's failure to provide adverse action rights "severely prejudiced" the appellant and outweighed the agency's reliance on case law that was subsequently reversed by the Federal Circuit).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board denied fees to an appellant who was not informed of his right to appeal from the denial of a step increase, but instead was told only of the right to use a contractual grievance procedure. The employee did appeal to the Board and was held not to be severely prejudiced by his agency's actions. <span class="Italic">Ingram v. VA</span>, 29 MSPR 641, 647 (1986). A prevailing appellant was awarded fees because of the agency's failure to provide proper notice to him of its proposed adverse action and its subsequent denial of an extension of time for him to present his reply to the charges, after the appellant informed the agency that he had not received a copy of the notice of proposed removal due to a change in address that should have been known to the agency. The right to advance written notice and an opportunity to reply were considered fundamental procedural rights. The agency's denial of the extension of time to reply was unreasonable because the request was received before the effective date of the action (but after the appellant received the decision letter). Had the appellant been provided an opportunity to reply, he could have articulated the successful defense presented at the Board hearing. It was concluded that the agency prolonged the proceeding and severely prejudiced the appellant's rights, leading to a finding of gross procedural error and entitlement to counsel fees. <span class="Italic">McInville v. USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 297, 301 (1986). Although there was an emergency caused by the labor strike of air traffic controllers and the enormous volume of litigation created for the agency, an AJ properly awarded fees after he characterized as gross procedural error the agency's failure to provide adverse action notice, an error that prolonged the case by adding a claim for a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Barson v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 22 MSPR 303, 306-07 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency error in advising the employee (who was being terminated for misconduct) to record his separation as a retirement rather than resignation, led to litigation, ultimately successful, by the appellant to demonstrate that the agency's advice was incorrect and that the separation should have been recorded as a resignation to permit the appellant to appeal the removal (without having to demonstrate that it was a constructive adverse action) and to secure later retirement benefits. The appellant prevailed because the effect of changing the nature of the separation from retirement to resignation provided him the appeal right he sought and affected the retirement entitlement. The appellant met the interest of justice standard because the agency's error was gross procedural error, <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 413, 420-23 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-22, 2010 MSPB 221 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's reviewing court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, has held that "[t]he attorney fee provision of the Back Pay Act is not a penalty designed to increase the agency's liability: it is a reimbursement statute, to facilitate making whole the wronged employee." <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 845 F.2d 976, 980 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Thus, to prove entitlement to an attorney fees award, an appellant who is a prevailing party must also show that an attorney fees award is in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. An award of attorney fees may be warranted in the interest of justice when: (1) the agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice; (2) the agency action was clearly without merit or wholly unfounded, or the employee is substantially innocent of the charges; (3) the agency initiated the action in bad faith; (4) the agency committed a gross procedural error that prolonged the proceeding or severely prejudiced the employee; or (5) the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 434-35; <span class="Italic">see also Dunn v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 F.3d 1308, 1311-12 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Department of the Army</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 656, &#x00B6; 13 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that an award of attorney fees is in the interest of justice because the appellant's involuntary resignation is the result of the agency's gross procedural error. The Board has held that in determining whether a gross procedural error occurred warranting an award of attorney fees, a balance is struck between the nature of and any excuse for the agency's error and the prejudice and burden that error caused the appellant. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 502, 506-07 (1998); <span class="Italic">Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 127, 132-34 (1987). If, in the balance, the prejudice and burden to the appellant predominates, gross procedural error exists and the appellant is entitled to a fee award. <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. at 132.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, the Board considered whether attorney fees were justified where an agency failed to provide an appellant with her entitled adverse action rights before placing her on enforced leave. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 130, 132. Noting the more than 3-year delay between when the appellant filed her appeal and the Board's decision reversing the action, the Board found that the agency's failure to provide the appellant with any adverse action appeal rights constituted gross procedural error. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 134. The Board explained that the agency's action severely prejudiced the appellant and prolonged the proceeding. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In <span class="Italic">Peasley v. Department of the Army</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 137, 138-39 (1984), the Board upheld an award of attorney fees under the gross procedural error standard upon finding that the agency's deception, which led to the appellant's involuntary resignation, "unnecessarily subjected [the] appellant to substantial burden and expense." Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Swanson v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 115, 118 (1987), the Board found that attorney fees were warranted under the gross procedural error standard where the agency separated an employee, without any adverse action procedures, due to abandonment of her position. The Board found that the agency's reasoning for its action--its reliance on and interpretation of the Federal Personnel Manual--did not "outweigh the prejudice and burden that the error caused the appellant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Board found that the agency provided the appellant with incorrect information concerning his ability to retire in lieu of being removed and that the appellant reasonably relied on this misinformation. <span class="Italic">Baldwin II</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 586, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 43-44. Because of this misinformation, the appellant was not informed that selecting a deferred annuity would require his separation to be processed as a resignation and not as a retirement. As we stated above, this distinction was important to the appellant, as the record showed in <span class="Italic">Baldwin II</span>, because the appellant wanted to retain his statutory right, as a tenured employee, to file a Board appeal of the underlying removal action for misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Mays</span>, 27 F.3d at 1579-81. Thus, as a result of the agency's misinformation, which resulted in processing the appellant's separation as a resignation, the appellant had to file an appeal with the Board to have that resignation deemed involuntary and reversed so that his statutory right under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) to appeal his removal for misconduct to the Board would be restored. Although the appellant was ultimately successful, the appeal process that required the agency to cancel his involuntary resignation took over 1.5 years. Thus, but for the agency's error, the appellant would have had the opportunity to appeal his removal for misconduct without the significant delay that consequently followed from the agency's actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find persuasive that, although the agency realized shortly after the appellant's December 3, 2007 separation that it had incorrectly processed his separation as a retirement, it did not take steps to inform the appellant that it had processed a new SF-52 showing that his separation would be recorded as a resignation. <span class="Italic">Baldwin II</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 586, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 11, 41. Instead, it was not until after the effective date of the appellant's separation that he learned that a new SF-52 was processed, showing his separation as a resignation, not a retirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 41 n.2. Thus, when the appellant attempted to appeal the underlying removal for misconduct to the Board, the agency filed a motion with the administrative judge to dismiss the appeal because the Board does not have jurisdiction over voluntary actions, such as resignations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7; <span class="Italic">see generally Neice v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 211, &#x00B6; 7 (2007) (an employee-initiated action, such as a resignation, is presumed to be voluntary, and as such, is not appealable to the Board, unless the employee can establish that the resignation was the product of duress or coercion or shows that a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency). The record further shows that the agency did not take any action to correct its wrongdoing once the discrepancy regarding the manner of the appellant's separation became clear to him, <span class="Italic">see generally Baldwin I and II</span>, and, therefore, the appellant's only option to effect the cancellation of his involuntary resignation was to pursue this matter before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Swanson</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. at 118 (in awarding attorney fees as a result of gross procedural error, the Board considered <span id="Page_4598"></span>the agency's refusal to reverse its action as well as its continued defense of the action even after the administrative judge raised the possibility of a procedural error).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant prevailed in his involuntary resignation appeal when the Board ordered the agency to cancel his resignation and reinstate him to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. Although the agency retroactively reinstated the appellant and then removed him pursuant to its previously-decided removal action, the appellant regained his statutory right, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), to appeal the underlying removal action, which appears to be the primary benefit he sought through this involuntary resignation appeal. The agency's error required, however, that the appellant spend over 1.5 years adjudicating the involuntary resignation action before the Board, thereby significantly prolonging his attempt to appeal the underlying removal action. <span class="Italic">See Powell v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. 322, 325 (1981) (finding gross procedural error warranting an award of attorney fees because the agency, which did not permit the appellant to withdraw his resignation request, subjected an appellant both to an involuntary separation without procedural due process and to the burden of prosecuting an appeal of his separation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the Board previously found that the agency gave the appellant misinformation which led to its error in wrongly processing the appellant's separation as a resignation. We now find that the agency's error significantly prejudiced the appellant by requiring that he pursue an appeal before the Board to have the involuntary resignation reversed and prolonging his ability to exercise his statutory rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) to file a Board appeal of the underlying removal action. Thus, we find that the agency has committed gross procedural error and an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 103, 114-16 (1991), distinguished gross procedural error and harmful error, but the analysis was unilluminating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that a fee award would be warranted in the interest of justice when the agency committed a gross procedural error. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 MSPR at 434-35. As we indicated above, the appellant's placement on enforced leave constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board. Suspensions for more than 14 days are adverse actions covered by 5 USC chapter 75, and agencies effecting such actions against employees are required to comply with the procedural requirements of 5 USC 7513, including advance notice of the basis for the action and an opportunity to respond. 5 USC 7512, 7513. The agency has not denied that it failed to comply with these requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In prior decisions, the Board has considered the failure of an agency to provide the required procedures to be harmful error <span class="Italic">per se</span>, and therefore a sufficient basis for overturning the action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 681-82 (1991), and cases cited therein. In <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, however, the Board held that a failure to provide such procedures would warrant the overturning of an action for "harmful error" under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A) "only when the evidence and argument of record show[ed] that the procedural error was 'likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 685, <span class="Italic">quoting</span> 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)] ; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Coltrane v. Department of the Army</span>, 32 MSPR 6, 9 (1986) (5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A) negates a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule of harm with respect to any procedural error).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A fee award under the gross procedural error category presupposes that the error provided a sufficient basis on which to overturn the action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 MSPR at 435, n.36 ("gross procedural error" is "not simply 'harmful' procedural error such as suffices to require reversal of the agency action")....&#8197;Therefore, in light of <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, to establish gross procedural error, an appellant must first show that the procedural error is likely to have had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency. The appellant in this case has not done so. We therefore find that he has failed to show that a fee award is warranted under the "gross procedural error" category.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that the Board also held in <span class="Italic">Stephen</span> that a nonprobationary competitive service employee had a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment; that an appealable agency action taken without affording an employee prior notice of the basis for the action, an explanation of the agency's evidence, and an opportunity to respond, violated the employee's constitutional right to minimum due process; and that such an action therefore could not be sustained. <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, 47 MSPR at 681. As we have noted above, the appellant in the appeal now before us was a nonprobationary competitive service employee whose suspension the agency effected without providing him with any prior notice or opportunity to respond. The appellant's suspension therefore could not have been sustained on appeal. Under these circumstances, we find that the suspension was clearly without merit, and that an award of attorney fees therefore is warranted on that basis.</p>

SSA</span>, 398 F.3d 1322 (Fed.
