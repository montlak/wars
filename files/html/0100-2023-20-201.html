<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-195"><span class="space">d.</span> Knowledge by Agency Manager of Appellant's Whistleblowing; Constructive Knowledge; Cat's Paw; Secondary Evidence of Agency Reprisal</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 1221(e)(1) establishes a basis for proof of reprisal through circumstantial evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)(1)&#x2003;Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), in any case involving an alleged prohibited personnel practice as described under section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), the Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate if the employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has demonstrated that a disclosure described under section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) was a contributing factor in the personnel action which was taken or is to be taken against such employee, former employee, or applicant. The employee may demonstrate that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure or protected activity; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2) Corrective action under paragraph (1) may not be ordered if, after a finding that a protected disclosure was contributing factor, the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether the official taking the disputed action is aware of the protected disclosure may require credibility determinations and analysis of circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Costin v. DHHS</span>, 72 MSPR 525, 539 (1996) (in an IRA case, the "fact that there is no 'smoking-gun,' direct evidence of a retaliatory motive is not dispositive."). Under<span class="Italic"> Mausser v. Dept. of Army</span>, 63 MSPR 41, 45 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether a disclosure was a contributing factor, the fact that the deciding official had actual or constructive knowledge of the threatened disclosures, and acted within such a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a factor, can constitute circumstantial evidence that the disclosure was a contributing factor. The proximity in time, however, between the disclosures and the personnel action may not necessarily compel such a finding....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">OSC ex rel. Missal v. Dept. of Interior</span>, CB-1208-17-0025-U-1 (NP 8/2/2017) (on initial stay application: "Regarding the Chief of the Office of Policy and Analysis, who referred Mr. Missal for the internal investigation, OSC contends that it is reasonable to infer that he had actual or constructive knowledge because Mr. Missal had made disclosures to the Chief's subordinate as well as the Chief's supervisor and because the Chief interacted regularly with BSEE management officials at headquarters who were aware of Mr. Missal's disclosures, including Mr. Missal's supervisor. OSC contends that the internal investigator and the proposing official also were aware of Mr. Missal's disclosures because they received a forwarded email containing some of Mr. Missal's disclosures. Finally, OSC contends that the deciding official was aware of Mr. Missal's disclosures because Mr. Missal detailed them at length during his response to the proposal and because the IG report, which was issued a month prior to Mr. Missal's removal, referenced that a complaint had been received from a BSEE Regional Environmental Officer in Alaska.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allowing for the possibility of constructive knowledge of disclosures, also discussed below under the rubric of the "cat's paw," it may be determined if the individual taking the action is unaware of the protected disclosures that reprisal is not possible. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hobson v. MSPB</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP) ("Mrs. Hobson demonstrated she engaged in protected activity. But to establish Board jurisdiction, Mrs. Hobson must allege that official(s) responsible for alleged personnel action knew of her protected activity. Because Mrs. Hobson did not allege that the Principal was aware of the whistleblower activity, Mrs. Hobson failed to establish Board jurisdiction over her IRA appeal."); <span class="Italic">Eluhu v. <span id="Page_3963"></span>VA</span>, <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca6/18-4243/18-4243-2020-02-24.html">801 Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency next argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that the proposing official's retaliatory motive could be imputed to the deciding official because the deciding official testified that he never had any conversations with the proposing official about the appellant's disclosure.

At issue was whether the deciding official had actual or constructive knowledge of the whistleblowing disclosures, or whether he acted within a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosures played a part in the decision to remove. Knowledge of the disclosure is critical; it is not essential that a manager or supervisor know the details of the disclosure for the disclosure to achieve protection. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Armstrong v.

<p class="Body-Text">Addressing the requirements of knowledge of protected activity and the timing of actions claimed to be retaliatory, <span class="Italic">Wagner v. EPA</span>, 51 MSPR 337, 345-46 (1991), explained that knowledge of a protected disclosure by the official taking the personnel action is a required element of a reprisal case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant nevertheless argues that "all...case law imposing the 'knowledge' test [in reprisal appeals] was struck down" by the Board in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of Defense</span>, 45 MSPR 146 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Williams I</span>), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span> <span class="Italic">sub</span> <span class="Italic">nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of Defense and Office of Personnel Management</span>, 46 MSPR 549 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Williams II</span>), and that the administrative judge thus erred by imposing that test. We note, however, that the Board did not strike down the previous knowledge requirement for reprisal cases in the subsequently-reversed <span class="Italic">Williams I</span>. Rather, the Board there noted the continuing requirement, under the WPA, for a showing that the official taking the action knew of the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 45 MSPR at 149, citing the joint explanatory statement of the Senate and House floor managers of the WPA, 135 Cong. Rec. H749 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1989). The Board then applied that continuing knowledge requirement in <span class="Italic">Williams II.

General Services Administration</span>, 43 MSPR 651, 661-62 (1990). There is no legal support for the appellant's argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues further that a previous requirement in reprisal appeals, that an appellant demonstrate a "nexus" between the employee's protected disclosures and the agency's personnel action, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Haine v. Department of Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 462, 472-73 (1989), was also struck down by the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Williams I</span>. He therefore argues that the administrative judge erred by finding that he failed to show such a nexus. We note that the Board's previous holding on this point in <span class="Italic">Williams I</span> was limited to the specific change in the law that was occasioned by the enactment of the WPA, i.e., the replacement of the previous "substantial factor" test by the new "contributing factor" test.... There is no legal support for the appellant's contention that a nexus requirement is inapplicable to his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, the appellant merely reargues his belief that the short period of time that elapsed between (a) his October 1989 protected activity (his October 18, 1989 letter to Congressman Dingell), and the immediate results thereof (Mr. Barden's October 26, 1989 receipt of a telephone call from a news reporter concerning the appellant's letter), and (b) the agency's November 1989 preparation of his FY 1989 performance evaluation, establishes that his whistleblowing was a contributing factor in his evaluation. We find no basis, however, to disturb the administrative judge's analysis of this issue. Quite simply, the timing of the appellant's evaluation was in virtually no way within the control of the agency officials alleged to have retaliated against him.... Therefore, under the circumstances of this appeal, it does not follow that "a reasonable person could conclude [from such proximity in time] that the disclosure was a factor in the personnel action." 135 Cong.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent in a corrective action appeal is the agency, not its individual officials; therefore, a lack of actual knowledge by a single official is not dispositive to the issue of contributing factor. <span class="Italic">Nasuti v.

Additionally, the Board has specifically rejected the agency's argument that the appellant must prove that the influencing official had actual knowledge of the disclosure in order to establish contributing factor and has instead made clear that contributing factor can be established by a showing that the influencing official had actual or constructive knowledge of the disclosure, and that official influenced the official taking the retaliatory action. <span class="Italic">See McClellan v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The deciding official's testimony, as summarized by the administrative judge, reflects that the deciding official knew about the appellant's protected disclosures of theft of government property and safety issues on March 6, 2015, which is less than a week before he issued the suspension decision on March 12, 2015.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, although the deciding official testified that he was unaware of the disclosed issues before March 6, 2015, and that he was unaware of the appellant's claims of a hostile work environment at any time prior to his issuance of his March 12, 2015 decision letter, there is evidence in the agency file refuting his testimony on this issue. In the appellant's January 9, 2015 written reply to his notice of proposed suspension, he informed the deciding official, in pertinent part, that: "I believe that this excessive action is reprisal against me for my complaints about a hostile work environment, physical intimidation, and theft and damaging of government property." The appellant also informed the deciding official that, in November 2014, he "reported several safety concerns to be addressed."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the deciding official participated in the appellant's reply meeting on January 16, 2015, during which the appellant restated his belief that the proposed adverse action was reprisal for his complaints and the pending management inquiry into his complaints. At a follow up meeting on January 20, 2015, the deciding official reviewed what the appellant asserted at the reply meeting. The deciding official also was copied on email communications in February 2015, discussing the agency's investigation of the appellant's hostile work environment claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in the deciding official's March 12, 2015 suspension decision, he referenced his participation in the appellant's January 16, 2015 reply meeting and stated that he "carefully considered [the appellant's] written and personal replies."

<p class="Block-Quote1">A "Cat's Paw" theory applies when an individual with knowledge of the protected disclosure influences another official to reassign the employee. Thus, the official making the reassignment is simply channeling the wishes of the <span class="Italic">de facto</span> decisionmaker. We have not addressed the Cat's Paw theory in a published whistleblower decision, but the Supreme Court addressed it in a different context, writing, "[I]f a supervisor performs an act motivated by antimilitary animus that is <span class="Italic">intended</span> by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action, and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action, then the employer is liable" under the relevant statute. <span class="Italic">Staub v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">When a whistleblower makes such highly critical accusations of an agency's conduct, an agency official's merely being outside that whistleblower's chain of command, not directly involved in alleged retaliatory actions, and not personally named in the whistleblower's disclosure is insufficient to remove the possibility of a retaliatory motive or retaliatory influence on the whistleblower's treatment. Since direct evidence of a proposing or deciding official's retaliatory motive is typically unavailable (because such motive is almost always denied), federal employees are entitled to rely on circumstantial evidence to prove a motive to retaliate. <span class="Italic">McCarthy v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the agency argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that the proposing and deciding officials held a "strong motive" to retaliate because they were not implicated by the appellant's disclosures or involved in the matters disclosed. However, it is not necessary that an agency official be directly implicated or harmed by an appellant's disclosures to establish a substantial retaliatory motive when, as here, the disclosures reflect poorly on the agency and, by implication, on the management officials. <span class="Italic">See Robinson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 923 F.3d 1004, 1019 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (explaining that those responsible for the agency's overall performance may well be motivated to retaliate, even if they are not directly implicated by the disclosures, as the criticism reflects on them in their capacities as managers and employees); <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1370-71 (finding that the appellant's criticisms cast the agency and, by implication, all of the responsible officials, in a highly critical light by calling into question the propriety and honesty of their official conduct); <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 69 (2011) (finding motive to retaliate because the appellant's disclosures reflected on the responsible agency officials as representatives of the general institutional interests of the agency). Here, the appellant's protected disclosure resulted in agency and OIG investigations that were highly critical of the agency's response to allegations of financial misconduct by a member of the agency's Senior Executive Service (SES). Moreover, the Board previously found that the proposing and deciding officials knew of the appellant's disclosures before they proposed and sustained, respectively, the appellant's demotion. <span class="Italic">Shibuya</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 537, &#x00B6; 23. Therefore, we find that both the proposing official and the deciding official, as members of the SES, had a substantial motive to retaliate because the appellant's disclosure, which reflected poorly on the agency in general, reflected on them as well. <span class="Italic">See Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1370-71.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Ms. Hiller, moreover, failed to introduce any evidence showing that the OPLA management officials personally disliked her or had any reason to act on the animus of OTD officials, and as we have explained in the past, "it is 'the existence of any motive to retaliate on the part of the <span class="Italic">agency officials</span> who were involved in the decision [to take disciplinary action]' that is to be considered," not the retaliatory motive of others. <span class="Italic">See Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1326 (quoting <span class="Italic">Geyer v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency disputes the import of the evidence that Ms. Potter cites. But the extent to which such evidence affects a <span class="Italic">Carr</span> analysis involves factual questions for the Board--not this court in the first instance. And, as to evidence that the Board's decision failed to evaluate (including that set forth above), we cannot be assured that it was given the consideration and weight appropriate in a <span class="Italic">Carr</span> analysis. <span class="Italic">See Whitmore,</span> 680 F.3d at 1376 ("While we acknowledge that the [Board] may well have considered the countervailing evidence and rejected or discounted it for various reasons, with no basis in [its] opinion to understand [its] logic, we cannot say that [its] analysis is reasonable or complies with the law for how proof by clear and convincing evidence is to be evaluated."). Remand is therefore appropriate. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1368. On remand, the Board is not limited to considering evidence bearing on Dr. Deering's motives; rather, it should also consider any record evidence suggesting a retaliatory motive on the part of other agency officials and the extent to which such officials influenced Dr. Deering's decision. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1371 ("When a whistleblower makes...highly critical accusations of an agency's conduct, an agency official's merely being outside that whistleblower's chain of command, not directly involved in alleged retaliatory actions,...is insufficient to remove the possibility of a retaliatory motive or retaliatory influence on the whistleblower's treatment.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, from <span class="Italic">Wilson v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WILSON_ARNOLD_AT_0714_19_0113_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1919286.pdf">2022 MSPB 7</a>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 65-67 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Those responsible for the agency's performance overall," like the deciding official in this case, "may well be motivated to retaliate even if they are not directly implicated by the disclosures...as the criticism reflects on them in their capacities as managers and employees." <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1370. An appellant's criticism that reflects on an agency official in her capacity as a manager and employee is sufficient to establish a substantial retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">Chavez</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 285, &#x00B6; 33. As set forth above, the deciding official was responsible for ensuring that the equipment problems were sufficiently documented to justify to her superiors the replacement of that equipment, and for responding to media inquiries regarding the resulting shutdown in operations. Thus, the appellant's disclosures generally put higher-level management officials, including the deciding official, in a critical light by disclosing problems with equipment that those officials were responsible for replacing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, an agency's failure to investigate a charge sufficiently before bringing an action might indicate an improper motive. <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 30 (2011). The administrative judge indicated that the deciding official "was largely motivated by" the July 2017 NPOSP report, as opposed to the appellant's disclosures, in demoting him. In particular, she found the deciding official relied on the statement in the report recommending that SPS leadership be removed. However, NPOSP was not referring to the appellant in making that recommendation. Instead, NPOSP was recommending the removal of the appellant's first-line supervisor. Thus, it appears that the agency failed to ask the critical question of who NPOSP recommended be removed. In sum, we find that the agency had a strong motive to retaliate because the appellant's disclosures reflected negatively on the deciding official as a manager and other higher-level management officials, and the agency did not sufficiently investigate which individuals NPOSP recommended removing from leadership positions before demoting the appellant. Thus, we find that the second <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor weighs in the appellant's favor given the evidence and considerations set forth above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the administrative judge found that the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor weighed slightly in the agency's favor because the agency removed or reassigned other individuals in leadership positions who were not properly managing their departments. We disagree with the administrative judge's conclusion that this factor weighs in the agency's favor. Although not raised by the appellant on review, we observe that the record does not reflect, and the administrative judge did not determine, whether these individuals were nonwhistleblowers. Only evidence reflecting the agency's treatment of similarly situated nonwhistleblower employees is relevant to <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor 3. <span class="Italic">Siler v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 908 F.3d 1291, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2018). The risk associated with producing no evidence for a particular <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor falls on the Government. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because the agency did not submit evidence that nonwhistleblowers who were similarly situated to the appellant were treated the same, this factor "cannot favor" the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

The governing statute prohibits any "personnel action" taken "because of" protected whistleblowing activity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).

However, the appellant's theory ignores the administrative judge's explicit finding that none of the individuals responsible for the personnel actions at issue were influenced by anyone else in their decisions, and she identifies nothing on review that would indicate that someone with either actual or constructive knowledge of her disclosures influenced those individuals concerning the personnel actions at issue.

ASAC Daumen has stated under oath that she was not aware that the appellant made a disclosure regarding ASAC Daumen's firearm. However, to resolve the question of what ASAC Daumen knew, a hearing is necessary so that the administrative judge may make a full credibility determination, including ASAC Daumen's demeanor when testifying. <span class="Italic">See Weed</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 19 (holding that in an IRA case an administrative judge may not resolve conflicting assertions without a hearing and any doubt or ambiguity as to whether the appellant made nonfrivolous jurisdictional allegations should be resolved in favor of providing a hearing); <span class="Italic">Drake v.

Seemingly skipping over the linkage of constructive knowledge of the whistleblowing, the Board remanded for further factfinding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...While the appellant disagrees with the administrative judge's credibility determinations, we do not find his challenges to be sufficiently sound to overturn the administrative judge's findings. <span class="Italic">Haebe</span>, 288 F.3d at 1300; <span class="Italic">Kimm v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 61 F.3d 888, 892 (Fed. Cir. 1995). We therefore conclude that the appellant has failed to establish that the administrative judge erred in finding that, under the knowledge/timing test, the appellant did not establish that his disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's decision to deny him an SCI. <span class="Italic">See Swanson v. General Services Administration</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 278, &#x00B6; 12 (2008) (under the "knowledge/timing test," a whistleblowing employee can demonstrate that his disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure, and that the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the knowledge/timing test is not the only way an appellant can establish that his protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take a personnel action against him. The Board has held that, if an administrative judge determines that an appellant has failed to satisfy the knowledge/timing test, he shall consider other evidence, such as evidence pertaining to the strength or weakness of the agency's reasons for taking the personnel action, whether the whistleblowing activity was personally directed at the officials in question, and whether they had a desire or motive to retaliate against the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Dorney v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not address this alternative way to establish that an employee's protected disclosures were a contributing factor <span id="Page_3967"></span>in the agency's decision to take a personnel action. In conducting his contributing factor analysis, the administrative judge recounted some of Merritt's testimony to the effect that the appellant had not made superior contributions to the agency's mission, but the administrative judge did not consider the appellant's contrary testimony that he received SCIs in the two previous years. Additionally, the administrative judge did not consider evidence that the appellant's protected disclosures named Merritt. Finally, as noted, the administrative judge's analysis of whether Merritt had a desire or motive to retaliate against the appellant is wholly conclusory. Because credibility remains at issue, we must remand this appeal to the administrative judge to make further findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge must first consider whether the appellant has established that his protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's decision to deny him an SCI. Because we have found that the administrative judge did not err in his application of the knowledge/timing test, this analysis should consider the evidence pertaining to the strength or weakness of the agency's reasons for denying the appellant an SCI, whether the whistleblowing was personally directed at Merritt, and whether she or others had a desire or motive to retaliate against the appellant. <span class="Italic">Dorney</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 480, &#x00B6; 15. If, after this analysis, the administrative judge finds that the appellant has not established that his protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's decision to deny him an SCI, the administrative judge must conclude that the appellant is not entitled to corrective action. If, however, the administrative judge finds that the appellant has established that his protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's decision to deny him an SCI, the administrative judge must then determine whether the agency has established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action, absent the appellant's protected disclosures, and, in so doing, must apply the court's analysis in <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>.</p>

Second, although the appellant does not explain in his pleadings whether or how the decision makers within FEMA's Office of General Counsel knew of the appellant's protected disclosure, he does allege that Tetsuwari used his influence within FEMA to cause the Office of General Counsel to take the personnel actions. This amounts to an allegation that the agency decision makers either knew of the disclosure via Tetsuwari, or were influenced by Tetsuwari, who knew of the disclosure. Because the appellant's burden at this stage is only to make a nonfrivolous claim, this allegation of knowledge or constructive knowledge is minimally sufficient to meet that low standard. <span class="Italic">Daniels v.

However, Col. Lord and Mr. Vitaris made apparently conscientious and thorough efforts to ensure that the decision on the RIF was impartially made. And, the RIF appears to have been part of a legitimate cost-reduction campaign instituted by Col. Lord. The agency thus successfully limited the effect of Lt. Col.

<p class="Body-Text">Inferred knowledge of protected disclosures among a group of managers was implicit under a cat's paw theory in the analysis of a defense to an ALJ complaint, <span class="Italic">SSA v. Butler</span>, CB-7521-14-0014-T-1 (NP 8/25/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prove that a disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action, the respondent only need demonstrate that the fact of, or the content of, the protected disclosure was one of the factors that tended to affect the personnel action in any way. <span class="Italic">Carey v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 676, &#x00B6; 10 (2003). The knowledge/timing test allows an employee to demonstrate that the disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure, and that the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1). Once the knowledge/timing test has been met, an administrative judge (or here, an ALJ) must find that the respondent has shown that his whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel action at issue, even if, after a complete analysis of all of the evidence, a reasonable factfinder could not conclude that his whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Schnell v. Department of the Army</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 83, &#x00B6; 21 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ALJ mentioned the knowledge/timing test in the initial decision. However, he did not appear to analyze this test consistent with the above precedent.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Associate Chief ALJ (ACALJ) Kathleen Scully-Hayes, who signed the complaint, testified that she did not know about any of the respondent's disclosures. She further testified that she received a draft complaint from the Division of Quality Services (DQS) in the Office of General Counsel, and she discussed with DQS various aspects of the complaint and proposed discipline. The U.S. Supreme Court has adopted the term "cat's paw" to describe a theory explaining instances in which a particular management official, acting because of improper animus, influences an agency official who is unaware of the improper animus when implementing a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Dorney v. Department of the Army</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 480, &#x00B6; 11 (2012) (citing <span class="Italic">Staub v. Proctor Hospital</span>, 562 U.S. 411 (2011)). We find that the cat's paw theory is applicable in this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that SSA management "always" has to involve DQS in matters pertaining to ALJs. In fact, DQS was involved in "talking points" for a June 2013 directive and a November 2013 reprimand, both of which were issued to the respondent prior to the complaint. Additionally, the complaint identified, among other things, the following relevant agency correspondence: (1) Chief ALJ (CALJ) Debra Bice's January 2013 memorandum, which reminded all ALJs that they are subordinate to the agency on matters of law and policy and that they must follow agency policies, including HALLEX; (2) Acting Assistant Regional Chief ALJ (AARCALJ) Michael Davenport's June 2013 directive that ordered the respondent to rehear three different matters with an interpreter; (3) Regional ALJ (RALJ) Ollie Garmon's November 2013 reprimand to the respondent based on his failure to comply with earlier directives regarding the use of interpreters; and (4) HOCALJ D'Alessio's October 31, 2013, November 13, 2013, and February 7, 2014 directives.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, CALJ Bice, RALJ Garmon, and HOCALJ D'Alessio each had some knowledge of the respondent's disclosures. We find it more likely than not that these SSA officials with knowledge of the respondent's protected disclosures would have shared this information with others in DQS. Under these circumstances, we find that the respondent has proven by preponderant evidence that knowledge of his disclosures is imputed to ACALJ Scully-Hayes under the cat's paw theory. Thus, the knowledge component of the knowledge/timing test is satisfied. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cahill v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 821 F.3d 1370, 1374 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">Whether the agency official involved in the challenged personnel practice knew of the appellant's protected disclosures is a question of fact to be resolved, if necessary, through evaluation of evidence and a determination of credibility based on the appellant's burden of proof on that issue by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Iyer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 95 MSPR 239, 243 &#x00B6; 9 (2003).

<p class="Body-Text">It may be shown circumstantially that an official had actual knowledge of disclosures; with this proof, one need not delve into constructive knowledge, as in <span class="Italic">McClellan v. DOD</span>, 53 MSPR 139, 146-47 (1992), determining that a reassignment was motivated by whistleblowing reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, the agency appears to argue, briefly, that the appellant must show that General Thomson had actual knowledge of the disclosure. We note, however, that in <span class="Italic">Gergick</span>, 43 MSPR at 651, the Board quoted from a joint explanatory statement regarding the Whistleblower Protection Bill in which House and Senate members made the following statement regarding ways to meet the "contributory factor" burden:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">One of the many possible ways to show that the whistleblowing was a factor in the personnel action is to show that the official taking the action knew (<span class="Italic">or had constructive knowledge</span>) of the disclosure and acted within such a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a factor in the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, Congress has allowed for the possibility that an individual may establish reprisal by evidence short of actual knowledge of the protected disclosure by the official taking the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency argues that even if the appellant had to show only that General Thomson had constructive knowledge of the disclosure, he failed to meet this burden because he did not show that anyone with actual knowledge of his disclosure influenced General Thomson's decision to reassign him. The agency cites <span class="Italic">Frazier v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 672 F.2d 150, 166-68 (D.C. Cir. 1982), to support its argument. It also asserts that the administrative judge improperly shifted the burden of proof to the agency to show that General Thomson lacked knowledge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject the agency's assertion that the administrative judge required it to show that General Thomson did not have knowledge of the appellant's disclosure. The agency is simply disagreeing with the administrative judge's findings concerning the sufficiency of the evidence. The agency's unsupported belief that the evidence is inadequate to establish the appellant's case does not show that the administrative judge improperly shifted the burden of proof to the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that <span class="Italic">Frazier</span> is a constructive knowledge case. In <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>, the court found that an appellant could show that the official accused of taking retaliatory action had constructive knowledge of the appellant's protected disclosure by showing that individuals with actual knowledge of the disclosure influenced the official's action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 166-68. However, the court did not state that this was the <span class="Italic">only</span> way to show constructive knowledge in a reprisal case. Indeed, contrary to the agency's assertion, the court allowed for the possibility that reprisal could be shown by establishing that a person with only constructive knowledge, as opposed to actual knowledge, of an appellant's disclosure influenced the official taking the action against the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 167-68.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, we find it unnecessary to elaborate on the definition of constructive knowledge or to determine how such knowledge can be shown, because the analysis in the initial decision is consistent with a finding that General Thomson had <span class="Italic">actual</span> knowledge of the appellant's protected disclosure. Specifically, the administrative judge found that although there was no direct proof that General Thomson knew of the protected disclosure, there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to support a finding that he knew of the disclosure. We find that the administrative judge's consideration of circumstantial evidence was proper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge based his conclusion that General Thomson knew of the appellant's disclosure on evidence concerning the usual method of handling Congressional inquiries and on his assessment of the appellant's and General Thomson's relative credibility.

SSA,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WEED_ALVERN_C_DE_1221_09_0320_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_473250.pdf">113 MSPR 221</a>, 233 &#x00B6; 22, 2010 MSPB 23 (2010), addresses the possibility of constructive knowledge by agency officials of disclosures related to them by their own representative, who in turn learned of the disclosures in other litigation with the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, we find that the appellant has made sufficient allegations to satisfy the jurisdictional standard set forth in Yunus that his alleged disclosures were a contributing factor in the determination not to appoint him to a position. The appellant states in this appeal that, while it was aware of his continuing interest in working in Kalispell, Montana, and shortly after he filed his complaint with OSC, the agency retaliated against him by knowingly and intentionally concealing several vacancies in the Montana Field Office from him and by filling the vacancies through restricted recruitment efforts limited to University of Montana students without any public announcement. He has not specifically alleged that the selecting official and other agency officials involved in the hiring actions knew of his protected activity. However, the Board has held that an appellant can show that a disclosure described under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) was a contributing factor in a personnel action by proving that the official taking the action had "constructive," i.e., imputed, knowledge of the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Marchese v. Department of the Navy,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 104, 108 (1994). An appellant may establish imputed knowledge by demonstrating that an individual with actual knowledge of the disclosure influenced the official accused of taking the retaliatory action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the appellant has alleged that the agency's representative in his other appeals had actual knowledge of his disclosures and that she was advising the management officials who filled the positions at issue. On remand, the appellant will have an opportunity to present evidence and argument to show that the selecting official for the positions had either actual knowledge or constructive knowledge, and that his disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's decision to restrict the hiring process only to University of Montana students, using FCIP.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Any requirement of knowledge, direct or constructive, of agency managers responsible for reprisal should not be equated to a requirement that specific managers be identified as being wholly or partially responsible for reprisal. A series of managers may be involved in a personnel decision. Relief in an IRA case is sought against the agency. The degree of influence of a particular manager in a personnel decision challenged through an IRA appeal is not a jurisdictional element of the claim, <span class="Italic">Worthington v. DOD</span>, 81 MSPR 532, 535-36 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he identity of the officials who were responsible for the personnel <span id="Page_3970"></span>action is not relevant to the jurisdictional question in an IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction over an IRA is derived from 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221. That section states, in relevant part, that "[s]ubject to...subsection 1214(a)(3), an employee, former employee or applicant for employment may, with respect to any personnel action taken, or proposed to be taken...as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8), seek corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board." Combining this section with subsection 1214(a)(3), the Board has held that, to establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal, an appellant must show by preponderant evidence that: He engaged in whistleblower activity by making a disclosure protected under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); the agency took or failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take, a "personnel action" as defined in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2); and he raised the issue before the OSC, and proceedings before the OSC were exhausted. <span class="Italic">Geyer v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Justice,</span> 63 MSPR 13, 16-17 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, although the AJ explicitly found that the appellant had satisfied each of the three jurisdictional elements in <span class="Italic">Geyer,</span> he relied on <span class="Italic">Frederick v. Department of Justice,</span> 73 F.3d 349 (Fed. Cir. 1996) and <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Spears,</span> 75 MSPR 639 (1997) in finding that the Board lacked jurisdiction nevertheless because the appellant had not shown that the two officials named by him made recommendations that were sufficiently decisive to constitute the taking of an action or the failure to take an action. <span class="Italic">Frederick</span> and <span class="Italic">Spears</span>, however, involved disciplinary actions taken against alleged retaliating officials, while in the instant case, the appellant is seeking corrective action under sections 1214 and 1221.[2] This difference is critical.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Spears,</span> OSC brought the action against the appellant under its authority in 5 USC &#x00A7; 1215. 75 MSPR at 645. In <span class="Italic">Frederick,</span> although it was the employing agency that brought the disciplinary action, with OSC's approval, under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(f), the court applied the same standard of proof that applies when OSC brings a disciplinary action based on a violation of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). 73 F.3d at 352.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a disciplinary action, in order to establish a violation of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), OSC (or the charging agency) must show that: (1) the acting official has the authority to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action; (2) the aggrieved employee made a disclosure protected under section 2302(b)(8); (3) the acting official used his authority to take, or refuse to take, a personnel action against the aggrieved employee; (4) the acting official took, or failed to take, the personnel action against the aggrieved employee because of the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Eidmann v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 976 F.2d 1400, 1407 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Thus, in <span class="Italic">Frederick,</span> the court's inquiry into whether the acting official took or failed to take an action was part of the determination <span class="Italic">on</span> <span class="Italic">the merits</span> of the agency's action, and was necessary in order to determine whether that particular official should be held liable for a prohibited personnel practice. <span class="Italic">See Frederick</span>, 73 F.3d at 352. In contrast, in an IRA appeal, the purpose is not to determine which agency official was responsible for an action, but to determine whether t<span class="Italic">he agency</span> took a wrongful personnel action against the appellant, and whether that action should be corrected. Indeed, the second jurisdictional element in an IRA appeal is whether <span class="Italic">the agency</span> took or failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take a personnel action against the appellant. <span class="Italic">See O'Brien v. Office of Independent Counsel</span>, 74 MSPR 192, 197 (1997). If the appellant satisfies that element, and otherwise meets his jurisdictional burden, the AJ must consider the appeal on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Paul v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 66 MSPR 643, 647 (1995) (once the appellant establishes Board jurisdiction over his IRA appeal, the AJ must consider the appeal on the merits).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In adjudicating the appeal on the merits, the degree of involvement of specific agency officials in the decision to take or fail to take the personnel action will most likely be relevant in determining whether the disclosures were a contributing factor in the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For purposes of establishing jurisdiction, the Board may assume that circumstances of a disclosure led to knowledge of personnel charged with reprisal, <span class="Italic">Tello v. DHS,</span> DA-1221-10-0137-W-1 (NP 7/18/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As to his claim that he was stripped of his law enforcement authority and assigned administrative duties, the appellant alleged that he sent copies of his April 28, 2009 letter to the Department of Justice to the Hebbronville Border Patrol Station and the Laredo Sector Station where he was employed. Even though he did not copy the letter to any particular individual, it is reasonable to assume, as the appellant alleged, that management officials, including Acting Deputy Chief Patrol Agent John Esquivel, would have been aware of the letter in that it contained very serious allegations of wrongdoing. Moreover, Esquivel notified the appellant by memorandum of August 4, 2009, that, effective immediately, his authority to carry a Service-issued firearm and non-deadly force weapons was rescinded, based on allegations of off-duty misconduct for which he had been recently interviewed and that he was placed on administrative duties, effective immediately. This personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the appellant's disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 469, &#x00B6; 26 (2010). Based on the knowledge/timing test, we therefore find that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that his disclosure to the Department of Justice was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to strip him of the law enforcement duties and place him on administrative duties, and that he has therefore established the Board's jurisdiction over his IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may engage in speculative factfinding as to management's knowledge of arguably protected disclosures, <span class="Italic">Coulter v. Dept. of Navy,</span> SF-1221-12-0271-B-2 (NP 6/15/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the problem with the door also was a known issue dating to the original installation of the door and the safety hazard was caused by a design flaw. The building, however, was designated an historical building and the agency had to get state approval to make the changes that would have fixed the problem, which remains unresolved. The steam vent pipe also was a known issue and the agency frequently addressed the issue with temporary insulation that unfortunately did not last very long. However, the building was undergoing a major renovation that would include fixing the problem with the steam pipe, so less-than-ideal temporary remedies seem appropriate under the circumstances. Although the underlying safety issues were quite serious, none of the appellant's disclosures were a surprise or had any qualities that would make them stand out in a crowd of other similar disclosures, and there is no reason why the appellant's reports would have attracted particular hostile attention. It also makes sense that the appellant's supervisor would simply tell the deciding official, for example, that there has been another lock-out tag-out issue without thinking to identify the employee who reported the problem.</p>
