<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-185"><span class="space">2.</span> Basis for Waiver</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 8346(b) establishes the basis for waiving CSRS overpayments from the retirement fund:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recovery of payments under this subchapter may not be made from an individual when, in the judgment of the Office of Personnel Management, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. Withholding or recovery of money mentioned by this subchapter on account of a certification or payment made by a former employee of the United States in the discharge of his official duties may be made only if the head of the agency on behalf of which the certification or payment was made certifies to the Office that the certification or payment involved fraud on the part of the former employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For FERS, the corresponding statute is 5 USC 8470(b):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recovery of payments under subchapter II, IV, or V of this chapter may not be made from an individual when, in the judgment of the Office, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. Withholding or recovery of money paid under subchapter II, IV, or V of this chapter on account of a certification or payment made by a former employee of the United States in the discharge of his official duties may be made only if the head of the agency on behalf of which the certification or payment was made certifies to the Office that the certification or payment involved fraud on the part of the former employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM CSRS standards for waiver of overpayments are at 5 CFR 831 Subpart N (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Standards for Waiver of Overpayments</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 831.1401 Conditions for waiver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recovery of an overpayment from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund may be waived pursuant to section 8346(b), of title 5, United States Code, when the annuitant (a) is without fault and (b) recovery would be against equity and good conscience. Where it has been determined that the recipient of an overpayment is ineligible for waiver, the individual is nevertheless entitled to an adjustment in the recovery schedule if he/she shows that it would cause him/her financial hardship to make payment at the rate scheduled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 831.1402 Fault.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A recipient of an overpayment is without fault if he/she performed no act of commission or omission which resulted in the overpayment. The fact that the Office of Personnel Management may have been at fault in initiating an overpayment will not necessarily relieve the individual from liability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Considerations.</span> Pertinent considerations in finding fault are--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Whether payment resulted from the individual's incorrect but not necessarily fraudulent statement, which he/she should have known to be incorrect;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Whether payment resulted from the individual's failure to disclose material facts in his/her possession which he/she should have known to be material; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Whether he/she accepted a payment which he/she knew or should have known to be erroneous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Mitigation factors.</span> The individual's age, physical and mental condition or the nature of the information supplied to him/her by OPM or a Federal agency may mitigate against finding fault if one or more contributed to his/her submission of an incorrect statement, a statement which did not disclose material facts in his/her possession, or his/her acceptance of an erroneous overpayment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 831.1403 Equity and good conscience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Defined.</span> Recovery is against equity and good conscience when--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;It would cause financial hardship to the person from whom it is sought;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The recipient of the overpayment can show (regardless of his or her financial circumstances) that due to the notice that such payment would be made or because of the incorrect payment either he/she has relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Recovery could be unconscionable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 831.1404 Financial hardship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Financial hardship may be deemed to exist in--but not limited to--those situations where the annuitant from whom collection is sought needs substantially all of his/her current income and liquid assets to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Considerations.</span> Some pertinent considerations in determining whether recovery would cause financial hardship are as follows:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Standards for Waiver of Overpayments</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 845.301 Conditions for waiver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recovery of an overpayment from the Fund may be waived pursuant to section 8470(b), of title 5, United States Code, when (a) the annuitant is without fault and (b) recovery would be against equity and good conscience. When it has been determined that the recipient of an overpayment is ineligible for waiver, the individual is nevertheless entitled to an adjustment in the recovery schedule if he or she shows that it would cause him or her financial hardship to make payment at the rate scheduled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 845.302 Fault.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A recipient of an overpayment is without fault if he or she performed no act of commission or omission that resulted in the overpayment. The fact that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or another agency may have been at fault in initiating an overpayment will not necessarily relieve the individual from liability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Considerations.</span> Pertinent considerations in finding fault are--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Whether payment resulted from the individual's incorrect but not necessarily fraudulent statement, which he or she should have known to be incorrect;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Whether payment resulted from the individual's failure to disclose material facts in his or her possession, which he or she should have known to be material; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Whether he or she accepted a payment that he or she knew or should have known to be erroneous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Mitigation factors.</span> The individual's age, physical and mental condition or the nature of the information supplied to him or her by OPM or a Federal agency may mitigate against finding fault if one or more of these factors contributed to his or her submission of an incorrect statement, a statement that did not disclose material facts in his or her possession, or his or her acceptance of an erroneous overpayment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 845.303 Equity and good conscience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recovery is against equity and good conscience when--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;It would cause financial hardship to the person from whom it is sought;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;The recipient of the overpayment can show (regardless of his or her financial circumstances) that due to the notice that such payment would be made or because of the incorrect payment he or she either has relinquished a valuable right or has changed positions for the worse; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Recovery would be unconscionable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 845.304 Financial hardship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Financial hardship may be deemed to exist in, but not limited to, those situations when the annuitant from whom collection is sought needs substantially all of his or her current income and liquid assets to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Considerations.</span> Some pertinent considerations in determining whether recovery would cause financial hardship are as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The individual's financial ability to pay at the time collection is scheduled to be made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Income to other family member(s), if such member's ordinary and necessary living expenses are included in expenses reported by the annuitant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exemptions.</span> Assets exempt from execution under State law should not be considered in determining an individual's ability to repay the indebtedness. Rather primary emphasis will be placed upon the annuitant's liquid assets and current income in making such determinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 845.305 Ordinary and necessary living expenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual's ordinary and necessary living expenses include rent, mortgage payments, utilities, maintenance, transportation, food, clothing, insurance (life, health, and accident), taxes, installment payments, medical expenses, support expenses for which the annuitant is legally responsible, and other miscellaneous expenses that the individual can establish as being ordinary and necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 845.306 Waiver precluded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Waiver of an overpayment cannot be granted when--</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The overpayment and recovery regulations are summarized by <span class="Italic">Nelson v. OPM</span>, 612 Fed. Appx. 603 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The authority to waive overpayments is in statute and in implementing OPM regulations, as described in <span class="Italic">Sawyer v. OPM</span>, 72 MSPR 496 (1996) (Member Amador dissenting), emphasizing the need to waive overpayment debt, rather than adjust repayment schedules, when the recipient is without fault and recovery would be contrary to equity and good conscience, the statutory terms. The 1996 <span class="Italic">Sawyer</span> decision was vacated on an OPM reconsideration petition, <span class="Italic">Sawyer v. OPM</span>, 74 MSPR 527 (1997), although the Board did not explicitly disavow the reasoning of the 1996 decision, 72 MSPR at 501-04:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The text of the statute and Board precedent make clear that recovery of an overpayment must be waived if an appellant is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience (as it would if recovery would cause the appellant financial hardship). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b); <span class="Italic">Thornhill v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 600, 602 (1996). When it promulgated regulations under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b), similarly, OPM recognized that the statute made waiver "mandatory" once the conditions for waiver had been met. <span class="Italic">See</span> 45 Fed. Reg. 23,631, 23,632 (1980). Finally, when it analyzed another statute addressing the recovery of overpayments (42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 404), the Supreme Court noted the difference between statutes in which waiver of recovery was merely permissible and those in which waiver was mandatory based on satisfaction of specified conditions. Concerning the latter, the Court found it "reasonable to infer...that Congress did not intend to exalt recovery over waiver."<span class="Italic">See Califano v. Yamasaki</span>, 442 U.S. 682, 684-85 &#x0026; n.1, 693-94 &#x0026; n.9 (1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b) bolsters that inference here. The waiver provision was originally enacted in 1944. It stated that "there shall be no recovery" of an overpayment from an individual found not at fault and when such recovery would be contrary to equity and good conscience. <span class="Italic">See</span> Civil Service Retirement Act--Annuity Payments, ch. 274, Pub. L. No. 351, 78th Cong., 2d Sess. (1944), <span class="Italic">reprinted</span> in 1944 U.S.C.C.S. (58 Stat.) 345. Prior to its enactment, the discovery of an overpayment would result in the termination of an annuity without right to future payments until the overpayment had been repaid. As a result of the hardship suffered by employees in this situation who had accepted an overpayment without knowledge that they were violating the applicable law, the Civil Service Commission sponsored a bill directing it to waive recovery of an overpayment on the terms mentioned above. Congress reported favorably on the aims of the bill in enacting it into law. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 1396, 78th Cong., 2d Sess., <span class="Italic">reprinted</span> in 1944 U.S.C.C.S. 1151-52. Congress expanded the scope of the waiver statute in 1956 by directing waiver of "payments" rather than merely "annuities" under the specified conditions. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Executive Pay Act of 1956, ch. 804, Pub. L. No. 854, &#x00A7; 401, 70 Stat. 758, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1956 U.S.C.C.A.N. 858, 867, 885; S. Rep. No. 2642, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. (1956), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1956 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3725, 3737. Congress first codified the waiver provision (without substantive change) as 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b) in 1966. <span class="Italic">See</span> Act of September 6, 1966, Pub. L. No. 89-554, 80 Stat. 378, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1966 U.S.C.C.A.N. 429, 708-09, 767. The waiver provision was amended without substantive change in 1978. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346 notes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The mandatory terms of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b) and its legislative history thus support the conclusion that Congress strongly intended and commanded obligatory waiver of recovery of overpayments for appellants who were without fault and when recovery would be against equity and good conscience. They do not support a finding that the statutory scheme exalts recovery of an overpayment over waiver. Unfortunately, however, Member Amador appears to endorse exactly that result by stating that the Board's proper response to a scheduled repayment amount that would cause an appellant (found not to be at fault) financial hardship is to reduce that amount in order to forestall such hardship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying that approach here to an appellant without fault, however, would render the issue of fault meaningless in determining whether <span id="Page_4410"></span>waiver or adjustment is warranted in overpayment cases. If recovery as scheduled by OPM would cause the appellant financial hardship, the statute requires waiver in imperative terms. Congress's primary purpose in enacting the waiver provision was to relieve employees who had accepted an overpayment in good faith and without knowledge of any violation of the law from financial hardship incurred by repayment of the debt. To find that such individuals are still obligated to repay the debt is not consistent with Congress's statement of the policy underlying the waiver statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Board precedent also makes clear that such an approach is untenable, as the Member himself admits. In <span class="Italic">Derrico</span>, the administrative judge conceded that the recovery schedule set by OPM would cause the appellant (who was not at fault) financial hardship but, instead of finding that waiver was proper, reduced the scheduled monthly repayment amount. The Board found, however, that adjustment was not a discretionary alternative to waiver. It concluded that a finding that recovery would cause the appellant financial hardship required "waiver of the entire overpayment" and that "it would be error...to then adjust the recovery schedule as a means of alleviating the hardship."<span class="Italic">See Derrico [supra]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">.</span> The Board has consistently held that it will consider the issue of adjustment of the recovery schedule only when the conditions for waiver have not been met. <span class="Italic">See Claviere v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 40, 41 (1992); <span class="Italic">Portello v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 261, 269 n.8 (1992); <span class="Italic">Derrico</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 499 &#x0026; n.8. It has never held that adjustment of the recovery schedule is proper so that (in effect) the Board may ensure that one of the conditions for waiver (financial hardship) will not be met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has not done so because the terms of the statute, its legislative history, and the precedent discussed above simply do not permit it to "exalt recovery over waiver" when the conditions for the latter have been met, as they have here. In suggesting a departure from this well-established body of law, the Member cites the "broad" terms of the statute and explains that he wishes to prevent "windfalls" to appellants who have at least a limited ability to repay the debt owed to OPM. This approach to statutory construction, however, is mistaken. The meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context; the words of a statute thus must be read as a whole and in a way which best harmonizes with the setting in which they are used and promotes the policy and objectives of the legislature. <span class="Italic">See King v. St. Vincent's Hospital</span>, 112 S. Ct. 570, 574 &#x0026; n.10 (1991). While we must accord OPM deference in interpreting and applying "general" language in the statutory provisions it administers, then, we also must conduct our own review to determine whether its interpretation is reasonable in light of the language, policies, and enactment history of the statute. <span class="Italic">See Tiniken Co. v. United States</span>, 37 F.3d 1470, 1474 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What is striking about the dissent, however, is the absence of any examination of the legislative history and policy behind the "broad" language of the statute. It instead bases its proposed departure from existing law on the conclusion that it promotes the public policy of preventing "windfalls" to appellants who have at least some ability to repay a debt. Whether or not this is a laudable public-policy goal, however, is irrelevant. Appropriate respect for legislative authority requires agencies to refrain from the temptation to stretch their jurisdiction to decide questions of competing public priorities whose resolution properly lies with Congress. <span class="Italic">See Killip v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 991 F.2d 1564, 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b) evidences Congress's policy of mandating debt relief for annuitants who, through no fault of their own, have received an overpayment and where recovery would be against equity and good conscience (as it would if recovery imposed a financial hardship). Although the dissent appears to acknowledge that recovery as scheduled would impose a financial hardship, it recommends not waiver as required by Congress but has instead interposed its own public-policy views in proposing adjustment of the repayment schedule. The Board, however, cannot adopt this proposal because it lacks the authority to disregard the legislative history and policy behind 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b). <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 112 S. Ct. at 574 n.10; <span class="Italic">Timken</span>, 37 F.3d at 1474; <span class="Italic">Killip</span>, 991 F.2d at 1570.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM standards for overpayment waivers have varied over time. Decisions discussed in the sections that follow may touch squarely, or only indirectly, on the current factors established by statute and OPM regulations governing overpayment recovery.</p>
