<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-174"><span class="space">f.</span> Agency Rules, Regulations That Do Not Conflict With Contract Provisions; Effect of Incorporation of Agency Rules in Negotiated Agreements</h5>
<p class="noindent">Assuming there is no applicable provision of a negotiated agreement, a matter discussed below, FLRA will find an award deficient under &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1) if it conflicts with a governing agency rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Military Sealift Command and MEBA</span>, 58 FLRA 558, 559 (2003) ("An award is deficient if it is inconsistent with a governing agency regulation."); <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, San Diego and AFGE INS Council</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v51/51-089.html">51 FLRA 1094</a>, 1103 (1996) (citing <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Ogden Serv. Ctr. and NTEU Chap. 67</span>, 42 FLRA 1034, 1056 (1991)); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916 and Dept. of Air Force, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Command, Tinker AFB</span>, 47 FLRA 735, 740 (1993) (stating rule and noting that arbitrators have authority to interpret and enforce agency regulations); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, San Antonio Air Logistics Ctr., Kelly AFB and AFGE Local 1617</span>, 44 FLRA 1195, 1200 (1992) (stating rule). FLRA "will determine whether the award is inconsistent with the plain wording of, or is otherwise impermissible under, the rule or regulation," a test that assesses, through <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law, based on the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1203 and VAMC Long Beach</span>, 55 FLRA 528, 530 (1999); <span class="Italic">cf. DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 2455</span>, 72 FLRA 171 (2021) (Chairman DuBester dissenting) (setting aside award that relied on an evidentiary standard that differed from the standard identified by agency regulation governing suspension or revocation of law enforcement status or firearm carry authorization).</p> 
<p class="noindent">Only an arbitration award that conflicts with a rule or regulation that governs the matter in dispute will be found deficient for that reason. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Air Warfare Ctr. and AFGE Local 1744</span>, 54 FLRA 1182, 1187 (1998) ("An agency regulation governs the matter in dispute when no provisions of a collective bargaining agreement address the matter."). Recall that a contract provision is not invalid based on the argument that it conflicts with an agency regulation supported by a compelling need. The compelling need issue is to be raised during negotiations, or it is waived, and when raised it can only be resolved in a negotiability appeal. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Campbell Dist., Third Region and AFGE Local 2022</span>, 37 FLRA 186 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell</span>). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-171.html#sec9-169">Conflict Between Contract Provisions and Government-Wide Regulations, Agency Rules and Regulations</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">If the contract incorporates government-wide regulations, those regulations control. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 238</span>, 65 FLRA 369, 371 (2010) (recon. den.<span class="Italic">,</span> 65 FLRA 630 (2011)) ("government-wide regulations govern a matter in dispute to which they apply, even if the same matter is covered by a collective bargaining agreement under the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Ft. Campbell Dist., Third Region, Fort Campbell, Ky.</span>, 37 FLRA 186, 193 (1990)."). An agency handbook may constitute an agency regulation, but if the handbook is incorporated into the parties' contract, the dispute over the enforceability of the award, if dependent on the handbook, is a matter of contract interpretation invoking the "essence" exception. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1760</span>, 65 FLRA 523, 526-27 (2011), involving access to agency data systems for a union president who was retired from his agency job, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the Arbitrator, the Agency argued that the Handbook required termination of the President's access to the system. Although the Agency did not specifically characterize the Handbook as a "rule or regulation," there is no dispute that the Handbook is an Agency regulation. Agency regulations are, as a matter of law, "rule[s] or regulation[s]" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Fort Campbell Dist., Third Region, Fort Campbell, Ky.</span>, 37 FLRA 186, 192 (1990). In addition, the Union points to no requirement that a party specifically characterize an Agency regulation as a "rule or regulation" before an arbitrator in order for the party to preserve its ability to later challenge the arbitrator's award as contrary to rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery VA Med. Ctr., Jackson, Miss.</span>, 65 FLRA 27, 29 <span id="page_1971"></span>(2010) (in dismissing exception on ground that agency did not challenge requested remedies as inconsistent with "[a]gency directives" before arbitrator, Authority did not address whether agency failed to properly characterize agency directives as laws, rules, or regulations). Consistent with the foregoing, we find that the Agency is not precluded from arguing that the Handbook is a rule or regulation within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Addressing the merits of the Agency's exception, when a collective bargaining agreement incorporates the agency regulation with which an award allegedly conflicts, the matter becomes one of contract interpretation because the agreement, not the regulation, governs the matter in dispute. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Council of Prison Locals 33</span>, 59 FLRA 381, 382 (2003). The Authority has found that where, "as plainly worded and interpreted by the [a]rbitrator," a collective bargaining agreement provides that certain matters are required to be conducted in accordance with an agency regulation, "the agreement effectively incorporates" the regulation. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Agric., Animal &#x0026; Plant Health Inspection Serv., Plant Prot. &#x0026; Quarantine</span>, 51 FLRA 1210, 1216-17 (1996) (<span class="Italic">APHIS</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency argues that the award is contrary to the Handbook. Specifically, the Agency claims, and there is no dispute, that the agreement requires that Union access to the system be consistent with Agency policies, including the Handbook. In these circumstances, consistent with <span class="Italic">APHIS</span>, we consider the Handbook "effectively incorporate[d]" into the agreement, and we treat the matter as "one of contract interpretation[,]" <span class="Italic">id. </span>Accordingly, below we apply an "essence" analysis to assess the Agency's argument.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA provided its view of its role in reviewing arbitrators' awards that apply agency regulations in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and NTEU Chap. 243</span>, 65 FLRA 13, 17-18 (2010) (Member Beck, dissenting), involving the agency's merit assignment program ("MAP"), noting that the level of its deference depends on whether the agency's interpretation of its regulations is litigation-oriented or whether that interpretation reflects the interpretation of the agency head:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the resolution of grievances under the Statute, arbitrators are empowered to interpret and apply agency rules and regulations.

However, consistent with the approach of the courts, the Authority declines to defer to an agency's "litigative position[&#8197;]." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(quoting <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Treasury</span>, 884 F.2d at 1455)). In this regard, the Authority has explained that such positions may not reflect the views of the agency head and may have been developed "hastily, or under special pressure, or without an adequate opportunity for presentation of conflicting views." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Accordingly, for an agency's interpretation to be entitled to deference, the interpretation asserted in exceptions must have been publicly articulated prior to "litigation[.]" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(quoting <span class="Italic">Nordell v. Heckler</span>, 749 F.2d 47, 48 (D.C. Cir. 1984)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the Agency's view, nothing in the MAP precludes a human resources specialist from seeking advice from a subject-matter expert, including a selecting official, on whether an applicant meets selective qualification factors. To the extent that this constitutes the Agency's interpretation of the MAP to which it alleges the Authority must defer, the Agency does not assert that this interpretation of the MAP reflects the views of the Agency head rather than the litigative position of the Agency before the Authority. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>There is also no indication that this interpretation was developed in a manner that reflects deliberate consideration or that it was previously publicly articulated. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>(citing <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Treasury</span>, 884 F.2d at 1455). As such, the Agency has not established that its interpretation of the regulation is entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">See id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In circumstances where an agency fails to establish that deference is due its alleged interpretation of an agency regulation, the Authority independently assesses whether the arbitrator's interpretation of the regulation is consistent with its provisions. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Union argued to the Arbitrator that the selecting official's determination violated the MAP because it was not applied to all candidates. In assessing the selecting official's determination, the Arbitrator found that the MAP requires uniform and equitable treatment. In this regard, MAP, Section I (Purpose) specifically provides that employees will receive equitable treatment, and Section II (Policy) specifically provides that all vacancies will be treated uniformly. In finding a violation of the MAP, the Arbitrator found that the selecting official reviewed some, but not all, of the applications for the vacancy. It is not disputed that these provisions must be strictly applied. Section XIII of the MAP expressly provides for the remedy awarded by the Arbitrator "[w]hen there is a failure to adhere strictly to the provisions of" the MAP. The Agency does not address these findings in its exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the Agency fails to demonstrate that, contrary to the conclusion of the Arbitrator, it strictly treated the grievant equitably and the vacancy uniformly, as required by the MAP. Further, the Agency does not demonstrate how the selecting official's determination prior to evaluation by the MAP panel is strictly consistent with the mandated roles and sequence requirements of the placement process. The MAP assigns the office of human resources, the selecting official, and the rating and ranking panel distinct roles in the selection process. Pursuant to Section V of the MAP, the human resources office is responsible for screening applications and evaluating candidates for positions. Section IX of the MAP emphasizes that evaluations will be made by the human resources office and specifies only one exception: when the selecting official specifically requests the establishment of a panel. In such cases, the panel determines the qualifications, and the selecting official advises the panel on the interpretation of qualifications, but has no vote. The Arbitrator found that the selecting official, rather than the human resources specialist, determined that the grievant was not qualified prior to the establishment of the MAP panel, and there is no dispute that the selecting official did not request the establishment of a panel. This finding supports the Arbitrator's conclusion that the selecting official's determination violated the MAP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also contends that the Arbitrator's interpretation of the MAP is deficient because the Arbitrator prescribed an incorrect standard of proof and improperly placed the burden of proof on the Agency. If a standard of proof is set forth in applicable law or regulation or the parties' collective bargaining agreement, then the arbitrator must apply the prescribed standard. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office, Arlington, Va.</span>, 60 FLRA 869, 881 (2005). When no standard is prescribed, arbitrators are empowered to prescribe whatever standard they consider appropriate, and their awards will not be found deficient on the basis that they applied an incorrect standard of proof. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Moreover, unless otherwise provided, prescribing the standard of proof encompasses specifying which party has the burden of proof. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In this case, the Agency does not claim that law, regulation, or the agreement prescribed the standard of proof or which party had the burden of proof, and its contentions provide no basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Arbitrators interpret agency rules, and their interpretations stand unless they are inconsistent with the plain ruling of the rule, under <span class="Italic">VAMC Dayton and Nat'l Nurses United</span>, 68 FLRA 360, 361-62 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting), involving application of rule regulating personal use of a computer on agency time:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving grievances under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute), arbitrators are empowered to interpret and apply agency rules and regulations.[22] When evaluating exceptions asserting that an award is contrary to a governing agency rule or regulation, the Authority will determine whether the award is inconsistent with the plain wording of, or is otherwise impermissible under, the rule or regulation.[23]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Relevant to the Agency's arguments about its policy, we note that arbitrators have the authority to interpret and apply agency rules and regulations in the resolution of grievances under the Statute, just as the Arbitrator did in this dispute.[26] But the Agency asserts that the Authority must defer to the Agency's own interpretation of the policy when evaluating its motion for reconsideration. Even assuming that such deference generally is warranted where an agency's interpretation of its regulation differs from an arbitrator's, the Authority does not defer to an agency's purely "litigative positions"; the Authority defers only to those interpretations that an agency "publicly articulated some time prior to" arbitration "over the disputed provision."[28] The Agency does not assert that it publicly articulated its interpretation of the policy provision at issue here prior to arbitration, so we decline to defer to that interpretation. Accordingly, we assess whether the Arbitrator erred in his interpretation and application of the policy.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, the Agency asserts that the Arbitrator applied the term "reorganization" contrary to its definition and use in the Agency regulation, but concedes that the Agency regulation does not define "reorganization." More generally, the substance of the Agency's exception is that any reduction in disputed employees' pay was the result of the employees' voluntary choice, not the result of a management-directed action as part of a reorganization. To the extent that the Agency is now arguing that situations involving employees' voluntary choices do not constitute "reorganizations" within the meaning of the Agency regulation, the Agency does not assert that this interpretation of the regulation reflects the views of the Agency head rather than the litigative position of the Agency before the Authority. <span class="Italic">See FAA, Washington,</span> 58 FLRA at 25-26; FAA, 56 FLRA at 630. There is also no indication that this interpretation was developed in a manner that reflects deliberate consideration, or that it was previously publicly articulated. <span class="Italic">See DOJ,</span> 51 FLRA at 1136 (citing <span class="Italic">FLRA v.

As discussed above, the Arbitrator noted testimony that described the disputed actions as the planned elimination, addition, and redistribution of functions and duties, which "restructured" positions. Assessing the disputed actions, he noted that, although the Agency repeatedly referred to the disputed actions as a "restructuring" rather than a reorganization, the restructuring of positions constitutes a "reorganization" under the OPM definition. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Consequently, the Arbitrator found that the disputed actions constituted a reorganization under the Agency regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency provides no support for its assertion that this interpretation and application of the term "reorganization" is contrary to its use in the Agency regulation. <span class="Italic">Cf. DOJ,</span> 51 FLRA at 1137 (agency provided no basis for finding an award contrary to agency regulation when the regulation did not define the term in dispute). The Agency also provides no support for its claim that the reorganization did not result in the reductions in pay. In this connection, there is no dispute that the disputed employees sought new, lower-paying positions as the result of the Agency's decision to restructure.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">An arbitration award will be found to be deficient under section 7122(a)(1) when the award conflicts with a governing agency rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Fort Campbell District, Third Region, Fort Campbell, Kentucky and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2022</span>, 37 FLRA 186, 192 (1990)....&#8197;Only an arbitration award that conflicts with a rule or regulation that governs the matter in dispute will be found to be deficient under section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute<span class="Italic">.

Nothing in the Statute prevents an agency from agreeing to collective bargaining agreement provisions that modify policies established by an agency rule or regulation and a provision that has become part of a collective bargaining agreement takes precedence over agency rules and regulations with respect to matters to which they both apply. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, there is no provision of the collective bargaining agreement that directly addresses temporary promotions for details. Article XIX of the agreement provides that merit promotion policies will be in accord with the provisions of PCPM Chapter 335. PCPM, Supplement P2, Subchapter 15.5(d) states with regard to temporary promotions that "the minimum period will not be less than 30 calendar days[.]" The Agency contends that regulation prevents it from compensating employees for details of less than 30 days.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Fort Campbell</span> did not specifically address a situation in which the agency regulation with which the award allegedly conflicts has been incorporated in a collective bargaining agreement. However, consistent with the principles set forth in <span class="Italic">Fort Campbell</span>, we conclude that inasmuch as the collective bargaining agreement in this case incorporates the regulations contained in PCPM Chapter 335 governing temporary promotions, the matter becomes one of contract interpretation because the agreement, not the regulation, now governs the matter in dispute. Consequently, the issue before us is whether the Arbitrator's award draws its essence from Article XIX, Merit Promotion, of the agreement.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2357 and USDA, FSIS</span>, 62 FLRA 375, 376 (2008), restated the rule when an arbitrator applies a contract that incorporates an agency regulation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well settled that when a collective bargaining agreement incorporates the regulations with which an award allegedly conflicts, the matter is one of contract interpretation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2703</span>, 59 FLRA 81, 83 (2003) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2703</span>). Here, it is undisputed that Article 13 of the parties' agreement incorporates 9 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 307.4 and 381.37, which are Agency regulations. In addition, the Arbitrator framed the issue before him as one concerned only with contract interpretation. Moreover, the Arbitrator limited his award to a determination of whether the Agency violated the parties' agreement and specifically found that the Agency did not violate Article 13, Section 2.c when it changed the inspectors' lunch periods. Consequently, Article 13 governs the grievance and any alleged inconsistency between the award and those regulations does not provide a basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1658</span>, 61 FLRA 80, 82 (2005). The issue before the Authority, therefore, is whether the award fails to draw its essence from Article 13 of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2703</span>, 59 FLRA at 83.</p>
