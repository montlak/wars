<p class="noindent">A Unit Consolidation (UC) petition (FLRA Form 21) does not determine whether the existing representative will continue. It is limited to determining whether existing units, represented by the same exclusive representative, will be consolidated, as specified in &#x00A7; 7112(d) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Border Patrol Council, AFGE and INS</span>, 23 FLRA 106, 108-09 (1986). Two or more bargaining units may be consolidated if FLRA determines the larger unit to be appropriate. <span class="Italic">Sheppard AFB and AFGE Local 779</span>, 57 FLRA 148, 149 (2001). Section 7112(d), providing for the consolidation of existing units, requires the same three criteria set forth in &#x00A7; 7112(a)(1) of any unit found appropriate. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp. and AFGE Local 3313</span>, 5 FLRA 646, 652 (1981), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Submarine Base, New London and NAGE Local R1-100</span>, 46 FLRA 1354, 1363 (1993) (approving consolidation of five units at a submarine base and its four tenant activities). FLRA construes &#x00A7; 7112(d) as promoting the consolidation of small units, and a petition seeking small units may be disapproved if larger units would be more effective. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp. and AFGE Local 3313</span>, 5 FLRA 646, 652-53 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent">In order for a unit to be considered appropriate in a consolidation case, the three statutory criteria under &#x00A7; 7112(a)--community of interest, effective dealings, and efficiency of agency operations--must be met. <span class="Italic">Sheppard AFB and AFGE Local 779</span>, 57 FLRA 148, 148-49 (2001). Under <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv. and AFGE</span>, 69 FLRA 89, 94-95 (2015) (consolidating nine units spanning 52 parks in seven states):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7112(d) of the Statute, two or more units in an agency for which a labor organization is the exclusive representative may, upon petition by the agency or labor organization, be consolidated without an election into a single larger unit if the Authority determines the larger unit to be appropriate. Under &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute, a unit is appropriate if it will: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings with the agency involved; and (3) promote efficiency of the operations of the agency involved.[64]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[64]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(a); <span class="Italic">Dover AFB</span>, 66 FLRA at 919 (citation omitted<span class="Italic">); U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span>, 55 FLRA 359, 361-62 (1999) (<span class="Italic">AFMC</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">According to <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy and IAF Local F-121</span>, 60 FLRA 469, 474-75 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7112(d) of the Statute, two or more bargaining units represented by the same union may be consolidated "if the Authority considers the larger unit to be appropriate." <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command</span>, <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio</span>, 55 FLRA 359, 361 (1999). The reference in &#x00A7; 7112(d) to the consolidation of "appropriate" units incorporates the appropriate unit criteria established in &#x00A7; 7112(a). Thus, in order for a unit to be considered appropriate, all three criteria--community of interest, effective dealings, and efficiency of agency operations--must be met.</p>
<p class="noindent">In making determinations as to the propriety of consolidation under &#x00A7; 7112(d), the primary considerations are: the degree of commonality and integration of the mission and function of the components involved; the distribution of the employees involved throughout the organizational and geographical components of the agency; the degree of similarity in the occupational undertakings of the employees in the proposed unit; and the locus and scope of personnel and labor relations authority and functions. Under those criteria a consolidation of Marine Corps units was approved. The employees shared a clear and identifiable community of interest in the development and maintenance of military forces. A substantial degree of integration existed throughout the establishment. The employees were sufficiently well distributed throughout the organizational elements and their geographic distribution sufficiently reflected that of the establishment so as to constitute a meaningful consolidated unit. There were similar occupational undertakings in the various units and common supervisory and personnel authority. As to effective dealings and efficient agency operations, personnel and labor relations authority was relatively centralized despite the previous existence of local contracts. A consolidated unit promoted a more effective, comprehensive unit structure and reduced fragmentation. An election was directed to determine if the professional employees desired to be represented in the proposed consolidated unit by the petitioning labor organization. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps and AFGE</span>, 8 FLRA 15, 22-23 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Travis AFB and AFGE</span>, 64 FLRA 1 (2009) (unit consolidation case considering statutory criteria); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 56 FLRA 486, 491 (2000) (statute does not require proposed unit be only appropriate, or most appropriate, unit; it lists factors for assessing appropriate unit and factors, including past collective bargaining experience, for determining propriety of consolidation).</p>
<p class="noindent">Consolidation decisions are issued case-by-case; FLRA's approach depends on the circumstances. A summary of the governing law is provided in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Dover AFB and AFGE Local 1709</span>, 66 FLRA 916, 919-21 (2012), involving the union's successful effort to consolidate nonprofessional bargaining units of appropriated-fund employees, nonappropriated-fund employees, and police officers:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7112(d) of the Statute permits consolidation of two or more bargaining units represented by the same exclusive representative "if the Authority considers the larger unit to be appropriate." This provision was intended by Congress to "better facilitate the consolidation of small units" into more comprehensive ones. <span class="Italic">AFMC</span>, 55 FLRA at 361 (quoting 124 Cong. Rec. H9634 (daily ed. Sept. 13, 1978) (statement of Representative Udall)). Consolidation serves a statutory interest in reducing unit fragmentation and in promoting an effective, comprehensive bargaining-unit structure. <span class="Italic">See Air Force Logistics Command, U.S. Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio</span>, 7 FLRA 210, 214 (1981); <span class="Italic">Army &#x0026; Air Force Exch. Serv., Dall., Tex.</span>, 5 FLRA 657, 661-62 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that &#x00A7; 7112(d) of the Statute permits consolidation whenever a consolidated unit is appropriate under &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 63 FLRA 356, 359 (2009); <span class="Italic">see also AFMC</span>, 55 FLRA at 361. In order for a unit to be appropriate under &#x00A7; 7112(a), it must: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings with the agency involved; and (3) promote efficiency of operations of the agency involved. <span class="Italic">E.g., FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 959. A proposed unit must meet all three criteria in order to be found appropriate. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau</span>, 64 FLRA 399, 402 (2010) (<span class="Italic">Commerce</span>). Determinations as to each of these criteria are made on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">E.g., id.</span> The Authority has set out factors for assessing each criterion, but has not specified the weight of individual factors or a particular number of factors necessary to establish an appropriate unit. <span class="Italic">E.g., id.</span> We address each criterion separately below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Community of Interest</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity alleges that the RD committed clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters.&#x2003;In addition, the Activity asserts <span id="page_223"></span>that the RD "failed to properly weigh the [community-of-interest] factors," which we construe as alleging that the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering whether employees share a clear and identifiable community of interest, the Authority examines such factors as geographic proximity, unique conditions of employment, distinct local concerns, degree of interchange between other organizational components, and functional or operational separation. <span class="Italic">See FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 961. In addition, the Authority considers factors such as whether the employees in the proposed unit are a part of the same organizational component of the agency; support the same mission; are subject to the same chain of command; have similar or related duties, job titles, and work assignments; are subject to the same general working conditions. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 960-61. Additionally, while the Authority also considers whether employees are governed by the same personnel office, <span class="Italic">see id. </span>at 961, the Authority does not require that labor-relations and personnel decisions be processed centrally, <span class="Italic">see AFMC</span>, 55 FLRA at 363. Rather, the Authority assesses whether employees work under similar personnel and labor relations policies. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth more generally above, no single community-of-interest factor is dispositive. <span class="Italic">Travis AFB</span>, 64 FLRA at 7. Additionally, the Authority has not specified the weight to be accorded the various factors. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Consistent with these principles, the Authority has made determinations regarding these factors on a case-by-case basis after examining the totality of the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the RD found several factors indicating a shared community of interest. Specifically, she found that: (1) the employees are geographically co-located, (2) the commander sets general personnel and workplace policies applicable to all employees; (3) the commander can authorize administrative dismissals for inclement weather; (4) the commander oversees labor relations; and (5) the commander oversees the labor relations/personnel offices. These findings indicate that certain community-of-interest factors--specifically, those pertaining to geographic proximity, common general working conditions, and similar personnel/labor relations policies--were met. <span class="Italic">See Commerce</span>, 64 FLRA at 403; <span class="Italic">FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 960-61; <span class="Italic">AFMC</span>, 55 FLRA at 363. Based on these findings, the RD's conclusion that the employees share a community of interest is consistent with Authority precedent. <span class="Italic">See Travis AFB</span>, 64 FLRA at 6-8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity does not demonstrate that the RD failed to apply established law.&#x2003;The Activity asserts that the RD "failed to properly weigh the [community-of-interest] factors." But arguments that "challenge the RD's weighing" of those factors do not demonstrate that the RD failed to apply established law. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Joint Base, Langley-Eustis, Va.</span>, 66 FLRA 752, 756 (2012) (<span class="Italic">Langley-Eustis</span>). Further, to the extent that the Activity's assertion challenges the weight the RD gave the evidence, such a challenge is "not sufficient to find that an RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., Hampton, Va.</span>, 65 FLRA 364, 366 (2010) (<span class="Italic">Veterans</span>). With regard to the Activity's assertion that the AFMAO does not support the 436 AW, that assertion, even if true, does not demonstrate that the components' missions bear no relationship to one another, or that employees' functions are not sufficiently similar, <span class="Italic">see Travis AFB</span>, 64 FLRA at 7-8; <span class="Italic">see also Marine Corps</span>, 8 FLRA at 22. Moreover, the Activity does not demonstrate that the geographically co-located missions at Dover AFB are in any way as "disparate" as the geographically diffuse missions that were spread across twenty-seven locations in <span class="Italic">Corps of Engr's</span>, 5 FLRA at 677, 680, 681-83. We note, in this regard, that the Statute expressly contemplates an "'appropriate unit...established on an...installation...basis.'" <span class="Italic">Travis AFB</span>, 64 FLRA at 6 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(a)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity also argues that the RD committed clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters because, according to the Activity, the employees do not have: (1) the same mission; (2) a common chain of command; (3) similar job titles and work assignments, except for the childcare workers; (4) a common personnel system; and (5) a common pay system<span class="Italic">.</span> Additionally, the Activity asserts that the employees are not part of the same organizational component, are not organizationally located throughout the Activity, and are not subject to the same general working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, even assuming that the RD made factual errors alleged by the Activity, the Activity does not demonstrate that those errors are prejudicial. In this regard, the RD's community-of-interest determination is supported by other factors, such as geographic proximity. Further, as stated above, no one community-of-interest factor is dispositive. <span class="Italic">Travis AFB</span>, 64 FLRA at 7. Thus, the Activity's assertions do not preclude a finding of a community of interest. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Accordingly, even if the factual findings cited by the Activity were erroneous, they were not outcome-determinative and, therefore, were not prejudicial. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Nat'l Weather Serv., Silver Spring, Md.</span>, 62 FLRA 472, 476-77 (2008). Based on the foregoing, the Activity has not demonstrated that the RD erred in finding that the employees share a community of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Effective Dealings</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, the Activity asserts that the RD did not "fully analyz[e] the effective[-]dealings" criterion, even though the RD "need[ed] to give equal weight" to that factor. Application at 33-34 (citing <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 3 FLRC at 241-42). But the RD fully analyzed the effective-dealings criterion, and there is no basis for finding that the RD failed to give equal weight to the criterion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2004</span>, 47 FLRA 969, 973 (1993). Accordingly, the Activity's assertion is rejected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the application of the criterion, the Authority examines such factors as the past collective bargaining experience of the parties; the locus and scope of authority of the responsible personnel office administering personnel policies covering employees in the proposed unit; the limitations, if any, on the negotiations of matters of critical concern to the employees in the proposed unit; and the level at which labor relations is set by the agency. <span class="Italic">E.g., Commerce</span>, 64 FLRA at 403. Additionally, the Authority considers whether consolidation will reduce bargaining-unit fragmentation and whether the unit would adequately reflect the agency's organizational structure or would require creating a new agency structure. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFMC</span>, 55 FLRA at 364.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the RD reviewed the parties' past collective-bargaining experience, noted that the commander sets policies applicable to all employees, and found that the labor relations/personnel offices support the same mission. Additionally, the RD found that there was "no evidence" that consolidation would interfere with labor relations at the Activity. Based on these findings, the RD determined that consolidation would be "consistent with the Activity's structure." Accordingly, the RD determined that consolidation would promote effective dealings with the Activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity's claims do not demonstrate that the RD erred in this regard. The Activity asserts that the RD "disregarded the significant differences in the pay, performance management, and personnel systems applicable to the employees in the three bargaining units," that the RD "barely addresse[d]" the parties' past collective-bargaining experience, and that the RD placed "undue focus on" the labor relations/personnel offices at Dover AFB. But these allegations challenge the RD's weighing of the effective-dealings factors. Such challenges do not demonstrate that the RD failed to apply established law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Langley-Eustis</span>, 66 FLRA at 756.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity also asserts that testimony contradicts the RD's finding that there was no evidence that consolidation would interfere with labor relations. However, this assertion challenges the weight the RD accorded that evidence and thus does not demonstrate that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Veterans</span>, 65 FLRA at 366.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Activity has not demonstrated that the RD erred with regard to effective dealings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Efficiency of Operations</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As with the effective dealings criterion, the Activity asserts that the RD did not "fully analyz[e]" the efficiency-of-operations criterion. But the RD fully analyzed that criterion, and there is no basis for finding that the RD failed to give equal weight to the criterion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2004</span>, 47 FLRA 969, 973 (1993). Accordingly, the Activity's assertion is rejected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the application of the criterion, the criterion concerns the degree to which the unit structure bears a rational relationship to the operational and organizational structure of the agency. <span class="Italic">See Commerce</span>, 64 FLRA at 404. In assessing this criterion, the Authority examines the effect of the proposed unit on operations in terms of cost, productivity, and use of resources. <span class="Italic">E.g., id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the RD found no evidence that consolidating the three units would result in additional costs, loss of productivity, or use of resources. Consistent with this finding, the RD determined that the consolidation would promote efficiency of the Activity's operations<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity alleges that the RD "ignored" certain evidence pertaining to "increased labor problems." However, the Activity's assertion challenges the weight the RD accorded the evidence. As stated above, such challenges do not demonstrate that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Veterans</span>, 65 FLRA at 366.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Activity has not demonstrated that the RD erred in finding that the consolidation would promote efficiency of the Activity's operations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The basic determinants of consolidation were discussed In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Material Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE</span>, 55 FLRA 359, 361-64 (1999), remanding for further findings the regional director's decision denying consolidation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7112(d) of the Statute permits consolidation of two or more bargaining units represented by the same exclusive representative "if the Authority considers the larger unit to be appropriate." This provision was intended by Congress to "better facilitate the consolidation of small units" into more comprehensive ones. <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation</span>, <span id="page_224"></span>5 FLRA at 652 (quoting 124 Cong. Rec. H9634 (daily ed. Sept. 13, 1978) (statement of Representative Udall)). Consolidation serves a statutory interest in reducing unit fragmentation and in promoting an effective, comprehensive bargaining unit structure. <span class="Italic">See Army and Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Exchange Service, Dallas, Texas and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO</span>, 5 FLRA 657, 661-62 (1981) <span class="Italic">(AAFES); Air Force Logistics Command, United States Air Force Wright-Patterson Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force Base, Ohio and International Association of Fire</span> <span class="Italic">Fighters, (AFLC Council), AFL-CIO-CLC, </span>7 FLRA 210, 214 (1981) <span class="Italic">(AFLC).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The reference in section 7112(d) to the consolidation of "appropriate" units incorporates the appropriate unit criteria established in section 7112(a). Those criteria provide that a unit may be determined to be appropriate if it will: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings with the agency involved; and (3) promote efficiency of the operations of the agency involved. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(a). The Authority has identified a number of factors that generally indicate whether these statutory criteria are met, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">generally, United States Department of the Navy, Fleet</span> <span class="Italic">and Industrial Supply Center, Norfolk, Virginia, </span>52 FLRA 950, 960-61 (1997) <span class="Italic">(FISC), </span>and has consistently applied certain of these factors in consolidation cases<span class="Italic">. See Department of Justice, </span>17 FLRA at 62; <span class="Italic">AAFES</span>, 5 FLRA at 660; <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation</span>, 5 FLRA at 652.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner asserts that the RD's Decision misapplied the statutory criteria, as construed by the Authority, and that the proposed consolidated unit is appropriate. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that the RD did not properly evaluate the community of interest criteria, and that it is necessary to remand the petition for further findings on certain of the issues relevant to this first statutory criteria. We also conclude, contrary to the RD's finding, that the proposed unit promotes effective dealings and the efficiency of operation of the agency, satisfying the second and third statutory criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The RD failed to properly evaluate the community of interest criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his decision, the RD relied on the factors that have been used in consolidation cases to evaluate whether a community of interest has been established. These factors are:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the degree of commonality and integration of the mission and function of the components involved; the distribution of the employees involved throughout the organizational and geographical components of the agency; the degree of similarity in the occupational undertakings of the employees in the proposed unit; and the locus and scope of personnel and labor relations authority and functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Department of Justice, </span>17 FLRA at 62; <span class="Italic">see also Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Submarine Base, New London Naval Submarine School,</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Submarine Support Facility New London, Personnel Support Activity New London and Naval Hospital Groton and National Association of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local RI-100, SEIU, AFL-CIO, </span>46 FLRA 1354, 1360-61 (1993). As in other appropriate unit determinations, these factors are applied on a case-by-case basis, and the Authority has not specified the number of factors needed to find a clear and identifiable community of interest. <span class="Italic">See FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 960.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Commonality of Agency mission and integration of function</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD concluded that, despite their common role in support of the Agency's overall mission, the separate components at issue have distinct missions that tend to render consolidation inappropriate. The Authority has held, however, that the separate missions of each component need only "bear a relationship" to one another, and the functions need only be "similar or supportive" to warrant consolidation. <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Marine Corps and American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, AFL-CIO, </span>8 FLRA 15, 22 (1982) <span class="Italic">(Department of the Navy). See also AAFES, </span>5 FLRA at 661 (stating that "while the [agency] pointed out the distinct role played by the Distribution Regions, it is clear that their function is integrally related to that of the Exchange Regions").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner's claim that the former AFSC and AFLC components have a common mission and function is buttressed by the Authority's holding in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees, Local 1138, </span>47 FLRA 602, 607 (1993) (<span class="Italic">AFMC</span>). In <span class="Italic">AFMC</span>, the Authority found that former AFSC employees in a Product Center had "accreted" into the Council 214 unit. The conclusion that the former AFSC employees should be included in this appropriate unit was based, in part, on a finding that "as a result of the consolidation of the AFLC and AFSC, the employees of the AFMC share a common mission and organizational structure...<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 610. The RD's conclusion here that the "distinct" mission of each component overrides the significance of the Agency's common mission and function is not supported by either the general standards established by Authority precedent or our past findings with respect to these parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the components involved have a sufficient degree of commonality and integration of mission and function to justify the appropriateness of the consolidated unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Similarity of Occupational Undertakings</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD determined, as a general matter, that because the "nature of the work" performed by employees in the Local units differed from that of employees in the AFGE Council 214 unit, the proposed consolidated unit did not contain sufficiently similar occupations to establish a community of interest. He based this finding on a conclusion that "in the main," employees in the AFGE Council 214 unit work at logistics bases, which are "industrial complexes," and the employees from the six Local units are assigned to "research and development facilities."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to these general conclusions, the RD made factual findings with regard to the occupational categories contained in the AFGE Council 214 and Local units. For example, in his discussion of the factual background, the RD included a chart of "Top Occupational Categories" in the Council 214 and Local units. These raw numbers suggest that similar positions exist in significant proportions in the current consolidated unit and the units proposed to be added. The RD did not, however, address these findings in his analysis. The RD's analysis also does not account for the fact that the existing consolidated unit contains significant numbers of employees who are involved in the research aspects of the Agency's work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the RD's general conclusions are not sufficiently supported by an explanation of the specific factual evidence he set forth. In addition, the record contains extensive additional evidence of the positions held by employees in the AFGE Council 214 and Local units. Given the complexity of the record on this issue and the factual findings made in the decision, we are unable to determine whether the commonality of positions in the proposed unit supports consolidation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Labor Relations and Personnel Authority</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In evaluating whether an agency's personnel and labor relations policies favor consolidation, the Authority assesses whether employees "work under similar personnel and labor relations policies[.]" <span class="Italic">AAFES</span>, 5 FLRA at 661. This factor does not require that labor relations and personnel decisions be processed centrally. For example, in <span class="Italic">AAFES, </span>these matters were regulated generally by the central commander, but "many day to day decisions affecting employees [were] made by base exchange mangers[.]"<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 659; <span class="Italic">accord, Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy, </span>8 FLRA at 23.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decision contains findings that support the Petitioner's position that Agency personnel and labor relations policies favor consolidation. The RD acknowledged that all Agency civilian employees share policies imposed by DOD, the Air Force and the Agency. Further, the RD found that "[a]ll AFMC employees are subject to the same personnel and administrative policies and practices for payroll, leave, disability and workers compensation benefits, retirement, health and life insurance."...&#8197;The RD concluded that these similarities are not decisive in light of what he characterized as "operational responsibility" of the "processing" of personnel administration at the local level....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the applicable legal standard looks to whether policy-making authority over personnel and labor relations policy is consistent with the proposed consolidation, rather than whether the administration or "operation" of these policies is local or centralized. The degree of centralized policy making and decentralized personnel and labor relations administration described by the RD does not compel a finding that these facts undermine the appropriateness of the proposed unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the current practice at the Agency supports a conclusion that the Agency's personnel and labor relations structure justifies consolidation. The Agency currently provides personnel and labor relations services for the nationwide, AFGE Council 214 unit and there is no indication in the decision that its personnel and labor relations structure undermines the appropriateness of this consolidated unit. If the current structure of personnel administration is consistent with the operation of the 42,000 employee AFGE Council 214 unit, then it is also consistent with the operation of a slightly larger consolidated unit that includes the Local units.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the employees at issue work under sufficiently similar personnel and labor relations policies to support consolidation. We also find that there is sufficient commonality of mission and operation to support consolidation. However, it is not possible for us to make a determination as to whether the proposed unit satisfies the community of interest criteria, because we are unable to determine whether the proposed unit contains sufficient commonality of occupations. Further, the RD's Decision does not address, at all, the "distribution of the employees involved throughout the Agency," which the Authority has described as a "primary" element in evaluating whether a community of interest exists in consolidation cases.[4] We therefore remand the case to the RD for a determination of whether the commonality of occupations and distribution of employees favors consolidation, and, in light of these findings and the findings contained <span id="page_225"></span>in this decision, whether the proposed unit of employees has sufficient community of interest to support an appropriate unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, 8 FLRA at 22 (representation of employees in each major type of installation and geographic area renders consolidation "meaningful"); <span class="Italic">see Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Justice, </span>17 FLRA at 62, <span class="Italic">compare AAFES</span>, 5 FLRA at 660 (representation in all major geographic and organizational components supports "meaningful consolidated unit"), <span class="Italic">with U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Army Materiel Development and Readiness Command and</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees</span>, 11 FLRA 156, 160 (1983) (no community of interest where union only represents employees in small proportion of subordinate commands and activities).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The RD failed to apply established law with respect to the requirement that consolidation promote effective dealings and the efficiency of the agency operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether consolidation would promote effective dealings and efficient agency operations, the Authority examines a number of factors, including: whether personnel and labor relations authority is centralized and broad operating polices exist at the national level; whether consolidation will reduce bargaining unit fragmentation, thereby, "promoting a more effective, comprehensive bargaining unit structure to effectuate the purposes of the Statute" (<span class="Italic">AAFES</span>, 5 FLRA at 661-62); and whether the unit would adequately reflect the agency's organizational structure or would require creating a new agency structure. <span class="Italic">Department of Defense,</span> <span class="Italic">National Guard Bureau and National Federation Federal Employees, Independent, Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau and National Association of Government Employees, </span>13 FLRA 232, 237 (1983); <span class="Italic">Department of Agriculture Farmers Home</span> <span class="Italic">Administration and National Federation of Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Independent, </span>20 FLRA 216, 221 (1985). As a general matter, the Authority also considers the past collective bargaining experience of the parties in making "effective dealings" determinations. <span class="Italic">FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 961.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we note that the RD's determination that effective dealings and efficient Agency operations would not be promoted by consolidating these units was based, in large part, on his determination that a lack of community of interest exists in the proposed consolidated unit, which we have vacated above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the RD found that these criteria were not met because there was not a showing that consolidation would improve labor-management relationships. While the past bargaining experience of the parties is a proper factor to evaluate in making a determination of "effective dealings," this factor does not require that a petitioner in a consolidation case establish that collective bargaining relationships will be improved by the consolidation. Section 7112(d) permits unions to consolidate existing units as long as the consolidated unit <span class="Italic">is</span> <span class="Italic">appropriate. </span>There is no requirement in the Statute that the consolidated unit be <span class="Italic">more appropriate </span>than the unconsolidated units. <span class="Italic">See generally, FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 959 n.5; <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2004 and Letterkenny Army Depot and</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Distribution Region</span> <span class="Italic">East, </span>47 FLRA 969, 973 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As explained above, the purpose of section 7112(d) is to facilitate consolidation, on the ground that reducing unit fragmentation promotes an effective bargaining unit structure. <span class="Italic">See Department of Transportation, </span>5 FLRA at 652; <span class="Italic">AAFES, </span>5 FLRA at 661-62. We conclude that this statutory scheme reflects a judgment that consolidation and the resulting reduction in unit fragmentation promotes effective labor relations, as long as the resulting unit is appropriate. The RD's requirement that the Petitioner demonstrate an improvement in relationships, rather than demonstrate that the new unit meets the statutory test for appropriateness, is inconsistent with section 7112(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the RD rejected the Petitioner's argument that the proposed consolidation would reduce unit fragmentation, on the ground that the "purpose of a consolidation petition is to consolidate all of an exclusive representative's existing units within an agency into a single larger comprehensive unit." RD's Decision at 20 (citing <span class="Italic">AAFES, 5 </span>FLRA at 661-62; <span class="Italic">Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy, </span>8 FLRA at 23; and <span class="Italic">AFLC). </span>The RD found that this purpose was not met, because the Petitioner had not included the Griffiss Unit in its petition to consolidate six units into the AFGE Council 214 unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of consolidation is to reduce fragmentation of units.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See AAFES</span>, 5 FLRA at 661-62. The Authority has never imposed a requirement that a consolidation petition eliminate unit fragmentation. The consolidation of six AFGE bargaining units into the current consolidated unit reduces unit fragmentation. The fact that one bargaining unit was not included in the proposed consolidation indicates that a different petition might have reduced unit fragmentation even more than the petition presented; it does not establish that the current petition does not reduce unit fragmentation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, we find that the proposed unit does promote effective dealings and the efficiency of Agency operations.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We note one aspect of this case that distinguishes it from past Authority cases evaluating unit consolidations. The consolidation at issue here is proposed to bring the bargaining unit structure in conformity with changes made by the Agency in a reorganization. As such a consolidation is premised on an agency judgment that the new structure promotes efficient agency operations, it may be appropriate for the Authority to apply a simpler, more direct test for evaluating unit appropriateness to this situation. However, as no such argument was made in this case, we leave for another day the question of whether our test for consolidation should be simpler and more direct in cases arising out of agency reorganizations.</p>
<p class="noindent">The criteria governing consolidation of units were also discussed in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and AFSCME Council 26</span>, 63 FLRA 356, 359-60 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7112(d) permits consolidation of two or more bargaining units represented by the same exclusive representative when the larger unit is appropriate. <span class="Italic">E.g., NLRB, Washington</span>, 63 FLRA at 50. As the RD acknowledged, and the Union does not dispute, the Statute and the Authority's Regulations expressly provide that both unions and agencies have standing to file consolidation petitions. Section 7112(d) was intended by Congress "to better facilitate the consolidation of small units" into more comprehensive ones. <span class="Italic">NLRB, Washington,</span> 63 at 50-51 (quoting 124 Cong. Rec. H9634 (daily ed. Sept 13, 1978) (statement of Representative Udall)). In this regard, consolidation serves a statutory interest in reducing unit fragmentation and in promoting an effective, comprehensive bargaining unit structure. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 51. The reference in &#x00A7; 7112(d) to "appropriate" requires the application of the appropriate unit criteria of &#x00A7; 7112(a). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority has "consistently held that &#x00A7; 7112(d) requires consolidation whenever a consolidated unit is appropriate[.]" <span class="Italic">Nat'I Labor Relations Bd.,</span> 62 FLRA 25, 36 (2007) (<span class="Italic">NLRB</span>). Moreover, there is no comparison of the consolidated unit with the unconsolidated units when determining whether the consolidated unit is appropriate. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that review is warranted because "there is no evidence that one unit is 'more appropriate' than three, and there is no evidence that the three existing units are inappropriate." The Union's argument misconstrues the Statute and fails to demonstrate that the RD failed to apply established law. As noted, a proposed consolidated unit is not compared with unconsolidated units. <span class="Italic">NLRB,</span> 62 FLRA at 36. In other words, a proposed consolidated unit need not be "more appropriate" than the unconsolidated units. The Union similarly misconstrues the RD's decision in arguing that the RD wrongly concluded that the consolidated unit would enhance community of interest, better promote effective dealings, and increase the efficiency of agency operations. The RD made no such comparative conclusions; the RD stated that "it [wa]s not necessary to determine the relative merits of either unit configuration[.]" Consequently, the Union's argument fails to demonstrate a genuine issue over whether the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that, as to the attorneys in the Office of Chief Counsel, the RD "ignored...precedent concerning community of interest." We construe this argument as a claim that, in concluding that employees in the consolidated unit share a community of interest, the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of the criterion that employees share a clear and identifiable community of interest is to ensure that it is possible for them to deal with management as a single group.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">FISC,</span> 52 FLRA at 960. In assessing this criterion, the Authority examines whether employees in the proposed unit: are part of the same organizational component of the agency; are subject to the same chain of command; have similar or related duties, job titles, and work assignments; are subject to the same general working conditions; and are governed by the same personnel and labor relations policies that are administered by the same personnel office. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 960-61. In assessing whether the employees of the proposed consolidated unit share a community of interest, the RD acknowledged Authority precedent and examined the factors identified in <span class="Italic">FISC.</span> The Union does not specifically contest the RD's assessment of these factors. Instead, the Union reiterates its argument to the RD that the attorneys of the Office of Chief Counsel cannot be consolidated with the other bargaining units because they serve as "the Agency's law firm."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD rejected the Union's argument, relying on <span class="Italic">NLRB, Washington,</span> where the Authority rejected the agency's claim that a consolidated unit properly could not include both attorneys who work for the General Counsel of the agency and attorneys who worked for the Chairman and Members of the agency. 63 FLRA at 51-52. The Authority concluded that there was no impediment under the Statute to such a consolidated unit. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Union here similarly fails to demonstrate that established law or Authority precedent impedes a consolidated bargaining unit that includes the attorneys of the Office of Chief Counsel. Consequently, the Union fails to demonstrate that the RD failed to apply established law in concluding that the employees of the proposed consolidated unit share a community of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union further argues that the RD "failed to consider...whether a single <span id="page_226"></span>bargaining unit <span class="Italic">could</span> efficiently deal with management[.]" We construe this argument as a claim that, in concluding that the consolidated unit would promote efficiency of agency operations, the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing efficiency of agency operations, the Authority examines the effect of the proposed unit on agency operations in terms of cost, productivity, and use of resources. <span class="Italic">FISC,</span> 52 FLRA at 961-62. The RD specifically acknowledged established law in evaluating this criterion. Moreover, contrary to the Union's claim, the RD's decision shows that he considered established law in concluding that the proposed consolidated unit would promote efficiency of agency operations. Furthermore, the record and the RD's findings support the RD's conclusion. Consequently, the Union fails to demonstrate that review is warranted because there is a genuine issue over whether the RD failed to apply established law in concluding that the proposed consolidated unit would promote efficiency of agency operations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Approved for consolidation was a group of five units at agency headquarters of the Census Bureau--three units representing nonprofessionals, one unit representing professionals, and one unit representing wage grade employees--along with employees at a geographically separate processing center with its own human relations and labor relations offices. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau and AFGE Local 1438</span>, 64 FLRA 399, 402-04 (2010), concluded the consolidated unit was appropriate despite differences in occupational categories and some geographical and functional separation of managerial responsibilities:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity asserts that the RD failed to apply established law because he erroneously concluded that the proposed consolidated unit was appropriate.&#x2003;As stated by the RD, a unit may be deemed to be appropriate under &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute only if it will: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings with the agency involved; and (3) promote efficiency of the operations of the agency involved. <span class="Italic">See FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 959. A proposed unit must meet all three criteria in order to be found appropriate. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, Tex.,</span> 59 FLRA 739, 741 (2004) (<span class="Italic">USDAF</span>) (citation omitted). Determinations as to each of these criteria are made on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority has set out factors for assessing each criterion, but has not specified the weight of individual factors or a particular number of factors necessary to establish an appropriate unit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">A. Community of Interest </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated by the RD, when the Authority examines the first appropriate unit criterion--whether employees share a clear and identifiable community of interest--it examines such factors as geographic proximity, unique conditions of employment, distinct local concerns, degree of interchange between other organizational components, and functional or operational separation. <span class="Italic">See FISC,</span> 52 FLRA at 961 (citations omitted). In addition, the Authority considers factors such as whether the employees in the proposed unit are a part of the same organizational component of the agency; support the same mission; are subject to the same chain of command; have similar or related duties, job titles and work assignments; are subject to the same general working conditions; and are governed by the same personnel office. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 960-61.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity asserts that the RD's community of interest analysis is flawed because he relied primarily on the fact that the employees in the proposed unit support the same mission, rather than on the fact that they perform different duties. Employees can, however, share a community of interest and still perform separate duties. Under Authority precedent, to establish a shared community of interest, employees in a proposed unit need only perform duties that are "similar[.]" <span class="Italic">US. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Material Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio,</span> 55 FLRA 359, 363 (1999) (<span class="Italic">AFMC</span>) (citation omitted). The Activity does not contend that the employees in the proposed unit do not perform similar duties. Nor does the Activity contend that the employees do not share a similar mission. Accordingly, the Activity has not established that the RD's analysis is flawed in this respect. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity also contends that the RD's analysis is flawed because he did not consider the employees' different occupations. The Authority has never held that appropriate units must include only employees who share functions or occupations, particularly in activity-wide units. <span class="Italic">See USDAF,</span> 59 FLRA at 742. Moreover, when employees are organizationally and operationally integrated, the fact that some of the employees have specialized functions does not compel a finding that they do not share a community of interest. <span class="Italic">See US. Dep't of Homeland Sec., Bureau of Customs &#x0026; Border Prot.,</span> 61 FLRA 485, 496 (2006). Based on the foregoing precedent, the fact that employees in the proposed unit have different occupational undertakings does not undermine the RD's community of interest finding. <span class="Italic">See USDAF,</span> 59 FLRA at 742. Moreover, as the RD noted, the Activity stipulated that a consolidated unit consisting of all Headquarter units would be appropriate even though such a unit would contain a mixture of employees with different occupations. Because a consolidated unit at Headquarters would be appropriate, despite the inclusion of different occupations, it logically follows that a consolidated unit of Headquarters and NPC employees similarly would be appropriate despite containing employees with different occupational undertakings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity also contends that the RD failed to consider properly the organizational and geographical isolation of NPC.&#x2003;The Activity has not offered any evidence in support of its assertion that NPC is organizationally and/or geographically isolated; moreover, the Activity does not dispute the RD's findings that NPC has regular contact with Headquarters. This argument, therefore, does not militate against a finding that the employees in the proposed unit share a community of interest. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Fleet Readiness Ctr. Sw., San Diego, Cal.,</span> 63 FLRA 245, 252 (2009) (unsupported assertion failed to establish that the RD's appropriate unit analysis was flawed).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity also argues that, because no centralized policy-making authority exists within the Activity, the RD did not properly analyze the locus and scope of personnel authority. This argument, however, is contrary to Authority precedent. For purposes of a community of interest analysis, the Authority examines whether personnel and labor relations policy is <span class="Italic">consistent</span> with the proposed consolidation, not whether such policy is <span class="Italic">centralized</span>. <span class="Italic">See AFMC,</span> 55 FLRA at 363.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, none of the Activity's arguments establishes that the RD's community of interest analysis was erroneous. Moreover, the Activity does not dispute the RD's findings that employees in the proposed unit: (1) share the same chain of command; and (2) have regular interaction with one another.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the RD correctly determined that employees in the proposed unit share a community of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">B. Effective Dealings </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing the effective dealings criterion, the Authority examines such factors as the past collective bargaining experience of the parties; the locus and scope of authority of the responsible personnel office administering personnel policies covering employees in the proposed unit; the limitations, if any, on the negotiation of matters of critical concern to the employees in the proposed unit; and the level at which labor relations is set by the agency. <span class="Italic">See FISC,</span> 52 FLRA at 961.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found, and the Activity does not dispute, that Commerce promulgates personnel polices that establish some of the working conditions for Activity employees. The Activity also does not dispute the RD's findings that Commerce retains approval over all collective bargaining agreements and provides legal representation to the Activity in personnel and labor matters. In addition, the Activity does not dispute the RD's finding that Headquarters and NPC routinely consult each other over labor and personnel matters. Finally, it is undisputed that employees at Headquarters and NPC are within the same chain of command. These facts, taken together, weigh in favor of finding that consolidation would promote effective dealings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity argues that the proposed unit would be ineffective because there is no history of national bargaining and the locus and scope of administration for personnel policies resides at the local level.&#x2003;Although both of these factors weigh against a conclusion that a proposed unit would promote effective dealings, these factors alone do not provide a basis for finding that the RD's analysis was erroneous. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of the Navy, U.S. Marine Corps,</span> 8 FLRA 15, 23 (1982) (<span class="Italic">Marine Corps</span>) (proposed unit promoted effective dealings even though labor and personnel activities occurred at local level because national level retained ultimate authority).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity also asserts that the proposed unit is ineffective because it would require the creation of a new labor relations structure.&#x2003;However, the creation of a new labor relations structure is only one of the factors the Authority considers in assessing effective dealings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFMC,</span> 55 FLRA at 364. As discussed above, the RD made several unrebutted findings to support his conclusion that the proposed unit would promote effective dealings. These findings are sufficient to support his conclusion that the proposed unit would promote effective dealings. <span class="Italic">See Marine Corps,</span> 8 FLRA at 23.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the RD correctly determined that the proposed unit would promote effective dealings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">C. Efficient Operations </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated by the RD, the criterion of efficiency of agency operations concerns "the degree to which the unit structure bears a rational relationship to the operational and organizational structure of the agency. In assessing this criterion, the Authority examines the effect of the proposed unit on operations "in terms of cost, productivity, and use of resources." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity asserts that the proposed unit would cut across organizational lines and, therefore, lacks a rational basis to the Activity's structure. The Activity does not dispute the RD's finding that NPC employees share the same chain of command as the other employees <span id="page_227"></span>in the proposed unit. The unit, accordingly, bears a rational relationship to the operational and organizational structure of the Activity. <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Commander, Naval Base, Norfolk, Va.,</span> 56 FLRA 328, 333 (2000) (Chairman Wasserman concurring in part and dissenting in part) (Authority stated that placing employees in separate chains of command could be evidence that proposed consolidation would not bear a rational relationship to agency's structure).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity also asserts that the proposed unit would not promote efficiency of operations because it would require the creation of a new labor relations structure.&#x2003;The Activity, however, does not dispute the RD's finding that consolidation would improve the efficiency of operations by reducing unit fragmentation, which in turn would allow for the possibility of reducing costs and the use of resources. This supports a finding that the unit would promote efficient operations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFMC,</span> 55 FLRA at 364 (reducing unit fragmentation promoted efficient operations and therefore supported consolidation). This finding, in conjunction with the finding that the proposed unit bears a rational relationship to the Activity's structure, sufficiently overcome the Activity's assertion that a new labor relations structure is required.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the RD correctly determined that the proposed unit would promote efficient operations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Consolidation was not appropriate for a major Army command consisting of 17 installations. The union held recognition at only five locations. There was no unity of personnel administration, the installations had separate missions, there was little interchange of employees, and in some units employees represented by the union were members of other major commands within the Army. <span class="Italic">Army Training and Doctrine Command and NAGE</span>, 11 FLRA 105, 109 (1983) (<span class="Italic">TRADOC</span>). The <span class="Italic">TRADOC</span> analysis was applied to deny a similar consolidation in a case involving DARCOM, <span class="Italic">Army Materiel Dev. and Readiness Command and NAGE</span>, 11 FLRA 156, 160-61 (1983). Consolidation of five of the 14 units of the Air Training Command was denied. The employees were involved in disparate missions requiring different job skills, classifications and duties; they were not involved in an integrated work process; they did not transfer or interchange among the existing units, and the consolidation would involve only about 10% of the command's total civilian workforce. Authority and control over personnel and labor relations were handled at separate installations. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Training Command, Randolph AFB and NFFE</span>, 12 FLRA 261, 265 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">Consolidation was denied for two unions representing National Guard units in <span class="Italic">DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau and NFFE and NAGE</span>, 13 FLRA 232, 237 (1983). A clear and identifiable community of interest was lacking. NAGE's unit would have been limited to 22% of National Guard technician employees in 22 states and D.C., with NAGE representing all eligible technicians in only five of the 50 states involved in the National Guard. NFFE's unit would have included less than 9% of the technicians in ten states and Puerto Rico, and NFFE represented all eligible employees in only one state. States had individual missions in addition to national missions, and control was not centralized. Additionally, there was almost no job mobility between units of the Guard. Small units within the Guard's national organization would not, it was found, reflect the Guard's organizational structure. Given state control over Guard activities, bargaining was traditionally at the state level, but was subject to national coordination by the National Guard Bureau.</p>
<p class="noindent">Consolidation of National Guard units was again considered, and again denied, <span class="Italic">DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau and ACT</span>, 55 FLRA 657, 657-58, 660 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Background and the RD's Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The petition seeks to consolidate existing bargaining units in 39 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, representing approximately 53 percent of eligible National Guard technicians nationwide.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">National Guard technicians are a "hybrid class" of employees--federal civilians who work in a military environment and under the immediate control of state officers. <span class="Italic">State of Nebraska, Military Department, Office</span> <span class="Italic">of the Adjutant General v. FLRA, </span>705 F.2d 945, 946 (8th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">see New Jersey Air National Guard v. FLRA,</span> 677 F.2d 276, 279-80 (3d Cir. 1982) <span class="Italic">(NJ National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard). </span>As a condition of their civilian employment, technicians must become and remain members of the National Guard, maintaining the particular military grade specified for their civilian positions. 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(b),(d),(e) (the Technician Act).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The hybrid nature of technician service reflects, in part, the unique federal-state character of the National Guard<span class="Italic">. See generally, Perpich v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense, </span>496 U.S. 334, 340-51 (1990) (describing the history of the National Guard and the competing themes of federal and state control over guard units). Each state National Guard activity is headed by an Adjutant General, who is usually appointed by the governor. <span class="Italic">Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau and National</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Federal Employees, Independent and</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau and</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees,</span> 13 FLRA 232, 234 (1983) <span class="Italic">(National Guard). </span>The federal NGB is "a joint Bureau" of the Department of the Army (Army) and the Department of the Air Force (Air Force), and a liaison in coordinating the activities of the state officers, the Army, and the Air Force. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The NGB is headed by a chief who reports on National Guard matters to the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Air Force....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Technician Act provides that technicians are considered "employees" of either the Army or the Air Force. 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(d). The Secretary of either Department is required, however, to "designate" the Adjutants General of the states to "employ and administer" the technicians. 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(c). In <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard, </span>the Authority described the joint federal-state management of technicians, stating that the NGB does not employ technicians or "exercise command over any state activity[,]" but it issues regulations pertaining to technicians' conditions of employment and work life<span class="Italic">. National Guard, </span>13 FLRA at 234. These regulations are administered by a personnel officer in each state who reports directly to the Adjutant General. Labor and personnel policies are administered by each state's Adjutant General.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority dismissed two petitions seeking consolidation in <span class="Italic">National Guard, </span>reasoning that each state's technicians are independently supervised and are subject to independent state control over personnel, labor relations, and working conditions. The Authority also found that technicians are subject to unique state missions. Thus, the Authority concluded that the units lacked a community of interest. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 237. The Authority also determined that consolidation would not promote effective dealings between the parties, or the efficient operation of the National Guard, because of the small number of employees involved, and because national bargaining units would not adequately reflect state control. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 237-38.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7112(d) of the Statute, two or more bargaining units represented by the same union may be consolidated "if the Authority considers the larger unit to be appropriate." <span class="Italic">See AFMC, </span>55 FLRA at 361. The reference in section 7112(d) to the consolidation of "appropriate" units incorporates the appropriate unit criteria established in section 7112(a). Those criteria provide that a unit may be determined to be appropriate if it will: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings with the agency involved; and (3) promote efficiency of the operations of the agency involved. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(a); <span class="Italic">AFMC, </span>55 FLRA at 361-62. The Authority has identified a number of factors that indicate whether these statutory criteria are met, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">generally, FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 960-61, and has consistently applied these factors on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Justice, </span>17 FLRA at 62; <span class="Italic">Army and Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force Exchange Service, Dallas, Texas and American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO</span>, 5 FLRA 657, 660-61 (1981) (AAFES).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner asserts that the RD's decision misapplied the statutory criteria and erred particularly in holding that, under the Technicians Act, the states have a role in labor and employment relations. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that the RD properly construed the provisions of the Technicians Act and properly applied the appropriate unit test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The state adjutants general have a role in labor relations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner's view is that, under the Statute and the Technician Act, labor relations is solely a federal function, with the states having no statutory role. According to the Petitioner, "technicians are federal employees,"...the Statute "expressly grants the federal departments full control over labor relations with technicians,"...and "[s]tate authority to control labor relations cannot be read into the Technician Act."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner's view ignores both the hybrid nature of technician employment and the significance of the command in section 709(c) of the Act, that the "Secretary concerned shall designate the adjutant general...to employ and administer the technicians...." The Senate report on the legislation that became the Technician Act explains that a "principal feature" of the Act is the "[r]equirement for adjutants general to be the <span class="Italic">sole agent </span>for employment and administration of [the] technician program under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned." S.R. Rep. No. 1446 at 2, 90th Cong. 2nd Sess. (1968) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also </span>H.R. Rep. No. 1823, at 3321 90th Cong. 2nd Sess. (1968) (same). Specifically, the Senate Report explains that the designation of the adjutants general of the states "to employ and administer the technicians" was "intended to achieve two purposes: (a) recognize the State character of the Guard and (b) meet the requirement of giving the adjutants general (who are State officers) the statutory function of employing Federal employees." S.R. Rep. No. 1446, at 15 (1968). As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit summarized, "the scheme of the [Technicians Act] is to create the technicians as nominal federal employees...and to recognize the military authority of the states through their Governors and Adjutants General to employ, command and discharge them." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2953 v. FLRA, </span>730 F.2d 1534, 1537-38 (D.C. 1984); <span class="Italic">see also, Johnson v. Orr, </span>780 F.2d 386, 392 (3rd Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the general requirement that the states employ and administer the technicians, the Technician Act identifies a number of specific employment actions as within the authority of state officials. <span id="page_228"></span>These include the separation of employees, reductions in force, suspensions, furloughs without pay, and reductions in rank. 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(e). This authority is exercised "under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no specific reference in the Technician Act to the allocation of labor relations authority.&#x2003;Further, there is no reference to technicians in the Statute, and there is no indication that issues relating to technician bargaining were separately considered by Congress when it enacted the Statute. There is, in short, no specific indication as to how Congress intended to integrate the authority set out in the Technician Act with the labor relations responsibilities set out in the Statute. Under basic rules of statutory construction, we must attempt to interpret both the Technician Act and the labor relations Statute so that they do not conflict. <span class="Italic">Mancari, </span>417 U.S. at 550. <span class="Italic">See also NJ National Guard</span>, 677 F.2d at 282-84 (rejecting the assertion that the Technicians Act and the Statute conflicted, or that the Statute should be interpreted as overriding a provision of the Technicians Act).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner argues that the key element in construing the Statute in this context is that the Statute defines the term "agency" as an "executive agency," which only includes federal officials. Application at 7 <span class="Italic">(citing </span>5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(3)). According to the Petitioner, any labor relations authority exercised by the states is subject to the "unfettered discretion" of federal officials, who may appoint state officials as their "representatives<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner's position requires that authority over labor relations be separated from authority to control employees' conditions of employment. Under the Technician Act, general authority over employment is vested in state officials--at least to some degree--as is unreviewable authority over discipline, separations, and reductions in force. The Statute requires that employees be permitted to bargain over conditions of employment, including these specific matters. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114, &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2), (3). This statutory scheme is not workable if employees do not have a right to negotiate with the same officials who exercise authority over these conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although federal officials promulgate regulations governing technician working conditions, this authority is not "unfettered." They retain no authority over the day-to-day employment of the technicians. That authority is designated by statute to the states. Although states' authority under section 709(e) is exercised "under regulations prescribed by the Secretary," this caveat does not empower federal officials to direct or supervise authority given to the states. As the Third Circuit Court of Appeals concluded in <span class="Italic">NJ National Guard, </span>reconciling provisions of the Statute and the Technicians Act, "it appears quite clear from the importance Congress attached to the preservation of state control that...it intended to bring Guard technicians within the coverage of schemes such as the Labor-Management Act only with the provision that the state controls set out in section 709(e) would remain." <span class="Italic">NJ National Guard, </span>677 F.2d at 284. The court concluded that it could "find no evidence whatsoever that Congress in 1978 had within its contemplation the employment status of National Guard technicians<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 285. Consistent with the foregoing, there is no basis to conclude that Congress intended that state control over technicians would be affected by the passage of the Statute, or that the Statute would have the effect of making labor relations an exclusively federal function.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD addressed the Petitioner's argument that the states have no necessary role in labor relations, stating that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[s]o long as the authority to 'employ and administer' the technicians remains with the State Activities, through their Adjutants General, the locus and scope of labor relations and personnel functions will remain with the State Activities, regardless of whether that authority exists by virtue of the Act or by some other means.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD's decision is consistent with the hybrid nature of the National Guard, the Technician Act and the Statute. Accordingly, we conclude that the RD did not err in construing the role of the states in labor relations under the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The RD properly applied established law in determining that the proposed consolidated unit is not appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The RD properly evaluated the community of interest criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner asserts that, contrary to the RD's decision, the proposed consolidated unit has a clear and identifiable community of interest under section 7112(a). The RD relied on the factors set out in <span class="Italic">Department of Justice </span>for determining whether employees share a community of interest, which are:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the degree of commonality and integration of the mission and function of the components involved; the distribution of the employees involved throughout the organizational and geographical components of the agency; the degree of similarity in the occupational undertakings of the employees in the proposed unit; and the locus and scope of personnel and labor relations authority and functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Department of Justice, </span>17 FLRA at 62; <span class="Italic">see also Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Submarine Base, New London Naval Submarine School,</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Submarine Support Facility New London, Personnel Support Activity New London and Naval Hospital Groton and National Association of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local RI-100, SEIU, AFL-CIO, </span>46 FLRA 1354, 1360-61 (1993). These factors are applied on a case-by-case basis, and the Authority has not specified the number of factors needed to find a clear and identifiable community of interest. <span class="Italic">See FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 960.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, the RD acknowledged that two of the <span class="Italic">Department of Justice</span> criteria had been met. He based his finding that the proposed consolidated unit lacks a community of interest on the two remaining factors.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a. Similarity and integration of National Guard mission and function</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the degree of commonality and integration of the mission and function of the components involved, the Authority has held that the separate missions of each component need only "bear a relationship" to one another, and the functions need only be "similar or supportive" to one another, to satisfy this appropriate unit criteria. <span class="Italic">See AFMC (citing Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, </span>8 FLRA 15, 22 (1982)). <span class="Italic">See also AAFES, </span>5 FLRA at 661. Examining this factor in <span class="Italic">National Guard, </span>the Authority stated that, "[w]hile the technicians are all working for the common mission of maintaining National Guard materiel, training its personnel, and administering its program, the employees are also subject to the unique Missions established at the state level." <span class="Italic">National Guard,</span> 13 FLRA at 237.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the RD found that no meaningful changes had occurred to alter the conclusions reached in <span class="Italic">National Guard, </span>stating that the "missions of the State Activities is significant in determining whether an appropriate unit may be established that crosses state lines" because of "the uniqueness of the [states] separate missions...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner asserts that there is a "commonality of mission" within the proposed unit that would be no different than the commonality found in existing units. According to the Petitioner, "current bargaining units already span the greatest degree of diversity and separation in missions and functions that exists within the National Guard"--those separating Army and Air Force components....&#8197;However, the Petitioner's assertion is misdirected. The RD's decision, and the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">National Guard, </span>is based on a lack of commonality between the different missions of <span class="Italic">the state components, </span>not the Army and Air Force components. Any similarity between the Army and Air Force components does not bridge the wholly different issue of diversity between states in terms of their varied missions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner does not dispute the RD's conclusion that state units have separate military missions. The Petitioner argues, instead, that these missions are irrelevant to our determination, because these missions are performed in military, rather than civilian status. The Petitioner does not, however, offer any reason or evidence to contradict the RD's finding that technicians prepare for state military missions while in federal civilian status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under our case law, the mission and function of various agency components sought to be placed in a consolidated unit is evaluated not only to determine whether these features are "similar," but also whether the mission and function are "integrated." <span class="Italic">Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Justice, </span>17 FLRA at 62. The separate authority exercised by the states over their respective military missions indicates a lack of integration of mission and function across state lines that outweighs any similarity in the actual duties that the technicians perform while preparing for and performing these responsibilities. We thus find that the Petitioner has not demonstrated that the RD misapplied this aspect of the community of interest test.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b. Labor Relations and Personnel Authority</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a community of interest has been established, the Authority evaluates the "locus and scope of personnel and labor relations authority and functions." <span class="Italic">Department of Justice, </span>17 FLRA at 62; <span class="Italic">AAFES, </span>5 FLRA at 661. Under this factor, the Authority "looks to whether policy-making authority over personnel and labor relations policy is consistent with the proposed consolidation[.]" <span class="Italic">AFMC, 55 </span>FLRA at 363.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">National Guard, </span>13 FLRA at 235, the RD found that the states set labor relations and personnel policies through their respective adjutants general. The Petitioner disagrees, asserting that the Technician Act grants "plenary authority to regulate the employment of technicians" in the Secretaries of the Army and Air Force and limits the Adjutants General to the role of "designate[d]...employ[ers] and administ[rators]." (brackets in original) (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(c)). The Petitioner's argument is based on its claim, addressed above, that the RD erred in his analysis of how labor relations and personnel authority is mandated under the Technician Act. For the reasons explained in &#x00A7; IV.A. of this decision, we have concluded that the RD did not err in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner has not established any basis to reject the Authority's <span id="page_229"></span>holding in <span class="Italic">National Guard. </span>As we explained, the Petitioner's assertion that state authority is subordinate to federal authority in this respect ignores the hybrid authority set out in the Technician Act. A consolidation that ignored this hybrid authority would establish lines of authority for labor relations at odds with the lines of authority governing the employment of technicians in their work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The authority of federal officials to issue regulations governing technician employment is necessarily accompanied by policy-making authority. However, the specific and irrevocable designations of authority to state officials contained in the Technician Act necessarily confers policy-making authority as well. The authority of state officials is greater than mere delegated, operational authority over day-to-day decision-making<span class="Italic">. Cf. AFMC, </span>54 FLRA at 363 (finding that the delegation of day-to-day operation of personnel and labor relations functions does not preclude consolidation). Rather, they exercise specific authority granted by the Technicians Act. Thus, the RD's conclusion is consistent with Authority precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c. The Impact of Expanded Bargaining Rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner asserts that RD should have considered the impact of expanded bargaining rights under section 7117(a) of the Statute in determining whether a community of interest had been established. The RD rejected this argument, stating that such a consideration is not a factor in determining a unit's appropriateness under section 7112(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a matter of statutory construction, the RD's conclusion is sound. The bargaining rights discussed in Section 7117(a)(3), according to the provision's plain wording, apply only to "an exclusive representative [that] represents an appropriate unit." Thus, section 7117(a)(3) rights extended to a petitioning party only if separate bases have been satisfied and a unit determined to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Limitations on consolidation necessitated by the Technicians Act may have the effect of limiting the bargaining rights of these employees.&#x2003;However, nothing in the Statute guarantees that every group of employees will be able to avail themselves of all aspects of the Statute. A separate statutory scheme that applies to one group of employees may place limitations on their collective bargaining rights. <span class="Italic">See Phoenix Area Indian</span> <span class="Italic">Health Service, Sacaton Service Unit, Hu Hu Kam</span> <span class="Italic">Memorial Hospital, Sacaton, Arizona and Southwest</span> <span class="Italic">Native American Health Care Employees, Local 1386,</span> <span class="Italic">LIUNA, AFL-CIO, </span>53 FLRA 1200,1219 (1998) (noting that technicians serve under a statutory scheme that places many working conditions that are ordinarily negotiated outside the scope of bargaining).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the RD did not err in determining that the proposed consolidated unit did not share a community of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The RD properly applied established law in determining that consolidation would not promote effective dealings or the efficiency of the agency operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether consolidation would promote effective dealings and efficient agency operations, the Authority examines a number of factors, including: whether personnel and labor relations authority is centralized and broad operating polices exist at the national level; whether consolidation will reduce bargaining unit fragmentation, thereby, "promoting a more effective, comprehensive bargaining unit structure to effectuate the purposes of the Statute" <span class="Italic">(AAFES, </span>5 FLRA at 661-62); and whether the unit would adequately reflect the agency's organizational structure or would require creating a new agency structure. <span class="Italic">National Guard, </span>13 FLRA at 237. As a general matter, the Authority also considers the past collective bargaining experience of the parties in making "effective dealings" determinations<span class="Italic">. FISC, </span>52 FLRA at 961; <span class="Italic">AFMC</span>, 55 FLRA at 364.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner argues that consolidation would end the duplicative acts of negotiating separate contracts at the local level.&#x2003;The RD's conclusion that this criteria was not met is based, however, on his determination that the NGB is without authority to engage in collective bargaining on behalf of the states and on his determination that effective bargaining relationships currently exist. Although acknowledging that the proposed consolidated unit "represents more employees in units better distributed geographically and organizationally than the unions involved in <span class="Italic">National Guard," </span>the RD relied on the retention of labor relations authority at the state level as indicating that consolidation would not be effective and would not promote efficient operations because the proposed consolidated unit would extend across state lines....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Essentially, the RD determined that the proposed consolidated unit would require a structuring of the National Guard inconsistent with the dictates of the Technicians Act. This determination, along with the RD's consideration that effective bargaining relationships already exist at the state level, is consistent with Authority precedent, <span class="Italic">see AFMC</span>, 55 FLRA at 364, <span class="Italic">FISC,</span> 52 FLRA at 961, and is also consistent with the Authority's holding in <span class="Italic">National Guard.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Authority finds that there is no basis for granting review of the RD's determination that the proposed consolidated unit would not promote effective dealings and the efficiency of agency operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;The RD properly concluded that consolidation of the bargaining units was not appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Petitioner has not established grounds warranting review of the RD's determination that a community of interest among employees was not established and that the proposed consolidated unit would not promote effective dealings and the efficiency of the National Guard's operations. Since all three section 7112(a) criteria must be met for a unit to be found appropriate, <span class="Italic">see U.S. Department of Housing and Urban</span> <span class="Italic">Development and National Federation of Federal Employees, Independent</span>, 15 FLRA 497, 500 n.6 (1984), the proposed unit is not appropriate under section 7112(a) of the Statute, and the RD properly dismissed the petition.</p>
<p class="noindent">Consolidation was denied for an activity unit that would be limited to employees at two of 17 depots, three of 14 activities and 25 ammunition plants, four of 11 testing activities, and five of 46 field activities. Most of the employees in the proposed consolidated unit, representing 19.4% of the agency civilian workforce, had different career interests and working conditions because of the uniqueness of each mission. Personnel authority was decentralized. There was a minimum of interchange from one unit to another. <span class="Italic">Hq. Army Materiel Dev. and Readiness Command and NFFE</span>, 13 FLRA 679, 682-83 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA considered a consolidation petition for 14 units of HUD employees encompassing about 2,000 professional and nonprofessional employees, about 14% of the workforce in three of 10 regional offices, eight of 40 area offices, and six of 55 service offices. The petition was denied. Although the employees shared a common mission and function, there was no integration of functions among area and regional offices (a result of decentralization and local administration of programs). There was little interchange of personnel among the various units and there was considerable geographic dispersion. Labor relations and personnel functions were dispersed with varied policies throughout the regional structure of the agency. <span class="Italic">DHUD and NFFE</span>, 15 FLRA 497, 499-500 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">Consolidation of two units represented by separate AFGE locals was inappropriate when the "issue of which labor organization should be certified to bargain or deal with management on behalf of the consolidated unit..." was unresolved. <span class="Italic">Sheppard AFB and AFGE Local 779</span>, 57 FLRA 148, 150 (2001) (agency-initiated petition). But when a national union became the exclusive representative, individual unions within the national could not block a consolidated union, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Navy Region Southeast and AFGE</span>, 62 FLRA 11, 13-14 (2007):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has addressed circumstances similar to those presented in this case.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Sheppard Air Force Base, Wichita Falls, Tex.</span>, 57 FLRA 148 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Sheppard AFB</span>), the activity petitioned for the consolidation of two AFGE locals at the activity. The RD denied the petition and the Authority denied the agency's application for review. The Authority agreed with the RD's conclusion that the proposed consolidated unit would not promote effective dealings. The Authority stated as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We find that the specific factual circumstances in this case demonstrate a basic impediment to the establishment of the relationship between management and the exclusive representative of the proposed consolidated unit, which strikes at the heart of the effective dealings criterion. In particular, the certifications of exclusive representation for the existing units are held by separate local unions, and there is no apparent, or asserted, bargaining representative for the consolidated unit. In this regard, neither the Agency nor the RD identified an exclusive representative that would be certified to represent the consolidated unit. Although both local unions are affiliates of AFGE, AFGE was not a party below and there is no basis in the record to conclude that AFGE could serve in that capacity. Without an identified labor organization to serve as the exclusive representative, it is not possible to find that the consolidated unit would promote effective dealings between a labor organization and the Agency. That is, certification of the consolidated unit could not promote effective dealings between the parties because the fundamental issue of which labor organization should be certified to bargain or deal with management on behalf of the consolidated unit is unresolved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 150. Implicitly, the Authority ruled that where multiple units of a labor organization are proposed for consolidation, if that labor organization has recognition as the exclusive representative of those units, and all other criteria under &#x00A7; 7112(a) are met, the consolidated unit will promote effective dealings and the consolidated unit will constitute an appropriate unit under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That is clearly the case here.&#x2003;AFGE has indicated its intent to serve as the exclusive representative of the consolidated unit. There is no claim that AFGE is not a labor organization within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(4) of the Statute. Moreover, there is no dispute that AFGE is the labor organization that holds exclusive recognition for all of the local units involved in this case. <span class="Italic">See IRS</span>. The locals' application for review misconstrues the significance of the term "labor organization" as used in &#x00A7; 7112(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_230"></span>The applications do not challenge the RD's findings that the consolidated unit shares a community of interest and is consistent with efficient operation of the CNRSE. Additionally, the RD found that the circumstances of this case are distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Sheppard AFB </span>and concluded that the consolidated unit would promote effective dealings.<span class="Italic"> </span>Thus, the RD's conclusion that the proposed consolidated unit is an appropriate unit is consistent with the Statute and Authority precedent.</p>

<a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-005.html">62 FLRA 11</a> (2007), <span class="italic">supra</span>, was followed when FLRA remanded to the

into one unit seven units represented by either the national union or

<a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-100.html">72 FLRA 510</a>, 510-12 (2021) (Chairman DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In October 2020, the Agency filed a petition to consolidate seven bargaining units into a single unit. The Agency filed the instant petition because it maintained that a consolidated unit would be appropriate under &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute and that consolidation would decrease unit fragmentation. The seven bargaining units at issue comprise fire fighters who are employed by the Agency at various locations within the Mid-Atlantic region to provide various firefighting and other emergency support services. The national IAFF is the exclusive representative of two of the units, and various local IAFF affiliates are the exclusive representatives of the remaining five units. However, the five local affiliates designated the national IAFF as their representative for the instant petition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the decision, the RD noted that &#x00A7; 7112(d) of the Statute provides that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[t]wo or more units which are in an agency and for which a labor organization is the exclusive representative may, upon petition by the agency or labor organization, be consolidated with or without an election into a single larger unit if the Authority considers the larger unit to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD also found that "[c]onsolidation can be granted over the objection of the union, as long as the petitioned-for unit is appropriate and a single union represents all of the units to be consolidated."[4]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The RD discussed the fact that &#x00A7; 7103(a)(16)(A) of the Statute defines an "exclusive representative" as a labor organization "certified as the exclusive representative of employees in an appropriate unit." Therefore, the RD found that the consolidation was not appropriate because the national "IAFF is not already the exclusive representative of all of the units the Agency petitioned to consolidate." Additionally, the RD found that the national IAFF's refusal to represent the proposed consolidated unit meant that consolidation would not promote effective dealings under &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute.[7] Consequently, the RD concluded that the petitioned-for consolidated unit was not appropriate and dismissed the petition. </p>

<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III. <span class="italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The RD failed to apply established law</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the RD failed to correctly apply &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute and that the RD misapplied Authority precedent. The Agency argues that a consolidated unit would be appropriate because the national IAFF is a labor organization within the meaning of the Statute and is the parent organization to all of the unions representing the bargaining units to be consolidated. Additionally, the Agency asserts that the national IAFF's refusal to serve as the consolidated unit's exclusive representative is immaterial because consolidation can be granted over the objection of the union as long as the petitioned-for unit is appropriate. Under &#x00A7; 2422.31(c)(3)(i) of the Authority's Regulations, the Authority may grant an application for review if the application demonstrates that there is a genuine issue over whether the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the RD concluded that consolidation was not appropriate because the national IAFF "is not already the exclusive representative of all of the units" to be consolidated. However, Authority precedent contradicts that conclusion. Rather, the Authority has granted consolidation where some units were exclusively represented by various union locals, and other units were exclusively represented by those locals' national organization.[13] In those cases, all units were considered represented by the same "labor organization"--the national organization--for purposes of consolidation under &#x00A7; 7112(d) of the Statute.[14] </p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;<span class="italic">Navy Region Se.,</span> 62 FLRA at 14; <span class="italic">see also IRS, Wash., D.C.,</span> 6 FLRC 288, 288-92 (1978) <span class="italic">(IRS)</span> (finding consolidation of thirteen units appropriate where NTEU national represented some units, and local NTEU chapters represented others, and further holding that even if the local chapters alone held exclusive recognition, an agreement between the local chapters and the national was not required for consolidation). </p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;<span class="italic">Navy Region Se.,</span> 62 FLRA at 14. Although <span class="italic">in U.S. Department of the Navy, Commander, Navy Region Southeast, Jacksonville, Florida</span>, unlike here, the national union supported consolidation, the Authority's analysis did not expressly rely on that fact. <span class="italic">See id.; see also U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Travis Air Force Base, Cal.,</span> 64 FLRA 1, 5 (2009) (denying review of RD's ruling that parent organization and constituent local should be treated as the same union for purposes of &#x00A7; 7112(d)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the RD relied on <span class="italic">Sheppard Air Force Base, Wichita Falls, Texas (Sheppard)</span>,[15] in that case there was "no apparent, or asserted, bargaining representative for the consolidated unit."[16] The Authority held that without an "<span class="Italic">identified</span> labor organization" to serve as the exclusive representative, consolidation would not promote effective dealings.[17] But here, the national IAFF has been identified in the Agency's petition as a labor organization that could serve as the exclusive representative for all the consolidated units because it already represents some of the units at issue and is the national "parent organization to the other IAFF locals' affiliates." Thus, Sheppard is not applicable to the instant case, and Authority precedent[19] compels the conclusion that the units are all represented by the same "labor organization."[20]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the RD also failed to apply established law by concluding that consolidation would not promote effective dealings. Where a single union represents all of the units to be consolidated, consolidation can be granted over the objection of the union as long as the petitioned-for unit is appropriate.[22] This establishes that the objection of the exclusive representative cannot singlehandedly defeat the appropriateness of a unit.[23]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In assessing whether a proposed unit would promote effective dealings, the Authority examines such factors as: the past collective-bargaining experience of the parties; the locus and scope of authority of the responsible personnel office administering personnel policies covering employees in the proposed unit; the limitations, if any, on the negotiation of matters of critical concern to employees in the proposed unit; and the level at which labor relations is set in the agency.[24] Rather than examining these factors, the RD relied solely on Sheppard and the national IAFF's refusal to represent the consolidated unit.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">CFTC Eastern Regional Office and AFGE</span>, 70 FLRA 291, 291-96 (2017), presented a consolidation involving separate units of professional and nonprofessional employees. AFGE represented both units. NTEU filed a petition to represent the professionals. The region held an election among the professionals to determine if they wanted to be included in the unit of nonprofessionals. The region then held an election for the consolidated unit. NTEU prevailed, AFGE challenged the result and the process leading to the election. FLRA determined the regional treatment was correct:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE filed a petition, BN-RP-16-0014, under &#x00A7; 7112(d) of the Statute, to consolidate two local units--one unit comprised of professional employees, the other of nonprofessional employees. Later that same month, NTEU filed BN-RP-16-0022 to represent the unit containing the professional employees. Shortly thereafter, AFGE requested that the Regional Office follow FLRA Office of the General Counsel Representation Case Handling Manual (CHM) 11.10.2 and suspend processing BN-RP-16-0022, pending resolution of BN-RP-16-0014. The Regional Office then notified the parties that, based on CHM 11.10.2 and <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation, FAA</span> (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>),[3] BN-RP-16-0022 would be held in abeyance pending resolution of BN-RP-16-0014.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;4 FLRA 722 (1980) (Chairman Haughton dissenting on <span class="Italic">retroactively</span> applying final regulation, but not the substance of the final regulation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following a vote by the Agency's professional employees, in which they agreed to be included in a unit with non-professional employees, the RD issued a certification for a consolidated unit in BN-RP-16-0014. The RD also notified the parties that BN-RP-16-0022 was being taken out of abeyance for processing. Per <span class="Italic">FAA</span> and CHM 11.10.2, NTEU had thirty days to submit a showing of interest for the unit newly certified through BN-RP-16-0014. AFGE filed a motion to dismiss BN-RP-16-0022, asserting it was untimely and barred by the certification issued in BN-RP-16-0014. The RD denied AFGE's motion and an election was held. In the election, out of sixty-one eligible voters, twenty-nine votes were cast for NTEU, twenty-one for AFGE, and two for neither.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In accordance with &#x00A7; 2422.26(a) of the Authority's Regulations, AFGE filed objections to the election. AFGE argued that the election was barred by &#x00A7; 7111(f)(4) of the Statute and &#x00A7; 2422.12 of the Authority's Regulations and that the election was procedurally flawed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">RD's Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his decision, the RD found that the election was not barred by the Statute or the Authority's Regulations. He found that &#x00A7; 7111(f)(4) was inapplicable as it is expressly limited to petitions seeking an election under &#x00A7; 7111, unlike AFGE's petition to consolidate, which was filed under &#x00A7; 7112(d). The RD found that &#x00A7; 2422.12 of the Authority's Regulations "merely implements" &#x00A7; 7111(f).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">He also traced back the history of the Authority's interim regulations, promulgated in 1979, and its final regulations, implemented in 1980. He cited <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, and its discussion of the interim regulation, which provided that if an election petition was filed concerning a unit that was the subject of a consolidation petition, the election petition would be dismissed if the consolidation petition was granted. The final regulation, &#x00A7; 2422.3(j),--mirrored in CHM 11.10.2--provided that the election petition would be held in abeyance and, after a consolidation certification issued, the election petition would be processed. The commentary on the change explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Section 2422.3(j) has been revised to provide that where a timely petition is filed raising a question concerning representation (QCR) in a unit which is included as part of a pending unit consolidation...petition, the QCR petition will no longer be automatically dismissed once the consolidated unit is certified. Instead, upon the issuance of a certification on consolidation of units, the QCR petitioner will be given thirty (30) days to secure a sufficient showing of interest in the consolidated unit and in the event such showing of interest is secured, will be given an opportunity to obtain the appropriate certification pursuant to an election. This revision is intended to avoid unfairness to petitioners who have filed timely and otherwise adequately supported election petitions subsequent to the petition for consolidation of units and also will permit pending consolidation petitions to be processed where the consolidated unit sought is deemed to be appropriate.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 6 (quoting 45 Fed. Reg. 3482-83 (Jan. 17, 1980)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD further explained that when &#x00A7; 2422.3(j) was removed from the Authority's Regulations in 1995, "the purpose and policy remained the same" as there were no substantive changes to the election and certification bars.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Analyzing the CHM sections cited by AFGE, the RD noted that AFGE failed to harmonize the general proposition contained in CHM 11.3 and 23.10.1.4--that consolidation certifications can serve as the basis for certification bars--with the specific situation of this case, in which a previously filed election petition has been placed in abeyance, pending the outcome of the consolidation petition. He explained that the situation is expressly addressed in CHM 11.10.2 and 23.10.1.1. CHM 11.10.2 states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Petitions filed after the related unit consolidation petition (is filed) are held in abeyance pending the processing of the petition to consolidate. Upon the issuance of a certification on consolidation of units, the petitioner is given thirty (30) days from the issuance of the certification to submit a sufficient showing of interest, the petition is processed and an appropriate certification is issued.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD explained that AFGE's interpretation would render CHM 11.10.2 meaningless. He found that CHM 11.3 and 23.10.1.4 state generally that a consolidation certification can serve as a bar to according exclusive recognition, but do not address the specific situation here, which is addressed by CHM 11.10.2, where a timely election petition was filed prior to the issuance of a consolidation certification. The RD found in this a balancing of a union's rights under &#x00A7; 7112(d) with employees' rights under &#x00A7; 7111 of the Statute. He emphasized that "the employees' statutory right to freely choose a bargaining representative is one of the cornerstone rights[;]...[t]o allow the filing of a consolidation petition to thwart the employees' right to choose their bargaining representative would be contrary to a foundational principle of the Statute."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After investigating AFGE's objections, the RD found that there was insufficient evidence to warrant setting aside the election. He dismissed the objections, and stated an intention to issue a certification based on NTEU's winning ballot tally, absent timely appeal. AFGE filed this application for review and NTEU filed an opposition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its application, AFGE argues that the RD failed to apply established law and that the decision raises an issue for which there is an absence of precedent. Specifically, AFGE argues that the RD failed to apply the certification bar required by &#x00A7; 7111(f)(4) of the Statute and &#x00A7; 2422.12 of the Authority's Regulations. AFGE argues that the RD erred in: (1) allowing NTEU to submit a showing of interest for the consolidated unit without amending its petition; (2) considering &#x00A7; 2422.3(j) because it is no longer in effect; and (3) failing to apply CHM guidance. It also argues that public policy--favoring the consolidation of units--supports the view that the RD failed to apply established law by not applying the certification bar. Further, AFGE argues that if the Authority finds that its certification did not bar the election, then its application should still be granted because there is an absence of precedent on this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, under the Authority's Regulations, the Authority may grant an application for review only when the application demonstrates that review is warranted because the decision raises an issue for which there is an absence of precedent or there is a genuine issue over whether the RD has failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Adequate Authority precedent exists on this issue.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As cited by the RD in his decision, the Authority has addressed a factual scenario similar to this one in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>.[26] In <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, the Authority considered whether to apply its transition, interim, or final rules to two representation petitions. While the Authority's transition rules were in effect, a union--the Federal Aviation Science and Technological Association (FASTA)--filed a consolidation petition for several units, including units covered under a renewing collective-bargaining agreement. During the open period and while the interim rules were in effect, another union--the Professional Airways Systems Specialists (PASS)--filed a timely representation petition in two of the units FASTA sought to consolidate. The interim rule had provided that a petition such as the one filed by PASS be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;RD's Decision at 5 (citing <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 4 FLRA at 723-31).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_232"></span>In January 1980, during the pendency of the case, the Authority's final rule, &#x00A7; 2422.3(j), took effect:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(j)(1) A petition filed pursuant to &#x00A7; 2422.2(a) and (b) seeking an election in any existing exclusively recognized unit covered by a pending petition to consolidate existing exclusively recognized units must be filed timely in accordance with the requirements set forth in this section. Such petition filed pursuant to &#x00A7; 2422.2(a) and (b) will be held in abeyance pending the processing of the petition to consolidate.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Upon the issuance of a certification on consolidation of units, the petitioner under &#x00A7; 2422.2(a) and (b) shall be given thirty (30) days from the issuance of the certification to submit a sufficient showing of interest in such consolidated unit. Upon the timely submission of such adequate showing of interest, petitions filed pursuant to &#x00A7; 2422.2(a) and (b) will be processed, and an appropriate certification will issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority explained that "no longer will timely filed [representation] petitions be automatically dismissed upon the issuance of a certification in the consolidated unit.... Instead, a petitioner will have an opportunity to compete for the consolidated unit providing it timely submits a sufficient showing of interest in the consolidated unit."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority decided to apply the final rule to the pending petitions, finding that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[o]bviously, the Authority did not intend to maintain the unfairness of [&#x00A7;] 2422.3(j) of the interim rules by continuing its application in pending cases after the final rules became effective.&#8197;...[I]t cannot be seriously argued that the Authority intended to continue applying the procedures of the interim rules to the instant cases where...the very unfairness which prompted the revision of [&#x00A7;] 2422.3(j) of the interim rules is so graphically demonstrated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The units at issue in FASTA's consolidation petition likewise included both professional and nonprofessional employees and the professional employees voted to be included with nonprofessional employees. The Authority explained that PASS had supported its petition with an adequate showing of interest. However, a certification and contract bar existed from early 1977 until December 1979, and if the interim rather than the final rule were applied, then it would deny employees in the consolidated unit the opportunity to freely choose their bargaining representative for a period of up to seven years.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, the Authority also considered &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101(a)(1) and 7102 of the Statute, which highlight the importance of an employee's right to participate in labor organizations of their own choosing. The Authority found that the final rule of &#x00A7; 2422.3(j) "plainly effectuate[d] th[e] democratic principle of freedom of choice sought to be accomplished by the Statute." The Authority explained that &#x00A7; 7112(d) of the Statute "was intended to facilitate larger bargaining units, <span class="Italic">not</span> to shackle employees in the selection of a bargaining representative in those larger units."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While <span class="Italic">FAA</span> issued in 1980, it remains the law of the Authority. In its opposition, NTEU observes that if the Authority granted AFGE's application and AFGE entered into a contract early next year, employees would be denied the opportunity to vote on their exclusive representative from May 2015 until March 2021. That nearly six-year span is comparable to what the Authority found to be unfair and unreasonable in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the RD discussed in his decision, CHM 11.10.2 addresses the specific situation at issue here and instructs that the Regional Office will hold the second petition in abeyance while the consolidation petition is processed with the petitioner later given thirty days to demonstrate a sufficient showing of interest. The RD followed this process. While the CHM is not a binding rule, it is publicly available guidance on how the Office of the General Counsel processes representation petitions. The CHM has been in place since at least 2000 and is routinely relied upon by the Office of the General Counsel. As such--and in part due to its own request--AFGE had clear notice of how the petitions would be handled. <span class="Italic">FAA</span> and CHM 11.10.2 demonstrate that there is adequate precedent on this issue. Hence, AFGE has not demonstrated that the RD's decision raises an issue for which there is an absence of precedent and we decline to grant review under &#x00A7; 2422.31(c)(1) of the Authority's Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The RD applied established law</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE contends that the RD's decision is contrary to &#x00A7; 7111(f)(4) of the Statute and &#x00A7; 2422.12 of the Authority's Regulations. However, a plain reading of the Statute and Regulations fails to support AFGE's contentions. Section 7111(f)(4) provides that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[e]xclusive recognition shall not be accorded to a labor organization...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...if the Authority has, within the previous 12 calendar months, conducted a secret ballot election for the unit described in any petition under this section and in such election a majority of the employees voting chose a labor organization for certification as the unit's exclusive representative.[40]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[40]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(f)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE argues that an election "for the unit described in any petition under this section" occurred and "in such election a majority of the employees voting chose a labor organization for certification as the unit's exclusive representative." But, the election AFGE refers to was not petitioned for under "this section"--&#x00A7; 7111. Instead AFGE's petition was filed under a different section of the Statute, &#x00A7; 7112. Thus, the conditions necessary for &#x00A7; 7111(f)(4) to apply were not met.[44]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[44]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See generally NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA 611, 611 n.1 (2012) (discussing &#x00A7; 7111(f)(4)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2422.12(b) of the Authority's Regulations, "[w]here there is a certified exclusive representative of employees, a petition seeking an election will not be considered timely if filed within twelve (12) months <span class="Italic">after</span> the certification." The record is clear that NTEU filed its petition three and a half months <span class="Italic">before</span> the consolidation certification was issued. Therefore, &#x00A7; 2422.12(b) is not applicable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE claims that the RD erred in allowing NTEU to demonstrate a showing of interest in the consolidated unit without amending its original petition.&#x2003;As outlined above, <span class="Italic">FAA</span> and CHM 11.10.2 provide a petitioning union the opportunity to submit a revised showing of interest in a consolidated unit.[48] Furthermore, in order to demonstrate it had a sufficient thirty percent showing of interest in the consolidated unit, NTEU would need signatures from nineteen employees. While NTEU provided additional signatures after the RD reopened the case, its petition already included signatures from twenty employees. So, NTEU had demonstrated a sufficient showing of interest in the unit and the RD did not err.[51]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[48]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 4 FLRA at 726, 731 &#x0026; n.12; CHM 11.10.2.</p>

Ctr., Chesapeake, Va.</span>, 34 FLRA 946, 949 (1990) (a regional director's "determination of the adequacy of the showing of interest is administrative in nature and is not subject to collateral attack").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE also argues that the RD erred in applying an outdated regulation, &#x00A7; 2422.3(j), which was removed during the Authority's revisions to its regulations in 1995. AFGE misunderstands the RD's decision.[52] The RD did not apply &#x00A7; 2422.3(j)--he discussed its history and the interim and final rules as part of his explanation of <span class="Italic">FAA</span> and the CHM. Hence, the RD did not err in discussing the history of &#x00A7; 2422.3(j).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[52]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 68 FLRA 710, 711-12 (2015) (union's misunderstanding of regional director's decision could not serve as basis for granting application on grounds that the decision was contrary to law).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, AFGE argues that the RD failed to apply CHM 11.3 and 21.10.11.4. As relevant here, CHM 11.3 provides that the certification bar includes the issuance of a certification of a consolidation of units. CHM 23.10.1.4 states that a certification on consolidation acts as a bar for a twelve-month period. However, as the RD explained in his decision, CHM 11.3 and 23.10.1.4 stand for general propositions that are distinguished by the more detailed and specific guidance outlined in CHM 11.10.2 and 23.10.1.1. Consequently, the RD did not err in focusing on the specificity provided by CHM 11.10.2 and 23.10.1.1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, AFGE contends that its position here is supported by public policy, specifically an interest in consolidation and reducing unit fragmentation. However, the Authority in <span class="Italic">FAA</span> addressed this specifically. As quoted above, the Authority found that &#x00A7; 7112(d) of the Statute "was intended to facilitate larger bargaining units, <span class="Italic">not</span> to shackle employees in the selection of a bargaining representative in those larger units."[58] Accordingly, AFGE does not demonstrate that the RD erred in his application of established law.</p>
