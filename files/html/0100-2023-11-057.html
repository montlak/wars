<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-58"><span class="space">4.</span> Specificity, Relevancy of Request; Interactive Process</h4>
<p class="noindent">FLRA evaluates the necessity for the requested information based on the reasons expressed in the union's request. <span class="Italic">Commander, Naval Air Pac., Naval Air Station Whidbey Island and AFGE Local 1513</span>, 41 FLRA 662, 669 (1991). The request for information should be clear enough that management can gauge whether it has relevance to an existing or potential grievance or a matter within the scope of negotiations. A union's assertion that it needs data to process a grievance does not automatically oblige the agency to supply that data. The duty to supply information depends on the nature of the request and the circumstances of each request. <span class="Italic">AAFES, Ft. Carson and AFGE Local 1345</span>, 17 FLRA 624, 626 (1985), <span class="Italic">remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345 v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 1360, 1363-65 (D.C. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">on</span> <span class="Italic">remand</span>, 25 FLRA 1060 (1987). The employer would not be faulted for failing to provide information as to a grievance that was vague and ill-defined, <span class="Italic">IRS, Buffalo Dist. and NTEU Chap. 58</span>, 7 FLRA 654, 654 (1982). The employer does not err by refusing an information request so broadly defined that production would include a substantial amount of information, including personnel actions affecting managers and supervisors, unrelated to the need identified by the union--information concerning improper preselection of employees for promotion. The request should be limited to particular, identifiable, relevant documents necessary to the union. FLRA will not place on management the burden of sorting out what documents should or should not be provided, if the initial request appears too broad. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census and AFGE Local 2782</span>, 24 FLRA 630, 632 (1986). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2263 v. FLRA</span>, <a href="http://openjurist.org/454/f3d/1101/american-federation-of-government-employees--v-federal-labor-relations-authority"> 454 F.3d 1101</a>, 1105-07 (10th Cir. 2006) (calling into question "all or nothing" approach of FLRA). Assuming the legitimacy of management's response, the union should respond to management's request for more information supporting need for the information with a reply that does more than reiterate the initial request. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Randolph AFB and AFGE Local 1840</span>, 60 FLRA 261, 263 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent">The need for a specific and supported information request was reiterated, <span class="Italic">SSA, Dallas and AFGE Local 1336</span>, 51 FLRA 1219, 1222-24 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and</span> <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Kansas City Service Center, Kansas</span> <span class="Italic">City, Missouri</span>, 50 FLRA 661 (1995) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>), the Authority set forth the analytical framework for determining whether requested information is necessary within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. We held that a union making a request under that section must establish a particularized need for the information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs the requested information, including the uses to which it will put the information and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute. We also stated that the requirement to establish such need is not satisfied merely by showing that the requested information is or would be relevant or useful to the union, but that the union must demonstrate that requested information is "'required in order for the union adequately to represent its members.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 669-70 (quoting <span class="Italic"><span id="Page_311"></span>Department of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 991 F.2d 285, 290 (5th Cir. 1993). Satisfying this burden requires more than a conclusory or bare assertion; among other things, a request for information must be sufficient to permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether information must be disclosed under the Statute. As for the agency's responsibilities, we stated that when it denies an information request, the agency must assert and establish any countervailing anti-disclosure interests. The agency will not satisfy its burden by making conclusory or bare assertions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the parties are unable to agree on whether, or to what extent, requested information must be provided, we will find an unfair labor practice if a union has established a particularized need for the information and either: (1) the agency has not established a countervailing interest; or (2) the agency has established such an interest but it does not outweigh the union's demonstration of particularized need.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span> to the facts in this case, we find that when it requested the information, the Union did not satisfy its burden of articulating with specificity the reasons for which it needed the requested information and demonstrating that the requested information was required for it to adequately represent its members. At the time of the request, the Union provided no reason for the request. At the hearing, however, the Union offered three reasons for seeking the requested information. We disagree with the Judge and the General Counsel that one of the reasons offered at the hearing, specifically, Moon's grievance over her FY 90 performance appraisal, should have been apparent from the circumstances surrounding the request. Rather, we find that the existence of Moon's multiple EEO complaints and an earlier information request that specifically referenced Moon's performance appraisal grievance clouded the relationship between that grievance and the requests for the memory joggers. Also obscuring recognition of any relationship was the fact that in addition to requesting memory joggers from Skarbek, who was Moon's supervisor during FY 90, memory joggers were requested from Liess, who became Moon's supervisor <span class="Italic">after</span> FY 90. Indeed, at the ULP hearing the Union asserted multiple reasons for the requests; this undermines a finding that the performance appraisal grievance or any other particular reason was evident at the time of the request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we stated in <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, a request for information must be sufficient to permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether information must be disclosed under the Statute. Even assuming, without deciding, that any of the reasons proffered at the hearing demonstrated a particularized need for the requested information, the Respondent was not aware of those reasons at a time when it reasonably could have assessed the necessity for the information<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity</span> <span class="Italic">Commission</span>, 51 FLRA 248, 258 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Union has not established that the requested information is necessary within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute and, therefore, the Respondent did not violate the Statute by refusing to give the Union the memory joggers.</p>

To demonstrate that requested information is "necessary" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4), a union "must establish a particularized need for the information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs the requested information, including the uses to which the union will put the information, and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute." <span class="Italic">IRS, Wash., D.C. and IRS, Kansas City Serv.

The union's responsibility for articulating its interests in the requested information requires more than a conclusory assertion and must permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether disclosure of the information is required under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See IRS, Kansas City, </span>50 FLRA at 670.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency is responsible for establishing any countervailing anti-disclosure interests and, like the union, must do so in more than a conclusory way. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also Health Care Fin. Admin.,</span> 56 FLRA 156, 159 (2000). Such interests must be raised at or near the time of the union's request. <span class="Italic">See U.S. DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Det.

<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent proposed to replace contract language that permitted the break flexibilities with language that would allow it to set break and lunch periods based on "operational needs." The Charging Party requested documents showing, from March 1 to June 14, the normal times that each employee in each OHA takes breaks and lunch, explaining that it needed the information to: (1) have full and complete understanding of the Respondent's proposal; (2) prepare counter proposals; and (3) determine whether there was a legitimate operational need for the change.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, Authority precedent requires information requests to be specific and to set forth the necessity of the particular information requested, including the scope of the request, which encompasses the type of the information requested as well as the temporal and geographic aspects of the request. <span class="Italic">See Twin Cities,</span> 52 FLRA at 1330. Here, the Charging Party's request for information from March 1 to June 14 and from particular offices corresponded with the scope of the Respondent's proposed change to the parties' agreement. In this regard, the Charging Party's request was limited to the time period covering the date of the Respondent's proposed change up to the date of the Charging Party's information request. In addition, the Charging Party's request concerned the 139 OHA offices that employed bargaining-unit employees whom the Respondent's proposed change would have affected. Consequently, the temporal and geographic scope of the Charging Party's request was limited appropriately.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Charging Party's first explanation for why its needed the information paraphrases the Statute's requirement for "full and proper...understanding...of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining[,]" and its second explanation--to prepare counter proposals--would apply in every bargaining situation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B). However, it is unnecessary to decide whether these explanations provide the requisite specificity to establish particularized need because the Charging Party's subsequent explanation--that it needed the information to determine whether there was a legitimate operational need for the Respondent's proposed change to the parties' agreement--provides such specificity. In this regard, there is no dispute that the Respondent was seeking to replace the break flexibilities with a policy that would permit it to "set different lunch/break schedules to accommodate operational needs. In response, the Charging Party requested information showing "the normal time when each employee within each hearing office takes his/her breaks and lunch for each workday." The Charging Party questioned the Respondent's need to set different lunch and break schedules based on office coverage and operational needs, explaining that unit members represent only about 60 percent of the office staff. According to the Charging Party, the information was necessary to assess whether the Respondent's proposed change was based on legitimate operational needs and to show that "office coverage, if proven needed, could be adjusted in many other ways."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that the Charging Party's request lacked specificity because it did not explain how the requested information "would enable [the Charging Party] to determine whether there was a 'legitimate operational need' for a contract change." However, the Charging Party's request clearly explained its intent to use the information to assess the need for office coverage and the various ways such coverage, if needed, could be achieved. The Charging Party also explained that the information was necessary to determine whether the Respondent's stated operational need for its bargaining proposal was legitimate or simply "hard ball <span id="Page_312"></span>negotiation tactics." Thus, contrary to the Judge's finding, the Charging Party did explain the uses to which it would put the information and the connection between those uses and its representational responsibility to engage in collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge also found that the Charging Party's request lacked specificity because it was "not at all clear...that the information would actually serve [the Charging Party's stated] purpose."<span class="Italic"> </span>However, as the GC points out, "whether requested information would accomplish a union's purpose is not determinative of whether it is necessary within the meaning of the Statute." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Forrest City, Ark., </span>57 FLRA 808, 813 (2002) (citation omitted) (then-Member Pope dissenting on other grounds).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Judge found that the Respondent did not expressly request clarification of the Charging Party's information request, but that it "left the door open [for] the Union to pursue the issue with more specificity." Under Authority precedent, "when an agency reasonably requests clarification of a union's information request, the union's failure to respond to the request is taken into account in determining whether the union has established a particularized need for the information." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Kirtland, Air Force Base, Albuquerque, NM, </span>60 FLRA 791, 794 (2005) <span class="Italic">(Kirtland AFB), aff'd in part sub nom, AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 2263 v. FLRA, </span>454 F.3d 1101 (10th Cir. 2006). Also under Authority precedent, an agency is not required to expressly request clarification where its response to the information request "implicitly invite[s] further discussion...." <span class="Italic">Air Force,</span> 52 FLRA at 1008. In<span class="Italic"> Air Force, </span>the agency's response that was found to have invited further discussion was not an outright denial of the union's information request, but was tentative. In particular, the agency advised the union that its request should have been made to a higher authority, explaining that the request "does not appear" to establish a particularized need. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1003.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the agency in <span class="Italic">Air Force,</span> the Respondent in this case definitively denied the Charging Party's information request, asserting that the Charging Party had "failed to establish a particularized need for each item requested." Moreover, there is no question that the person responding to the Charging Party's information request had the authority to approve or deny the request. As the Respondent denied the Charging Party's information request without requesting clarification, there is no support for the Judge's finding that the Respondent "left the door open [for] the Union to pursue the issue with more specificity." Given the Respondent's failure to request clarification, the Charging Party was not required to provide such clarification. In any event, the Respondent's reason for denying the Charging Party's information request was not only that there was no particularized need, but also that the information constituted guidance relating to collective bargaining under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) of the Statute. Thus, even if the Respondent had requested clarification, providing such clarification would have eliminated only one of the two alternative bases on which the Respondent denied the request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the Charging Party's information request established a particularized need under the Statute and that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (5) and (8) of the Statute by not providing the Charging Party with the requested information.</p>
<p class="noindent">If management cannot reasonably divine the significance of the union's request, then the union must respond to inquiries from management that seek to develop the relevance of the requested material, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 51 FLRA 1391, 1392-97 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance on behalf of a unit employee, alleging that she had improperly been given a lower performance appraisal rating than in the previous year, in part because of discriminatory treatment based on sex. In connection with the processing of this grievance and another grievance which was subsequently resolved, the Union requested copies of the performance appraisals of all bargaining unit and nonbargaining unit employees of the Oklahoma City Information Systems Staff (ISS) for the 2-year period covering the grievant's prior and current appraisals. The Union's request stated that a "partial basis of this grievance is sexual discrimination and disparate treatment of the grievant[,]" and "[a]lthough the grievant is performing a different job function, it is the position of [the Union] that the aforementioned appraisals are necessary in order to support our allegations."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a written response, Respondent U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Oklahoma City District, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (Oklahoma City District), stated that it was not clear from the request how the information would support, or otherwise relate to, the grievance. The Oklahoma City District asserted that the information was not relevant and necessary to the issue of disparate treatment because the grievant was the only Computer Assistant on the ISS Staff. According to the Oklahoma City District, to support a claim of disparate treatment, a comparison of performance appraisals of individuals who occupy like positions must be made. The Oklahoma City District further stated to the Union that "[i]f you can provide a clear connection between the information requested or if other, more appropriate information is necessary, please let [management] know." Subsequently, the Union and the Oklahoma City District's representatives discussed the information request on at least two occasions. The Oklahoma City District restated its view that the necessity and relevance of the information to the processing of the grievance had not been established. The Union gave no further explanation regarding the Union's need for the information sought, and the Oklahoma City District did not furnish the requested information. It was not until the hearing before the Judge that the Union responded to the request that it explain its need for the information. The Oklahoma City District denied the grievance and the Union invoked arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and</span> <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Kansas City Service Center, Kansas</span> <span class="Italic">City, Missouri</span>, 50 FLRA 661 (1995) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>) (Member Talkin concurring), the Authority set forth the analysis for determining whether information is "necessary" under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. The Authority held that a union making a request under that section must establish a particularized need for the requested information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs that information, including the uses to which the information will be put, and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute. The Authority also stated that a union's need will not be satisfied merely by showing that requested information is or would be relevant or useful, but that the information is "'required in order for the union adequately to represent its members.'" <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, 50 FLRA at 670 (quoting <span class="Italic">Department of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 991 F.2d 285, 290 (5th Cir. 1993)). A union's responsibility for articulating and explaining its interests extends to more than a conclusory or bare assertion. Among other things, a request for information must be sufficient to permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether information must be disclosed under the Statute. As for the agency's responsibilities, it must assert and establish any countervailing anti-disclosure interests when it denies an information request. An agency may not satisfy its burden by making conclusory or bare assertions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority concluded that application of the above standard, which requires the parties to articulate and exchange their respective interests in disclosing information, serves several important purposes. First, it "facilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes" and, thereby, effectuates the purposes and policies of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1)(C)). Second, it facilitates the exchange of information, with the result that both parties' abilities to effectively and timely discharge their collective bargaining responsibilities under the Statute are enhanced. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Third, it permits the parties to consider, and as appropriate, accommodate their respective interests and attempt to reach agreement on the extent to which requested information is disclosed<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 670-71.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the parties are unable to agree on whether, or to what extent, requested information must be provided, the Authority will find an unfair labor practice if a union has established a particularized need for the information and either: (1) the agency has not established a countervailing interest; or (2) the agency has established such an interest but it does not outweigh the union's demonstration of particularized need.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the analytical framework of <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, we find that the Union has not satisfied its burden of establishing a particularized need for the sanitized performance appraisals. When it requested the performance appraisals, the Union stated that, "although the grievant [was] performing a different job function," it was the Union's "position" that the information was needed to show disparate treatment on the basis of sex. In denying the request, the Oklahoma City District questioned how the information was relevant or necessary because the grievant occupied the position of Computer Assistant, a one-of-a-kind position. In the District's view, the performance appraisals of other employees were not necessary because the Union could prove disparate treatment only by comparing the grievant's appraisal to those of other employees who occupied the same position. The Oklahoma City District asked the Union to provide additional information that would explain why the information was necessary, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, why the Union needed performance appraisals of employees who occupy dissimilar positions. The District also asked the Union to notify it if "other, more appropriate information" was necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under these circumstances, it was incumbent on the Union to provide additional explanation as to why it needed the information. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity</span> <span class="Italic">Commission</span>, 51 FLRA 248, 257-58 (1995) (<span class="Italic">EEOC</span>). That is, in view of the Oklahoma City District's unanswered questions, we find that the Union's conclusory assertion that the appraisals "are necessary in order to support our allegations" was insufficient to establish particularized need. The Union should have responded by explaining how performance appraisal information concerning dissimilar positions would allow a meaningful comparison to be made in order to support a claim of disparate treatment on the basis of sex. We are not persuaded <span id="Page_313"></span>by the General Counsel's contention that the reasons offered by the Union at the ULP hearing were "nothing more than a statement of what should have been reasonably obvious to the Respondent at the time it was considering the request." In this regard, the Oklahoma City District sought clarification from the Union on this exact point. Accepting the General Counsel's contention would require us to conclude that the request for clarification was either disingenuous or unreasonable, a conclusion not supported by the record. Nor are we willing to speculate that, as the General Counsel argues, it would have been "futile" for the Union to provide the Respondent further information<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming, without deciding, that the explanation eventually proffered at the hearing demonstrated a particularized need for the requested information, the Oklahoma City District was not aware of the explanation at a time when it reasonably could have assessed the necessity for the information. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration, Dallas Region, Dallas, Texas</span>, 51 FLRA 1219, 1224 (1996).[3] In sum, because the Union did not timely provide the clarification that was requested, the parties were effectively foreclosed from considering ways to accommodate their respective interests and could not attempt to reach agreement on the extent to which any of the requested information could be disclosed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 258; <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, 50 FLRA at 670-71.</p>

Among other things, in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, the union requested name-identified performance award information in order to prepare for an annual labor-management meeting, which would include discussions of the agency's recognition and awards program, and to determine whether unit employees had been treated differently under the program. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1067. The agency in <span class="Italic">FAA</span> neither responded to the union's request nor sought to have the union clarify its request as did Respondents in this case. Because it was clear on the face of the request why the union in <span class="Italic">FAA</span> needed the information, we found that the union established the requisite particularized need. We considered the hearing testimony in <span class="Italic">FAA</span> because it merely "further explained the Union's previously stated reasons" for needing the information<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Here, however, the Oklahoma City District immediately sought clarification of the request, and the Union did not respond.

<p class="noindent">The particularized need inherent in an information request should be established through dynamic, meaningful communications between the parties. Although testimony at a ULP hearing may provide some elaboration of reasons for a request, the hearing is not the place for the union to initially provide the reasons supporting its request. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and Nat'l Border Patrol Council, AFGE</span>, 51 FLRA 1467, 1472-76 (1996), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 52 FLRA 1323 (1997), <span class="Italic">agency petition for review denied</span>, <span class="Italic">DOJ v.

<p class="noindent-1">Subsequent to the court's remand, the Authority issued <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and Internal Revenue Service, Kansas City Service Center, Kansas City, Missouri</span>, 50 FLRA 661 (1995) (Member Talkin concurring) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>, <span class="Italic">Kansas City</span>), which set forth the approach for determining whether and how information must be disclosed under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. In <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, the Authority directly addressed the court's decision in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>. The Authority held that "a union requesting information under that section must establish a particularized need for the information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs the requested information, including the uses to which the union will put the information, and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 669. The Authority also stated that a union's burdens will not be satisfied merely by showing that requested information is or would be relevant or useful, but that the union must demonstrate that the information is "'required in order for the union adequately to represent its members.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 670 (quoting <span class="Italic">Department of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 991 F.2d 285, 290 (5th Cir. 1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A union's burdens under <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span> extend to articulating and establishing the necessity of the particular information it has requested, including the scope of a request. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, D.C</span>., 51 FLRA 462, 476 (1995) (<span class="Italic">DOL</span>). Satisfying its burden requires more than a conclusory or bare assertion; among other things, the union's request for information must be sufficient to permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether the information must be disclosed under the Statute. <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas</span> <span class="Italic">City</span>, 50 FLRA at 670. To accomplish this, a union must articulate its disclosure interests at or near the time of the request--not for the first time at the unfair labor practice hearing. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Justice, United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, United States Border Patrol, Dallas, Texas</span>, 51 FLRA 545, 551 (1995) (<span class="Italic">INS, Dallas);</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 51 FLRA 248, 258 (1995) (<span class="Italic">EEOC</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to an agency's responsibilities in responding to a request for information, the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span> that an agency's "burden extends beyond simply saying 'no.'" 50 FLRA at 670. In particular, the agency "must assert and establish any countervailing anti-disclosure interests<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. The agency will not satisfy its burden by making conclusory or bare assertions. In addition, for the same reasons that we expect a union to articulate its disclosure interests at or near the time of a request, we expect an agency to timely communicate its interests as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the parties are unable to agree on whether, or to what extent, requested information must be provided and the matter is presented for adjudication, each party must establish its reasons for requesting, or denying a request for, information. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Border Patrol, Del Rio, Texas</span>, 51 FLRA 768, 774 (1995); <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base</span>, <span class="Italic">Illinois</span>, 51 FLRA 675, 681 (1996). We will find an unfair labor practice if a union has established a particularized need for the information and either: (1) the agency has not established a countervailing interest; or (2) the agency has established such an interest but it does not outweigh the union's demonstration of particularized need. In determining whether and/or how disclosure is required, the parties should consider alternative forms or means of disclosure that may satisfy both a union's information needs and an agency's interests in information. <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, 50 FLRA at 671 (citing <span class="Italic">Detroit Edison Co. v.

<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent proposed the removal of Wood 2 days before the Union made its November 21, 1990, request for disciplinary and adverse action records. In that request, the Union explicitly connected its request with the adverse action the Respondent proposed to take against Wood by stating that the requested information was needed to "properly respond to the allegations" set forth in the notice. <span class="Italic">DOJ/INS</span>, 46 FLRA at 1556. Approximately 2 weeks thereafter, at the meeting held on December 6, 1990, the Union and the Respondent specifically discussed the reasons the Union had requested these records. The Union stated that it needed the records in order to compare the discipline the Respondent had proposed for Wood with that given to other employees who had committed similar offenses. The Union and the Respondent also discussed the Respondent's concerns about the privacy of such other employees, and the Respondent inquired whether the Union "could accept the proposed actions in a sanitized version." The Union responded that it could "take them in a sanitized version...because...all [the Union] needed to know was that the disciplinary action was proposed and what the outcome of it was." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. There is no assertion that the Respondent was unclear at that meeting about the Union's reasons for requesting the records, or that, thereafter, the Respondent ever requested further clarification of those reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the hearing, the Union was questioned as to why it had requested records spanning 5 years and covering a geographic region.

The Union further stated that it was aware "that in 1985 there were some officers that had been given suspension notices and termination notices, and [it] wanted to make sure that these people--the evidence or their proposals and what was mitigated down would have been comparable to what Mr. Wood should have received or could receive." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 124. These statements explain why the scope of the information was considered necessary to determine whether Wood was treated fairly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the hearing testimony is the first time the record shows that the Union was asked about, and specifically addressed, the 5-year and region-wide scope of its request for disciplinary and adverse action letters, the question arises whether it is proper to consider this testimonial evidence in assessing the adequacy of the Union's assertion of need.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where testimony at the hearing amounts to explaining previously stated reasons for needing the requested information, it has been taken into consideration<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration</span>, <span class="Italic">New England Region, Bradley Air Traffic Control Tower, Windsor</span> <span class="Italic">Locks, Connecticut</span>, 51 FLRA 1054, 1067 (1996) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">INS, Dallas</span>, 51 FLRA at 550 (even assuming that reason articulated by union at ULP hearing was timely, the union did not establish particularized need). However, in <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, 51 FLRA at 258, the Authority refused to consider reasons for requesting information that had not previously been articulated by the union and that were offered by the union for the first time at the ULP hearing because this was considered too late for the respondent to make a reasoned judgment in responding to the information request<span class="Italic">. See also</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and U.S. Department of the Treasury, <span id="Page_314"></span>Internal Revenue Service, Oklahoma City District, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</span>, 51 FLRA No. 113, slip op. at 6-7 (1996) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Oklahoma City</span>) (Authority refused to consider reasons for requesting information offered by union for the first time at the hearing where respondent previously sought and union refused to provide clarification of its request).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts in the case now before us are distinguishable from those in <span class="Italic">IRS, Oklahoma City</span> and <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>. In particular, the Union responded soon after the request to the questions and concerns that were raised by the Respondent. In contrast, in <span class="Italic">IRS, Oklahoma City</span> and <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, the unions failed to respond to the agencies' requests for clarification of the reasons the unions needed the requested information. <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, 51 FLRA No. 113, slip op. at 6; <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, 51 FLRA at 257-58. In addition, in the case now before the Authority, the reasons offered at the time of the request and at the subsequent December 6th meeting clearly explained why the requested disciplinary and adverse action letters were needed. In <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, on the other hand, after the agency furnished some of the requested information, the union advanced no explanation for still needing the remaining information<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no indication in the record that, at the time of the November 21 request or during the December 6 meeting, the Respondent raised concerns about, or requested clarification concerning, the scope of the Union's request. When the Union was asked about the scope of the request at the ULP hearing, the Union witness testified quite specifically as to why the request encompassed a 5-year, region-wide scope. As such, this case also is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, where the Authority concluded that the union's testimony at the ULP hearing, that it requested 5 years' of records because it believed the respondent maintained records for that period, did not establish particularized need. 51 FLRA at 476 (the fact "that disciplinary...records covering a period of 5 years are available does not establish that those records are necessary.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we will take into account the Union's testimony about the scope of its request at the hearing in assessing whether the Union satisfied its burden to establish particularized need. To do otherwise would give undue weight to whether the agency asked or the union answered questions about matters that, unlike other matters that were discussed at the December 6 meeting, neither party appeared concerned about at the time of the request. This we are unwilling to do, especially since the Respondent continued to maintain that none of the requested disciplinary and adverse action letters were necessary even after the Union clarified the reasons it needed the records. The Respondent's response to the Union's clarification effectively terminated meaningful discussions on the issue of the scope of the Union's request. As such, we find it appropriate to consider the Union's explanation of the scope of the request at the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To guide these parties and others involved in future information requests, we emphasize, as the Authority did in <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, 50 FLRA at 670, that "applying a standard which requires parties to articulate and exchange their respective interests in disclosing information serves several important purposes." These purposes include facilitating the amicable settlement of disputes, and enhancing the parties' abilities to effectively and timely discharge their...responsibilities under the Statute...." The purposes are not served when either party fails to fully communicate its interests and concerns prior to litigation. Litigating a ULP charge should not be a substitute for practicing good labor relations.</p>
