<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-322"><span class="space">a.</span> Definition of Agency</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The ability to exercise veterans preference rights, and to appeal their denial in a right to compete case, may depend on the definition of the agency that undertakes the recruitment action. <span class="Italic">Vassallo v. DOD</span>, 122 MSPR 156, 157-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-10, 2015 MSPB 8 (2015) (reconsideration decision reversing <span class="Italic">Vassallo v. DOD</span>, 121 MSPR 70, 71-72 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6-12, 2014 MSPB 24 (2014), <span class="Italic">post</span>. The Board decisions but briefly describe the basic facts of the case, so upon retreat to the AJ's decision, <span class="Italic">Vassallo v. DOD</span>, PH-3330-13-0049-I-1 (Initial Decision Jan. 29, 2013), and we learn that Mr. Vassallo, a DCMA employee with veterans preference, applied for a job under a DOD job announcement that limited consideration to DCMA and a limited group of other DOD employees. Vassallo was not considered for the job because he did not include with his application a copy of a required SF-50. The question became whether Vasallo should have been considered as an applicant from outside the agency (since an SF-50 would not have been required). And the question then became whether the agency was DCMA (the potential employer), leading to a conclusion that applications were accepted outside the confines of DMCA, or whether DOD was the employer, leading to a conclusion that applications were not being accepted outside of DOD.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With that background, we arrive at the later, controlling Board decision that the agency in question was DOD, <span class="Italic">Vassallo v. DOD</span>, 122 MSPR 156, 157-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-10, 2015 MSPB 8 (2015) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Vassallo v. DOD</span>, 797 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2015), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal concerns a vacancy announcement issued by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), which is a subcomponent of the Department of Defense (DOD), for a position in DCMA. <span class="Italic">Vassallo</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 70, &#x00B6; 2. The vacancy announcement specified that only applicants from particular DOD subcomponents would be considered for the position: current DCMA employees and DOD employees with the Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Workforce who are outside the military components. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant was a current DCMA employee; however his application was rejected due to his failure to submit a Standard Form (SF) 50 (Notification of Personnel Action), which the announcement requested in order to verify an individual's eligibility for the position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> After first seeking corrective action from the Department of Labor, the appellant filed a VEOA claim under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), <span class="Italic">Vassallo</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 70, &#x00B6; 3, which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Preference eligibles or veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dispositive issue in this case is determining the scope of the meaning of the word "agency" as used in the statute for purposes of determining whether DCMA was required to give the appellant an "opportunity to compete." If the word "agency" in the statute means DCMA in this case, then the appellant had the right to compete, regardless of whether he submitted an SF-50 verifying his current DCMA employment, because applications were accepted from persons outside DCMA. If the word "agency" in the statute means DOD in this case, the appellant would not have had a right to compete because applications were not accepted from outside DOD's workforce; indeed, applications were not accepted from the entirety of DOD's workforce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that "agency" in this matter meant DCMA rather than DOD, the Board noted OPM's guidance in the VetGuide, which indicated that DOD, not its DCMA subcomponent, was the relevant agency. <span class="Italic">Vassallo</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 70, &#x00B6; 7. The Board found that, while guidance in the VetGuide is entitled to "some weight," it is not entitled to the deference accorded to regulations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8. Furthermore, the Board cited to its decisions in <span class="Italic">Washburn v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 265 (2013), and <span class="Italic">Willingham v. Department of the Navy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 21 (2012), in determining that the pertinent agency was DCMA, <span class="Italic">Vassallo</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 70, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board noted that, in <span class="Italic">Washburn</span>, it had rejected OPM's interpretation of the meaning of the word "agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9. Furthermore, it noted that, while not directly on point, its decision in <span class="Italic">Willingham</span> was instructive on the question of defining "agency" for purposes of a VEOA claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10. The issue in <span class="Italic">Willingham</span> was whether the Marine Corps Community Services (MCCS), a nonappropriated fund instrumentality, was an "agency" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A) for purposes of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Willingham</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 21, &#x00B6; 9. Noting that nothing in the legislative history of VEOA shed light on the meaning of "agency," the Board in <span class="Italic">Willingham</span> looked to other sources for guidance in interpreting the meaning of "agency," including rules of statutory construction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-18. Relying primarily on the Act's remedial purpose to establish rights and benefits for veterans, the Board in <span class="Italic">Willingham</span> ultimately concluded that the MCCS should be viewed as the agency for purposes of the VEOA provision at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-18. Thus, we noted in our prior decision in this matter that, while <span class="Italic">Willingham</span> does not stand for the proposition that all subcomponents of DOD are agencies for purposes of VEOA, it does reflect the Board's determination in VEOA appeals to interpret "agency" in a manner that best effectuates the underlying purposes of the Act.[1] <span class="Italic">Vassallo</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 70, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;While the same statutory ambiguity in <span class="Italic">Willingham</span> exists in this case, as explained below, the ambiguity in the present matter can be resolved through the application of OPM regulation 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.611. There was no such similar controlling regulation at issue in <span class="Italic">Willingham</span>; accordingly, our decision in this case is not incongruous with <span class="Italic">Willingham</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's argument that the Board's decision is wrong as a matter of law proceeds as follows: (1) sections 101-105 of Title 5, U.S. Code, constitute a comprehensive definitional scheme as to what entities constitute various types of agencies; (2) the term "Executive agency" in section 105 encompasses executive departments (including DOD), independent establishments, and military departments, but not subcomponents of any of those entities[2] ; (3) these definitions apply to subsection 3304(f); (4) the term "agency" in subsection 3304(f) unambiguously refers to "Executive agency" as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105, and this definition must <span id="Page_578"></span>be applied in this case; and (5) even if the term "agency" in subsection 3304(f) is ambiguous, the Board must defer to OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.611, which specifies that the definition in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105 applies to claims under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;OPM is correct that the definition of "Executive agency" does not include subcomponents of executive departments, but OPM is incorrect in stating that military departments are executive agencies. Executive agencies under section 105 means an executive department, a government corporation, and an independent establishment. While "Executive department" does include DOD, "military departments" are separately defined as encompassing the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 102.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not agree with OPM's contention that the term "agency" in subsection 3304(f) unambiguously refers to "Executive agency" as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105. The unmodified term "agency" is not defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101-105; those sections define "Executive departments," "military departments," "Government corporation," "independent establishment," and "Executive agency." Nevertheless, we agree with OPM's contention that any ambiguity is resolved by its regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.611.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the language of a statute is ambiguous or Congress has left a gap to be filled, the interpretation of the agency entrusted with implementing the statute must be upheld so long as it is a permissible construction of the statute. <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984). When there is an express delegation of rulemaking authority to fill gaps in the statutory scheme, the agency's "legislative regulation" will be given controlling weight unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 843-44. The statute that spells out the substantive entitlement of preference eligibles and veterans to have an opportunity to compete for vacant positions specifies that "[OPM] shall prescribe regulations necessary for the administration of this subsection." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(5). OPM has prescribed such regulations in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 335.106 and 315.611. Section 335.106, titled "Special selection procedures for certain veterans under merit promotion," provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Preference eligibles or veterans who have been separated under honorable conditions from the armed forces after completing (as determined by the agency) 3 or more years of continuous active military service may compete for vacancies under merit promotion when an agency accepts applications from individuals outside its own workforce. Those veterans selected will be given career or career conditional appointments under &#x00A7; 315.611 of this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 315.611, titled "Appointment of certain veterans who have competed under agency merit promotion announcements," provides the following definition at subsection (b): "'Agency' in this context means an executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There can be no doubt that interpreting the word "agency" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) to mean "Executive agency" as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105 is a permissible construction of the statute, and we must therefore give OPM's regulation controlling weight. Given the above, the agency was not required to give the appellant an "opportunity to compete" because "the agency making the announcement--DOD--did not accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures. It restricted applications to individuals within its own workforce. Of course, the appellant was in DOD's workforce in this case. Whether the agency erred in not accepting the SF-50, however, is not a matter for the Board to review under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we reverse our previous decision and deny the appellant's request for corrective action.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Washburn</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 7, the Board relied on a different OPM regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.101(a), which defines "agencies" for the purpose of "Filling Vacancies in the Competitive Service" as including military departments. The definition at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.611 for "agency" is narrower, as it relies on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105. DOD is an executive department under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101, and is therefore an executive agency under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105, which includes, among other things, an executive department. By contrast, the Department of the Air Force is a "military department" as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 102, which is not included in the definition of "Executive agency" under section 105. Because the instant matter does not involve a military department, we need not resolve this apparent inconsistency in the regulations at this time.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We review an agency's statutory interpretation using the two-pronged framework established by <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837 (1984). The first prong requires the court to assess "whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue"; if so, the court "must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 842-43. If the statute does not answer the specific question, meaning that it is "silent or ambiguous," then the court must discern whether the agency provided "a permissible construction of the statute." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 843; <span class="Italic">Wilder v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government contends that the Board "was not required to defer to OPM's regulation[ ] because the plain language of the statute makes clear that DOD is 'the agency' for purposes of the VEOA." Because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105 defines "executive agency" to cover "executive departments," not the executive departments' subcomponents, the government argues that "the use of the word 'agency'" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) "to mean 'Executive Agency' follows naturally when examining the statutory scheme as a whole." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory scheme does not answer the precise question, i.e., whether "agency" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) means "executive agency" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105. Section 105 of Title 5 of the United States Code provides that "[f]or purposes of [5 U.S.C.], 'Executive agency' means Executive department...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105. In turn, &#x00A7; 101 of the same title explains that the term "Executive departments" includes, among others, the DOD. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101. The Board correctly observed that "[t]he unmodified term 'agency' is not defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101-105."

Indeed, neither "executive" nor "department" appears in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304, still less do they appear in subsection (f) of that provision. As a result, we cannot say that Congress unambiguously intended to equate "agency" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) with "executive agency" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105. In view of this ambiguity, the Board properly proceeded to the second step under <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;OPM's Regulation Governs</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Vassallo raises a series of statistics-based arguments about the alleged universe of civil and military employees in federal service. Mr. Vassallo argues that these statistics demonstrate that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.611(b) unreasonably expands the pool of potential workers from which the DOD may hire and, as a consequence, limits the benefits that Congress intended for the VEOA to provide to veterans.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Statistics alone, however, do not govern this court's analysis of OPM's regulation; rather, we must discern whether the regulation "[is] arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute." <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 844. As previously stated, OPM's regulation defines "agency" as "an executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 105." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.611(b). As explained above, "executive agency" encompasses "executive departments," which include the DOD but not its subcomponents, such as DCMA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101, 105. The Board observed that "[t]here can be no doubt that interpreting the word 'agency' in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) to mean 'Executive agency' as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105 is a permissible construction of the statute." The court agrees, particularly given that Congress expressly directed OPM to "elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation" and that those regulations warrant "controlling weight." <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843-44; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(5) ("[OPM] shall prescribe regulations necessary for the administration of this subsection"). An agency regulation that adopts as its own a relevant definition from the governing statutory scheme does not "manifestly contra[dict] " the statute. <span class="Italic">Cf. Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 844.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before its change in position, the Board obliquely defined the meaning of "agency" for VEOA cases, <span class="Italic">Vassallo v. DOD</span>, 121 MSPR 70, 71, 73-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6-12, 2014 MSPB 24 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The pertinent facts, as set forth in the initial decision, are undisputed. The appellant was employed by the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), a component of the Department of Defense, as a GS-12 Computer Engineer. He applied for the GS-13 position of Lead Interdisciplinary Engineer. The vacancy announcement, issued by DCMA, specified that the following Department of Defense employees could apply for the position: current DCMA employees; and current Department of Defense employees with the Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Workforce who are outside the Military Components....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory section governing "opportunity to compete" claims under the VEOA provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Preference eligibles or veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). It is undisputed that the appellant met the <span id="Page_579"></span>definition of a "veteran" under section 3304(f)(1) and otherwise satisfied jurisdictional requirements for an appeal under that provision. The dispositive question is whether the agency making the announcement accepted applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the initial decision reflects, OPM's guidance in the VetGuide indicates that the Department of Defense, not its DCMA subcomponent, was the relevant agency in this case. Accordingly, if the VetGuide guidance is applied, the agency did not accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce by accepting applications from "Department of Defense Employee[s] within the Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (AT&#x0026;L) Workforce who are outside of the Military Components." Indeed, if the Department of Defense is the relevant "agency," then it did not even accept applications from the entirety of its own workforce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's guidance in the VetGuide, while entitled to "some weight" depending on factors such as consistency of the agency's position, its formality, and its persuasiveness, is not entitled to the deference accorded to regulations. <span class="Italic">Durand v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 14 (2007); <span class="Italic">Brandt v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 14 (2006).

Department of Homeland Security</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 104, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-20 (2007), the Board rejected guidance in the VetGuide as to an interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) in another context.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's interpretation of the meaning of the word "agency" has been rejected by the Board in <span class="Italic">Washburn v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 119 MSPR 265 (2013). In <span class="Italic">Washburn</span>, the Department of the Air Force issued a vacancy announcement to fill a position in the United States Strategic Command, a Department of Defense entity that includes elements of the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps, and the vacancy announcement stated that it would accept applications from "Air Force Employee[s]" and "[DOD] Transfer (Army, Navy, [Defense Finance and Accounting Service], etc.--Excluding Air Force)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 2. The Board held that "the agency making the announcement" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) was the Department of the Air Force and concluded that this agency had "accept[ed] applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While not directly on point, our decision in <span class="Italic">Willingham v. Department of the Navy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 21 (2012), is instructive on the question of defining "agency" for purposes of a VEOA claim. The issue in that case was whether the Marine Corps Community Services, a nonappropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI), was an "agency" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A).[4] VEOA does not define "agency," and nothing in the Act's legislative history sheds light on the parameters of that term. In light of the resulting ambiguity as to the meaning of "agency" for purposes of VEOA, the Board relied primarily on the Act's remedial purpose to establish rights and benefits for veterans in construing "agency" as encompassing the NAFI at issue there. Thus, while <span class="Italic">Willingham</span> does not stand for the proposition that all subcomponents of the Department of Defense are agencies for purposes of VEOA, it does reflect the Board's determination in VEOA appeals to interpret "agency" in a manner that best effectuates the underlying purposes of the Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although the VEOA claim in <span class="Italic">Willingham</span> arose under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A) rather than under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B), which is the statutory subsection at issue here, we see no basis to construe the term "agency" differently under those subsections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our previous decisions in <span class="Italic">Washburn</span> and <span class="Italic">Willingham</span>, we conclude that "the agency making the announcement" was DCMA, not the Department of Defense. The VetGuide's contrary interpretation of the law is not persuasive. We note in this regard that the VetGuide provision contains no analysis of this legal issue. Its treatment consists of the single parenthetical sentence quoted above. <span class="Italic">Supra</span> &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because DCMA "accept[ed] applications from outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures," a veteran such as the appellant "may not be denied the opportunity to compete." We conclude that the appellant was wrongfully denied the opportunity to compete for the position at issue because of the agency's erroneous conclusion that he had failed to verify his current employment status. The agency therefore violated the appellant's rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B) and 3304(f)(1). The remedy for a violation in circumstances such as this is to determine whether the appellant was otherwise qualified for the position in question and, if so, require the agency to reconstruct the selection process. <span class="Italic">Jolley</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 104, &#x00B6; 21.</p>
