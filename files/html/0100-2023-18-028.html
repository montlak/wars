<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-32"><span class="space">E.</span> REPRESENTATION AND UNIT DETERMINATION</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA</span>, 727 F.2d 481, 491-93 (5th Cir. 1984), denied judicial review of FLRA representation decisions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress did not specifically provide in section 7123(a) for direct review of "election" orders, only "final" orders....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a conference report on the statute, Congress made it clear that the provisions of the statute concerning the role of the Authority, the proceedings in representation cases and the right of court review were based on established practices of the National Labor Relations Board....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the almost fifty years since the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, appellate courts, when asked to review orders of the National Labor Relations Board...which set aside elections and directed another election, have said many times that such an order is not a "final" order....&#8197;The courts have also said that any type of order by the Board during the representation proceedings, which include the determination of an appropriate bargaining unit, the direction of election, ruling on possible election objections, the certification of a bargaining representative, is not a "final" order....&#8197;In view of this background, Congress's failure in section 7123(a) to exclude by specific words section 7111 election decisions from direct review can hardly be indicative of an intention to cause such orders to be directly reviewable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the particular order here, it is especially clear that it is not final. The Authority's order setting aside the first election and directing a second election does not have any conclusive legal consequences nor does it finally determine any rights or obligations. It does not purport to determine at all, much less with finality, whether either union will represent the employees in the subject bargaining unit. That matter is left to a second election and subsequent certification proceedings. At the same time, the order does not impose obligations on the Border Patrol or any of the unions....</p>
<p class="noindent">The court added as to the means to test election results, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 493 n.15:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Such decisions and orders can only be indirectly reviewed after a labor organization has been certified by the Board as the employee's exclusive representative and the employer has been ordered to bargain with the labor organization as the result of the certification; and then only if the employer "tests" the certification by committing an unfair labor practice by refusing to bargain. <span class="Italic">AFL v. NLRB</span>, 308 U.S. 401 (1940); <span class="Italic">Boire v. Greyhound Corp.</span>, 376 U.S. 473 (1964).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA</span>, the Ninth Circuit distinguished the Fifth Circuit decision by explaining that it had jurisdiction to review FLRA's determination that an individual lacked standing to file and have adjudicated a unit clarification petition. The summary rejection of the clarification petition filed under 5 USC 7111, was, in the Ninth Circuit's opinion, a judicially reviewable order that was not equivalent to a unit determination made under 5 USC 7112 that was, in turn, judicially unreviewable under 5 USC 7123(a)(2). According to <span class="Italic">Eisinger v. FLRA</span>, 218 F.3d 1097, 1101-04 (9th Cir. 2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our jurisdiction to review a final decision of the FLRA is governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a), which provides, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Any person aggrieved by <span class="Italic">any final</span> <span class="Italic">order of the Authority other than</span> an order under--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;section 7112 of this title (involving an appropriate unit determination), may...institute an action for judicial review of the Authority's order in the United States court of appeals....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a) (emphasis added). The plain language of the statute clearly states that we have jurisdiction over all final orders from the FLRA, with one of the two exceptions being orders issued under &#x00A7; 7112.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The other exception is &#x00A7; 7122 (arbitration awards), which is not relevant to this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7112 discusses the "[d]etermination of appropriate units for labor organization representation" and clearly states that "[t]he Authority shall determine the appropriateness of any unit." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(a). An appropriate unit determination involves "whether...the appropriate unit should be established on an agency, plant, installation, functional, or other basis...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Eisinger filed his petition under &#x00A7; 7111, not &#x00A7; 7112. Section 7111(b)(2) involves the "clarification of, or amendment to" an existing unit. The statute says that "[i]f a petition is filed with the Authority...by any person seeking clarification of, or amendment to, a certification then in effect or a matter relating to representation; the Authority <span class="Italic">shall</span> investigate the petition,...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2) (emphasis added). A <span id="page_2541"></span>clarification of unit (CU) petition is a type of "representation petition" that is "appropriate where there is uncertainty about the status of an employee with respect to the bargaining unit or in cases where reorganization has altered the scope of the unit." Robert T. Simmelkjaer, <span class="Italic">Representation and Election</span>, <span class="Italic">in</span> Federal Civil Service Law and Procedures 213, 216 (Ellen M. Bussy ed., 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ordinarily, the investigation of a CU petition under &#x00A7; 7111 results in an appropriate unit determination under &#x00A7; 7112:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Following the filing of a representation petition in accordance with 7111(b), the regional director...must conduct an investigation to determine whether the proposed unit is appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining. The regional director's investigation not only applies the criteria for determining appropriateness contained in section 7112(a)(1) but also ensures that the unit does not contain excluded categories of employees identified in section 7112(b)(1)-7112(b)(7).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Simmelkjaer, <span class="Italic">Representation and Elections</span>, 222-23. The FLRA is "bound by the three criteria for determining the appropriateness of any unit as mandated by section 7112(a)(1)." <span class="Italic">International Communication Agency</span>, 5 FLRA 97, 99 (1981). Thus, FLRA review of &#x00A7; 7111/CU petitions typically involves application of the substantive criteria required by &#x00A7; 7112(a). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Department of Defense Dependents Schools</span>, 6 F.L.R.A. 297 (1981); <span class="Italic">Department of Agriculture, Animal Plant Health Inspection Serv.</span>, 6 F.L.R.A. 261 (1981); <span class="Italic">International Communication Agency</span>, 5 F.L.R.A. at 99.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The primary reason for our jurisdiction over this case is the plain language of &#x00A7; 7123. It is a well-recognized rule of statutory construction that "[t]he plain meaning of the statute controls, and courts will look no further, unless its application leads to unreasonable or impracticable results." <span class="Italic">United States v. Daas</span>, 198 F.3d 1167, 1174 (9th Cir. 1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Seattle-First Nat'l Bank v. Conaway</span>, 98 F.3d 1195, 1197 (9th Cir. 1996)). The plain meaning of &#x00A7; 7123 is unambiguous: If the FLRA's final order is not an "appropriate unit determination" under &#x00A7; 7112 and if no other exception applies, then we have jurisdiction. We reject the FLRA's argument that in this case it made an "appropriate unit determination" under &#x00A7; 7112. The FLRA dismissed Eisinger's petition on standing grounds. It did not conduct an investigation, it did not make an appropriate unit determination, and it did not consider the three criteria for determining the appropriateness of a unit as mandated by &#x00A7; 7112(a). Neither the Regional Director nor the FLRA moved beyond the procedures of &#x00A7; 7111 and into the substance of &#x00A7; 7112. Therefore, this is an atypical case where a CU petition filed under &#x00A7; 7111 does not implicate &#x00A7; 7112.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have jurisdiction because we are not interfering with the FLRA's unreviewable authority to decide the merits of representation petitions. We do not believe that we should limit our jurisdiction because Eisinger may have other avenues of relief.[5] Nor do we believe that our decision will lead to a bifurcated review of FLRA decisions based on whether or not they are decided on procedural grounds (such as mootness, ripeness, or standing) or on the merits. Section 7111 commands that if a CU petition is filed by "any person," the FLRA "<span class="Italic">shall</span> investigate the petition[&#8197;]...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2) (emphasis added). By using the word "shall," Congress mandated an FLRA investigation of every &#x00A7; 7111 petition under &#x00A7; 7112. <span class="Italic">See Mallard v. United States Dist. Court</span>, 490 U.S. 296, 302, 109 S. Ct. 1814, 104 L. Ed.2d 318 (1989) (finding that use of the word "shall" indicates a command). Thus, before dismissing this case on procedural grounds, the FLRA should have investigated the petition according to the procedures of &#x00A7; 7111 and the criteria of &#x00A7; 7112. Indeed, if the FLRA had investigated the merits of Eisinger's petition, or if it ever considers the merits of his petition in the future, we will not have jurisdiction to review the FLRA's decision. As it currently stands, however, asserting jurisdiction over this case based on the statute's plain language will not lead to an "unreasonable or impracticable" result.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The FLRA, citing <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) v. FLRA</span>, 112 F.3d 402, 406 (9th Cir. 1997) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), noted that if its regulations on standing are "in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific [statutory] provision," then the district court has original jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyrie</span>, 358 U.S. 184, 188, 79 S. Ct. 180, 3 L. Ed.2d 210 (1958). The district court, however, has original jurisdiction only if appellate review is presumptively foreclosed. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 187, 79 S. Ct. 180. In order for Eisinger to prevail at the district court, the FLRA must have completely exceeded its jurisdictional authority, rather than just acted arbitrarily and capriciously. Furthermore, the FLRA fails to acknowledge that our decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> held that we lacked jurisdiction over that arbitration case because the statutory language of &#x00A7; 7123 was clear. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 112 F.3d at 404-05. In this case, we likewise find that the plain meaning of &#x00A7; 7123 is clear, but this time it indicates that we have jurisdiction. Given this clear statutory language, it is unnecessary to abdicate our jurisdiction because Eisinger may have other avenues of relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the FLRA's contention that the legislative history is clearly contrary to the statute's plain language. We are mindful that "access to judicial review should be limited 'only upon a showing of "clear and convincing evidence" of a contrary legislative intent.'" <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 112 F.3d at 404-05 (quoting <span class="Italic">Lindahl v.

<p class="noindent-1">The express language and the nature of the administrative action in this case indicate that we have jurisdiction.&#x2003;We reject the FLRA's reliance on <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice v. FLRA ("Justice")</span>, 727 F.2d 481 (5th Cir. 1984), which the FLRA cites in support of its argument that the statute's legislative history suggests otherwise. The Fifth Circuit held that it did not have jurisdiction to review an FLRA decision under &#x00A7; 7111 that overturned the results of a representation election and ordered a second election. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 494. The Fifth Circuit read the statute's legislative history as bearing "strong indicia of an intent on the part of Congress to exclude section 7111 election decisions from direct appellate review." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 492. Furthermore, in dicta, the Fifth Circuit reads the legislative history as suggesting that Congress also intended "to treat the Authority's decisions in representation proceedings as 'non-final' orders, which were not reviewable<span class="Italic">...." Id.</span> at 493.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Fifth Circuit's reading of the legislative history is overbroad. The Senate version of the bill allowed appeals only of unfair labor practices. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 153 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2860, 2887 (Conference Report). The House version allowed appeals from unfair labor practice decisions and "all other final decisions of the Authority involving an award by an arbitrator, and the appropriateness of the unit an organization seeks to represent...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The conference committee compromised by excluding arbitration awards and appropriate unit determinations from judicial review, but by allowing review of all other decisions:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In the case of those other matters that are appealable to the Authority the conference report authorizes both the agency and the employee to appeal the final decision of the Authority except in two instances where the House recedes to the Senate. As in the private sector, there will no judicial review of the Authority's determination of the appropriateness of bargaining units, and there will be no judicial review of the Authority's action on those arbitrators awards in grievance cases which are appealable to the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> We find this conference report to be consistent with the plain language of the statute: All final FLRA orders are appealable, except those relating to appropriate unit determinations and arbitration awards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Fifth Circuit argued by implication that since &#x00A7; 7111 "election decisions" were not mentioned in either the House or Senate bills, they were not appealable. Furthermore, it contended that the reference to "the private sector" and a statement by one of the bill's co-sponsors indicate that we should follow NLRB case law that any order during a representation proceeding is not a final order. <span class="Italic">See Justice</span>, 727 F.2d at 492. The Fifth Circuit's reading, however, ignores the consistency between the statutory language and the legislative history.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Fifth Circuit downplayed the plain meaning argument by characterizing it as "expressio unius est exclusio alterius." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 491. This canon of statutory construction means "the [expression] of one thing implies the exclusion of all the others." William N. Eskridge, Jr., <span class="Italic">The New Textualism</span>, 37 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 621, 664 (1990). The statute in this case does not by implication require excluding anything. Its plain language explicitly <span class="Italic">includes</span> everything within our judicial review, with two well-defined exceptions. The Fifth Circuit's opinion argued that the legislative history implies additional exceptions. We leave that task for Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Fifth Circuit's decision is distinguishable because it rested on a finding that ordering a second election is not a "final order" under &#x00A7; 7123. <span class="Italic">See Justice</span>, 727 F.2d at 493 ("With regard to the particular order here, it is especially clear that it is not final....&#8197;[S]etting aside the first election and directing a second election does not have any conclusive legal consequences nor does it finally determine any rights or obligations....&#8197;That matter is left to a second election and subsequent certification proceedings."). In contrast, the FLRA order in this case was a "final order." By dismissing Eisinger's petition on standing grounds, the FLRA precluded subsequent proceedings on the merits. Thus, unlike the Fifth Circuit's refusal to review an order of a second election, this order was final for the purposes of our jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7123.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, we have jurisdiction over this case because (1) the plain language of the statute clearly grants us jurisdiction over all final FLRA orders other than those under &#x00A7; 7112; (2) the FLRA's order addressed only standing under &#x00A7; 7111 and never reached the merits under &#x00A7; 7112; and (3) the statute's legislative history is inconsistent with its plain language.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The National Association of Agriculture Employees (NAAE) is a union that until recently represented federal agricultural inspectors stationed at the nation's borders and ports. NAAE challenges the FLRA's finding that the inspectors are not "professional employees" under the FSLMRS and consequently do not have the right to vote themselves into a professionals-only collective bargaining unit. We hold that the FLRA's professional status finding in this case was a component of an appropriate unit determination. Since &#x00A7; 7123(a)(2) precludes review of such determinations, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Factual and Procedural History</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA referred the matter to a regional director to conduct a hearing.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(e)(1). In a written decision, the regional director concluded that CBP's proposed units were appropriate, that NAAE's proposed agricultural employees units were not and that agricultural specialists are not professionals. The regional director accordingly scheduled an election for employees in the new CBP units to vote for a union representative and for professional employees to vote on whether they wanted to be included in the wall-to-wall unit with nonprofessionals. NAAE appealed the decision to the FLRA, which in a written opinion affirmed the regional director on all relevant grounds. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Homeland Sec. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection,</span> 61 F.L.R.A. No. 92, 2006 WL 297220 (Feb. 3, 2006). NAAE then filed a timely petition for review in this court pursuant to &#x00A7; 7123(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FSLMRS grants federal circuit courts jurisdiction to review final orders of the FLRA subject to two exceptions, one of which is relevant here:</p>

<p class="noindent-2">may...institute an action for judicial review of the Authority's order in the United States court of appeals in the circuit in which the person resides or transacts business.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a) (emphasis added). "The plain language of the statute clearly states that we have jurisdiction over all final orders from the FLRA, with one of the two exceptions being orders issued under &#x00A7; 7112." <span class="Italic">Eisinger v. FLRA,</span> 218 F.3d 1097, 1101 (9th Cir. 2000). The FLRA argues that its order in this case involved an appropriate unit determination and thus we lack jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7123(a)(2). We agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To resolve whether the FLRA's decision that agricultural specialists are not professionals is an "order under...section 7112...(involving an appropriate unit determination)," we look first to the text of the statute. <span class="Italic">See Eisinger,</span> 218 F.3d at 1102 ("[T]he plain meaning of the statute controls, and courts will look no further, unless its application leads to unreasonable or impracticable results." (citation omitted)). Section 7112 specifies two mandatory considerations for determining unit appropriateness. First, under &#x00A7; 7112(a), the FLRA is required to decide whether the proposed unit ensures "a clear and identifiable community of interest" and whether it "promote[s] effective dealings with, and efficiency of the operations of the agency involved." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(a); <span class="Italic">see also Dep't of the Navy, Navy Publ'ns and Printing Serv. Branch Office, Vallejo, Cal.,</span> 10 F.L.R.A. 659, 660 (1982) ("[I]n order to be found appropriate, a proposed unit must meet all three of the...criteria."). Second, under &#x00A7; 7112(b), the FLRA is absolutely prohibited from finding a unit appropriate if it includes certain classes of employees, such as managers, confidential employees and intelligence officers; and--relevant here--conditionally prohibited from combining professional employees with nonprofessionals. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b). Thus, in investigating unit appropriateness the FLRA "not only applies the criteria for determining appropriateness contained in section 7112(a)[&#8197;] but also ensures that the unit does not contain excluded categories of employees identified in section 7112(b)(1)-7112(b)(7)." <span class="Italic">Eisinger,</span> 218 F.3d at 1101-02 (quoting Robert T. Simmelkjaer, <span class="Italic">Representation and Election, in</span> Federal Civil Service Law and Procedures 213, 216 (Ellen M. Bussy ed., 1990)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to professional employees, &#x00A7; 7112 specifies that "[a] unit shall not be determined to be appropriate...if it includes...both professional employees and other employees, unless a majority of the professional employees vote for inclusion in the unit." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(5). Professional employees are therefore presumptively members of their own unit. That presumption is rebutted when the professionals vote to be included in a unit with nonprofessionals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statute defines professional employees at &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15) by listing four conjunctive criteria: advanced education, application of discretion, intellectual predominance and nonstandardization. If the employee's work meets all four of the criteria, the employee is a professional. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15). This definition applies only to the FSLMRS, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a), and the term is used only once in the statute, in &#x00A7; 7112(b)(5). The FLRA has accordingly remarked that "[t]he term ['professional employee'] is relevant primarily to the determination of appropriate bargaining units under section 7112." <span class="Italic">Int'l Fed. of Prof'l and Technical Eng'rs Local 25, </span>13 F.L.R.A. 433, 438 (1983) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 95-1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1978)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">From this statutory scheme we conclude that when the FLRA decides professional status it typically, if not always, does so as a necessary and integral component of an appropriate unit determination.[4] Employing the language of unit appropriateness, &#x00A7; 7112(b)(5) mandates that professional employees not be joined with nonprofessionals in a single unit without an opt-in vote. If professional status is contested in an appropriate unit determination proceeding, the FLRA is required by the statute to apply the four criteria listed in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15) to resolve the dispute. Its failure to do so would violate the statute by risking the joinder of professionals and nonprofessionals. In such a case, the FLRA's resolution of the employee's status is a required element of the appropriate unit determination and thus part of an "order under...section 7112." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;NAAE cites several FLRA decisions in which NAAE contends the FLRA decided professional status outside of an appropriate unit determination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of the Army U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, Los Angeles Dist.,</span> 56 F.L.R.A. 973 (2000);<span class="Italic"> U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr. Coatesville, PA,</span> 56 F.L.R.A. 966 (2000). We need not determine whether NAAE's characterization of these decisions, which involve very different circumstances, is correct. The only question before us is whether an FLRA professional status finding in circumstances such as those present here is part of an appropriate unit determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is such a case.&#x2003;This dispute arose in response to CBP's request for unit clarification under &#x00A7; 7111. The purpose of CBP's petition was to obtain the FLRA's approval of a new bargaining unit structure for CBP employees. One element of the new structure was the redesignation of agricultural specialists as nonprofessionals, thereby negating any need to give the specialists the opportunity to vote themselves into the wall-to-wall bargaining unit in which CBP placed them. When NAAE disputed the agricultural specialists' change in status, the FLRA was required to apply the &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15) criteria. NAAE's challenge was thus an attack on the appropriateness of CBP's proposed unit structure because, if NAAE had been right, CBP's unit would be, in the language of the statute, "not...appropriate." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b). By asking us to revisit and reverse the FLRA's professional status determination, NAAE asks us to do precisely what &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1) forbids: reverse the FLRA's appropriate unit determination. We therefore lack jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAAE argues that the FLRA's professional status ruling was not a component of its appropriate unit determination but instead an adjudication regarding a special right to self determination granted by &#x00A7; 7112(b)(5)--the right of professionals to cast a vote to determine for themselves which bargaining unit to join. We agree that professionals' ability to vote for unit assignment is properly characterized as a right. <span class="Italic">See Leedom v. Kyne, </span>358 U.S. 184, 189, 3 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1958) (characterizing as a "right" the voting privilege granted to a private sector professional employee under similar provisions of the NLRA). However it is a right given only to professionals, and the antecedent question of whether agricultural specialists are professionals was in this case a portion of the FLRA's appropriate unit determination. We lack jurisdiction to review that finding.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_2543"></span>[5]&#x2003;If, however, it were beyond dispute that agricultural specialists are professionals and the FLRA still denied them their right to vote, then NAAE could challenge the FLRA's denial in a federal district court under<span class="Italic"> Leedom. See Nat'l Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA,</span> 112 F.3d 402, 406 (9th Cir. 1997) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) ("If the FLRA acts 'in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific [statutory] prohibition,' district courts have jurisdiction[.]" (quoting<span class="Italic"> Leedom, </span>358 U.S. at 188)). NAAE does not contend that the <span class="Italic">Leedom </span>doctrine applies here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find similarly unavailing NAAE's argument that we have jurisdiction because CBP's petition was brought under &#x00A7; 7111 rather than &#x00A7; 7112. "Ordinarily, the investigation of a...petition under &#x00A7; 7111 results in an appropriate unit determination under &#x00A7; 7112." <span class="Italic">Eisinger, </span>218 F.3d at 1102. In fact, it is the "atypical case where a [clarification of unit] petition filed under &#x00A7; 7111 does not implicate &#x00A7; 7112." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This is not the atypical case. Rather, CBP's initial petition for unit clarification asked the FLRA "to exercise its Authority under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7105(a)(2), 7111(b) <span class="Italic">and 7112</span> to determine the appropriate bargaining units...within CBP." (emphasis added). It is undisputed that, in response to the petition, the FLRA made an appropriate unit determination. It is therefore of no moment that the petition was filed pursuant to &#x00A7; 7111. We also reject NAAE's claim that the FLRA's ruling was made under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15), which defines "professional employee." Section 7112(b) incorporates the criteria listed in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15). Thus when the FLRA applied those criteria in this case it was doing so as a part of its appropriate unit determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we hold that where, as here, the FLRA makes an appropriate unit determination and in doing so adjudicates an employee's professional status to satisfy itself that the units selected are appropriate, we lack jurisdiction to review that status finding.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;We do not reach whether the FLRA's unit determination might be reviewed indirectly through an appeal from an unfair labor practice charge. <span class="Italic">See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Inc. v. FLRA,</span> 350 U.S. App. D.C. 238, 283 F.3d 339, 342 (D.C. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Twin City Hospital Corp. v. NLRB,</span> 889 F.2d 1557, 1559 &#x0026; n.2 (6th Cir. 1989) (stating in the context of parallel provisions of the NLRA that a professional status determination was reviewable in this manner).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">ACT v. FLRA</span>, 283 F.3d 339, 340-42 (D.C. Cir. 2002), rejected an argument that review of a unit determination issue could be obtained in district court under the Administrative Procedure Act, subject to further review in an appellate court:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case presents a straightforward question of statutory interpretation: Does the statute that gives federal courts of appeals jurisdiction to review decisions of the Federal Labor Relations Authority "other than...order[s]...involving an appropriate unit determination," leave district courts free to review such determinations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act? Answering no, we affirm the district court's dismissal of this challenge to an appropriate unit determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case began when the Association filed a petition with the Federal Labor Relations Authority seeking to have dual status technician bargaining units consolidated into a single, national unit. The Federal Labor Relations Act (FLRA) directs the Authority to determine whether unit determination petitions are "appropriate," based on such factors as whether the determination "will ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit and will promote effective dealings with, and efficiency of the operations of the agency involved." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(a). Applying these standards, the Authority's Regional Director denied the petition. On review, the Authority acknowledged that some evidence--particularly the "interchange" of technicians among State Guards--supported the appropriateness of the proposed national unit. The Authority, however, affirmed the Regional Director's conclusion that more evidence justified maintaining state-based units: Each National Guard state unit has "an individual mission unique to its state or territory"; the NGTA invests Adjutants General with "overall authority over all personnel and labor relations matters in their respective State Activities"; and national collective bargaining would be ineffective because "authority over the day-to-day employment of the technicians...is designated by statute to the states." The Association urged the Authority to consider the increased bargaining rights that consolidation would purportedly bring to union members, but the agency declined to do so, agreeing with the Regional Director that the statutory obligation to "ensure employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed under this chapter," <span class="Italic">id.</span>, applies only to units already determined to be appropriate. On the basis of this analysis, the Authority denied the petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Invoking section 702 of the Administrative Procedure Act--"[a] person...aggrieved by agency action...is entitled to judicial review thereof," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 702--the Association sued the Authority in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, arguing that the unit determination was "arbitrary [and] capricious," i<span class="Italic">d</span>. &#x00A7; 706(a)(2)(A). The district court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, relying on FLRA section 7123: "Any person aggrieved by any final order of the [Federal Labor Relations] Authority <span class="Italic">other than an order under...section 7112 of this title (involving an appropriate unit determination)</span>, may...institute an action for judicial review of the Authority's order in the [appropriate] United States court of appeals<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7123(a) (emphasis added). The district court concluded that this exception deprives not just courts of appeals, but all federal courts, of jurisdiction to review appropriate unit determinations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Association appeals.&#x2003;Our review is <span class="Italic">de novo. Nat'l Taxpayers Union v. United States</span>, 68 F.3d 1428, 1432 (D.C. Cir. 1995) ("In a case...involving a District Court's dismissal of a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, our standard of review is <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding eighty-two pages of briefing, this case is not difficult. FLRA section 7123 gives courts of appeals jurisdiction to review Authority decisions "other than...order[s] under...section 7112 of this title (involving an appropriate unit determination)." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a). The APA expressly provides that its general review provisions, pursuant to which the Association filed this suit, do not apply where "statutes preclude judicial review<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. &#x00A7; 701(a)(1); <span class="Italic">cf</span>.<span class="Italic"> id</span>. &#x00A7; 702 ("Nothing herein...confers authority to grant relief if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief...sought."). Because FLRA section 7123 "precludes judicial review" of appropriate unit determinations, the district court properly held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pointing out that FLRA section 7123 mentions only "courts of appeals," the Association insists that the provision does not bar district courts from reviewing appropriate unit determinations. Like the district court, we disagree. We cannot imagine that Congress, having vested in courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to review all Authority decisions except those relating to appropriate unit determinations, would have intended that such determinations could nevertheless be reviewed by district courts<span class="Italic">. See Columbia Power Trades Council v. United States Dep't of Energy</span>, 671 F.2d 325, 327 (9th Cir. 1982) ("At no point does the Act entitle a party to petition a district court for relief. Given the broad purpose of the Act[,]...and the limited role of the judiciary in this statutory scheme, it is manifestly the expressed desire of Congress to create an exclusive statutory scheme.") (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although FLRA section 7123's clarity makes resort to legislative history unnecessary, we think it worth noting that the Joint Committee Report on the bill that became the FLRA declared: "As in the private sector, there will be no judicial review of the Authority's determination of the appropriateness of bargaining units." H.R. Rep. No. 95-1717, at 153 (1978). The Report does not say that there will be "no circuit court review"; it says there will be "no judicial review." Moreover, the Joint Committee's comparison to the "private sector" demonstrates that Congress had in mind a review scheme identical to the NLRB's, and the Supreme Court has determined that the National Labor Relations Act's preclusion of direct court of appeals review of certain matters also bars district court APA review<span class="Italic">. See NLRB v. United Food &#x0026; Commercial Workers Union, Local 23</span>, 484 U.S. 112, 133 (1987). "It would be absurd," the Supreme Court declared, to allow district court review of settlement determinations when the NLRA expressly precludes direct review of such determinations in courts of appeals<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In holding that FLRA section 7123 precludes direct review of Authority appropriate unit determinations, we emphasize that the Association remains free to obtain indirect judicial review by refusing to bargain, drawing an unfair labor practice charge, and appealing that charge to the Authority and then to a court of appeals<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Dep't of Energy v. FLRA</span>, 880 F.2d 1163, 1163-65, 1164 n.3 (10th Cir. 1989) (reviewing the Authority's unit determination in the context of an unfair labor practice proceeding). It is in this way, as the Joint Committee indicated, <span class="Italic">see supra </span>at 4-5, that the FLRA parallels the NLRA. The Association claims that the existence of this indirect method of review implies that direct review should be available as well, but we rejected a virtually identical argument in <span class="Italic">Physicians National House Staff Ass'n v. Fanning</span>, where a union sought APA review of an NLRB denial of a certification petition. 642 F.2d 492, 495 (D.C. Cir. 1980). Pointing out that the denial occurred in the course of an unreviewable representation proceeding, we rejected the union's argument that the district court nevertheless had jurisdiction because the union's only other means of review was through an onerous unfair labor practice proceeding. Our analysis in <span class="Italic">Fanning </span>applies here as well:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[I]t may be unlikely that the correctness of these decisions may be tested in an unfair labor practice proceeding reviewable in a court of appeals, but we think this is not a reason to permit District Court review. Congress has considered the likelihood that some Board decisions in representation proceedings may evade all judicial review. Nevertheless, it has rejected attempts to provide review in such cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 499....</p>
<p class="noindent">Indirect review of unit determination matters through lawsuits filed in district court was again rejected, <span class="Italic">AFGE v. Loy</span>, 367 F.3d 932, 933-37 (2004) (not reaching a constitutional issue):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2544"></span>A union wishing to become the bargaining representative of newly-federalized airport screeners initiated two proceedings, one administrative, the other judicial. The administrative action sought to have the Federal Labor Relations Authority order representation elections. The other action sought a judgment from the district court that the screeners had the right to engage in collective bargaining. The FLRA rejected the union's petition. The district court dismissed the complaint. The question in this appeal is whether the district court had jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the events of September 11, 2001, Congress enacted the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, Pub. L. No. 107-71, 115 Stat. 597 (2001), creating a federal workforce to screen passengers and cargo at commercial airports. Section 111(d) of the Security Act, 115 Stat. 620, <span class="Italic">codified at</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935 note, provides that "[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security may employ, appoint, discipline, terminate, and fix the compensation, terms, and conditions of employment of Federal service for [federally employed security screeners]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thereafter, the American Federation of Government Employees filed several petitions with the Federal Labor Relations Authority, seeking elections among security screeners at a number of airports and certification as the screeners' exclusive representative for collective bargaining. On January 8, 2003, Under Secretary James M. Loy issued a directive stating that, "[b]y virtue of the authority vested in the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security in Section 111(d)," federally employed security screeners "shall not, as a term or condition of their employment, be entitled to engage in collective bargaining or be represented for the purpose of engaging in such bargaining by any representative or organization." The next day, the Transportation Security Administration filed its response to the union's petitions. The Administration's main contention was that the FLRA could not order representation elections in view of &#x00A7; 111(d) and Loy's directive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One day later the union filed a complaint in the district court seeking an injunction and a declaratory judgment on the ground that Loy "did not have the statutory authority to issue the directive" and that the directive was "arbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706." The union also challenged the directive on constitutional grounds, asserting that it "deprives affected federal employees of their right to free speech and association under the First Amendment and to equal protection under the Fifth Amendment" to the Constitution.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the case was pending before the district court, the FLRA's Regional Director ruled that &#x00A7; 111(d) of the Security Act and the Loy directive relieved the Transportation Security Administration of any "duty to bargain over conditions of employment of security screeners."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court later dismissed the union's statutory claims, holding that the "FLRA has exclusive authority over conducting elections to determine whether a labor union has the support of a majority of employees in an appropriate unit" and that the "petitions for elections and the TSA objection that the Loy Determination deprives FLRA of jurisdiction to conduct any election are...properly before that agency," not the court. 281 F. Supp.2d 59, 62 (D.D.C. 2003). As to the constitutional claims, the court took note of the union's failure to raise these before the FLRA<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 64. Finding the claims insubstantial, the court dismissed this portion of the complaint for failure to state a cause of action<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 66.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the meantime the FLRA affirmed the Regional Director's decision dismissing the union's petitions<span class="Italic">. United States Dep't of Homeland Security, et al. and AFGE, AFL-CIO,</span> 59 F.L.R.A. No. 63, 2003 WL 22669101 (Nov. 4, 2003). The FLRA agreed that &#x00A7; 111(d) granted "unfettered discretion to the [Under Secretary] to determine the terms and conditions of employment for [federal] screener personnel," and that the Loy directive validly barred the screeners from engaging in collective bargaining<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at *13. Therefore, the union's "petitions could not be processed" because the FLRA had no authority to conduct elections<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at *7. The FLRA refused to consider the union's constitutional arguments because these were not properly raised before the Regional Director<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at *13. The union did not seek judicial review of the FLRA's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-7134, governs labor relations between federal agencies and their employees. One of the FLRA's exclusive functions is to conduct "elections to determine whether a labor organization has been selected as an exclusive representative by a majority of the [federal] employees in an appropriate unit," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(B). A union may file a petition with the FLRA alleging that 30 percent or more of the employees in an appropriate unit want the union to represent them in collective bargaining. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b)(1)(A). The FLRA "shall investigate" such a petition and, if it finds that "a question of representation exists," it shall conduct or supervise an election after determining who is eligible to vote. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b)(1)(A) &#x0026; (d). Any person aggrieved by a "final order" of the FLRA, other than an order under &#x00A7; 7112 (unit determination) or &#x00A7; 7122 (arbitration award), may seek review in the court of appeals. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an FLRA order falls within one of &#x00A7; 7123(a)'s two exceptions to review in the court of appeals, this does not mean the district courts are open. It means that review is precluded in any court<span class="Italic">. Ass'n of Civilian Technicians v. FLRA,</span> 283 F.3d 339 (D.C. Cir. 2002). On the other hand, if an FLRA order is not within either exception and is "final," it may be reviewed only by a court of appeals. The district courts do not have concurrent jurisdiction over matters within the exclusive purview of the FLRA<span class="Italic">. Karahalios v. Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Employees,</span> 489 U.S. 527, 533, 109 S. Ct. 1282, 1286-87, 103 L. Ed.2d 539 (1989); <span class="Italic">see United States v. Fausto,</span> 484 U.S. 439, 445, 108 S. Ct. 668, 672-73, 98 L. Ed.2d 830 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union thinks it was entitled to sue in district court because this court could not review the FLRA's refusal to order representational elections. The FLRA rendered its decision under &#x00A7; 7111. Citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice v. FLRA,</span> 727 F.2d 481 (5th Cir. 1984), the union states that FLRA rulings under &#x00A7; 7111 are unreviewable. That reads too much into the opinion. The question before the Fifth Circuit was whether an FLRA order requiring a rerun election pursuant to &#x00A7; 7111 was a "final order" under &#x00A7; 7123(a). The court held no because the FLRA had not finally determined if a particular union would represent the employees. 727 F.2d at 493.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The order here is of a different sort.&#x2003;The FLRA's decision that the screeners could not engage in collective bargaining, and thus were not entitled to union representation, was final in every sense of the word, as counsel for the union admitted at oral argument. We will have a few more words to say on this subject when we discuss the union's constitutional claims. As to the union's statutory claims, it is enough to point out that the district court's jurisdiction did not turn on the presence or absence of our jurisdiction. We cannot review an FLRA unit determination, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)(2), but that does not mean a district court may<span class="Italic">. Ass'n of Civilian Technicians,</span> 283 F.3d at 340. What matters is whether the union's claim--that the screeners had the right to engage in collective bargaining--was "arguably" within the FLRA's authority to decide<span class="Italic">. See American Foreign Serv. Ass'n v.</span> <span class="Italic">Baker,</span> 895 F.2d 1460, 1462 (D.C. Cir. 1990). On that score there is no doubt. The union must have thought as much when it filed its election petitions. Title VII gives the FLRA, and the FLRA alone, the authority to order elections so that federal employees may decide who, if anyone, will become their exclusive bargaining representative. In investigating a &#x00A7; 7111 petition the FLRA necessarily must determine that the employees are entitled to engage in collective bargaining. Sometimes the determination will be made in the context of a unit determination. Employees engaged in "security work which directly affects national security," for instance, cannot be part of a bargaining unit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). Here the FLRA, acting under &#x00A7; 7111, never reached the unit question. It ruled instead that the Security Act plus the Loy directive foreclosed collective bargaining for all federally-employed airport screeners and thus precluded representation elections. We do not say the FLRA was correct. That issue is not properly before us. We do say the FLRA had the exclusive authority to render judgment on the question, subject to review only in a court of appeals pursuant to &#x00A7; 7123.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Citing <span class="Italic">Aid Ass'n for Lutherans v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 321 F.3d 1166 (D.C. Cir. 2003), the union argues that even if a statute precluded judicial review of the legality of the Loy directive, this would not deprive the district court of jurisdiction to decide whether Loy acted <span class="Italic">ultra vires</span>. The short answer is that no statute precludes judicial review of the union's claims in this regard. Review may be had, but it must be in the court of appeals and it may occur only after the claim has been presented to and finally decided by the FLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We therefore agree with the district court that it did not have jurisdiction over the union's complaint. The district court nevertheless went ahead and rejected the union's constitutional claims that the employees had a First Amendment right to engage in collective bargaining and that the Loy directive violated the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. We think the court should also have dismissed these claims for lack of jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See Sturm, Ruger &#x0026; Co. v. Chao,</span> 300 F.3d 867, 877 (D.C. Cir. 2002). Parties may not bifurcate their case, pursuing only statutory claims before the FLRA while litigating closely related constitutional claims in the district court<span class="Italic">. NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 986 F.2d 537, 539-40 (D.C. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Steadman v. Governor, U.S. Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home,</span> 918 F.2d 963, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1990). That the union did not present its constitutional claims to the FLRA Regional Director is no reason for allowing it to litigate those claims in the district court. To hold otherwise would be to excuse non-compliance with the requirement that one must exhaust administrative remedies on the basis that the party failed to comply<span class="Italic">. See Steadman,</span> 918 F.2d at 968.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The cases just cited, and analogous cases concerning constitutional claims raised in administrative proceedings, <span class="Italic">see Shalala v. Illinois Council on Long Term Care, Inc.,</span> 529 U.S. 1, 24, 120 S. Ct. 1084, 1099, 146 L. Ed.2d 1 (2000), and <span class="Italic">Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich,</span> 510 U.S. 200, 214, 114 S. Ct. 771, 779-80, 127 L. Ed.2d 29 (1994), assume that there can be judicial review of the agency's decision. Citing <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians,</span> 476 U.S. 667, 681 n.12, 106 S. Ct. 2133, 1241 n.12, 90 L. Ed.2d 623 (1986), the Court in <span class="Italic">Thunder Basin</span> dropped a footnote stating that there would <span id="page_2545"></span>be a serious constitutional question "if an agency statute were construed to preclude all judicial review of a constitutional claim." 510 U.S. at 215 n.20, 114 S. Ct. at 780 n.20. Avoiding that constitutional question might have been an additional factor in favor of finding the FLRA's dismissal of the union's petitions a "final order" within &#x00A7; 7123(a), and thus subject to judicial review in this court if the union had raised its First and Fifth Amendment claims in the agency proceedings. But according to the FLRA, the union's constitutional claims were not properly before it and the union never sought judicial review. At any rate, to decide that the district court had jurisdiction over the union's constitutional claims we would--at the least--have to assume that the FLRA's decision on them would have been unreviewable. That assumption would be unwarranted for the reasons we have given.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court's judgment dismissing the complaint is affirmed on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAAE and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 61 FLRA 545 (2006), [discussed in Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-10-134.html#sec2-135">Stays of Representation Proceedings</a>"] addressed the criteria applied by FLRA to an application for a stay of representation proceedings pending judicial review sought by a labor union.</p>
