<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-286"><span class="space">c.</span> Circumstantial Evidence; Statistics</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Circumstantial evidence is properly evaluated in a USERRA claim, <span class="Italic">Skellham v. USPS</span>, 90 MSPR 361, 366 &#x00B6; 11 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n appropriate circumstances, a trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of an explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose. <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc</span>., 530 U.S. 133, 147, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed.2d 105 (2000). Such an inference is consistent with the general principle of evidence law that the factfinder is entitled to consider a party's dishonesty about a material fact as "affirmative evidence of guilt." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001), circumstantial evidence of discrimination under USERRA includes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...a variety of factors, including proximity in time between the employee's military activity and the adverse employment action, inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee's military activity, and disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sharpe v. DOJ</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/17-2356.Opinion.3-1-2019.pdf">916 F.3d 1376, 1380</a> (Fed. Cir. 2019), observed that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[D]iscrimination is seldom open or notorious," <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014, and "employers rarely concede an improper motivation for their employment actions," <span class="Italic">McMillan v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 812 F.3d 1364, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Rather, discrimination tends to be "inferred" from evidence of "hostility" or "disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses." <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014. Because Mr. Sharpe sought to introduce the Tomaski email and question SAIC Sherman about it to support an inference that his non-selections resulted from SAIC Sherman's hostility towards reservists, the MSPB abused its discretion in excluding it as irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gossage v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 118 MSPR 455, 460-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12, 2012 MSPB 97 (2012), remanded a case for hearing, outlining possible sources of circumstantial evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleged that he served in the Department of the Army on active duty from 1971 until 1974 and that the agency did not select him for the Industrial Hygienist position in September 2000. He further alleged that the agency discriminated against him in part due to his status as a disabled veteran and that the agency violated his rights as a veteran and his veterans' preference rights when he was not selected for the Industrial Hygienist position. Specifically, the appellant alleged that the agency interviewed a lower-scoring nonveteran and offered that nonveteran the position prior to interviewing him for it, and ultimately did not select him despite his veterans' preference rights in violation of USERRA. Based upon these assertions, we find the appellant meets the jurisdictional requirements under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a). <span class="Italic">See Dale v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 15 (2006) (the appellant raised a nonfrivolous claim of jurisdiction under USERRA when he claimed that the agency offered the appointment to a vacant position to a nonveteran who should have been ranked lower than him during the selection process); <span class="Italic">Gaston</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 411, &#x00B6; 8 (the appellant raised a nonfrivolous claim of jurisdiction under USERRA where he claimed that his veterans' preference should have placed him ahead of the other candidates and that a nonveteran was selected over him).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because jurisdiction has been established, the appellant is entitled to the hearing he sought. <span class="Italic">See Downs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 139, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18. On remand, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that his military status was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the agency's decision to deny him employment. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan v.

Discriminatory motivation under USERRA may be reasonably inferred from such circumstantial evidence as temporal proximity between the appellant's military activity and the adverse employment action, "inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the [individual's] military activity, and disparate treatment of certain [individuals] compared to other [individuals] with similar work records or offenses." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the appellant meets his burden, the burden shifts to the agency to prove that legitimate reasons, standing alone, would have induced it to take the same action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Duncan v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 86, 90-95 (1997), modified by <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, emphasized the considerable expansion of Board jurisdiction in cases involving claims of deprivation or diminution of employment benefits because of military service. <span class="Italic">Duncan</span> also explained that an appellant may support a USERRA claim through direct evidence, or through indirect evidence by establishing membership in the protected group, by showing disparate treatment in comparison to another individual not in the protected group, and by proving as pretextual <span id="Page_484"></span>any legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason articulated for the challenged action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We have recently addressed the issue of the scope of our jurisdiction under USERRA. <span class="Italic">See Petersen v. Dept. of the Interior</span>, 71 MSPR 227, 231-40 (1996). USERRA, Pub. L. No. 103-353, 1994 USCCAN (108 Stat.) 3149, enacted on October 13, 1994, replaced the existing provisions of chapter 43 of title 38 of the United States Code regarding the employment rights of military veterans returning to civilian service. Among other provisions, USERRA protects veterans against discrimination in employment on account of their prior military service. Specifically, 38 USC 4311(a) now provides in relevant part that "[a] person who...has performed...service in a uniformed service shall not be denied...<span class="Italic">initial employment</span> [or] <span class="Italic">reemployment</span>...by an employer on the basis of that...performance of service...." (Emphasis supplied). USERRA applies to employment in the federal government. <span class="Italic">See Petersen</span>, 71 MSPR at 232.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The USERRA provision on reemployment rights (38 USC 4312) does not apply here because it addresses a person's absence from a position of employment due to military service and his later application for reemployment. The appellant here, by contrast, left his position not by reason of military service but because of his disability retirement. The USERRA provisions on initial requests for employment [38 USC 4311(a), (b)] thus govern here instead....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA provides remedial procedures for employees of executive agencies under 38 USC 4322 and 4324. It allows an individual to seek assistance from the Secretary of Labor and also, upon the Secretary's referral, from the Office of the Special Counsel with respect to alleged noncompliance with the provisions of USERRA. After exhausting one or both of these administrative remedies, an individual may also file a complaint against an executive agency with the Board; in addition, an individual may file a complaint directly with the Board without first pursuing remedies with the Secretary of Labor and/or the Office of the Special Counsel. <span class="Italic">See Petersen</span>, 71 MSPR at 232-33. The appellant did not file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor or the Office of the Special Counsel but instead filed an appeal with the Board directly regarding the agency's denial of his requests for reemployment. The questions to be decided, then, are whether the appeal was timely filed and whether the appellant has properly stated a claim of a violation of USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found in <span class="Italic">Petersen</span>, 71 MSPR at 234, that cases properly brought under USERRA fall within the Board's appellate jurisdiction, and the question here thus is whether this appeal has properly stated a claim of a violation of USERRA. We find that it has. The applicable USERRA provision states that the Board shall adjudicate "any complaint" brought before it. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC 4324(c). In describing elsewhere when a person may file a "complaint," another USERRA provision states that such person may do so if he "claims" that he is entitled to USERRA rights and that an employer has failed or refused, or is about to fail or refuse, to accord him those rights<span class="Italic">. See</span> 38 USC 4322(a). The language of the statute suggests that the Board may consider a general claim by an employee that an employer denied him rights guaranteed under USERRA. That conclusion is bolstered by the discussion in <span class="Italic">Petersen</span> of the legislative history of USERRA, which shows that Congress intended it (and had intended its predecessors) to be broadly construed and strictly enforced. <span class="Italic">See</span> 71 MSPR at 235-36 &#x0026; n.8, 239.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this respect, then, a nonfrivolous allegation under USERRA may be compared to a nonfrivolous allegation of discrimination under Title VII rather than to a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction over an allegedly involuntary resignation or retirement, and we analyze an appellant's claim of a violation of USERRA accordingly. <span class="Italic">See Crawford v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 416, 420-24 (1996) (an appellant's right to present evidence on any discrimination claim is of cardinal importance, and his claim should be broadly and liberally construed in determining whether it is nonfrivolous); <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329-30 (1994) (a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction must include specific factual assertions underlying the jurisdictional claim). An allegation that an appellant's employer took or failed to take various actions based on his status as a veteran, in violation of the protections guaranteed under USERRA, thus would constitute a nonfrivolous allegation entitling him to Board consideration of his USERRA claim. The relative weakness of the specific factual allegations initially made by an appellant in his USERRA claim thus should not serve as a basis for dismissing them for lack of jurisdiction; if he fails to develop those allegations, his USERRA claim should simply be denied on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA prohibits an employer from denying an individual employment because of his prior military service, and the appellant here claimed that the agency refused to employ him because of his military service from 1968-70 and from 1975-80. If the appellant is able to prove this allegation, he will have established a violation of USERRA; based on this nonfrivolous allegation, then, the appeal was properly brought under USERRA. <span class="Italic">See Petersen</span>, 71 MSPR at 235-37. The appeal therefore must be remanded to the field office for adjudication on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties' burdens of proof and production in a discrimination claim under USERRA are set forth in 38 USC 4311(b) as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employer shall be considered to have denied a person...reemployment...in violation of this section if the person's...service, or obligation for service in the uniformed services is a motivating factor in the employer's action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such...performance of service,...or obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found in <span class="Italic">Petersen</span> that, in enacting section 4311(b), Congress clearly rejected the concept that prior military service must be the sole factor motivating an employer's alleged discriminatory conduct. On remand, then, the appellant only had to show by preponderant evidence that the prior service was a substantial or a motivating factor. <span class="Italic">See Petersen</span>, 71 MSPR at 239-40. If the appellant met that burden on remand, he was entitled to prevail unless the agency could show that it would have taken the same action even if, hypothetically, it had not been motivated by a desire to punish the appellant because of the prior military service. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 240.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Petersen</span>, the appellant alleged that direct evidence of discrimination existed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 71 MSPR at 235. He contended that agency employees had made derogatory comments about his status as a disabled veteran and had belittled him and other veterans; more specifically, he asserted that he had been called various names such as "psycho," "baby killer," and "plate head." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. In analyzing that discrimination claim, the Board prescribed the standard of review discussed above after reviewing the relevant legislative history. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 239-40. On remand, then, if the appellant wishes to support his claim of a violation of USERRA through the use of direct evidence as in <span class="Italic">Petersen</span>, the administrative judge shall analyze his claim in accordance with that standard of review. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, the appellant could try to prove the agency's discriminatory intent more indirectly by showing that such intent could be inferred from relevant circumstantial evidence that he would submit on remand. If the administrative judge has to consider such a claim, he should apply analogous burdens of proof and production under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for analyzing discrimination claims based on circumstantial evidence. Where an appellant has sought to establish a claim of prohibited employment discrimination through the use of such evidence, we have held that the appellant must first establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by showing that: (1) He was a member of a protected group; (2) he was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of his protected group; and (3) he was treated more harshly or disparately than the individual who was not a member of his protected group. <span class="Italic">See Coleman v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 498, 508 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1165 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden of going forward then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action; it meets that burden when it introduces evidence which, if taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for its action, regardless of whether the agency actually proves that reason. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The appellant then has to show by preponderant evidence that the agency's stated reason is merely a pretext for prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In this regard, the appellant must actually show both that the stated reason was not the real reason for the action and that discrimination was the real reason for the action<span class="Italic">. See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, as discussed above, it is undisputed that the appellant is entitled to the protection of USERRA based on his prior military service. If he wishes to establish his claim of discrimination on remand through the use of circumstantial evidence, however, he must also establish the other two elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, i.e., that the agency treated him more harshly or disparately in denying his request for employment as compared to a similarly situated individual who lacked such prior military service. <span class="Italic">See Coleman</span>, 66 MSPR at 508. The burden then would shift to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its denial of that request, and the appellant then would have to show that this reason was merely a pretext for discriminating against him based on his prior military service. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge thus must first determine on remand what method of proof the appellant wishes to use in supporting his claim that the agency discriminated against him in violation of USERRA. Based on that determination, he shall afford the parties the opportunity to develop the record more fully, and he shall then make findings on the appellant's USERRA discrimination claim under the relevant burdens of proof and production discussed above.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Roberson v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 569, 572-73 (1998), summarized the <span class="Italic">Duncan</span> analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Duncan</span>, 73 MSPR at 93-94, the Board held that, if an appellant supports his claim of a violation of USERRA through the use of direct evidence of discriminatory intent, the administrative judge shall analyze his claim in accordance with the USERRA standard of review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 4311(b); <span class="Italic">Jasper,</span> 73 MSPR at 37071; <span class="Italic">Petersen</span>, 71 MSPR at 239-40. On the <span id="Page_485"></span>other hand, if an appellant supports his claim more indirectly by showing that discriminatory intent could be inferred from relevant circumstantial evidence, the administrative judge should apply analogous burdens of proof and production under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for analyzing discrimination claims based on circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Duncan</span>, 73 MSPR at 93-94; <span class="Italic">see Coleman v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 66 MSPR 498, 508 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 79 F.3d 1165 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table); <span class="Italic">see also Decker v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 40 MSPR 119, 132 (1989) (application of Title VII burdens of proof and production to an age discrimination case); <span class="Italic">Stalkfleet v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 6 MSPB 536, 6 MSPR 637, 646-48 (1981) (use of Title VII burdens of proof and production in a disability discrimination case).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, if the appeal is ripe for adjudication, the administrative judge must determine what method of proof the appellant wishes to use in supporting his claim that the agency discriminated against him in violation of USERRA. Based on that determination, he shall afford the parties the opportunity to develop the record more fully, and he shall then make findings on the appellant's USERRA discrimination claim under the relevant method of proof.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Dept. of Army</span>, 254 Fed. Appx. 814, 817-18 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), considered motivational and circumstantial evidence in a VEOA case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to whether the committee members committed errors in evaluating his application, he is not entitled to relief simply upon showing that the selection process was flawed. Even if he could show that he was the best candidate and should have been selected but for evaluation mistakes made by the committee, his claim under USERRA would not succeed unless he could show that those errors were motivated by animus against him based on his prior military service. USERRA ensures, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that an employer will not discriminate against an applicant "on the basis of...performance of [military] service." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a). That is, a veteran is entitled to relief under USERRA if the veteran can show that his military service was "a motivating factor in the employer's action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such [service]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 4311(c)(1). The key element of a claim under USERRA thus is discrimination on the basis of military service; it is not enough to show simply that the claimant is a veteran and should have been selected for a particular position, but was not. To be sure, the prohibited discrimination can be proved by circumstantial evidence. Therefore, evidence such as the failure to select a veteran who was plainly qualified may help support a claim of discrimination, but it is not by itself sufficient to satisfy USERRA. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 240 F.3d 1009, 1013-14 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board's administrative judge heard testimony from Mr. Burroughs and from all three members of the screening committee, as well as from an agency human relations officer. Based on that evidence, the administrative judge found that the committee members' explanations for their decision not to forward Mr. Burroughs' name to the selection committee were credible; for that reason, the administrative judge rejected Mr. Burroughs' assertions that the selection committee's true motivation was to discriminate against Mr. Burroughs based on his status as a veteran and that his prior military service was the true reason he was not hired. In making that determination, the administrative judge was properly focused on the legal issue raised by Mr. Burroughs' USERRA appeal. Because there is nothing in the record to suggest anti-veteran animus on the part of the screening committee in particular, and the agency as a whole--other than the fact that Mr. Burroughs was not referred to the selection committee and ultimately selected--we hold that the administrative judge's finding that Mr. Burroughs failed to prove a violation of USERRA is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Burroughs' second argument is that the selection process effectively denied him the benefit of the veterans' preference to which he was entitled. The problem with that argument is that claims regarding the improper crediting of the veterans' preference are properly raised under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act ("VEOA"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a. Such claims are not within the reach of USERRA, except to the extent that the denial of veterans' preference credit to which an applicant is entitled may be some evidence of anti-veteran animus. Except in that respect, USERRA is not directed at enforcing the rights of veterans to be given preference over non-veterans. <span class="Italic">See Gaston v. Peace Corps,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 411, 413 (2005) ("USERRA does not provide that veterans will be treated better than non-veterans."); <span class="Italic">Fahrenbacher v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 500, 510 (2000) (stating, in response to the argument that the failure to afford the appellants veterans' preference shows discrimination: "To establish discrimination, the appellants must show that they were treated more harshly than non-veterans. The fact that they were not treated better than non-veterans does not show discrimination."), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Sheehan v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 240 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kitlinski v. DOJ,</span> SF-4324-14-0184-I-2 (NP 11/3/2015) (aff'd in part, vacated in part, remanded on another issue, <span class="Italic">Kitlinski v. MSPB</span>, 857 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2017), <span class="Italic">following remand, Kitlinski v. DOJ</span>, 2023 MSPB 13 (2023)), concluded that circumstantial evidence was insufficient to demonstrate a USERRA violation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that two separate comments made during the Career Board's meetings in September 2012, and May 2013, demonstrate the agency's military bias. In both instances, someone present at the Career Board's meetings commented about the appellant's active duty status with the U.S. Coast Guard, in one instance rhetorically asking whether he would receive an extension of his U.S. Coast Guard assignment if he did not receive a transfer within the agency and, in the other, posing the question of whether he believed he worked for the agency or the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although these comments reflect that the appellant's active duty status with the U.S. Coast Guard was discussed at the Career Board meeting, we agree with the administrative judge that these comments do not demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that his military service factored into the agency's denials of his transfer requests. <span class="Italic">See McMillan v. Department of Justice</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 20 (2013). Importantly, these comments are unrelated to the agency's actual denials of his transfer requests, and they are not probative of whether his military service was "one of the reasons for [the agency's] decision." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Escher v. BWXT Y-12, LLC</span>, 627 F.3d 1020, 1026 (6th Cir. 2010)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge, moreover, that the comment made during the September 2012 Career Board meeting is countermanded by the statements of another Career Board member who stressed the importance of considering the appellant's transfer request in a fair manner, but explained that the appellant could not be transferred to headquarters because he lacked 4 years of supervisory field experience. The Board will consider all the evidence when assessing whether the appellant has proven that his protected military status motivated the agency's conduct. <span class="Italic">See McMillan,</span> 120 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 20. Such a holistic view of the Career Board's September 2012 deliberations reflects that the appellant's military status was not part of the agency's underlying rationale for denying his September 2012 request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the second comment referencing the appellant's military service, which was recorded during the Career Board's May 15, 2013 meeting, the appellant has failed to establish who made this comment and to what extent, if any, this comment influenced the Career Board's denial of the appellant's last two transfer requests. Such an absence of proof is fatal to the appellant's burden of demonstrating that his military service was a motivating factor in the agency's denial of his transfer requests.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We further agree with the administrative judge that the agency presented sufficient evidence that it would have denied his last three transfer requests based upon its policy that generally restricted supervisory transfers to headquarters until an employee had accrued 4 years of supervisory service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that these comments are not direct evidence of military bias. Generally, direct evidence of discrimination is any statement made by an employer that (1) reflects directly the alleged discriminatory attitude, and (2) bears directly on the contested employment decision. <span class="Italic">See Arredondo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 113, &#x00B6; 13 (2000). Even assuming that these comments directly reflect a discriminatory attitude toward the appellant based on his military service, we find neither comment bears directly on the contested transfer denials at issue, and that the agency has further presented preponderant evidence that it would have denied his requests even in the absence of his military service pursuant to its policies governing transfers to supervisory positions at its headquarters.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Jones v. DHHS</span>, 718 Fed. Appx. 958, 961 (Fed.

We see no reason to disturb the Board's determination that HRSA's subject matter experts credibly testified that they did not consider Mr. Jones's military service or his prior USERRA claims in their decision that he was not qualified for the position. We also see no error in the Board's determination that HRSA's experts credibly testified that they were unaware of any hostility toward military service members within HHS. Moreover, we agree with the Board that the fact that HRSA's subject matter experts themselves were active duty service members in the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service further militates against the finding of any animus toward veterans."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">McDermott v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Richardson v. Dept. of Interior,</span> SF-4324-09-0913-I-1 (NP 9/9/2010), discounted statistical information concerning general hiring patterns as to veterans in a particular agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in disallowing <span id="Page_486"></span>him to use discovery to gather statistics to show that the agency now employs fewer veterans than it did in years past. An administrative judge's errors regarding discovery matters are subject to an abuse of discretion standard. <span class="Italic">Wagner v.

The appellant has not shown that the administrative judge abused his broad discretion in regulating discovery. With respect to these matters, the appellant has not explained how any information he sought to discover or present at the hearing would have changed the result in his appeal. Statistical evidence of the allegedly declining number of veterans employed by the agency is not probative of whether the selecting official testified credibly about his reason for choosing the selectee to fill the MPA position.</p>
