<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-288"><span class="space">2.</span> Effect of Denial of Discovery</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Discovery is an important component of Board practice. It can be of significance in cases involving jurisdictional issues closely tied to the merits, e.g., whistleblowing reprisal cases involving issues of motivation of management officials. Because the Board resolves many jurisdictional issues through proceedings that constitute, but are not denominated, summary judgment, it is important for an appellant to gather information prior to the close of the record on the jurisdictional issue to avoid dismissal for lack of a sufficient showing of argument and evidence to constitute a nonfrivolous jurisdictional issue. When summary judgment is available, it is inappropriate unless a tribunal permits adequate time for discovery. <span class="Italic">Burnside-Ott Aviation Training Ctr. v. United States</span>, 985 F.2d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Contract Disputes Act litigation) (relying on <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.</span>, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2511 n.5 (1986), and <span class="Italic">Celotex Corp. v. Catrett</span>, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2554 (1986)). [Refer to Chapter 17, "<a href="0100-2023-24-035.html#sec17-35">Ruling on Discovery</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reminded the Board of the traditional scope of discovery in a consolidated RIF appeal, <span class="Italic">Hayes v. DHHS</span>, 829 F.2d 1092, 1103 (Fed. Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he information sought in the discovery request was relevant to the issue in the remand proceedings. The presiding official erred in denying production of this information. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. v. Sanders</span>, 437 U.S. 340, 351 (1978) ("relevant" information for discovery purposes "has been construed broadly to encompass any matter that bears on, or that reasonably could lead to other matters that could bear on, any issue that is or may be in the case"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Hickman v. Taylor</span>, 329 U.S. 495, 507 (1947) ("Mutual knowledge of all the relevant facts gathered by both parties is essential to proper litigation.")</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baird v. Dept. of Army</span>, 517 F.3d 1345, 1350-51 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (remanding an appeal to the Board when the court concluded that the AJ erred by refusing to require the agency to comply with discovery requests for emails that may have contained communications showing that the adverse action decisional process was subject to inappropriate control at a level higher than the deciding official); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 8 MSPR 170, 174, 7 MSPB 649 (1981) ("what constitutes relevant material in discovery is to be liberally interpreted"; <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> approved the denial of discovery requests that "were clearly not relevant to any...issue under appeal"); <span class="Italic">cf. Beck v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210514269">997 F.3d 1171</a>, 1185 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (Judge Taranto concurring) ("We have previously held that 'it is an abuse of discretion to categorically exclude all witnesses' who may be relevant to a plaintiff's case. <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Dep't of Lab</span>., 680 F.3d 1353, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Such exclusion precludes plaintiffs from 'effectively presenting [their case] and leaves only the agency's side of the case in play. This can have a substantial effect on the outcome of the case, and so constitutes harmful error.' <span class="Italic">Id</span>.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Discovery can be improperly denied both by an improper ruling on a motion to compel discovery as well as by a scheduling order that effectively denies discovery. If the AJ sets a date for the cutoff for discovery in a prehearing order that precludes the appellant from having considered an otherwise timely motion to compel discovery, and if discovery was sought on a material point, e.g., comparable discipline for similarly situated employees, the Board may remedy the error through a remand for completion of the discovery process and any hearing necessitated by development of information through the discovery. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v.

As the agency's response to the appellant's discovery request could have been filed on the last day provided for such a response, issuing the initial decision prior to the close of discovery effectively denied the appellant the opportunity to contest the agency's objections, to follow up with requests for further discoverable material based upon the agency's initial response, or to file a motion to compel. It also denied her the opportunity to submit into the record evidence obtained during discovery.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lynch v. DOD</span>, 114 MSPR 219, 222-23 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11, 2010 MSPB 117 (2010), remanded a VEOA appeal for completion of discovery and for the opportunity to the appellant to use the fruits of discovery when the AJ issued an initial decision before the discovery period closed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred by issuing the initial decision before he was able to submit the evidence that he received from the agency through discovery and his response to it. The appellant asserts that the agency's responses to his discovery requests support his position that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding the agency's assertion and the administrative judge's finding that the agency did not obstruct his right to compete for the GS-12 Quality Assurance Specialist position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge's errors regarding discovery matters are subject to an abuse of discretion standard. <span class="Italic">Wagner v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 447, 452 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 996 F.2d 1236 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table). The rules governing discovery in Board proceedings are set out in the Board's regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.71-.75. These regulations require that "[d]iscovery must be completed within the time limit the judge designates." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(d)(5). Initial discovery requests must be served within 25 days of the administrative judge ordering the agency to produce its file and response. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(d)(1). The agency must respond to an appellant's discovery request within 20 days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(d)(2). If the agency serves objections to the appellant's discovery request or if the agency does not timely respond to the appellant's discovery request, the appellant has 10 days to file a motion to compel discovery. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(d)(4). If the agency timely responds to the appellant's discovery request, the appellant has 10 days from receipt of the response to file a follow-up discovery request. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(f)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the acknowledgment order, the administrative judge set the time frame for discovery consistent with the provisions of the Board's regulations, indicating that a party's initial discovery request must be served within 25 days of October 27, 2009, and the opposing party's responses to discovery must be served no later than 20 days after the date of service of the other party's discovery request. If the parties timely filed discovery requests and responses using the entire period set by the administrative judge for discovery, the discovery period ended on December 21, 2009. The administrative judge issued the initial decision on December 11, 2009, without informing the parties that the discovery period had closed. As the agency's response to any discovery request by the appellant could have been filed on the last day provided for such response, issuance of the initial decision prior to the close of discovery effectively denied the appellant any opportunity to contest any of the agency's objections, file a motion to compel, or follow up with requests for further discoverable material based upon the agency's initial response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the administrative judge was aware that the parties were engaging in discovery in a timely manner. On December 3, 2009, the agency informed the administrative judge that the parties were still engaging in discovery and that the appellant had agreed to allow the agency until December 7, 2009, to respond to the appellant's discovery request. The administrative judge, therefore, should have known that, pursuant to the Board's regulations, if the agency served objections to the appellant's discovery request or if the agency did not respond to the appellant's discovery request by December 7, 2009, the appellant had 10 days from December 10, 2009, or until December 20, 2009, to file a motion to compel discovery. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(d)(4). Additionally, she should have known that, if the agency timely responded to the appellant's discovery request, the appellant had 10 days from receipt of the response, or at least until December 20, 2009, to file a follow-up discovery request. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(f)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties' actions regarding discovery were consistent with the guidance provided in the Board's regulations, i.e., that the parties attempt to resolve discovery disputes between themselves "with a minimum of [administrative judge] intervention." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.71. The administrative judge should not have issued the initial decision when she knew or should have known that the time limit for the parties to submit evidence obtained through discovery had not expired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will not find reversible error in an administrative judge's failing to inform the parties that the time period set for discovery in the acknowledgment order had expired absent an abuse of discretion that prejudiced a party's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Department of Defense</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6; 13 (2006). As evidenced by the agency's responses, the appellant's initial discovery request is directed at evidence that could be relevant and admissible concerning the appellant's allegation that the agency obstructed his right to compete. Further, as the party bearing the burden of proof on the claim, the appellant is entitled to obtain evidence to support his claim. <span class="Italic">See Redd v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 182, &#x00B6; 15 (2006). By issuing the initial decision prior to the completion of discovery, the administrative judge deprived the parties of the opportunity to submit additional relevant evidence that they had obtained during the discovery process. As the acknowledgment order makes clear, submissions by the parties during discovery are to be served on the other party, "<span class="Italic">but not the Board</span>." Thus, we find it necessary to remand the appeal for further adjudication.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the Board to remand a case based on discovery errors, e.g., the failure of the AJ to rule on a motion to compel discovery, the appellant must demonstrate prejudice as a result of the denial of discovery; the appellant may be required to show that the information sought would influence the outcome of the appeal. <span class="Italic">Szejner v. OPM</span>, 99 MSPR 275, 278 &#x00B6; 5 (2005); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Trinkl v.

Nor does the record disclose that this discovery issue was raised before the AJ or otherwise preserved below.").

Beyond claiming surprise at one statement that each of the two witnesses made during their testimony, the appellant has failed to explain how his substantive rights were prejudiced by not having deposed Jones and Washington in advance of the hearing or how any information he sought to discover would have changed the result in this appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v. Government Printing Office</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 355, &#x00B6; 7 (2008).

Moreover, appellant was not prevented from introducing his own documentary evidence and testimony pertaining to other cases he had worked on in order to rebut the agency charges.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Finding no material error in a AJ's failure to rule on a motion to compel discovery, the Board went to some length to avoid a remand in the VEOA appeal of <span class="Italic">Asatov v. DOJ</span>, PH-3330-12-0348-I-1 (NP 8/9/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the appellant filed a motion to compel discovery of the certificate of eligibles from which the position was filled and the name of the individual selected along with documentation showing that the individual is entitled to veterans' preference. While the administrative judge did not explicitly rule on the appellant's discovery motion, he implicitly denied the motion when he found that "the order to show cause gave the appellant the essence of what he sought in discovery, i.e., the identity of the selectee and whether the selectee is entitled to veterans' preference. In his reply to the agency's evidence showing that the selectee is preference eligible, the appellant raised no challenges." While the appellant may not have liked the administrative judge's decision in this regard, the appellant was provided a reason as to why his discovery request was not granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent the appellant contends that he was harmed because the administrative judge did not grant his discovery request, the agency's response to the show cause order provided the appellant with the information sought in discovery and the appellant has raised no challenges to the evidence submitted by the agency. Specifically, the appellant argued below that the agency did not follow the procedures for passing over a preference eligible. However, the agency's response and supporting evidence shows that it was not required to request passover authority because it selected a preference eligible to fill the vacancy. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3318(b)(1), 3319(c)(2). Indeed, the agency submitted a declaration sworn under penalty of perjury from Susan Cimino, Human Resource Manager, stating that the individual selected to fill the Labor Relations Specialist is a preference eligible who served on active duty from September 1987 until February 2007, and who had a 50 percent service connected disability. The record reflects that the appellant's name was on the list of preference eligible veterans considered for the position, but another preference eligible was selected. Accordingly, discovery is not required because there is no genuine dispute of material fact in this case and the agency must prevail as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 604, &#x00B6; 12 (2007) (the Board may decide a VEOA appeal on the merits, without an evidentiary hearing, where there is no genuine dispute of material fact and one party must prevail as a matter of law).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's approach to discovery error can be circular. It suggests you demonstrate harm through denial of discovery by showing what of significance would have been obtained through discovery. You don't know what you don't know. Although an appellant denied discovery may be hard pressed to show what he was denied, the appellant should make a reasonable and reasoned effort to inform the AJ of the likely significance of the discovery he desires to pursue, <span class="Italic">Enplanar, Inc. v. Marsh</span>, 11 F.3d 1284, 1292 (5th Cir. 1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Certainly, we are not requiring clairvoyance on the part of the Contractors. They do not need to know the precise content of the requested discovery, but they do need to give the district court some idea of how the sought-after discovery might reasonably be supposed to create a factual dispute. The mere fleeting mention of a matter, without a description of its likely relevance, will not suffice to alert the district court to the potential importance of that undiscovered item.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Starks v. Dept. of Army</span>, 94 MSPR 95, 98-99 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (2003), the agency failed to provide some investigative materials to the appellant until after the hearing. The agency contended the appellant's discovery request was not structured to ensure a proper search for the records. The agency's error was inadvertent; a sanction would not be imposed when the agency provided the materials promptly after learning of their existence. The error was harmless because the evidence supported the charge and, even if the charge was dismissed, the adverse action would be sustained on the basis of other charges. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Rodgers v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 122 MSPR 559, 571 &#x00B6; 21, 2015 MSPB 45 (2015) ("The administrative judge ruled on the outstanding discovery motions at the beginning of the hearing. The appellant was granted additional discovery and permitted to supplement the record with any relevant evidence he obtained.<span class="Italic"></span> We find no abuse of discretion in the timing of this discovery ruling.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Davis v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 340, 344-45 (1990), offers analysis of an assertion that the appellant was improperly denied discovery:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of discovery is to enable a party to obtain relevant information, including information which appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(a), and that purpose would not be served in this instance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. 170 (1981) (what constitutes relevant material in discovery is to be liberally interpreted)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here...the appellant has not shown with any specificity the relevancy and materiality of the information sought, and that such information was not otherwise contained in the agency's appeal file or its decisions. <span class="Italic">Cf. Cornelius v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 149, 151-52 (1986) (motion to compel denied where request was overly broad, burdensome and immaterial); <span class="Italic">Carter v. Department of Labor,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 500, 502 (1985) (employee not entitled to have agency produce documents absent showing by employee how such information was relevant to specific issues); <span class="Italic">Abbott v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 27 M.S.P.R. 442, 444 (1985) (in determining whether an interrogatory is so broad as to be burdensome, the Board balances the burden on the interrogated party against the benefits the information would provide to the party submitting the interrogatory).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board came close to placing the burden on the appellant to demonstrate the necessity for discovery, rather than the right to discovery, on a jurisdictional issue, <span class="Italic">Chang v. DHHS,</span> DC-0752-11-0040-I-1 (NP 9/2/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the administrative judge accepted all of the appellant's allegations as fact, engaging in discovery could not assist the appellant in meeting her jurisdictional burden on those claims. Further, the appellant fails to identify any materials she requested that would permit her to make the requisite nonfrivolous allegation if she were allowed to engage in discovery. The examples the appellant cites in opposition to the agency's request to stay discovery are replete with broad statements of what "the evidence" she seeks will show, but she fails to identify any specific item that would allow her to do so. Thus, the appellant failed to show that the administrative judge abused his discretion in granting the agency's motion for a stay of discovery.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1274"></span>At times Board analysis of the discretion exercised by an AJ can be a tad attenuated, <span class="Italic">Araujo v. Dept. of Army</span>, 20 MSPR 123, 124-25 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon consideration of the petition, we find that the presiding official properly limited the scope of discovery as all materials relied upon by the agency in taking the action against appellant were contained in the adverse action file supplied to appellant. No procedural error was committed by the presiding official in exercising her authority to rule on discovery requests under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(4)(7) and (9). The 3-day hearing conducted by the presiding official and her lengthy initial decision reflect a thorough consideration of all issues raised.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"Ordinarily, if a discovery motion or a motion to subpoena a witness for the hearing clearly relates to a matter that is material to the case, the motion should be granted in the absence of a showing that it would be unduly burdensome, harassing, or repetitious." <span class="Italic">Pedersen v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 9 MSPR 195, 199 (1981). If the AJ denies discovery requests but does not explain his rulings, the Board must examine the requests and theories argued by the appellant to determine whether the requests could have produced information material to defenses asserted by the appellant. The Board may then remand the case to the region to permit discovery in areas earlier foreclosed by the AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. SBA</span>, 60 MSPR 130, 134 (1993). If the AJ dismisses an appeal as beyond Board jurisdiction and the Board then reverses on the jurisdictional issue, the Board should remand the case to the AJ to permit discovery if there are material issues of disputed fact. <span class="Italic">Baxter v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1991 NP No. 91-3019); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Gregory v.

USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 494, 498 &#x00B6; 9 (2000) ("[P]articularly where, as here, the appellant bears the burden of ultimately showing the existence and availability of vacant positions at or below her grade level, within her commuting area, to which she could be reassigned as a reasonable accommodation of her disability...it is patently unfair for the AJ, having ordered the agency to provide such information, not to require it to do so, and then to find that the appellant failed to carry her burden.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ has the discretion to permit discovery on the merits of the case only after a jurisdictional issue is resolved. <span class="Italic">Kostan v. Arizona Nat'l Guard</span>, 45 MSPR 173 (1990). But some cases presenting jurisdictional issues, e.g., constructive adverse actions, should support immediate discovery, assuming well-pled jurisdictional allegations, for the merits of the case are intertwined with the jurisdictional issues. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gregory</span>, <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-012.html#sec6-13">Constructive Adverse Action</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to an appeal considered on the merits, a denial of material discovery warrants remand to the AJ and the issuance of a new initial decision taking into consideration the arguments and evidence introduced after the conclusion of discovery. <span class="Italic">Bize v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 3 MSPR 155, 164, 3 MSPB 261 (1980) ("Since one of the main functions of the Board is the adjudication of cases within its jurisdiction, 5 U.S.C. 1205, the fairness of such adjudications can only be enhanced by disclosure of the facts in a case.

Dept. of Army</span>, 41 MSPR 310, 312 (1989) (remanding because the AJ had not ordered the agency to produce regulations pertinent to MSPB jurisdiction).

Dept. of Treasury</span>, 8 MSPR 170, 176, 7 MSPB 649 (1981). If there are no valid privilege claims, the AJ must determine under <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> whether further proceedings are appropriate and issue a new initial decision taking into consideration the arguments and evidence raising matters not already fully considered.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ should provide reasonable procedural guidance on discovery to an appellant who requests it and the failure of the AJ to do so may warrant remand, <span class="Italic">Stein-Verbit v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 72 MSPR 332, 342-43 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appears to contend that the administrative judge denied her the opportunity to conduct discovery by ordering the agency not to provide the appellant with the documents that she requested. As noted above, the administrative judge's order was erroneous. Nonetheless, the administrative judge's October 11, 1995 acknowledgment order stated that, if the appellant wished to engage in discovery, she must initiate discovery within 25 days of the date of the acknowledgment order. It appears that the appellant took no action to initiate discovery after the administrative judge issued her October 11, 1995 Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an October 30, 1995 pleading, the appellant stated that she had read the Board's discovery regulations and that she had questions about discovery. It appears that the appellant attempted to obtain answers to her questions via telephone, but that the administrative judge would not take the appellant's calls without the agency representative's participation.[4] While the record shows that the administrative judge addressed the appellant's discovery questions during a November 9, 1995 teleconference, this teleconference did not occur until after the deadline for initiating discovery had passed. Moreover, the appellant continued to request information from the agency and even filed a procedurally defective motion to compel discovery, which the administrative judge did not address.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The record does not reflect whether the administrative judge sought or received a waiver of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications from the agency. In any event, the administrative judge could have answered the appellant's questions concerning discovery without the participation of the agency's representative and without obtaining a waiver of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, because such a communication would not constitute a <span class="Italic">prohibited ex parte</span> communication. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.101(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, by failing to respond to the appellant's discovery questions until after the deadline for initiating discovery passed, and by not addressing the appellant's motion to compel discovery, the administrative judge denied the appellant a full and fair opportunity to conduct discovery, which, in turn, affected the appellant's ability to prepare appropriate pre-hearing submissions.</p>
