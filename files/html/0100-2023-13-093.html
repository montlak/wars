<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-93"><span class="space">d.</span> Disability Accommodation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency may need to accommodate an employee who seeks to return from leave, but the employee should request a specific accommodation, e.g., a modification of a work schedule, supply documentation necessary for the agency to evaluate the disability and any workplace threat presented or accommodation requested, and engage in an interactive process with the agency, <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas v. Dept. of Army</span>, 122 MSPR 468, 471-80 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-20, 2015 MSPB 13 (2015) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas v. MSPB</span>, 833 F.3d 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (Judge Dyk dissenting), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 19, 2011, the appellant submitted a letter from his treating psychiatrist requesting to be excused from work until January 16, 2012 based on an "emotional condition." Through the following months, the appellant continued to request leave from work based on his condition, each time pushing back his expected return date, and the agency continued to approve the appellant's absences. Then, on June 11, 2012, the appellant submitted a June 7, 2012 letter from his psychiatrist with the following recommendation for a part-time schedule:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Having [the appellant] resume his position at work, gradually, starting on Monday, July 2, 2012. To work a 20 to 30 hours a week schedule for a three weeks period minimum. After this period, I would like to evaluate [the appellant] again, to certify his capacity to move in, on a full time schedule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency determined that the appellant was requesting to be accommodated through a modified work schedule. It asked him to indicate the number of hours he was requesting to work per week, his proposed schedule, and whether he wished to take leave for the remaining hours or if he was seeking a change to a part-time schedule. There is no evidence that the appellant sent the requested information. Instead, on June 25, 2012, he told the agency that he was going to return to work full time on July 2, 2012. The agency responded, noting that the appellant's psychiatrist had recommended that he return to work part time, and requesting additional information before returning the appellant to duty. The appellant did not return to work on July 2, 2012, and instead continued to request leave, claiming that the agency was preventing him from returning to duty. Through the following weeks, the appellant exchanged emails with the agency, and provided some additional documentation, but the agency maintained that the documentation was insufficient. He ultimately provided a report from his psychiatrist on July 25, 2012. The report indicated that the agency's requests for medical documentation had exacerbated the appellant's symptoms, he was unable to work, and his prognosis was "reserved," and recommended that he "consider applying for disability." The appellant requested leave beginning July 25, 2012, and the agency continued to approve the leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not provide further medical documentation until November 14, 2012. On that date, he sent the agency a new report from his psychiatrist, giving a detailed assessment of the appellant's condition and recommending that he return to duty for 20 to 30 hours per week beginning November 19, 2012. However, on November 15, 2012, the agency proposed the appellant's removal on the same bases underlying the first removal, and it placed him on paid administrative leave. The deciding official upheld the removal, which was effective February 8, 2013....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although various fact patterns may give rise to an appealable constructive suspension, all constructive suspension claims are premised on the proposition that an absence that appears to be voluntary actually is not. To demonstrate that the absence was, in part, not voluntary, and is an actionable constructive suspension, an appellant must show that: (1) the employee lacked a meaningful choice in the matter; and (2) it was the agency's wrongful actions that deprived the employee of that choice. <span class="Italic">Romero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6; 8 (2014). Assuming that the jurisdictional requirements of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 are otherwise met, proof of these two things is sufficient to establish Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This analysis extends to situations in which the agency prevented the appellant's return to work after an initially voluntary leave of absence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 &#x0026; n.2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's absence from December 19, 2011, through July 1, 2012, did not constitute a constructive suspension.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that the agency constructively suspended him from December 19, 2011, through July 1, 2012, by consistently demanding adequate medical documentation to substantiate his continued absence and threatening to place him in an absence without leave status if he failed to comply. He alleges that the agency's actions in this regard intimidated him and caused his psychological condition to deteriorate. He argues that his absence during this time constituted a constructive suspension because it was both involuntary and precipitated by the agency's wrongful actions. [<span class="Italic">S]ee Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 8 (2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's absence from December 19, 2011, through July 1, 2012, did not constitute a constructive suspension. It appears to be undisputed that the appellant's psychological condition precluded him from reporting to work during this time period, and thus, he lacked a meaningful choice in the matter. <span class="Italic">See Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 13. Nevertheless, we find that the appellant's psychological condition was not caused by any improper agency actions. An agency is entitled to require medical documentation from its employees to substantiate sick leave requests in excess of 3 workdays, and such documentation generally must be provided within 15 days after the agency requests it. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.405(a)-(b); <span class="Italic">see Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</span>, Notice 915.002, Questions 15-16 (July 27, 2000) (Enforcement Guidance). Indeed, the agency in this case has promulgated its own procedures requiring such documentation. Thus, the agency was fully within its rights to require that the appellant substantiate his lengthy medical absence with documentation from his treating psychiatrist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reviewed the agency's correspondence with the appellant during this time period, and we find nothing about it threatening, coercive, abusive, or otherwise improper. Even if the appellant's psychological condition was exacerbated by the agency requiring him to comply with its lawful leave procedures, this does not mean that the agency acted improperly by requiring him to do so. Nor do we construe the agency's warnings of the consequences for failure to provide adequate medical documentation as improper threats. Rather, the agency would have been remiss not to provide the appellant with such warnings. <span class="Italic">See Allen v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 491, &#x00B6; 10 (2001) (an agency may not discipline an employee for failure to follow leave requesting procedures or for unscheduled leave unless he is on notice of the applicable requirements and that discipline for continued noncompliance is likely). Because the appellant has not shown that his absence from December 19, 2011, through July 1, 2012, was precipitated by any improper agency action, we find that he has not established jurisdiction over his constructive suspension appeal for that period of time. <span class="Italic">See Romero,</span> 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">see also Bean,</span> 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's absence from July 2, 2012, through November 17, 2012, did not constitute a constructive suspension.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2072"></span>On review, the agency argues that it was justified in preventing the appellant from returning to work on July 2, 2012, either in a full-time or part-time capacity. It argues that the appellant failed to provide medical documentation releasing him for full duty and also failed to provide any information on how he wished to structure a part-time schedule. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, on June 7, 2012, the appellant's psychiatrist recommended that he resume working 20 to 30 hours per week beginning July 2, 2012. The agency determined that the appellant was making a request for reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA), and it followed up with him promptly, requesting more information in order to make a decision on the request. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(9)(B) (a modified or part-time work schedule is a type of reasonable accommodation); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(2)(ii) (same). The requested information included the number of hours that the appellant wished to work per week, a proposed schedule, and how to account for the remaining unworked hours. We find that the agency's request was entirely reasonable and is the sort of exchange that is supposed to occur during the interactive process. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(3) (indicating that it may be necessary for an agency to initiate a discussion with the employee regarding potential reasonable accommodations). However, the appellant failed to respond to the agency's request. Instead, he waited until a week before his expected return date and informed the agency that no accommodation was necessary because he would be returning to work full time. This was contrary to the psychiatrist's recommendation that the appellant return to duty on a part-time basis. The agency followed up the next day, summarizing the June 7, 2012 psychiatrist's note and directing the appellant to submit medical documentation that would clarify his prognosis and permit his return to work. The agency's request was consistent with its leave procedures, which required medical certification as a prerequisite for a return to duty following an absence for which medical certification was required. The appellant failed to satisfy this requirement despite the agency's clear and repeated instructions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the agency's request for medical information was permissible under the ADAAA. <span class="Italic">See Archerda v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28-35 (2014). Under the ADAAA, an agency may only make a medical inquiry regarding whether an employee "is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of the disability," where such an inquiry "is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 29 (quoting 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4)(A)). Generally, a disability-related inquiry or medical examination may be job-related and consistent with business necessity if an employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that: (1) an employee's ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition; or (2) an employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 30. A direct threat is a "significant risk of substantial harm to the health of safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). We find that the agency was justified, under both of these theories, to require further medical documentation from the appellant before returning him to duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's ability to perform his essential job functions, we find that the June 7, 2012 letter from his psychiatrist stating that the appellant should return to work part time, when read together with the appellant's prior medical documentation, was sufficient to form the basis for a reasonable belief that the appellant's condition would preclude him from performing the essential functions of his position, even on a part-time basis. <span class="Italic">See Archerda</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 32-34. At the time that the agency received the letter, the appellant had been absent for medical reasons for approximately 7 months. A month prior to providing the agency with the June 7, 2012 letter, the appellant provided the agency with another letter from the same psychiatrist, reflecting that his conditions were "not resolving," and contemplating treatment options, including "Partial Hospitalization" and "[r]elocation [to] a working area where the [appellant] does not feel threatened after the bad experience he lived through."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The June 7, 2012 letter did not certify that the appellant was able to work part time, but rather stated that allowing him to work part time was "encourage[d]," subject to reevaluation to determine if he could move on to a full-time schedule. No specific recommendation was provided. Rather, the psychiatrist suggested that the appellant work 20 to 30 hours per week "for a three weeks period minimum." In light of these facts, we agree with the agency that it was appropriate to gather more information before making a final determination on the appellant's ability to perform the essential functions of his position with or without reasonable accommodation, or alternatively, on how to tailor any accommodation that might be required to allow him to perform those functions. Accordingly, we find that the agency's disability-related inquiry was job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">See Topping v. Rumsfeld</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01991520 &#x0026; 01991900, 2002 WL 31230849 at *4 (E.E.O.C. Sept. 30, 2002) (finding the decision to conduct a fitness for duty examination was appropriate where the medical information from the employee's own doctors was insufficient for the agency to make a determination of whether she was able to perform the essential functions of her position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding any direct threat that the appellant might have posed upon his return to the workplace, less than 5 months earlier, on January 25, 2012, the appellant submitted a psychiatrist's note stating that that the appellant had experienced "aggressive episodes." We find that this information was sufficient to form the basis for a reasonable belief that the appellant would pose a direct threat if he returned. We make no finding on whether the appellant actually posed such a threat because that would require us to make an individualized assessment of his "present ability to safely perform the essential functions" of his position, including the duration of the risk, the nature and severity of the potential harm, the likelihood that the potential harm would occur, and the imminence of the potential harm. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r); <span class="Italic">see also Complainant v. Donahoe,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120120665, 2014 WL 7005985 at *6 (E.E.O.C. Dec. 4, 2014) (discussing the documentation on which an agency may rely in applying this test). The record is insufficiently developed for us to make such a determination, and it likewise appears that the agency had insufficient information before it to make such a determination. The agency was therefore entitled to seek additional information to address the direct threat issue before deciding whether to return the appellant to the workplace. <span class="Italic">See Norton v. Nicholson,</span> Appeal No. 01A51018, 2006 WL 522288 at *4 (E.E.O.C. Feb. 21, 2006) (finding that management reasonably concluded from doctors notes provided by the employee that more information was required to determine if the employee posed a direct threat); Enforcement Guidance, Question 17, Example B (indicating that an employer may request additional medical documentation when an employee with a psychiatric condition threatens several coworkers, is hospitalized for 6 weeks, and returns to work with a doctor's note that indicates only that he was "cleared to return to work"). The agency's inquiry was job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">See Norton</span>, 2006 WL 522288 at *4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency failed to meet its burden to show that there was no reasonable accommodation that would either eliminate or reduce any direct threat that the appellant posed. She suggested that one such accommodation might have been telework. We note, however, that the appellant did not respond to the agency's request for clarification regarding what it interpreted as his request for accommodation, did not request telework as an accommodation, and did not identify any vacant, funded position to which the agency might have reassigned him. <span class="Italic">See White v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 244, &#x00B6; 16 (2012) (setting forth the elements of a claim of failure to accommodate a disability); <span class="Italic">see also Petitioner v. McDonald</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0320130052, 2014 WL 6853739 at *3 (E.E.O.C. Nov. 28, 2014) (the disabled individual generally has the obligation to request accommodation; an agency is not required to inquire in the first instance). Considering the appellant's failure to engage in the interactive process with respect to his request for part-time work and his failure to provide documentation from his psychiatrist releasing him for full-time work, we find that the agency did not act improperly in refusing to place the appellant back in a duty status. <span class="Italic">See Romero</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11. Thus, even assuming that the appellant is a qualified individual with a disability, his refusal to engage in the interactive process prevented the agency from identifying a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of the Army,</span> 121 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-21 (2014) (finding an appellant frustrated the agency's reasonable accommodation efforts); <span class="Italic">see also Moylett v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency had the right to prevent the appellant from returning to work in the absence of proper medical documentation under its regulations. <span class="Italic">See Nowinski v. Potter,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120063215, 2007 WL 1094273, at *3, *5 (E.E.O.C.

The appellant's failure to provide this documentation was not the fault of the agency. Because the appellant failed to show that his absence during any of the time periods at issue was the result of the agency's improper actions, we find the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Romero</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">see also Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's discrimination and reprisal claims.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2073"></span>The appellant has raised numerous discrimination and reprisal claims in this appeal. The Board generally lacks jurisdiction over such claims in the absence of an otherwise appealable action. <span class="Italic">See Pridgen v.

Department of Homeland Security,</span> 437 F.3d 1322, 1341-43 (Fed. Cir. 2006), as discussed above, we find no basis to conclude that the alleged prohibited personnel practices in this case precipitated the appellant's absence. To the extent that the appellant is arguing that the agency prevented him from returning to work for reasons of discrimination or reprisal, for the reasons explained above, we find that the real reason was the appellant's failure to provide adequate documentation to allow it to do so. To the extent that the appellant is arguing that his initial leave of absence was caused by his removal without due process 2 years prior, we find that these circumstances would not compel a reasonable person in the appellant's situation to be absent from work after the removal was reversed. <span class="Italic">See Swift v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 29, 32 (1994) (the Board applies the "reasonable person" standard in determining whether an action is involuntary based on coercion).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas v. MSPB</span>, 833 F.3d 1342, 1344-47 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (Judge Dyk dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Rosario served as a biologist and project manager for the Regulatory Division of the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) until he was fired in February 2010. In November 2011, the Board determined that the termination violated Mr. Rosario's due process rights and ordered his prompt restoration. This improper removal caused Mr. Rosario to suffer from depression, thus he voluntarily took sick leave to recover before resuming his duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 7, 2012, Mr. Rosario submitted a letter from his physician, Dr. Juan Rodriguez-Velez, to his supervisor, Mr. Sindulfo Castillo, stating that his symptoms, which included severe anxiety, paranoia, chronic insomnia, marked irritability, frequent panic attacks, and aggressive episodes, were not improving. Dr. Rodriguez-Velez recommended either: (1) referring Mr. Rosario for partial hospitalization; (2) relocating Mr. Rosario's working area; or (3) providing reasonable accommodation for three months to evaluate whether Mr. Rosario was emotionally stable to continue working. One month later, Mr. Rosario submitted another letter to Mr. Castillo from Dr. Rodriguez-Velez, which recommended that Mr. Rosario return to work on July 2, 2012, for 20-30 hours per week, because he had "started to advance emotionally." The Corps viewed this letter as a request for reasonable accommodation of Mr. Rosario's medical condition. Therefore, on June 14, 2012, Mr. Castillo requested further information to clarify Mr. Rosario's proposed accommodation, including the number of hours he wanted to work per week, his proposed schedule, and if he was requesting leave for the hours he was not working each week or if he was requesting to be switched to a part-time schedule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 25, 2012, Mr. Castillo reminded Mr. Rosario to submit the information so that the Corps could continue processing his request for accommodation. Mr. Rosario replied that he would not be submitting the forms because he was going to return to work full time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next day, Mr. Castillo informed Mr. Rosario that due to his symptomatology and the possibility of aggressive episodes, the Corps had a reasonable belief that he could not perform an essential job function and/or that he represented a direct safety threat to himself or his coworkers. Therefore, to return to duty on July 2, 2012, Mr. Rosario needed to provide a medical release from his physician addressing the history of his medical condition, his prognosis, including an estimated date of recovery, and an explanation of the condition's impact, including any resultant medical restrictions and the reasons for them. Mr. Castillo also informed Mr. Rosario that he needed to request approved leave or risk being placed in AWOL status until he provided the requested medical documentation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Rosario requested leave under protest. On July 23, 2012, Mr. Rosario submitted a letter from Dr. Rodriguez-Velez, which recommended that Mr. Rosario apply for disability because his depression had returned. Mr. Rosario did not provide any other medical documentation and continued to request leave under protest. On September 25, 2012, Mr. Castillo informed Mr. Rosario that he had not yet provided adequate medical documentation that would allow the agency to evaluate his request to return to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 14, 2012, Mr. Rosario forwarded a report from Dr. Rodriguez-Velez which outlined his treatment regimen, and explained that Mr. Rosario could exercise necessary impulse control and perform his duties at an intermediate capacity, if in a structured and predictable environment. Dr. Rodriguez-Velez recommended that Mr. Rosario return to work beginning on November 19, 2012 for 20-30 hours per week.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 15, 2012, the Corps issued a "Revised Notice of Proposed Removal" based on the same charges that led to the first removal action in February 2010. Mr. Rosario was informed that he would be placed on administrative leave, beginning November 18, 2012, pending a decision from the deciding official regarding the proposal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Rosario appealed, arguing that he was constructively suspended from July 2, 2012 until November 18, 2012, when he was placed on administrative leave. The Board, however, concluded that he was not constructively suspended and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's appellate jurisdiction is limited to agency actions over which it has been granted jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a). Appealable agency actions include removals and suspensions for more than 14 days. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512, 7513(d). Additionally, this court has recognized that "seemingly voluntary actions in some circumstances may be considered adverse actions" over which the Board has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 437 F.3d 1322, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Specifically, the Board has jurisdiction "if the employee proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, that [his or her action] was involuntary and thus tantamount to [a forced enumerated adverse action]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1329 (alterations in original) (citing <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. Dep't of Agric</span>., 260 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One such involuntary action that the Board has jurisdiction over is an appeal based on a "constructive suspension"--an <span class="Italic">involuntary</span> absence from an agency for more than 14 days. <span class="Italic">Halloway v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 993 F.2d 219, 220-21 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (the dispositive inquiry for whether there has been a suspension for jurisdictional purposes is "whether the employee's absence from the agency was voluntary or involuntary").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the context of constructive resignations and retirements, the decision to retire or resign is presumed voluntary "and this presumption will prevail unless plaintiff comes forward with sufficient evidence to establish that the resignation [or retirement] was involuntarily extracted." <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1329. Claimants generally allege involuntariness by establishing that the resignation or retirement was the product of (1) misinformation or deception by the agency or (2) coercion by the agency. <span class="Italic">Conforto v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 713 F.3d 1111, 1121 (Fed. Cir. 2013). This court has determined that the Board has jurisdiction over involuntary coercion claims if the employee first establishes that: "(1) the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee's resignation or retirement; (2) the employee had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire; and (3) the employee's resignation or retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency." <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1329 (quoting <span class="Italic">Shoaf</span>, 260 F.3d at 1341).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Rosario alleges that his decision to take leave was involuntary due to coercion by the Corps. Therefore, the Board required Mr. Rosario to demonstrate that his absence from work was involuntary by proving that: (1) he lacked a meaningful choice in the matter; and (2) it was the Corps' wrongful actions that deprived him of that choice. <span class="Italic">See Romero v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 121 M.S.P.R. 606, 610 (2014). Ultimately, the Board concluded that "[c]onsidering the appellant's failure to engage in the interactive process with respect to his request for parttime work and his failure to provide documentation from his psychiatrist releasing him for full-time work...the agency did not act improperly in refusing to place the appellant back in a duty status."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Rosario argues, however, that the Board's requirements for establishing involuntariness erroneously conflated the merits determination (whether the Corps' action was wrongful) with the jurisdictional question (whether Mr. Rosario's absence was involuntary). We disagree. In the context of constructive action cases, whether an agency acted wrongfully is fundamental to determining jurisdiction because "[a]n action is not voluntary if it is produced by government conduct which is wrongful." <span class="Italic">Roskos v. United States</span>, 549 F.2d 1386, 1389-90 (Ct. Cl. 1977). Moreover, the Board's requirements for establishing jurisdiction in constructive suspension cases are directly in line with this court's requirements for establishing jurisdiction in constructive retirement and resignation cases. <span class="Italic">Compare Romero</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. at 610 (requiring an employee to establish involuntariness by proving that the agency's wrongful actions deprived him of a meaningful choice in the matter), <span class="Italic">with Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1329 (requiring an employee to establish involuntariness by proving, among other things, that the resignation or retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency). Therefore, the standard used by the Board to determine if Mr. Rosario's absence from work was involuntary was appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find the Board's jurisdictional inquiry appropriate, Mr. Rosario's petition for review must be denied if the Board's decision is supported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See Bolton</span>, 154 F.3d at 1316; <span class="Italic">Hogan v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 218 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("[T]his court will not overturn an agency decision if it is supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Rosario asserts that his absence from work from July 2, 2012 until November 18, 2012, was involuntary--i.e., he lacked a meaningful choice in <span id="Page_2074"></span>the matter. Even assuming that assertion is correct, for Mr. Rosario to prevail, he must also show that his absence was involuntary because it was caused by improper agency action. <span class="Italic">See Romero</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. at 610.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee voluntarily takes leave, an agency may properly refuse to allow the employee to resume working if the employee does not satisfy the agency's conditions for returning to work. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 610 n.2 ("[W]hile the agency's refusal to allow the appellant to return to work is the immediate cause of his absence, the proximate cause is arguably his failure to meet the conditions of the agency's 'clearance to return to work' policy."). In those circumstances, the agency's refusal to allow the employee to return to work does not amount to a constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Rosario took voluntary leave to recover from depression. When Mr. Rosario was able to resume working, the Corps conditioned his return on the provision of a medical release in which his physician addressed the history of his medical condition, his prognosis, including estimated date of recovery, and an explanation of the impact of the medical condition, including any resultant medical restrictions and the reasons for them.[1] Mr. Rosario did not provide the Corps with the requested medical release and thus failed to comply with the Corps' conditions for returning to work. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that the Corps did not act improperly by refusing to allow Mr. Rosario to return to work. Because the Corps did not act improperly in refusing to allow Mr. Rosario to return to work, his absence was not involuntary and thus he was not constructively suspended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We offer no conclusion as to whether the Corps' conditions for returning to work violate the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act, as jurisdiction for those claims lie with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b)(1), or the appropriate United States District Court, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2).</p>

Thus, even assuming that the appellant is a qualified individual with a disability, her refusal to engage in the interactive process prevented the agency from identifying a reasonable accommodation. <span class="italic">Id</span>.; <span class="italic">see Miller v.

<p class="Body-Text">The appellant's allegations that her medical condition precluded her from working without an accommodation that was denied by the agency sufficed to move the case to a jurisdictional hearing when the agency's response was to place the employee on LWOP, <span class="Italic">Thomas v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has explained that, although various fact patterns may give rise to an appealable constructive suspension, all constructive suspension claims are premised on the proposition that an absence that appears to be voluntary actually is not. <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 8 (2015), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 2015-3102, 2016 WL 4363176 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 16, 2016). To demonstrate that an absence from work was not voluntary, and is an actionable constructive suspension, an appellant must show that: (1) she lacked a meaningful choice in the matter; and (2) it was the agency's wrongful actions that deprived her of that choice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Romero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6; 8 (2014). Assuming that the jurisdictional requirements of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 are otherwise met, proof of these two things is sufficient to establish Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Romero</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9. Our reviewing court has specifically stated that the jurisdictional analysis set forth above is appropriate. <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas</span>, No. 2015-3102, slip op. at 3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the appellant did not establish that she suffered a constructive suspension. In particular, he found that the appellant did not establish that the agency deprived her of a meaningful choice. In making this finding, as explained below, the administrative judge held the appellant to a higher burden of proof than is required at this stage of the proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that, in a constructive adverse action appeal, if an appellant makes a nonfrivolous allegation of fact establishing Board jurisdiction, she is entitled to a hearing at which she must prove jurisdiction by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that, in a constructive adverse action appeal, "[a] denial of a request for a [jurisdictional] hearing would be proper where the claimant has failed to make allegations that, if proven, could satisfy one or more of the elements necessary to establish Board jurisdiction"); <span class="Italic">see Moore v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 84, &#x00B6; 11 (2011) (stating that an appellant is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing in a constructive suspension appeal based upon intolerable working conditions when she makes nonfrivolous allegations that her working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person in her position would have been compelled to absent herself from the workplace). Whether allegations are nonfrivolous is determined based on the written record. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the appellant alleged that, beginning in 2012, she suffered from allergic rhinitis due to exposure to allergens in Building 2010 and that her condition was permanent and could cause asthma if she were not removed from the allergens. The appellant explained that she was capable of performing her duties in a healthy, allergen-free environment, and she requested that the agency reasonably accommodate her condition by allowing her to work in that type of environment. Over the next 3 years, the agency sought additional medical documentation, the appellant provided documentation and continued to seek reasonable accommodation, and the agency attempted with mixed success to accommodate the appellant's conditions by, among other things, assigning her to Building 3101 and allowing her to telework from her home.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, on June 25, 2015, the agency instructed the appellant to work 2 days a week in a telework status, with the remaining 3 days classified as LWOP. In a July 13, 2015 reasonable accommodation request describing the appellant's condition and limitations as permanent, she sought, as an accommodation, reassignment to a work environment free of mold, contaminants, and irritants, not to include Buildings 2010 or 3101, and, if that were not possible, then reassignment to a mutually agreeable position in a work location free of mold, contaminants, and irritants. On September 9, 2015, the agency again requested additional medical documentation, specifically, the level of a particular allergen which caused an allergic reaction for the appellant and the identity of other mold, allergens, contaminants, or irritants to which she is allergic, along with the associated level which causes an allergic reaction for her. In response, the appellant's physician provided his opinion that no accommodation would allow the appellant to work in Building 2010 and that she should be allowed to telework 5 days a week or be assigned to another building free from contamination or to another unidentified position in a completely different location.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has, by these claims, made a nonfrivolous allegation that she was constructively suspended. <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas</span>, No. 2015-3102, slip op. at 3; <span class="Italic">Romero</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6; 8. She has done so by nonfrivolously alleging that, during the time in question, she was compelled to be in a nonpay status for 3 days each week because the alternative presented by the agency was for her to work in violation of her doctor's orders such that she lacked a meaningful choice in the matter, and by nonfrivolously alleging that the agency forced her into this untenable position by failing to accommodate her condition. <span class="Italic">See Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 14 (2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties disagree as to whether the medical evidence the appellant submitted in support of her request for accommodation was sufficient, whether the agency was justified in continuing to demand additional documentation, and whether the accommodations the agency offered were, in fact, reasonable. Nevertheless, at this stage of the proceedings, the appellant need only nonfrivolously allege that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate her condition, and this she has done based on her allegations and supporting documentation. We find that the appellant's allegations, if proven, could establish that she lacked a meaningful choice in this matter and that it was the agency's improper actions that deprived her of that choice. The jurisdictional prerequisites of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 otherwise appear to be satisfied. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A). Therefore, under the principles set forth above, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that she was subjected to an appealable constructive suspension and she is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence the matters that she has nonfrivolously alleged. If she does so, she will have established the Board's jurisdiction over her constructive suspension appeal, and the administrative judge must reverse the action as effected without due process, although he still must analyze the appellant's claims of disability discrimination and retaliation for EEO activity, if she wishes to pursue those claims. If the appellant does not establish the Board's jurisdiction over her constructive suspension appeal, then the administrative judge must dismiss it on that basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2075"></span>However, during adjudication, as noted above, the appellant offered an alternative basis for Board jurisdiction, specifically, that the agency actually suspended her by placing her on LWOP against her will for 3 days a week beginning on August 18, 2015, and continuing until October 21, 2015, when she filed her appeal and even thereafter. <span class="Italic">See Abbott v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 294, &#x00B6; 10 (2014) (stating that an agency's placement of an employee on enforced leave for more than 14 days constitutes an appealable suspension within the Board's jurisdiction and that previous Board decisions characterizing such suspensions as constructive were in error); <span class="Italic">see also Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The administrative judge did not address this claim. If, on remand, he finds that the appellant did not establish her constructive suspension claim, he shall consider her nonconstructive suspension claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">See Collazo v. USPS</span>, PH-3443-21-0263-I-1 (NP 7/29/2022) ("We find that the appellant has, by these claims, made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was constructively suspended. <span class="italic">See Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14. Like the appellant in Bean, the appellant appears to claim that the agency compelled him to absent himself from work because his only alternative was to work in violation of his medical restrictions and that the agency forced him into this untenable position by improperly failing to accommodate his condition. <span class="italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 14."); <span class="italic">cf. Lewis v. USPS</span>, NY-0752-13-0408-I-1 (NP 3/2/2023) (citing <span class="italic">"Bean v.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Pletten v. Dept. of Army</span>, 7 MSPR 13, 17, 6 MSPB 626 (1981), the employee was placed on sick leave because his physician felt it would be inadvisable for the appellant to work in any area contaminated by tobacco smoke. The agency attempted to provide a smoke-free environment, but could not guarantee an installation-wide smoke-free environment. The Board determined that the agency's accommodation was sufficient. Because the appellant could not work with reasonable accommodation, he was not able to work and not subjected to adverse action by being placed on sick leave. <span class="Italic">Pletten</span> was decided on an analysis, no longer applicable, that justified the imposition of enforced leave without advance notice and reply rights based on the ability of the employee to work. But the Board's procedural analysis suggests what the substantive result would have been the same had adverse action procedures been followed. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Strozier v. USPS</span>, 189 Fed. Appx. 953 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP) (employee who was physically unable to perform his duties, and for whom no accommodation was suggested that would have enabled him to perform the core functions of his position, was properly placed on enforced leave and ultimately removed; the Board did not reach the due process issues relating to the enforced leave); <span class="Italic">Abbott v.
