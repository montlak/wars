<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;to minimize the disruption to the lives of persons performing service in the uniformed services as well as to their employers, their fellow employees, and their communities, by providing for the prompt reemployment of such persons upon their completion of such service; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;to prohibit discrimination against persons because of their service in the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;It is the sense of Congress that the Federal Government should be a model employer in carrying out the provisions of this chapter.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(b) This chapter supersedes any State law (including any local law or ordinance), contract, agreement, policy, plan, practice, or other matter that reduces, limits, or eliminates in any manner any right or benefit provided by this chapter, including the establishment of additional prerequisites to the exercise of any such right or the receipt of any such benefit.</p>
