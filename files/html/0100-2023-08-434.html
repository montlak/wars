<p class="Body-Text">OPM regulations define employment practices and establish review jurisdiction in the Board, 5 CFR Part 300 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">300.101 <span class="Italic">Purpose</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of this subpart is to establish principles to govern, as nearly as is administratively feasible and practical, the employment practices of the Federal Government generally, and of individual agencies, that affect the recruitment, measurement, ranking, and selection of individuals for initial appointment and competitive promotion in the competitive service or in positions in the government of the District of Columbia required to be filled in the same manner that positions in the competitive service are filled. For the purpose of this subpart, the term "employment practices" includes the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">300.102 <span class="Italic">Policy</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This subpart is directed to implementation of the policy that competitive employment practices:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Be practical in character and as far as possible relate to matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of candidates for the jobs to be filled;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Result in selection from among the best qualified candidates;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Be developed and used without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, age (as defined by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended), disability, genetic information (including family medical history), marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, labor organization affiliation or nonaffiliation, status as a parent, or any other non-merit-based factor, or retaliation for exercising rights with respect to the categories enumerated above, where retaliation rights are available.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Insure to the candidate opportunity for appeal or administrative review, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">300.103 <span class="Italic">Basic requirements</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Job analysis</span>. Each employment practice of the Federal Government generally, and of individual agencies, shall be based on a job analysis to identify:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The basic duties and responsibilities;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The knowledges, skills, and abilities required to perform the duties and responsibilities; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The factors that are important in evaluating candidates. The job analysis may cover a single position or group of positions, or an occupation or group of occupations, having common characteristics.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Relevance</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;There shall be a rational relationship between performance in the position to be filled (or in the target position in the case of an entry position) and the employment practice used. The demonstration of rational relationship shall include a showing that the employment practice was professionally developed. A minimum educational requirement may not be established except as authorized under section 3308 of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;In the case of an entry position the required relevance may be based upon the target position when--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;The entry position is a training position or the first of a progressive series of established training and development positions leading to a target position at a higher level; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;New employees, within a reasonable period of time and <span id="Page_825"></span>in the great majority of cases, can expect to progress to a target position at a higher level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Equal employment opportunity and prohibited forms of discrimination</span>. An employment practice must not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, age (as defined by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended), disability, genetic information (including family medical history), marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, labor organization affiliation or nonaffiliation, status as a parent, or any other non-merit-based factor, or retaliation for exercising rights with respect to the categories enumerated above, where retaliation rights are available. Employee selection procedures shall meet the standards established by the "Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures," where applicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">300.104 <span class="Italic">Appeals, grievances and complaints</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Employment practices</span>. A candidate who believes that an employment practice which was applied to him or her by the Office of Personnel Management violates a basic requirement in &#x00A7; 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of its regulations.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Beech v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-3443-17-0420-I-1 (NP 2/28/2023), offered an overview of an employment practice case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "employment practice" is defined by regulation as practices that affect the recruitment, measurement, ranking, and selection of individuals for initial appointment and competitive promotion in the competitive service. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101. Employment practices include the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, measurement instruments, and practices other than merit-based tests impacting selection. <span class="Italic">Holse v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 6 (2004); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103, each employment practice of the Federal Government generally must adhere to the following basic requirements. First, an employment practice must be based on a job analysis identifying the basic duties of the position; the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform those duties; and the factors that are important in evaluating candidates for the position. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(a). Second, a rational relationship must exist between performance in the position and the employment practice used to fill the position and such relationship must be demonstrated by showing that the employment practice was professionally developed. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b). Third, an employment practice must not discriminate on the basis of any prohibited factor listed in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(c). A candidate for employment who believes that an employment practice applied to him by OPM violates an aforementioned basic requirement may file an appeal with the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish Board jurisdiction over an employment practices appeal, an appellant's appeal must concern an employment practice that OPM is involved in administering and an appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice violated one of the basic requirements set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Sauser v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6; 6 (2010). OPM need not be immediately involved in the practice in question, as an agency's misapplication of a valid OPM requirement may constitute an appealable employment practice, assuming the other jurisdictional elements are met. <span class="Italic">See Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 12 (2007) (noting that OPM can be sufficiently involved in an agency's selection process in an employment practices appeal when OPM formulated the qualification standard at issue).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly held in the initial decision, the appellant's challenge of the agency's decision that he did not meet the educational requirements for the Instructional Systems Specialist position is not an employment practices appeal within the Board's jurisdiction. While the term "employment practice" is to be construed broadly, it does not encompass the agency's rating and handling of an individual application. <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Department of Defense</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 58, 61 (1998) (holding that the Board lacked jurisdiction over an employment practices appeal when the appellant merely contested the agency's rating and handling of her individual application); <span class="Italic">see Sutton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 671 F. App'x 781, 783 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (Table) (finding that the appellant's employment practices appeal was not within the Board's jurisdiction because the appellant challenged the individual determination that his transcript was insufficient to show that he met the educational requirements).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relatedly, as determined by the administrative judge in the initial decision, the appellant does not challenge the validity or applicability of the educational requirements for the position at issue. In an employment practices appeal, misapplication of a valid OPM requirement by an agency does not mean that an agency inaccurately evaluated a candidate using a valid OPM requirement; instead, it means that the very application of the requirement to the candidate violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">See Sauser</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (finding that an appellant established jurisdiction over an employment practices appeal when alleging that an agency improperly applied OPM qualification standards because he alleged that the standards were not rationally related to performance in the position at issue). The appellant makes no such claim here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did however allege in his appeal and on review that the agency failed to apply an OPM policy relating to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3308 because it did not conduct a comprehensive evaluation of his background during the selection process.[3] While noting this issue in both an order and in the initial decision, the administrative judge did not reach a conclusion on the matter. Initial decisions must contain findings of fact and conclusions of law for the material issues presented in the record, along with the corresponding reasons or bases. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(1)-(2); <span class="Italic">see Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980). We modify the initial decision to include analysis and conclusion on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3308, agencies may not prescribe minimal educational requirements for competitive-service positions unless OPM decides that the duties are of a scientific, technical, or professional position that cannot be performed by an individual who does not have a prescribed minimum education. OPM determined that the competitive service GS-1750-11 Instructional Systems Specialist position in this appeal falls under the exception of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3308 and established educational requirements as a result. The appellant does not challenge the validity or applicability of these educational requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant continuously references the OPM policy that states that in rare occasions, agencies must conduct a more comprehensive evaluation of an applicant who does not meet the required educational requirements, but is demonstrably well qualified for the position due to a combination of education and experience. <span class="Italic">See</span> OPM, Classification &#x0026; Qualifications, General Schedule Qualification Policies, Educational and Training Provisions or Requirements, Interpreting Minimum Educational Requirements, <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-policies/">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-policies/</a> (last visited February 28, 2023). In this case, the appellant claims that he is demonstrably well qualified and the agency did not conduct a comprehensive evaluation of his background.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual agency action or decision that is not made pursuant to or as part of a rule or practice of some kind does not qualify as an "employment practice." <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">see Banks v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 157, 159-60 (1993) (finding that failure to consider the appellant's relevant education and experience and other alleged irregularities in the selection process does not constitute an "employment practice"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 26 F.3d 140 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). Here, the appellant claimed that the agency did not complete a comprehensive evaluation of his background, but has not alleged or shown that the supposed failure to do so was pursuant to or part of any rule or practice by the agency. We therefore find that <span id="Page_826"></span>the appellant's allegation, even if true, does not show that the agency's actions constituted an employment practice. <span class="Italic">See Manno v. Department of Justice</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 696, &#x00B6; 7 (2000) (finding that because the contested agency action was not made pursuant to or as part of a rule or practice, it did not constitute an employment practice).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Even if the appellant did adequately allege that the agency's failure to apply this OPM policy to his individual circumstance is an employment practice, he still does not establish Board jurisdiction over his claim, as he did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice at issue violated one of the basic requirements set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Sauser</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6; 6.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The basic requirements of a valid employment practice are at 5 CFR 300.103 (2022).

<p class="Block-Quote1">...5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(C), gives the Board authority to consider whether any agency decision is not in accordance with law, but only with respect to agency decisions that are within the Board's jurisdiction. The Board does not have general jurisdiction to entertain any statutory challenge to an employment practice. Rather, the Board's jurisdiction is strictly confined to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by statute, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Goine v. Merit Sys. Prot.

In challenges to employment practices, the relevant OPM regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a), does not give the Board jurisdiction over any and all legal challenges to employment practices; it grants jurisdiction to the Board only with respect to challenges based on the three grounds set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">See Vesser v.

In making this finding, the administrative judge considered the appellant's claim that the jurisdictional requirement that OPM was involved in administering the employment practice was met because OPM's website contained guidance regarding testing that the agency misapplied. The administrative judge noted that the appellant did not identify the website for OPM's guidance regarding setting qualification standards, and that the reference quoted by the appellant was inapplicable to her because it referred to "inservice placement," and not to an initial appointment in the competitive service like the appellant's. Moreover, the administrative judge found that, even assuming the website provisions applied to the appellant, the appellant failed to show that OPM was significantly involved in the administration of the employment practice at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not provide a reason for disturbing the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to show that the agency misapplied an OPM requirement. Furthermore, we agree with the administrative judge that, even if the OPM guidance referenced by the appellant was applicable to her, the appellant fails to show that OPM was involved in administering the alleged employment practice. For OPM to be deemed to have been involved in the administration of an agency's employment practice, OPM's involvement "must be significant." <span class="Italic">See Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 888 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Here, the appellant has failed to show that OPM was significantly involved in the test administered by the agency to Paralegal Specialist applicants. Accordingly, the Board lacks jurisdiction over this alleged employment practice. <span class="Italic">See Manno v. Department of Justice</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 696, &#x00B6; 8 (2000) (finding that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the alleged employment practice where the appellant failed to show that OPM had any involvement in the practice).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming the appellant had shown that OPM was involved in administering the alleged employment practice, she fails to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice violated one of the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. While the appellant claims that the agency's testing of Paralegal Specialist applicants violates 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103 because it discriminates based on a non-merit factor, she fails to identify any discriminatory factors utilized in the alleged employment practice. Conclusory, vague, or unsupported allegations are insufficient to meet the nonfrivolous allegation standard. <span class="Italic">See Briscoe v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 55 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An applicant for employment who believes that an employment practice applied to him by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) violates a basic requirement in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). The Board has jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) when two conditions are met: First, the appeal must concern an employment practice that OPM is involved in administering; and, second, the appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice violated one of the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Meeker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 319 F.3d 1368, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Mapstone v. Department of the Interior</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 122, &#x00B6; 7 (2008). The "basic requirements" of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103 are that employment practices "be based on a job analysis to identify: (1) The basic duties and responsibilities; (2) The knowledges, skills, and abilities required to perform the duties and responsibilities; and (3) The factors that are important in evaluating candidates." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(a). There must also be a "rational relationship between performance in the position to be filled...and the employment practice used." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b)(1). Also, "[a]n employment practice shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, partisan political affiliation, or other nonmerit factor." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(c); <span class="Italic">see Holse v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 7 (2004).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Galloway</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Galloway v. MSPB</span>, 527 Fed. Appx. 977, 979-81 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency action that is not performed pursuant to a rule, or as part of a practice of some kind, is not an employment practice. <span class="Italic">See Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887 (racial misidentification is "an irregularity in the section process rather than an application of a specific rule, provision, or policy"); <span class="Italic">Wilcox v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., Nos. 99-3314, 99-3315, 2000 WL 266481, at *3 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 9, 2000) (non-precedential) (decision to not fill a vacant position, rescind the announcement, and hire a current employee to fill another position in same office not made "pursuant to a rule or practice of some kind").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Galloway argues that the Agency's application of "non-merit" factors (the issues allegedly articulated by Ms. Phan) amounted to an employment practice. Galloway asserts that these factors were not applied to any other candidate, were not included in the vacancy announcement, and should have been assessed as part of the interview process. Galloway argues that application of these factors in this manner amounts to an employment practice because the regulatory definition includes practices that affect the "selection of individuals for...competitive promotion in the competitive service" and "includes the development and use of...other measurement instruments."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that the Agency actions at issue do not amount to an employment practice. First, Galloway's non-selection was not the result of the Agency applying a particular rule, policy, or practice. <span class="Italic">Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887. Galloway fails to identify an Agency practice or rule that prevented him from applying for the vacancy or resulted in his non-selection. To the contrary, the record establishes that Galloway applied for the vacancy, was fully considered, and then not selected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, although Galloway asserts that the Agency applied "non-merit" factors to him alone, the comments attributed to Ms. Phan indicate that his non-selection was, in fact, merit based. As Galloway explained in his brief, "merit factors" are those that reflect a candidate's "ability to perform the job." The attributes allegedly identified by Ms. Phan (an inability to articulate thoughts to senior leaders, an incapacity for critical thinking, and a lack of dependability) would, if true, certainly address Galloway's "ability to perform the job." Ms. Phan's alleged comments, therefore, appear to reflect a merit based, individual evaluation of Galloway's qualifications for the vacancy, not an application of an Agency practice, rule, or policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, contrary to Galloway's suggestion, not every action related to "competitive promotion in the competitive service" is an employment practice. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 886-87. Likewise, there is no <span id="Page_828"></span>indication that the Agency developed or used "other measurement instruments" that resulted in Galloway's non-selection. Indeed, the record reveals that Galloway was fully considered, upon merit, and not selected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Agency actions at issue here were not pursuant to a rule, practice or policy, we agree with the Board that Galloway has not identified an employment practice under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300. Galloway's failure to identify an employment practice undermines his argument that jurisdiction of the Board arises under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104. We next address whether Galloway has established sufficient OPM involvement in the Agency's actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to being an employment practice, the actions at issue must have been "applied...by the Office of Personnel Management." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). OPM's involvement in an agency's selection process, if significant, may characterize the agency's actions as being "applied...by" the OPM. <span class="Italic">See Maule v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 812 F.2d 1396, 1398 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (jurisdiction proper where the OPM made a "pivotal decision" that denied petitioner opportunity to compete for position); <span class="Italic">Lackhouse</span>, 734 F.2d at 1474 (requirement that OPM approve agency's action gave it "critical role" and made jurisdiction proper). When the OPM has a lesser role, jurisdiction is lacking. <span class="Italic">See Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 888 (jurisdiction lacking absent allegation OPM was actively involved in practices at issue); <span class="Italic">Dowd v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 745 F.2d 650, 651 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (jurisdiction lacking where the OPM "had simply been brought into the case by the [Board] as the only possible respondent under [5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a)] ").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Galloway argues that the necessary OPM involvement is present here because the OPM delegated its selection authority to the Agency and the Coast Guard's instructions regarding the program manager vacancy provide that the instructions shall be used in conjunction with 5 C.F.R. Parts 300 and 335 and appropriate issuances of the OPM. Galloway cites <span class="Italic">Lackhouse</span> as support for his contention. For its part, the Board notes that it appears the Coast Guard generally classifies all positions in concert with OPM guidelines and that this is the full extent of OPM involvement here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that Galloway has not demonstrated significant OPM involvement in his nonselection. <span class="Italic">See Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 888. Unlike in <span class="Italic">Lackhouse</span>, there is no evidence of the OPM playing a "critical role" in Galloway's non-selection. <span class="Italic">Lackhouse</span>, 734 F.2d at 1474. Although the Agency may have been generally establish that the OPM had an active role in, or influence over, Galloway's non-selection. In particular, Galloway attributes the application of "non-merit" factors, which forms the basis of his claim, to Ms. Phan, not the OPM. Nor does Galloway suggest that the OPM was involved in applying these factors to him alone. Because Galloway has not demonstrated that the OPM was significantly involved in the actions that form the basis of his claim, we agree with the Board that the necessary OPM involvement is lacking.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that Galloway has failed to demonstrate either an employment practice or significant OPM involvement, we affirm the Board's decision that it lacked jurisdiction over Galloway's claims and do not address the remaining issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Richardson v. DOD</span>, 78 MSPR 58, 60-62 (1998), involving alleged improper rating of the appellant for a position, also summarized Board jurisdiction over employment practice challenges:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is a GS-4 Supply Clerk. In 1993, the agency incorrectly rated her application for a GS-5 Supply Systems Analyst position, resulting in her not being referred on the register to the selecting official for the position. In 1994, to remedy the error, the agency gave her a one-time "special consideration" for the next GS-5 Supply Systems Analyst position to become available. In 1995, because there had been no vacancies in that position and to satisfy her equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint, the agency expanded her priority consideration to a GS-5 Inventory Management Specialist position. The appellant was then referred, but not selected, for an Inventory Management Specialist position. The agency informed her that it considered this referral as satisfying its EEO decision and her priority consideration rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for appeal, the appellant asserted that her application was incorrectly rated, causing her to miss an opportunity for a promotion, and that the agency's citation to the incorrect provision in the Federal Personnel Manual for "special consideration" led her to believe that she would receive a temporary promotion to the GS-5 Inventory Management Specialist position. She also asserted that she was discriminated against on the basis of, among other things, race and sex.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge found, and with exceptions not applicable here, an allegation of nonselection for promotion is not <span class="Italic">per se</span> appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Crum v. Department of the Navy,</span> 75 MSPR 75, 78 (1997). The appellant has not disputed this finding in her petition for review, and we find no reason to disturb it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts, however, that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.104(a). She asserts that the agency used improper "employment practices," which violated "basic requirements," in evaluating her credentials for available positions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employment practices include the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.101. "Basic requirements" provide that each employment practice shall be based on a job analysis, be rationally related to performance in the position, and not discriminate on nonmerit factors. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.103. Candidates who believe that an employment practice applied to them by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) violates a basic requirement in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.103 may appeal to the Board. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.104(a). An agency's misapplication of a valid OPM requirement under 5 CFR Part 300 also constitutes an appealable employment practice. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Banks v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 59 MSPR 157, 160 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 26 F.3d 140 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not identified a basic requirement that was missing from the instrument the agency used to evaluate her application. Rather, she is simply contesting the agency's rating and handling of her individual application. Such a challenge is not within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hannon</span>, 73 MSPR at 616-17; <span class="Italic">Dow v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 68 MSPR 285, 288 (1995). Thus, the administrative judge did not err in finding that the agency's alleged errors in rating and evaluating her application did not provide a basis for Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly stated the general rule that the appellant's discrimination allegations could not confer jurisdiction on the Board where it does not otherwise exist. In the context of an employment practice appeal, however, this rule does not apply. As previously noted, the basic requirements specifically provide that employment practices may not discriminate on nonmerit factors. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hannon</span>, 73 MSPR at 617; 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.103.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the administrative judge's overbroad statement did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights and thus does not provide a basis for reversing the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984). The appellant asserted below only that an employment practice discriminated against her individually. The Board's jurisdiction is limited to claims that an employment practice is generally applied in a discriminatory fashion or is inherently biased against a certain group of individuals. <span class="Italic">Hannon</span>, 73 MSPR at 617; <span class="Italic">Dow,</span> 68 MSPR at 288-89. Thus, the administrative judge correctly dismissed the appellant's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Dow</span>, 68 MSPR at 288-90.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Employment practice challenges are directed to practices that exclude individuals from initial appointments. They do not exist to challenge procedural rules that do not have a substantive or merit-based effect upon an individuals ability to secure an initial appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chadwell v. MSPB</span>, 629 F.3d 1306 (Fed. Cir. 2010), discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-444.html#sec1-438">Selection and Examination Practices for Administrative Law Judges</a>." The employment practice case may avoid a direct challenge to an OPM rule, but instead argue an agency's misapplication of the rule to the appellant, <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. OPM</span>, DA-300A-12-0651-I-1 (NP 11/4/2013) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. OPM</span>, 708 Fed. Appx. 669 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...However, the appellant is not challenging the validity of the rule of three <span class="Italic">per se</span>, and in fact he appears to admit that it is valid. Rather, he is arguing that this employment practice was inapplicable to him. <span class="Italic">See Dowd v. United States</span>, 713 F.2d 720, 724 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (the applicability of a valid OPM requirement can be considered by the Board to the same extent as any other employment practice); <span class="Italic">accord Scott v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The Board has sometimes rendered this proposition as "an agency's misapplication of a valid OPM requirement may constitute an employment practice." <span class="Italic">E.g., Sauser v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6; 7 (2010). Although not inaccurate, this statement of the law is potentially misleading to the extent that the word "misapplication" suggests that an individual agency action or decision that is not a rule or practice of some kind may qualify as an employment practice. It may not. <span class="Italic">Saya v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 493, 496 (1995). "Misapplication" in this context should be taken to refer to an agency's practice of applying an inapplicable examination, certification, or selection rule, as discussed in <span class="Italic">Lackhouse</span>, 773 F.2d at 315, and <span class="Italic">Dowd</span>, 713 F.2d at 724. <span class="Italic">See generally Prewitt v.

<p class="Body-Text">Of a straightforward nonselection, <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> AT-300A-11-0278-I-1 (NP 12/8/2011), determined that no appealable employment practice existed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appeal must concern an employment practice that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is involved in administering; and second, the appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice violated one of the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The "basic requirements" are that an employment practice be: (1) based on a job analysis that sets forth the duties of and qualifications for the position; (2) relevant to performance in the position; and (3) nondiscriminatory. <span class="Italic">Maule v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although the concept of an employment practice is to be construed broadly and is not restricted to examinations, measurement tools, and qualifications relating to merit, claims that an agency did not fully consider a particular candidate's relevant education and experience and other similar alleged irregularities in the selection process do not constitute appealable employment practices. <span class="Italic">See Prewitt</span>, 133 F.3d at 887. Rather, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(b), a candidate may file an appeal of his or her examination rating or the rejection of his or her application with OPM, or an agency with delegated examining authority, when applicable. Thus, the Board does not have jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) to review the appellant's factual allegations that the agency erred in rating him not minimally qualified for the position, nor does it have the authority under this regulation to review the appellant's allegation that a co-worker was improperly selected for the position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Evaluation of an individual application for a job did not support Board jurisdiction to review an employment practice, <span class="Italic">Sutton v. VA,</span> DC-300A-14-0641-I-1 (NP 4/12/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reiterates his arguments, raised below, that the agency and OPM erred in determining that his DAWIA transcript was insufficient to demonstrate that he met the education qualification requirement for the position. However, the appellant is not challenging the validity or applicability of the qualification requirement, but rather, is merely arguing that the agency and OPM should have found him qualified for the Supervisory Contract Specialist position based on that requirement. As such, the appellant is challenging the rating and handling of his individual application, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over such a claim. <span class="Italic">See Richardson v. Department of Defense</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 58, 61 (1998) (finding that the Board lacked jurisdiction over an employment practices appeal where an appellant failed to identify any basic requirement that was missing from the instrument that the agency used to evaluate her application, and instead, merely contested the agency's handing and rating of her individual application); <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 157, 160 (1993) (finding that an appellant's allegations that an agency failed to fully consider his education and experience in making a selection for a position did not establish jurisdiction over an employment practices claim), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 26 F.3d 140 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the appellant notes on review, the Board has found that an agency's "misapplication" of a valid OPM requirement may constitute an employment practice for purposes of Board jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). <span class="Italic">See Sauser</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Mapstone v. Department of the Interior</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 122, &#x00B6; 8 (2008). However, "misapplication" in this context does not mean that the agency or OPM inaccurately evaluated a candidate using a valid OPM requirement. Rather, it means that the very application of the requirement to the candidate violated one of the basic requisites of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">See Dowd v. United States</span>, 713 F.2d 720, 721-24 (Fed.

In other words, "misapplication of a valid OPM requirement" refers to the applicability of a requirement, rather than to the method of its application. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Sauser</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10; <span class="Italic">Mapstone</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 122, &#x00B6; 8. Here, because the appellant does not challenge the applicability of the education qualification requirement at issue, he has not alleged that the agency "misapplied" that qualification requirement. In sum, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to establish jurisdiction over his employment practices appeal.</p>

The term "employment practice," defined in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101, includes the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments.

Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Department of Defense</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 58, 61 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reviewing the appeal filed in this case in light of the additional submissions filed with the PFR, it appears the appellant is arguing that the competitive examination utilized by the agency does not properly assess the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform the duties of the QA Officer position. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(a), employment practices of the Federal Government must be based on a job analysis to identify: (1) the basic duties and responsibilities; (2) the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform the duties and responsibilities; and (3) the factors that are important in evaluating candidates. There must also be a "rational relationship between performance in the position to be filled...and the employment practices used," proof of which includes a showing that "the employment practice was professionally developed." 5 C.F.R. 300.103(b). Finally, an employment practice shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, partisan political affiliation, or other nonmerit factor. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(c). Pursuant to this section, as well as the authority set forth above, we conclude that the appellant's claim may be an appealable employment practice under 5 C.F.R. Part 300, Subpart A. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant raises an employment practice claim, an AJ must inform the appellant of the burden of proving her claim, the burden of going forward with the evidence, and the type of evidence necessary to prove her claim. <span class="Italic">Cf. Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue). Here, however, because the AJ did not have the benefit of the documents submitted on review, the acknowledgement order provided no information about how to establish the Board's jurisdiction over an employment practice claim. Accordingly, we will forward this claim to the Atlanta Regional Office for docketing as a separate appeal. The AJ can then inform the appellant of her jurisdictional burden and afford the parties an opportunity to present evidence and argument on her employment practice claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will review a challenge to the validity of a test raised under Part 300 of the OPM regulations; however, it does not appear that the Board will review a challenge to the requirement that the appellant take the examination because her qualifications are demonstrated through prior job experience. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v. OPM</span>, 11 MSPR 576, 578-79 (1982). Because "employment practices" are defined by regulation to encompass only initial appointment and competitive promotion in the competitive service, they do not encompass reclassification of employees' positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crum v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 75 MSPR 75, 79 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board will not review statutory provisions governing the employment process through an employment practice challenge, the Board will consider OPM's interpretation of statutes applied to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vesser v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board appears to lack the jurisdiction to determine whether an employment practice violates the Veterans Preference Act; the jurisdiction under 5 CFR 300.104(a) is limited to the grounds set forth in 5 CFR 300.103. <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum v.

<p class="Body-Text">An AJ is required to place an appellant on notice of the jurisdictional requirements of an appeal involving a challenged employment practice. In <span id="Page_830"></span>what was styled a nonselection case, not ordinarily in the appellate jurisdiction of the Board (or IRA and VEOA or USERRA cases), <span class="Italic">Parker v. DHUD</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/PARKER_ADRON_DA_3443_07_0005_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_280908.pdf">106 MSPR 329</a>, 331-32 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8, 2007 MSPB 187 (2007), the Board remanded the case for jurisdictional development and proper advice of jurisdictional requirements to the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the PFR, the appellant's primary argument pertains to the AJ's deferral of discovery until the issue of jurisdiction could be resolved. We will address this issue after we address a larger concern in this appeal, the apparent lack of <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> notice regarding the Board's employment practices jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the acknowledgment order, the AJ included a brief statement that gave the appellant <span class="Italic">general</span> notice about the issue of jurisdiction and instructed him to file evidence and argument on that issue within 15 days. The appellant filed a response that stated, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "I offer 5 C.F.R. Section 1201.3(a)(19) as support for my argument. I feel that the agency's action was not in the spirit of fairness and equality. The AJ issued no further notice on jurisdiction and instead issued the ID several weeks later.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the general statement on jurisdiction in the acknowledgment order was appropriate at the time it was issued, the appellant's reply necessitated an additional show-cause order setting forth a more explicit explanation about the evidence and arguments he would need to present to allege nonfrivolously that his appeal fell within the Board's employment practices jurisdiction. As with any other basis for jurisdiction, when an appellant raises an employment practices claim, an AJ must inform him with specificity of his burden of proving the claim, his burden of going forward with the evidence, and the types of evidence necessary to make a nonfrivolous allegation. <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of Justice,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 13 (2007); <span class="Italic">Holse v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 8 (2004); <span class="Italic">see Burgess,</span> 758 F.2d at 643-44. The acknowledgment order did not do this.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An AJ's failure to provide an appellant with proper <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> notice may be cured if the agency's pleadings contain the notice that was lacking in the acknowledgment order or later show-cause orders, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Nichols v. Department of the Interior,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 386, 388-89 (1996), or if the ID itself puts the appellant on notice of what he must do to establish jurisdiction, thus affording him the opportunity to meet his jurisdictional burden in the PFR, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Fleming v. Department of Labor,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 341, &#x00B6; 9 (2004); <span class="Italic">see also Milam v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 485, &#x00B6; 10 (2005). Neither situation was the case here. The agency response states simply as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Appellant's Response refers to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3[(a)] (19) to establish jurisdiction, but Appellant has not detailed what employment practice or basic requirement in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103 he believes has been violated. Since nonselection is not an appealable action and Appellant has not offered any other facts on which to establish the Board's jurisdiction, Appellant's appeal should be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the ID, treatment of the appellant's jurisdictional allegation is limited to a single footnote stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3[(a)] (19) pertains to employment practices. An employee who believes that the Office of Personnel Management has applied an employment practice to him that violates a requirement of the basic employment practice regulations may file an appeal with the Board.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 300.103, 104(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, therefore, the AJ shall fully inform the appellant of his jurisdictional burden pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) and afford the parties an opportunity to present evidence and argument on that issue. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Manno v. Department of Justice,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 696, &#x00B6; 6 (2000) <span class="Italic">(citing Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1998)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Potes v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-3443-13-0556-I-1 (NP 7/25/2014) ("Although the appellant raised an employment practices claim during the proceedings below, the administrative judge did not provide him with explicit information on what is required to establish jurisdiction based on employment practices. In addition, the administrative judge did not address the appellant's employment practices claim in the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980) (an initial decision must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, resolve issues of credibility, and include the administrative judge's conclusions of law and his legal reasoning, as well as the authorities on which that reasoning rests)."); <span class="Italic">Gingery v. OPM</span>, CH-300A-13-0240-I-1 (NP 2/14/2014) ("When an appellant raises an employment practices claim, an administrative judge must inform the appellant of the burden of proving his claim, the burden of going forward with the evidence, and the type of evidence necessary to prove his claim. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue)."). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Whipple v. VA</span>, NY-3443-15-0286-I-1 n.6 (NP 2/2/2016) ("Ordinarily, an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Here, however, the appellant's vague assertions below regarding his employment practices claim did not trigger a duty on the part of the administrative judge to provide him with his burden of proof over this claim. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Parker v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 329, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2007) (remanding the appeal for the administrative judge to provide the appellant with <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> notice on his employment practices claim where he clearly raised this claim below).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The significance of the availability of a contract grievance procedure to address potential employment practice challenges that might otherwise be considered by the Board was addressed in <span class="Italic">Holse v. USDA</span>, 97 MSPR 624, 627-28 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, another potential jurisdictional issue. In its response to the petition for appeal, the agency asserted that the appellant is covered by a collective bargaining agreement and that the agency's action could have been grieved under the agreement's negotiated grievance procedure. The agency did not, however, submit a copy of the applicable provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1), the negotiated grievance procedure is the exclusive means for resolving grievances that fall within its coverage, with certain exceptions. Under one such exception, an aggrieved party who is affected by a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) may appeal to the Board from an action that is otherwise covered by the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d); <span class="Italic">McCann v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 288, 293-94 (1993); <span class="Italic">Morales v. Department of Defense</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 226, 229 (1992). Accordingly, even assuming that the appellant is able to satisfy her jurisdictional burden under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a), if the agency's assertion regarding the appellant's ability to grieve the agency action under the negotiated grievance procedure is correct, she is precluded from adjudicating her claim before the Board unless it falls within one of the exceptions to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1).</p>
