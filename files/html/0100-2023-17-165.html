<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-163"><span class="space">F.</span> VIOLATION OF PUBLIC POLICY</h3>
<p class="noindent">Few exceptions are filed alleging that awards violate public policy rather than a particular law or regulation, but FLRA will address the public policy exception, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapter 299 and Dept. of Treasury, OCC</span>, 68 FLRA 835, 840 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1942"></span>The Union argues that the award is contrary to the public policy "supporting expanding telework." For an award to be found deficient on this basis, the asserted public policy must be "explicit," "well defined," and "dominant," and a violation of the policy "must be clearly shown."[75] In addition, the appealing party must identify the policy "by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests."[76]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[75]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, White Sands Missile Range, White Sands Missile Range, N.M.</span>, 67 FLRA 619, 622 (2014) (<span class="Italic">White Sands</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB, Region 9, Cincinnati, Ohio</span>, 66 FLRA 456, 459 (2012) (<span class="Italic">NLRB</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[76]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 66 FLRA at 459).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union relies on the same arguments that it relies on in making its contrary-to-law, essence, and bias exceptions. Specifically, the Union claims that the award "undermines...[this] public policy" because the Arbitrator gave "excessive deference" to the Agency, did not require the Agency to support its decision with "objective" evidence and did not rule on the "tru[th]" of the Agency's reason for denying the grievant's telework request. As discussed above, we find that these various claims lack merit. Therefore, even assuming, without deciding, that the asserted public policy is sufficiently explicit, well defined, and dominant,[79] the Union has not "clearly shown"[80] that the award violates the alleged public policy supporting expanding telework.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[79]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 66 FLRA at 459 (quoting <span class="Italic">W.R. Grace &#x0026; Co. v. Local Union 759, Int'l Union of United Rubber Workers of Am</span>., 461 U.S. 757, 766 (1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[80]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">White Sands</span>, 67 FLRA at 622 (quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 66 FLRA at 459).</p>
<p class="noindent">The nature of the exception was described, <span class="Italic">Defense Security Assistance Dev. Ctr. and AFGE Local 2004</span>, 60 FLRA 292, 293-94 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will find an award deficient as contrary to public policy.&#x2003;However, we have stated that this ground is "extremely narrow." <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin., </span>32 FLRA 765, 767 (1988) (quoting <span class="Italic">United States Postal Serv. v. NALC, </span>810 F.2d 1239, 1241 (D.C. Cir. 1987)) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). For an award to be found deficient, the public policy must be explicit, well-defined, and dominant. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The appealing party must identify the policy "by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 768 (quoting <span class="Italic">W.R. Grace &#x0026; Co. v. Rubber Workers, </span>461 U.S. 757, 766 (1983) (<span class="Italic">Grace</span>)). To prevail, the appealing party must clearly show that the award violates the asserted public policy. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Union fails to establish that the Arbitrator's award of priority consideration for promotion violates public policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Union argues that the Agency's conduct, not the Arbitrator's award, violates the public policies set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 335.103(b)(5) and 2635.902. Accordingly, these policies provide no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's public policy argument with respect to the award is that public policy requires meaningful and appropriate arbitration remedies and that the remedy of priority consideration in this case is not meaningful or appropriate to correct the Agency's improper conduct. However, the Union fails to cite any explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy that proscribed the Arbitrator from awarding priority consideration for promotion in circumstances where there was no established causal connection between the Agency's unwarranted actions and the failure of the grievants to be promoted. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the explicit policy on arbitration remedies recognized by the Authority has always been one of according broad discretion to arbitrators in the fashioning of appropriate remedies. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Veterans Admin., </span>24 FLRA 447, 450 (1986) ("[B]oth the Authority and Federal courts have consistently emphasized the broad discretion to be accorded arbitrators in the fashioning of appropriate remedies."). The Union's asserted policy on meaningful and appropriate remedies is insufficient to override this clearly articulated policy on arbitration remedies. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 2172, </span>57 FLRA 625, 629<span class="Italic"> </span>(2001). In addition, as recognized by the Agency, the Arbitrator's remedy of priority consideration is specifically supported by Authority precedent. In several cases where an arbitrator awarded a promotion without the required causal connection, the Authority ruled that the appropriate remedy was priority consideration and substituted that remedy for the deficient promotion remedy. <span class="Italic">See Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Houston, Tex., </span>36 FLRA 122, 128 (1990) (and cited cases).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At best, this exception is based on "general considerations of supposed public interest[,]" which fail to establish the necessary explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2172, </span>57 FLRA at 629<span class="Italic"> </span>(quoting <span class="Italic">Grace, </span>461 U.S. at 766).

<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7122(a)(2) of the Statute, an award will be found deficient on grounds similar to those applied by federal courts in private sector labor relations cases.

<p class="noindent-1">We construe the Union's argument that the award encourages agencies to violate their collective bargaining obligations because the award fails to implement a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy as an exception that the award is <span id="page_1943"></span>contrary to public policy. A failure to order <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>relief, however, does not by itself make an award contrary to public policy. Moreover, the Union has failed to identify a policy requiring a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy in these circumstances. Indeed, the Authority previously has held that, where a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy is inappropriate, other "traditional" remedies, including a cease-and-desist order and a posting of a notice of the ULP--such as those ordered by the Arbitrator here--are also available. <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins Air Force Base, Ga., </span>53 FLRA 1664, 1671 (1998) (citing <span class="Italic">F.E.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's public policy exception claims that the award is inconsistent with the "covered by" doctrine. However, the "covered by" doctrine is a defense to a statutory duty to bargain; it does not apply as a defense to a contractual obligation to bargain, and, thus, the Arbitrator's finding of a contractual violation does not conflict with the doctrine. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def., Nat'l Guard Bureau, Adjutant Gen., Kan., Nat'l Guard</span>, 57 FLRA 934, 936-37 (2002) (<span class="Italic">Nat'l Guard</span>). With regard to the Arbitrator's separate finding of a statutory failure to bargain, the Authority has declined to find a matter "covered by" an agreement where the agreement specifically contemplates bargaining. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Energy, W. Area Power Admin., Golden, Colo.</span>, 56 FLRA 9, 12 (2000) (<span class="Italic">DOE)</span>. As the Arbitrator found that the CBA specifically contemplated bargaining, there is no basis for concluding that the finding of a statutory violation conflicts with the "covered by" doctrine.[6] For these reasons, even assuming that the "covered by" doctrine is an "explicit," "well-defined," and "dominant" public policy, the Agency has not "clearly shown" a violation of such policy. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Guard</span>, 57 FLRA at 936-37; <span class="Italic">DOE</span>, 56 FLRA at 12.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Additionally, even if the finding of a statutory violation conflicts with the "covered by doctrine, discussed above, we find that the finding of a CBA violation provides a separate and independent basis for the award. We note that in <span class="Italic">Federal Bureau of Prisons v. FLRA</span>, 2011 WL 2652437 (D.C. Cir. July 8, 2011) (<span class="Italic">Federal Bureau of Prisons</span>), the court rejected the Authority's contention that the award was based on separate and independent grounds because the "award [made] no distinction between the purportedly 'separate' statutory and contractual grounds for the award." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at *6. However, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Federal Bureau of Prisons </span>because, here, the Arbitrator clearly distinguished between the separate grounds he relied on in the award. As the Agency has not shown that the finding regarding the CBA is deficient, any deficiency in the statutory finding does not provide a basis for setting aside the award. <span class="Italic">See Soc. Sec. Admin., Fredericksburg Dist. Office</span>, 65 FLRA 946, 949 (2011).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Underseas Warfare Ctr. and NAGE, FUSE</span>, 54 FLRA 1495, 1500-01 (1998), reviewed the public policy exception in the context of an award granting FEPA overtime incurred while in travel status:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the Arbitrator's award granting overtime to the grievant for time spent in travel status is contrary to public policy because it ignores applicable law and precedent pertaining to pay decisions of this type....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant was entitled to overtime under FEPA violates an "explicit" public policy based on "well defined" and "dominant" laws and legal precedents. Rather, the Agency's exception is a reiteration of its nonfact and contrary to law exceptions. As explained above, these exceptions provide no basis for finding the award deficient. Applying Authority precedent, the Agency's exception does not provide a basis for finding the award deficient under section 7122(a)(2) of the Statute as contrary to public policy. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R3-10 and U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 51 FLRA 1265, 1270-71 (1996); <span class="Italic">Social Security</span>, 32 FLRA at 767-68.

<p class="noindent-1">As noted previously, the Agency argues that the award is contrary to public policy. Although the Authority will find an award deficient when it is contrary to public policy, this ground is "extremely narrow."[68] For an award to be found deficient as contrary to public policy, the asserted public policy must be "explicit," "well defined," and "dominant,"[69] and a violation of the policy "must be clearly shown."[70] The appealing party must also identify the policy "by reference to the laws and legal precedents."[71] As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has explained, this ground for reviewing arbitration awards is "extremely narrow" because "judges have no license to impose their own brand of justice in determining applicable public policy; thus, the exception applies only when the public policy emanates from clear statutory or case law, '<span class="Italic">not from general considerations of supposed public interests</span>.'"[72]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the award is contrary to public policy because the Arbitrator "failed to take account of the unique national[-]security implications involved in this matter," and "made no determinations concerning these national[-]security concerns, or the proper weight that they should be accorded." The Agency also argues that "[d]isallowing chiefs, deputy chiefs, and supervisors from changing [the grievants' schedules] to address pending inclement weather is contrary to public policy, given[&#8197;] the [p]residential implications involved"--specifically, because the area at issue includes the White House.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Few would dispute that ensuring a drug-free workplace within the federal government is a well-established public policy that is enshrined in official language. For example, in addition to Executive Order 12,564--which the Agency raises in an argument that we are dismissing above--the U.S. Office of Personnel Management has issued official guidance on prohibiting drug use amongst the federal workforce.[44] Moreover, the Agency's concerns regarding the negative impact of drug use on workplace performance are supported by a wealth of scientific studies[45] and are consistent with findings made by other components of the federal government.[46] In addition to these sources, we are confident that there exists a wealth of other supporting documents to bolster the Agency's argument that the award is contrary to public policy.</p>
