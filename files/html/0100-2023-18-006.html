<p class="noindent">A FSIP decision is not directly reviewable in court. The decision may be reviewed only indirectly, after the party fails to comply and a ULP complaint is issued and adjudicated. <span class="Italic">Nevada NG and NAGE Local R12-130</span>, 7 FLRA 245, 252-53 (1981); <span class="Italic">see DODDES and FEA Stateside,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-116.html">72 FLRA 601</a>, 603 (2021) (Chairman DuBester concurring) ("The Authority has repeatedly stated that Panel orders are not directly reviewable by the Authority or the courts. Instead, the Statute provides a particular avenue for parties to challenge a Panel order. Specifically, it is a ULP for an agency or a labor organization 'to fail or refuse to cooperate in impasse procedures and impasse decisions.' Only a party that fails or refuses to comply with a Panel order, and is consequently charged with a ULP, may then challenge the Panel's order." [footnotes omitted]) (recon. den., <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-35.html">73 FLRA 149</a> (2022), <span class="Italic">Antilles Consol. Educ. Assn. v.

Cir. 1985) ("Decisions of the Impasses Panel are not directly reviewable by the courts...&#8197;A party's failure to abide by the Impasses Panel's order can, however, be challenged as an unfair labor practice. After the Authority has issued its findings and order in an unfair labor practice proceeding, the parties may seek review in the courts."); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury v. FLRA</span>, 707 F.2d 574, 577 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1983) ("The Panel's decision is reviewable, first before the Authority, then in court, in an unfair labor practice proceeding.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Reviewability of FSIP decisions was explored in <span class="Italic">Council of Prison Locals v. Brewer</span>, 735 F.2d 1497, 1498-1502 (D.C. Cir. 1984). The union sought to obtain review of what it considered to be a lopsided FSIP decision following factfinding by a Panel hearing officer:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This appeal presents the question of whether the orders of the Federal Service Impasses Panel (Impasses Panel or Panel) are generally subject to direct judicial review. Upon examining the relevant statutory provisions and legislative history, we conclude that Congress intended to vest in the Panel broad and final authority to put an end to disputes in which negotiations have failed to produce a settlement. Accordingly, while we are cognizant of the heavy presumption in favor of judicial review of agency action, we nevertheless hold that Congress precluded direct judicial review of Panel orders, except in extraordinary circumstances not present in this case. We note, however, that Panel orders are reviewable indirectly in the context of unfair labor practice proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we recognize that access to judicial review of agency actions should be restricted only upon a clear and convincing showing that Congress intended to prohibit such judicial oversight. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dunlop v. Bachowski,</span> 421 U.S. 560, 567, 95 S. Ct. 1851, 1857, 44 L. Ed.2d 379 (1975); <span class="Italic">Local 1219, American Federation of Government Employees v. Donovan,</span> 683 F.2d 511, 517 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Our examination of the relevant indicia of congressional intent, set forth below, convinces us that Congress meant to foreclose direct judicial review of Impasses Panel orders. We therefore affirm the district court's dismissal of this action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statute establishes the Impasses Panel as "an entity within" the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA or Authority), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7119(c)(1), and authorizes it to investigate "promptly" any negotiation impasse and to "take whatever action is necessary and not inconsistent with this chapter to resolve the impasse," <span class="Italic">id.</span> Sec. 7119(c)(5)(A), (B)(iii). The statute thus commits to the panel broad authority to make swift decisions in order to end disputes in which the negotiation process between a federal agency and its employees has failed.[1]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;Unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Local 1219, American Federation of Government Employees,</span> in this case the Panel has not restricted its discretion through the adoption of regulations. <span class="Italic">Compare Local 1219,</span> 683 F.2d at 515-16 (describing regulatory scheme that "does not contemplate that the Director shall have complete discretion") <span id="page_2507"></span>with 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2471.11 (reiterating statutory language; Panel "may take whatever action is necessary and not inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. chapter 71 to resolve the impasse"). Furthermore, in <span class="Italic">Local 1219,</span> we noted that "permissive language would [not] offer conclusive evidence of congressional intent to preclude review." 683 F.2d at 516 n.16. In this case, however, there is a great deal more evidence--in the statutory language and in the legislative history--that Congress intended to restrict judicial review. <span class="Italic">See infra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the statute makes the Panel's orders "binding on [the] parties during the term of the agreement, unless the parties agree otherwise." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Sec. 7119(c)(5)(C). While section 7123 specifically provides for judicial review of orders by the Authority, there is no provision for such review of Panel orders, and Panel orders are not appealable even to the Authority. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Sec. 7105. Accordingly, the statute gives every reasonable indication that orders by the Impasses Panel are final and nonreviewable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which gave statutory recognition to the Impasses Panel,[2] confirms this understanding. First, the Administration's proposed bill provided for no review of Panel orders; in fact, section 305 of the proposed bill would have rendered "[t]he decisions of the Authority on any matter within its jurisdiction...final and not subject to judicial review." H.R.Doc. No. 341, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 7 (1978) (message from the President transmitting Proposal to Reform the Federal Personnel Management System), reprinted in Subcommittee on Postal Personnel and Modernization of the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., Legislative History of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 637 (1979) [hereinafter Legislative History]. The Senate bill made all Panel orders appealable to the Authority, but restricted judicial review of Authority decisions to include appeals only from unfair labor practice proceedings, except when constitutional questions were raised. <span class="Italic">See</span> Legislative History at 567, 584-85, 604-05 (sections 7204(c)(4), 7216(f) and 7235(h) of S. 2640); H.R. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 153 (1978) (Conference Report), reprinted in Legislative History at 821, U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, p. 2723. Thus, the Administration's proposed bill and the Senate bill both envisioned that Panel orders would generally not be subject to direct judicial review.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;The Impasses Panel was first established by Executive Order as an agency within the Federal Labor Relations Council. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec. Order 11491 Secs. 5, 17 (Oct. 29, 1969) (the Panel "in its discretion...may settle the impasse by appropriate action"). No judicial review was provided for in the Executive Order program. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Personnel Management Project, Option Paper Number Four p I(c)(2), reprinted in Legislative History at 1362.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the purposes of our review today, the House bill is of primary importance, because its provision regarding the Impasses Panel was incorporated verbatim into the final Act. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 124 Cong. Rec. H9698 (daily ed. Sept. 13, 1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> Legislative History at 977-78 (section 7119 of H.R. 11280) <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7119. As the House Committee Report that accompanied the bill explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Notice of any final action of the Panel must be promptly served upon the parties, and the action is final and binding upon the parties during the term of the agreement, unless the parties agree otherwise. Final action of the Panel under this section is not subject to appeal, and failure to comply with any final action ordered by the Panel constitutes an unfair labor practice....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">H.R. Rep. No. 1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 54 (1978), reprinted in Legislative History at 700 (emphasis supplied). A clearer suggestion that Congress intended no appeal from Panel decisions would be difficult to imagine.[4] We therefore find that Congress has restricted the courts from subjecting Panel actions to direct judicial scrutiny.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;In addition, the Conference Report restricts its discussion of judicial review to the "decisions of the Authority" and "matters that are appealable to the Authority." H.R. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 153 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> Legislative History at 821, U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, p. 2887. Under the bill as reported by the Conference Committee, just as in the final Act, Panel orders were not appealable to the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, our conclusion today does not mean that absolutely no judicial review of Panel orders is available. As the House report, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> noted, "failure to comply with any final action ordered by the Panel constitutes an unfair labor practice." <span class="Italic">See also </span>5 U.S.C. Sec. 7116(a)(6), (b)(6) (it is an unfair labor practice for an agency or a labor organization "to fail or refuse to cooperate in impasse procedures and impasse decisions"). Once the Authority issues findings of fact and an order in an unfair labor practice proceeding, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7118(a)(7), the parties may seek review in the courts of appeals, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> Sec. 7123(a). In such an appeal, the courts may review the validity of the Panel order in question. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA,</span> 712 F.2d 640, 641 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1983) ("Panel decisions are reviewable, first by the Authority, then in court in an unfair labor practice proceeding."); <span class="Italic">Department of Treasury v. FLRA,</span> 707 F.2d 574, 577 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (same). In light of our examination of the statute and its legislative history, we agree with the district court that this specific review procedure, established by the statute, forecloses the assumption of general federal question or mandamus jurisdiction. 562 F. Supp. at 851.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of course, in exceptional circumstances, a district court may exercise federal jurisdiction to invalidate a Panel order made "in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition of the Act." <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne,</span> 358 U.S. 184, 188, 79 S. Ct. 180, 184, 3 L. Ed.2d 210 (1958). The invocation of <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> jurisdiction is extraordinary; to justify such jurisdiction, there must be a "specific provision of the Act which, although it is 'clear and mandatory,'" was nevertheless violated by the Panel. <span class="Italic">Physicians National House Staff Association v. Fanning,</span> 642 F.2d 492, 496 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">Leedom,</span> 358 U.S. at 188, 79 S. Ct. at 183), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 450 U.S. 917, 101 S. Ct. 1360, 67 L. Ed.2d 342 (1981). In this case, the Council contends that the Panel's order exceeds its statutory authority because, according to the Council, the Panel "may not direct parties to agree to proposals or make concessions."[5] However, section 7119(c)(5)(B)(iii), which authorizes the Panel to "take whatever action is necessary and not inconsistent with this chapter to resolve the impasse," appears to contemplate imposed settlements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA,</span> 712 F.2d at 646 &#x0026; n.24; <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA,</span> 691 F.2d 565, 569 n.26 (D.C. Cir. 1982), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 103 S. Ct. 2085, 77 L. Ed.2d 297 (1983); <span class="Italic">Department of Defense v. FLRA,</span> 659 F.2d 1140, 1146 (D.C.

Ed.2d 658 (1982); <span class="Italic">see also Nebraska Military Department v. FLRA,</span> 705 F.2d 945, 950 n.7 (8th Cir. 1983). Thus, the Panel's action does not clearly exceed its authority in the respect alleged by the Council.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;To support its claim, the Council relies upon section 7103(a)(12) of title 5, which defines "collective bargaining." Under this provision, the obligation to engage in collective bargaining "does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or to make a concession." This definition of collective bargaining, however, does not settle the question of the scope of the Panel's authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Leedom</span> jurisdiction might be justified by a showing that the Panel's action was clearly not "consistent with" chapter 71 of title 5. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 7119(c)(5)(B)(iii). For example, a Panel order might clearly impinge upon employees' rights established by 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7102, or clearly disregard the rights and duties of agencies and recognized bargaining units established by 5 U.S.C. Secs. 7106, 7111-7114. We find no such clear departure from the requirements of chapter 71 in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Council complains that "the [Panel's] decision is arbitrary and not in accordance with law, since it includes no explanation for the actions taken by the Panel. However, nothing in the Act requires the Panel to articulate reasons or to make findings; instead, as we explained <span class="Italic">supra</span> at 4-5, the statute contemplates swift, decisive action by the Panel to settle an impasse. While the Administrative Procedure Act enables a reviewing court to set aside agency action found to be "arbitrary and capricious," 5 U.S.C. Sec. 706(2)(A), it does not apply when the relevant statutes "preclude review" or when the relevant agency action "is committed to discretion by law," <span class="Italic">id.</span> Sec. 701(a). In the present circumstances, the Panel order at issue in this case is outside the reach of APA standards.[7] In any event, the APA does not clearly oblige the Panel to give reasons for its actions, and such clarity of obligation is necessary for the exercise of <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The APA does not afford "an implied grant of subject-matter jurisdiction permitting federal judicial review of agency action." <span class="Italic">Califano v. Sanders,</span> 430 U.S. 99, 107, 97 S. Ct. 980, 985, 51 L. Ed.2d 192 (1977). Similarly, the Declaratory Judgment Act does not create an independent federal jurisdictional basis. <span class="Italic">See Skelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co.,</span> 339 U.S. 667, 671-72, 70 S. Ct. 876, 878-879, 94 L. Ed. 1194 (1950); <span class="Italic">Potomac Passengers Ass'n v. Chesapeake &#x0026; Ohio Ry. Co.,</span> 520 F.2d 91, 97 (D.C. Cir. 1975). We do not decide today whether federal jurisdiction might exist over a declaratory action filed in anticipation of an impending unfair labor practice proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we believe that our decision today is consistent with the public policies embodied in the statutory scheme of review. The Impasses Panel serves as a mechanism of last resort in the speedy resolution of disputes, after negotiations have failed. By providing no direct recourse to the courts, the Congress evidently intended to supplement speed with finality.[8] The availability of protracted litigation would undermine these values of speed and finality evidenced in the statutory scheme. <span class="Italic">See Devine v. White,</span> 697 F.2d 421, 435-36 (D.C. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Physicians National House Staff Association v. Fanning,</span> 642 F.2d 492 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 450 U.S. 917, 101 S. Ct. 1360, 67 L. Ed.2d 342 (1981). While on occasion such a scheme may result in uncorrected errors of judgment, it <span id="page_2508"></span>is Congress, and not this court, that has the authority to alter the scheme of review.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;As the Federal Personnel Management Project explained in 1977, "the Federal sector has few incentives to the parties to reach an agreement--in particular, there are not strike deadlines, with default costs, as exist in the private sector." Legislative History at 1402. In addition, "[w]ithout some form of finality, fact finding in difficult cases may be only a waste of time." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1403. Accordingly, the Project looked to the Impasses Panel to bring "finality to the negotiation process." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1400.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;We recognize, however, the shortcomings of the unfair labor practices proceeding as the exclusive means for assuring judicial review of Panel orders. The decision to defy an existing labor contract--even if the relevant contract term were imposed by a Panel order--is not to be taken lightly. Such defiance could subject the union to prolonged administrative proceedings, followed perhaps by a cease and desist order, before judicial review could be available. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7118. Furthermore, in many situations--for instance, where an employee benefit rather than a burden is at issue--it is difficult to see what the union could do to challenge the disputed contract term, since it may not resort to a "strike, work stoppage, or slowdown" under pain of decertification. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Sec. 7120(f).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Presented with such a choice, it is most likely that a union would often go along with the contract, and relinquish the opportunity for judicial review, rather than risk such calamities. Perhaps Congress wished to pay this price in return for swift and final Panel authority. In any event, our decision today adheres to the language and legislative history of the Act. Of course, Congress remains free to alter the scheme of review as it sees fit.</p>
<p class="noindent">Jurisdiction to review an FSIP decision was revisited and again found wanting in <span class="Italic">NATCA v. FSIP</span>, 437 F.3d 1256, 1257-1266 (D.C. Cir. 2006), involving refusal of FSIP to become involved in an impasse, based on a determination that FSIP lacked jurisdiction to entertain the dispute because statutory provisions established a separate personnel system for the FAA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress established a distinct regulatory framework for collective bargaining between federal agencies and their employees under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-7135 (2000). Within this statutory framework, the Federal Service Impasses Panel ("FSIP," "Impasses Panel," or "Panel") serves as a forum "of last resort in the speedy resolution of disputes" between a federal agency and the exclusive representatives of its employees "after negotiations have failed." <span class="Italic">Council of Prison Locals v. Brewer,</span> 735 F.2d 1497, 1501 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Therefore, decisions of the FSIP generally are not subject to direct judicial review. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1498. A federal district court may exercise jurisdiction to review a Panel order only "in exceptional circumstances" as defined by <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne,</span> 358 U.S. 184 (1958), and its progeny. <span class="Italic">Brewer,</span> 735 F.2d at 1500-01.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2003, contract negotiations between the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") and two of the unions representing its employees, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, AFL-CIO ("NATCA"), and the Professional Airways Systems Specialists, AFL-CIO ("PASS"), broke down. In July 2003, the Unions sought the assistance of the Panel. However, the FSIP declined to exercise jurisdiction over the bargaining impasses because, after receiving the parties' submissions, the Panel was uncertain whether it had the authority to resolve the disputes. The Unions then filed suit against the Panel and the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA" or "Authority") in District Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to <span class="Italic">Leedom.</span> The District Court granted summary judgment to the defendants, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the Panel's decision not to assert jurisdiction over the parties' collective bargaining disputes. The Unions have appealed. The FAA appears as <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span> in support of the Impasses Panel and the FLRA. We affirm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Leedom</span> provides an extremely limited exception to the nonreviewability of FSIP orders. In this case, the Unions have failed to demonstrate either of the predicates necessary for <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> jurisdiction: The specific statutory provision identified by the Unions is not sufficiently "clear and mandatory" to require the Panel to exercise jurisdiction over these disputes, <span class="Italic">Leedom,</span> 358 U.S. at 188, and the Unions have failed to show that, without the District Court's exercise of jurisdiction, they have no "meaningful and adequate means of vindicating [their] statutory rights," <span class="Italic">Bd. of Governors, Fed. Reserve Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc</span>., 502 U.S. 32, 43 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties disagree over the import of 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 106(l). The FAA argues that &#x00A7; 106(l) divests the FSIP of jurisdiction over bargaining impasses between the FAA and union bargaining agents with respect to "compensation and benefits." In other words, the agency claims that it is only required to bargain "to the extent provided for in section 40122(a)." And under &#x00A7; 40122(a)(2), the FAA cannot be required to use the services of the FSIP. The Unions disagree, pointing out that the first line of &#x00A7; 106(l) says "[e]xcept as provided in subsection[&#8197;]...(g) of section 40122," and that &#x00A7; 40122(g) in turn expressly incorporates Chapter 71 bargaining rights. Neither the Panel nor the Authority has taken a position on the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On September 22, 2003, the FAA responded by filing an objection to the FSIP's jurisdiction. Based on its interpretation of the provisions of the 1996 FAA Act, the FAA argued that the Unions' Requests for Assistance should be denied, because Congress had decreed that disputes between the FAA and its unions concerning changes to the Personnel Management System should be directed, first, to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, and then, if agreement cannot be reached, to Congress. The FSIP had no role to play, according to the FAA. In this case, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service procedure had been exhausted, so the proper remedy, the FAA argued, was for the FAA to make the required submission to Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Unions replied in turn that the FAA's construction of the 1996 FAA Act was wrong. The crux of the Unions' argument before the Panel was that 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(a) governs procedures for negotiating changes to the Personnel Management System and that subsection (a) has no application in the context of recurring collective bargaining between the FAA and its unionized employees. And, further, according to the Unions, 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g) expressly confirms that Chapter 71, which governs labor-management relations, applies to collective bargaining disputes between the FAA and unions representing agency employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 9, 2004, the Panel issued its decisions. In each case, the Panel explained that "[a]fter due consideration of the request for assistance...the Panel in accordance with its regulations, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2471.6(a)(1), declines to assert jurisdiction because it is unclear whether the Panel has the authority to resolve the parties' impasse." <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, DC and NATCA, AFL-CIO</span>, Case No. 03 FSIP 144 at 1 (Jan. 9, 2004), reprinted in J.A. 25 ("<span class="Italic">NATCA Decision</span>"); <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, DC and PASS, AFL-CIO</span>, Case Nos. 03 FSIP 149, 150, 151, and 157 at 1 (Jan. 9, 2004), ("<span class="Italic">PASS Decision</span>"). The Panel found that the FAA "ha[d] raised arguable questions concerning whether the Panel has the authority to resolve collective bargaining disputes over the compensation and benefits of FAA's bargaining-unit employees." The Panel thus concluded that the various "statutory provisions subject to conflicting interpretations[&#8197;] <span class="Italic">must be addressed in an appropriate forum before the Panel commits its resources to assist the parties</span> in resolving the merits of their impasse." The Panel assured the parties that its determination would not prejudice any party's right to file another request for assistance should an appropriate forum determine that the FSIP indeed continues to have jurisdiction over collective bargaining disputes between the FAA and the Unions over compensation and benefits. The FSIP's Letter to PASS added that its determination was neither an explicit nor implicit endorsement of the FAA's statutory interpretation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 30, 2004, the Unions filed suit against the FSIP and the Authority in the District Court. The Unions sought a declaration that the Panel's decisions violated its mandatory statutory duties under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7119 and thereby deprived NATCA, PASS, and the affected FAA employees of their statutory rights. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Air Traffic Controllers Ass'n v. Fed. Serv. Impasses Panel</span>, CA No. 04-138, 2005 WL 418016, at *2 (D.D.C. Feb. 22, 2005). The Unions also sought an order directing the Panel to provide assistance in resolving the Unions' impasses with the FAA. Apparently, that same day, in accordance with the procedures set forth in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(a)(2), the FAA submitted to Congress its final bargaining proposals for the 11 NATCA-represented units, together with a statement that it intended to impose the agency's proposed changes sixty days following the transmittal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An order of the FSIP is not reviewable "except in extraordinary circumstances," because "Congress precluded direct judicial review of Panel orders." <span class="Italic">Brewer,</span> 735 F.2d at 1498. The Unions argue that this case presents an "extraordinary circumstance," because the FSIP had a <span class="Italic">mandatory</span> statutory duty under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7119(c)(5) to assist the Unions and the FAA in resolving their collective bargaining impasses. The Unions also contend that there is nothing in the 1996 FAA Act or in the FAA Personnel Management System that divests the Panel of this mandatory statutory duty, so the Panel's refusal to address the parties' bargaining impasses was a flagrant abdication of its statutory duty. Thus, according to the Unions, the District Court plainly erred in declining to exercise jurisdiction under <span class="Italic">Leedom.</span> Appellees respond that <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> jurisdiction is not available in the instant case, because the Panel's determination not to assert jurisdiction was not a violation of a clear and mandatory statutory provision, and because the Unions can seek redress from the FLRA for any alleged wrongdoing in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ultimately, this case turns on the scope of <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Leedom,</span> <span id="page_2509"></span>the relevant statute provided that the National Labor Relations Board ("Board") "shall not...decide that any unit is appropriate for [collective bargaining] purposes if such unit includes both professional employees and employees who are not professional employees unless a majority of such professional employees vote for inclusion in such unit." 358 U.S. at 185 (internal quotation marks omitted). The statute was, thus, "clear and mandatory" with respect to the Board's obligations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 188. The Board nonetheless refused to allow professional employees to vote before certifying a bargaining unit that combined professional and nonprofessional employees. It was therefore clear that the Board had "attempted [to] exercise power that had been specifically withheld." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 189. Under these circumstances, the Court held that the federal district court had jurisdiction to set aside the certification, even though Board certification orders are interlocutory and, therefore, normally not subject to judicial review. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 187, 191. The Court explained that it could not "lightly infer that Congress does not intend judicial protection of rights it confers against agency action taken in excess of delegated powers." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 190.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This so-called <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> jurisdiction can apply in cases involving either negative or positive statutory commands. <span class="Italic">Ry. Labor Executives' Ass'n v. Nat'l Mediation Bd.,</span> 29 F.3d 655, 661-62 (D.C. Cir.) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), <span class="Italic">amended by </span>38 F.3d 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1994).

FLRA,</span> 283 F.3d 339, 344 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). This point cannot be overstated, because, as the parties in this case recognize, <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> jurisdiction is extremely narrow in scope.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court in <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> held that the district court had jurisdiction because the Board's order was "in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the [National Labor Relations] Act," which "[was] clear and mandatory," 358 U.S. at 188, and the "'absence of jurisdiction of the federal courts' would [have] mean[t] 'a sacrifice or obliteration of a right which Congress' ha[d] given," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 190. And "'[c]entral' to the decision in <span class="Italic">Leedom,</span> the Court has since explained, was the understanding that barring district court review would have 'wholly deprive[d] the union of a meaningful and adequate means of vindicating its statutory rights,"' because the union's members had "'no other means, within their control'" of obtaining judicial review." <span class="Italic">Sturm, Ruger &#x0026; Co. v.

Thus, in order to justify the exercise of <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> jurisdiction, a plaintiff must show, first, that the agency has acted "in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition" which "is clear and mandatory," <span class="Italic">Leedom,</span> 358 U.S. at 188, and, <span class="Italic">second</span>, that barring review by the district court "would wholly deprive [the party] of a meaningful and adequate means of vindicating its statutory rights," <span class="Italic">MCorp,</span> 502 U.S. at 43. The Unions have not satisfied these requirements in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the FAA and the Unions have raised compelling arguments regarding the proper interpretation of the disputed statutory provisions.&#x2003;It is precisely because of this that we cannot conclude that the Panel's decisions in this case contravened a clear and specific statutory mandate, as required by <span class="Italic">Leedom</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 358 U.S. at 188. On the record before us, it appears that the Panel reasonably questioned whether it had jurisdiction to act. Therefore, it cannot be said that the FSIP violated "a specific and unambiguous statutory directive." <span class="Italic">United Food &#x0026; Commercial Workers, Local 400 v. NLRB</span>, 694 F.2d 276, 278 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if the Unions' view of the Panel's jurisdiction is correct, they still could not assert jurisdiction under <span class="Italic">Leedom,</span> because they have not been "wholly deprive[d]...of a meaningful and adequate means of vindicating [their alleged] statutory rights." <span class="Italic">MCorp,</span> 502 U.S. at 43. The brief to this court submitted on behalf of the FSIP and the FLRA strenuously contends that the Unions' grievances in this case should be presented to and addressed by the FLRA. We agree. If their claims have merit, the Unions can vindicate their statutory rights and gain appropriate redress before the FLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the FLRA has held that, where an agency has a duty to negotiate, a unilateral change in conditions of employment is a refusal to consult or negotiate in good faith and thus an unfair labor practice. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst. Bastrop</span>, Tex., 55 F.L.R.A. 848, 852 (1999). Therefore, if the FAA refuses to participate in proceedings before the Panel to resolve collective bargaining impasses between the agency and the Unions and then unilaterally implements its proposals, the Unions will have an additional basis for asserting unfair labor practice charges before the FLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, if the Unions' interpretation of the disputed statutory provisions is correct, then it is clear that they have viable unfair labor practice charges that can be raised with and addressed by the FLRA. Thus, the Unions are not without possible redress for the alleged violations of their statutory rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is also clear that any alleged unfair labor practices must be addressed in the first instance by the FLRA--not by the FSIP, the District Court, or this court. <span class="Italic">See AFGE,</span> 778 F.2d at 854 (explaining that "[t]he Authority has held that" Chapter 71's grant of jurisdiction to the FLRA to resolve issues regarding a party's duty to bargain in good faith "preclude[s] the Impasses Panel from considering negotiability issues"); <span class="Italic">Steadman v. Governor, U.S. Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 918 F.2d 963, 966 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (finding that the "district judge improperly interjected the federal judiciary, at a premature stage into [Chapter 71's] carefully developed system of administrative review," by adjudicating the parties' dispute before an unfair labor practice charge had been filed with the Authority); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. FLRA,</span> 476 U.S. 19, 23 (1986) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (agreeing that except in extraordinary circumstances the Courts of Appeals are without jurisdiction to consider an issue not raised before the FLRA). Matters such as statutory unfair labor practice charges, which are properly within the jurisdiction of the FLRA, should be addressed by the Authority in the first instance to allow it to "bring[&#8197;] its expertise to bear on the resolution of those issues." <span class="Italic">EEOC v. FLRA,</span> 476 U.S. at 23.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in a sequel to <span class="Italic">NATCA,</span> a district court had jurisdiction to consider whether a declaratory judgment action could be pursued to determine if FSIP had jurisdiction over an impasse it considered beyond its statutory authority to resolve, <span class="Italic">NATCA v. FSIP</span>, 606 F.3d 780, 782-88 (D.C. Cir. 2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (the Union) and the Federal Aviation Authority reached an impasse in collective bargaining, the Union sought the aid of the Federal Service Impasses Panel. The FSIP declined to assert jurisdiction, whereupon the Union sued the FSIP, the FAA, and the Federal Labor Relations Authority, seeking both a declaratory judgment that the FSIP had jurisdiction over an impasse involving the FAA and an injunction requiring the FSIP to assert jurisdiction over all such pending and future impasses. The district court dismissed the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. For the reasons that follow, we affirm that order insofar as it applies to the FAA but reverse it with respect to the FSIP and the FLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We first explain the roles played by the agencies involved in this suit.&#x2003;We then recount the factual and procedural background of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The FLRA and the FSIP</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "Congress established a distinct regulatory framework for collective bargaining between federal agencies and their employees under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute," which was passed as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and codified in Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code. <span class="Italic">NATCA v. FSIP,</span> 437 F.3d 1256, 1258 (D.C. Cir. 2006) [hereinafter <span class="Italic">NATCA 1</span>]. "The Statute grants federal agency employees the right to organize, provides for collective bargaining, and defines various unfair labor practices." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Employees v. Dep't of Interior,</span> 526 U.S. 86, 88 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA is "primarily responsible for administering" the Statute. <span class="Italic">NATCA I,</span> 437 F.3d at 1258. Much as the National Labor Relations Board does for the private sector, the FLRA "determine[s] the appropriateness of units for labor organization representation," "conduct[s] elections to determine whether a labor organization has been selected as an exclusive representative" and, most relevant here, "conduct[s] hearings and resolve[s] complaints of unfair labor practices" arising out of negotiations between a federal agency employer and the union that represents its employees. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2). Except in circumstances not relevant here, a final order issued by the FLRA is reviewable in the court of appeals. <span class="Italic">Turgeon v. FLRA,</span> 677 F.2d 937, 938 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel of the FLRA, who "serves at the pleasure of the President," has by statute "separate authority" from that of the FLRA. <span class="Italic">Turgeon,</span> 677 F.2d at 938 n.4. Her principal duties are to investigate unfair labor practice charges, issue unfair labor practice complaints arising from those charges, and prosecute those complaints before the FLRA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> A union or an employer accusing its counterpart of an unfair labor practice first submits a charge to a Regional Director of the FLRA, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.6(a), who, acting "on behalf of the General Counsel," investigates the charge, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.8(a), and decides whether to issue a complaint, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.10(a). If the Regional Director dismisses the charge, then the charging party may appeal that decision to the General Counsel, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.11(c), but the General Counsel's decision whether to issue a complaint is not subject to judicial review, <span class="Italic">see Turgeon,</span> 677 F.2d at 940.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FSIP, "an entity within the" FLRA, "serves as a forum of last resort in the speedy resolution of disputes between a federal agency and the exclusive representatives of its employees after negotiations have failed." <span class="Italic">NATCA I,</span> 437 F.3d at 1257-58 (citing <span class="Italic">Council of Prison Locals v. Brewer,</span> 735 F.2d 1497, 1501 (D.C. Cir. 1984)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The FSIP must "promptly investigate any impasse presented to it," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7119(c)(5)(A), and then "either (1) Decline to assert jurisdiction...[for] good cause...or (2) Assert jurisdiction," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2471.6(a). If the FSIP asserts jurisdiction, then it may ultimately "take whatever action is necessary and not inconsistent with [the Statute] to resolve the impasse," <span id="page_2510"></span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7119(c)(5)(B)(iii), "including binding arbitration," <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n. of Gov't Employees v. FLRA,</span> 691 F.2d 565, 569 n.26 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2471.6(a)(2)(ii). A decision of the FSIP declining to assert jurisdiction over an impasse "is not reviewable 'except in extraordinary circumstances,' because 'Congress precluded direct judicial review of Panel orders.'" <span class="Italic">NATCA I,</span> 437 F.3d at 1262 (quoting <span class="Italic">Brewer,</span> 735 F.2d at 1498).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Factual and Procedural Background</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The present drama unfolded in two acts, the first beginning in 2003 and the second in 2006. We begin, however, with a brief prologue reviewing the statutory provisions that form the background for these events.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1995 the Congress "directed the FAA to establish its own personnel management system." <span class="Italic">NATCA I,</span> 437 F.3d at 1259. In 1996, one day after the FAA had established its system, the Congress exempted that system from the requirements of Title 5 of the U.S. Code (Government Organizations and Employees) except, in relevant part, those in Chapter 71, i.e., the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1259-60;<span class="Italic"> see </span>49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(C) (providing exemption). Later that year the Congress enacted 49 U.S.C. 106(2), which provides: "In fixing compensation and benefits...the Administrator [of the FAA] shall not engage in any type of bargaining, except to the extent provided for in section 40122(a)" of Title 49. <span class="Italic">See NATCA I,</span> 437 F.3d at 1260. That section in turn requires the FAA to negotiate with the representative of its employees before making a change to its personnel management system; if such negotiation reaches an impasse, then the FAA must first use the "services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service" and, if mediation fails, "transmit[&#8197;] the proposed change...to Congress."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2003 the FAA reached an impasse in contract negotiations with both the NATCA and the Professional Airways Systems Specialists, another union. <span class="Italic">NATCA I,</span> 437 F.3d at 1258. The two Unions "sought the assistance" of the FSIP. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The FAA argued the FSIP lacked jurisdiction because, although 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7119 generally provides the FSIP with jurisdiction over an impasse between a federal agency and a union, 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 106(0 specifically prohibits the FAA from bargaining over compensation and benefits except as provided in 40122(a), which makes no mention of the FSIP. <span class="Italic">NATCA I,</span> 437 F.3d at 1260-61. In January 2004 the FSIP declined to assert jurisdiction on the ground that it was "unclear whether [it] ha[d] the authority to resolve the parties' impasse." The Panel went on to say the question whether the Congress had divested it of jurisdiction over compensation-related impasses involving the FAA "must be addressed in an appropriate forum before the [FSIP would] commit[&#8197;] its resources" to assist in "resolving the merits of [the] impasse." The FSIP did not indicate what forum it believed was "appropriate."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Unions then sued the FSIP and the FLRA in the district court, seeking both a declaration that "the FSIP's decisions...are in violation of specific provisions of the Panel's statutory authority" and an order that the FSIP "proceed forthwith to resolve the existing impasses." Citing <span class="Italic">Brewer,</span> the district court held it did not have jurisdiction to review the decision of the FSIP and dismissed the case. <span class="Italic">NATCA v. FSIP,</span> No. Civ. A. 04-0138(RMC), 2005 WL 418016, at *4-5 (Feb. 22).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We affirmed, explaining that "a Panel order" is subject to review in district court only in the "exceptional circumstances" identified in <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne,</span> 358 U.S. 184 (1958), viz., where (1) the agency acts "in excess" of its "delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition" that "is clear and mandatory," and (2) denying review "would wholly deprive [a party] of a meaningful and adequate means of vindicating its statutory rights." <span class="Italic">NATCA I,</span> 437 F.3d at 1263 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither requirement was met in that case.&#x2003;There was no "specific and unambiguous statutory directive" about the jurisdiction of the FSIP over an impasse between the FAA and a union; on the contrary, there were "compelling arguments" on each side "regarding the proper interpretation of the disputed statutory provisions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1264. In addition, "the Unions [could] vindicate their statutory rights and gain appropriate redress before the FLRA." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1265. We then described a path by which the Unions could seek review in that forum, namely, by challenging the FAA's refusal to submit to the jurisdiction of the FSIP as an "unfair labor practice." If the General Counsel filed a complaint based upon that charge, then the FLRA would have to answer the underlying question about jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1265.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our decision, however, was not the last word on the 2003 impasse. As it happened, even before we heard its appeal the Union had filed an unfair labor practice charge concerning that impasse, and after we issued our decision a Regional Director of the FLRA entered into a "unilateral Settlement Agreement" with the FAA in lieu of issuing a complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2006 the Union again reached an impasse with the FAA and again requested help from the FSIP, which again declined to assert jurisdiction, giving again the explanation it had given in 2004. In due course the Union again filed an unfair labor practice charge alleging the FAA had "refused to bargain under the auspices" of the FSIP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A Regional Director of the FLRA dismissed that charge on the ground that "issuance of a complaint [was] not warranted" because 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(a) deprived the FSIP of jurisdiction over the impasse. The Union appealed to the General Counsel, who denied both the appeal and the Union's subsequent motion for reconsideration. Because the General Counsel did not issue a complaint, the question of the FSIP's jurisdiction raised by the unfair labor practice charge was never put before the FLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2008 the Union sued the FSIP, the FLRA, and the FAA. It sought both a declaration that "the FSIP has mandatory jurisdiction to resolve impasses between the FAA and labor organizations...of the same kind and extent as its mandatory jurisdiction over such impasses between other federal agencies and exclusive representatives of their employees" and an injunction in support of that declaration. In its motion for summary judgment, the Union argued the exception provided in &#x00A7; 40122(a) and referred to in &#x00A7; 106(0 does not "divest the FSIP of its...jurisdiction" over an impasse between the FAA and one of its unions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FSIP and the FLRA moved to dismiss, arguing the Union was seeking review of a decision of the FSIP, which review was beyond the jurisdiction of the court. The FAA filed its own motion to dismiss, contending in addition that (1) the Union did not have standing to sue the FAA because the "harm [it] alleged...is not 'traceable' to the FAA and cannot be redressed by that Agency"; and (2) the Union "failed to plead facts indicating that it can receive relief from the FAA."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court granted the agencies' motion to dismiss the suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court explained that "the [FLRA] is the appropriate forum to determine whether the Panel has jurisdiction," <span class="Italic">NATCA v. FSIP,</span> 582 F. Supp.2d. 18, 19 (2008), and that therefore the court did not have jurisdiction to review "[a] decision by the FLRA's General Counsel to settle or dismiss an unfair labor practice charge, instead of issuing a complaint," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 21. In the court's view, the Union effectively had asked it to do just that, seeking "the same [ruling] it sought before the Panel and before the FLRA a ruling that the Panel has jurisdiction to resolve these impasses." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The specific impasse that prompted the Union to seek assistance from the FSIP in 2006 was resolved in 2009 through mediation.[*] The Union and the FAA continue to negotiate about other matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*] The appellees do not argue this suit is therefore moot, but we must consider the question nonetheless. <span class="Italic">See Ass 'n of Admin. Law Judges v. FLRA,</span> 397 F.3d 957, 960 n.* (D.C. Cir. 2005). We conclude the suit is not moot because the plaintiff is "seek[ing] declaratory relief as to an ongoing policy." <span class="Italic">Del Monte Fresh Produce Co. v. United States,</span> 570 F.3d 316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">see Entergy Servs., Inc. v. FERC,</span> 391 F.3d 1240, 1246 (D.C. Cir. 2004) ("it is true that a petitioner with a mooted individual controversy may at times have standing to challenge an ongoing policy"); <span class="Italic">City of Houston, Tex. v. Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev.,</span> 24 F.3d 1421, 1429 (D.C. Cir. 1994) ("if a plaintiff's specific claim has been mooted, it may nevertheless seek declaratory relief forbidding an agency from imposing a disputed policy in the future"). The plaintiff must still have standing to challenge the policy and the "request for declaratory relief [must be] ripe." <span class="Italic">Del Monte,</span> 570 F.3d at 321; <span class="Italic">see Entergy Servs.,</span> 391 F.3d at 1246.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In this case the Union has standing because the disputed policy injures it both by denying it recourse to the services of the FSIP with respect to impasses that will likely arise between it and the FAA in the foreseeable future and by denying the Union, in negotiations with the FAA, whatever leverage it derives from the ability to threaten recourse to the FSIP. We determine whether a request for declaratory relief is ripe by "evaluat[ing] both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration." <span class="Italic">Toca Producers v. FERC,</span> 411 F.3d 262, 289 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quoting <span class="Italic">Abbott Labs. v. Gardner,</span> 387 U.S. 136, 149 (1967)). "In applying the ripeness doctrine to agency action we balance the interests of the court and the agency in delaying review against the petitioner's interest in prompt consideration of allegedly unlawful agency action." <span class="Italic">Toca,</span> 411 F.3d at 289. The issue here involves a pure question of law, and neither the court nor agencies have a cognizable interest in delaying review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We review "<span class="Italic">de novo</span> the district court's grant of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Piersall v. Winter,</span> 435 F.3d 319, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2006). We consider first whether the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this case because, as in <span class="Italic">NATCA I,</span> the complaint seeks review of an unreviewable decision of the FSIP or of the General Counsel of the FLRA....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reviewability </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues the district court has subject matter jurisdiction because it is seeking a declaratory judgment rather than "review of, or relief from an administrative determination by the General Counsel...or the FSIP." The agencies all contend the court does not have jurisdiction because the Union is seeking review of just such a decision, review of which is precluded by a specific statute and therefore cannot be founded <span id="page_2511"></span>upon "more general grants of judicial authority," such as 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1331 (federal question jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There can be no doubt, and the petitioners agree, the district court lacks jurisdiction to review the decisions of the FSIP and of the General Counsel respectively declining jurisdiction over the impasse and refusing to issue an unfair labor practice complaint. <span class="Italic">See NATCA I,</span> 437 F.3d at 1258; <span class="Italic">Turgeon,</span> 677 F.2d at 940. Unlike the complaint the Union filed in 2004, however, its complaint in this case does not ask the court to review either of those decisions. Whereas the Union in the former case asked the court to "[d]eclare...the FSIP's decisions of January 9, 2004 [declining jurisdiction were] in violation of specific provisions of the Panel's statutory authority," the Union's complaint here identifies no specific decision of the FSIP or of the General Counsel. Rather, it complains of the "FSIP's refusal to exercise its mandatory...jurisdiction over...negotiation impasses between the FAA and labor organizations representing its employees" and asks the court to "[d]eclare...the FSIP has mandatory jurisdiction to resolve [such] impasses." [**]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[**] That the Union also seeks an injunction does not alter our analysis of whether it is asking the district court to review an unreviewable decision; the injunction is merely a means by which to enforce the requested declaratory judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Declaring the FSIP has jurisdiction over impasses between the FAA and the Union would not require the district court to review the decision of the FSIP declining jurisdiction on the ground that an "appropriate forum" had not yet addressed whether it had such jurisdiction. The FSIP did not reach, let alone answer, the question whether it has jurisdiction over impasses between the FAA and the Union. Nor would the district court need to review the General Counsel's decision not to issue a complaint. The effect of that decision was to prevent the FLRA from adjudicating the Union's unfair labor practice charge and the claim entailed therein that the FSIP does indeed have mandatory jurisdiction over an impasse involving the FAA.[***] Nothing the district court does will reverse the decision not to issue a complaint in this case. Because the Union does not seek review of a decision of either the FSIP or the General Counsel, the district court erred in dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[***] The Union charged the FAA with failing to bargain in good faith because the FAA objected to the FSIP asserting jurisdiction over the impasse. If the FSIP had jurisdiction, then the FAA was acting in bad faith when it refused to accept the mediation and other services of the FSIP. As we explained in <span class="Italic">NATCA I</span>: "[I]f the Unions' interpretation of the disputed statutory provisions [defining the jurisdiction of the FSIP] is correct, then it is clear that they have viable unfair labor practice charges that can be raised with and addressed by the FLRA." 437 F.3d at 1265.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agencies and the district court all seem to have read <span class="Italic">NATCA I</span> so broadly as to require that any question about the jurisdiction of the FSIP even one that does not entail reviewing a decision of the Panel be submitted to the FLRA in the garb of an unfair labor practice charge and resolved by the FLRA before a court may consider it.[****] In <span class="Italic">NATCA I,</span> however, we determined only that, under <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne,</span> a decision of the FSIP to decline jurisdiction over a bargaining impasse is not reviewable in court until the FLRA has first reviewed it. 437 F.3d at 1258. In the present case the Union does not seek review of an FSIP decision; hence <span class="Italic">NATCA I</span> has no bearing upon the jurisdiction of the district court.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[****] <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> FAA's Br. 6 (NATCA I held "the proper course of action for the Unions to resolve the issue of the appropriate impasse mechanism for FAA and its Unions was by filing" an unfair labor practice charge); FSIP's Br. 11 (NATCA I held the "proper forum for addressing the underlying question of the Panel's jurisdiction is the FLRA"); <span class="Italic">NATCA v. FSIP,</span> 582 F. Supp.2d 18, 19 (D.D.C. 2008) (<span class="Italic">NATCA I</span> held in order to "determine whether the [FSIP] is an available mechanism to resolve certain types of impasses" the "proper course of action" is to "file an unfair labor practices charge...with the FLRA").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor is there reason to believe the Congress intended to keep the courts from ever considering a question about the jurisdiction of the FSIP until the FLRA has passed upon it.&#x2003;Indeed if every such question had to be framed as an unfair labor practice charge and resolved first by the FLRA, then it would be the General Counsel who, by her exercise of unreviewable discretion not to issue a complaint, could strip the court of jurisdiction over issues concerning the reach of the FSIP's authority. We do not believe the Congress intended the General Counsel of the FLRA to exercise such control over our jurisdiction.[*****]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*****] We are not unaware the Supreme Court has said "the FLRA shall [first] pass upon issues arising under the [Statute], thereby bringing its expertise to bear on the resolution of those issues." <span class="Italic">EEOC v. FLRA</span>, 476 U.S. 19, 23 (1986). The agencies properly do not cite that case because the Court made the quoted statement in relation to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123, which provides a party seeking review of a final order of the FLRA may not raise an "objection that has not been urged before the Authority." The Union is not seeking review of a final order of the FLRA indeed, the FLRA has issued no final order nor is the Union belatedly raising in court any objection to the FSIP's refusal to assert jurisdiction over its impasse with the FAA that the Union failed to raise before the agencies.</p>
