<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-45"><span class="space">5.</span> Factual Dispute</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the "wholly unfounded" test, if the agency evidence is reasonable but unconvincing, fees may be denied (the result may be different under the "substantial innocence" test). If an agency has evidence, but it is not sufficient to support an appeal, the agency's actions are not clearly without merit or wholly unfounded. <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Army</span>, 5 MSPR 216, 218, 5 MSPB 265 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Batchelder v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 14 MSPR 37, 39-40 (1982) ("The fact that the presiding official later found that the charge was not supported by a preponderance of the evidence does not establish that it was negligently brought or was clearly without merit.... Rather, we find that the agency reasonably believed that appellant committed the infraction as charged, particularly in view of his failure to respond to the charge in his oral reply."). If there is a close factual question concerning a central charge against the appellant, a Board determination will be upheld that the charge is not clearly without merit. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 674 F.2d 714 (8th Cir. 1982). If an agency has reason to believe that the appellant was unable to perform his duties because of his physical condition, counsel fees would not be awarded under the clearly without merit standard only because the appellant prevailed by showing that he could do his work without hazard to himself or others. <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Army</span>, 21 MSPR 672, 674-75 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Perez v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 52, 54, 4 MSPB 142 (1980), the issue was whether a finding that the agency failed to sustain its burden by a preponderance of the evidence was equivalent to a finding that the charges were clearly without merit. The case, involving an employee accused of falsifying the time records of a subordinate employee, turned on credibility. Ultimately, on conflicting evidence, the AJ ruled for the appellant based on a polygraph test result introduced at the hearing. The appellant refused to take a polygraph test offered to him before the adverse action was taken. The AJ concluded that, on the basis of conflicting evidence and the failure of the appellant to take the polygraph the demotion, the agency acted reasonably. But the AJ decided that a fee award was appropriate because, having failed to meet the preponderance test, the agency action was without merit and sufficiently close to the statutory example of an action that is "clearly without merit" to justify an award of fees. The Board reversed the AJ, justifying denial of a fee on the basis that it was a close case, the deciding factor being the polygraph test that the appellant could have taken, but did not, prior to the demotion. The Board refused to conclude that the action was clearly without merit or that the appellant was substantially innocent. In the Board's judgment, that result would equate to a fee award for prevailing in an adverse action, providing no distinct meaning to the interest of justice standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clay v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 22 MSPR 602, 604 (1984) ("Thus, the record establishes that the agency had a reasonable basis for taking the adverse actions since appellant's failed to explain their absences during the nation-wide strike prior to their removals. Appellants have, therefore failed to show that the actions were clearly without merit, wholly unfounded, or that they were substantially innocent of the charges, or that the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceedings. <span class="Italic">Allen, supra,</span> at 593, 593 n.35, n.37.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The concept of the close case was further developed in <span class="Italic">Kruger v. VA</span>, 95 MSPR 471, 474-77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-14 (2004), involving reversal of the denial of a step increase. The Board reversed the AJ's award of fees. The Board noted that the agency "did present probative evidence in support of its charges, even though the agency ultimately did not prevail, so the agency's action cannot be seen to be clearly without merit." If fees are denied under the "clearly without merit" category when an agency submits probative but unpersuasive evidence, few awards are going to be made under this category. The Board's decision will need to await development in future cases before its true import is determined. But the import in <span class="Italic">Kruger</span> was that the appellant obtained no fees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to be entitled to an award of attorney fees, an appellant must show that: (1) An attorney-client relationship exists pursuant to which counsel rendered legal services on the appellant's behalf in connection with a Board proceeding; (2) the appellant was the prevailing party; (3) an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice; and (4) the fees requested are reasonable. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1); <span class="Italic">Diehl v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 104 &#x00B6; 10 (2001); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 635 &#x00B6; 8 (2000). Here, there is no dispute that an attorney-client <span id="Page_4574"></span>relationship existed and that the appellant incurred fees in connection with her appeal. Nor is there any dispute that the appellant is the prevailing party. At issue in this appeal is whether an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An attorney fee award by the Board may be warranted in the interest of justice when, e.g.: (1) The agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice; (2) the agency action was clearly without merit or wholly unfounded, or the employee was substantially innocent of the charges; (3) the agency initiated the action in bad faith; (4) the agency committed a gross procedural error; or (5) the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits<span class="Italic">. Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2 MSPB 582, 2 M.S.P.R. 420, 434-35 (1980). However, the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories are merely "directional markers" towards the goal of awarding fees only when doing so is in the interest of justice<span class="Italic">. Uhlig v. Department of Justice</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 660 &#x00B6; 14 (2000). The <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories are not exhaustive or exclusive<span class="Italic">. See Boese v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388, 391 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the AJ based his award of fees entirely upon his finding that the agency's action was clearly without merit. The clearly-without-merit test for an award of attorney fees is based upon of the result of the case before the Board, not upon evidence and information available to the agency at the time that it took the action. <span class="Italic">Gensburg v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 187 &#x00B6; 6 (1998). In addition, the Board examines the degree of fault on the employee's part and the existence of any reasonable basis for the agency's action. <span class="Italic">Uhlig,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 660 &#x00B6; 23; <span class="Italic">DiGiulio v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 659, 666-67 (1995). An award of fees is warranted under the clearly-without-merit category where the appellant prevails on substantially all of the charges and the agency's unsustained charges were wholly unfounded because incredible or unspecific evidence was presented<span class="Italic">. Akin v. Department of the Army</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 61, 63 (1985). However, this test does not mean that every time an employee prevails before the Board, she is entitled to fees<span class="Italic">. Massa v. Department of Defense</span>, 833 F.2d 991, 993-94 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Department of the Army</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 350 &#x00B6; 8 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the AJ found that the appellant was entitled to an award of fees under the clearly-without-merit category because she prevailed in her appeal. This finding impermissibly conflates the concepts of "prevailing party" and "interest of justice." It is well settled that evidence sufficient to render an appellant a prevailing party does not necessarily establish that she is entitled to attorney fees in the interest of justice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">Uhlig</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 660 &#x00B6; 11. The appellant is most certainly a prevailing party. However, we find that the AJ erred by concluding that, because the appellant was a prevailing party (i.e., because the agency did not prove its case), the appellant was automatically entitled to an award of attorney fees under the clearly-without-merit category. The AJ was required to conduct some analysis of whether an award of fees was warranted in the interest of justice based on something more than the fact that the appellant was successful in her appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find, under the facts and circumstances of this case, that the agency's action was not clearly without merit and that an award of fees is not warranted in the interest of justice. In so finding, we are cognizant of precedent holding that it is the characterization of the evidence set forth in the Board's final order on the merits that controls review of a subsequent attorney fees request. <span class="Italic">Yorkshire v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 746 F.2d 1454, 1458 (Fed. Cir. 1984); Gensburg, 80 M.S.P.R. 187 &#x00B6; 5. We are also cognizant of direction from our reviewing court that "factually close" cases do not automatically fall into the class of cases in which fees are not available in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">See Thomson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 772 F.2d 879, 881 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the fact of the matter is that this case was a close call. This is borne out by the fact that the two voting Board members could not agree as to the disposition of the appeal on review. One Board member believed that the AJ's decision on the merits of the WIGI denial was unsupported by the evidence in the record. We believe that Thomson does not require the Board to ignore this in assessing whether attorney fees are warranted in this case. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Swentek v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 605, 612 (1997) (the Board is not precluded from reexamining its established attorney fees categories; Congress gave the Board primary responsibility for developing attorney fees policy and intended the Board to have the flexibility to determine whether fees are warranted in the interest of justice on the basis of the experience that the Board develops in adjudicating cases). To do so would come perilously close to running afoul of the prohibition against automatically awarding fees to every prevailing party, regardless of what the interest of justice dictates. Indeed, the closeness of the evidence is a factor to be considered in determining whether an award of fees is warranted. Massa, 833 F.2d at 994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the AJ found that the agency improperly denied the appellant's WIGI, it is clear from his initial decision on the merits that this finding was substantially based upon his opinion that the agency's performance expectations were unreasonable, i.e., that the appellant's supervisors required too many meetings which he believed were not necessary. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 188 &#x00B6; 5 (2001) (an agency is entitled to use its managerial discretion in establishing the performance standards by which an employee's performance is to be measured). The AJ's disdain for the agency's performance expectations is clear from the tone of his decision, particularly his inclusion of the word "communication" in quotation marks to imply that communication was not the agency's actual goal in setting its standards. Significantly, however, the AJ found that the appellant did have "deficiencies" and "problems" in her performance. The agency's perception of the appellant's communication problems was corroborated by a disinterested witness at the hearing and even by the appellant herself, who admitted that her relationship with her supervisors was adversarial. Thus, the agency did present probative evidence in support of its charges, even though the agency ultimately did not prevail, so the agency's action cannot be seen to be clearly without merit. <span class="Italic">See Trueheart v. Department of the Army</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 527, 530 (1984); <span class="Italic">Fekete v. Department of Justice</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 235, 237-38 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 31, 34 (1993) (attorney fees will not be granted when the decision to grant a disability retirement claim is based on a close call between conflicting physicians' statements). For similar reasons, we find that fees are not warranted under either the bad-faith category or the knew-or-should-have-known category as argued by the appellant in her motion for attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant has failed to show that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice, and we deny her motion for fees. We therefore need not address the agency's argument that the fees should be reduced.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fees were awarded under the clearly without merit criterion when an action was set aside because the evidence relied on by the agency was not credible and was wholly countered by the evidence presented by the appellant. <span class="Italic">Jennings v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 45 MSPR 615, 618 (1990) (agency clarified the ambiguity of the original charge and presented no credible evidence supporting the clarified charge; it was immaterial that the evidence presented would have supported another misconduct charge). But in <span class="Italic">Froehlich v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 21 MSPR 265, 269 (1984), the Board refused to award counsel fees to a prevailing appellant because the issues in the removal case turned on credibility of witnesses; nothing in the record indicated that further investigation or inquiry by the agency as to the reasons would have compelled the agency to refrain from bringing the charges. <span class="Italic">Quick v. USPS</span>, 7 MSPR 583, 585, 7 MSPB 423 (1981), involved an appellant charged with attempting to impede an official agency investigation who was then removed. On appeal the AJ reversed the action when the agency failed to present sufficient credible evidence to support its charges by a preponderance of evidence. The appellant filed for counsel fees and received no award from the AJ; he then filed a PFR on the fee decision. The Board turned the PFR down, stating that it could not be concluded that the removal action was clearly without merit. The agency presented considerable documentary evidence and testimony in support of its charge. There was no evidence that the agency initiated the action in bad faith or that it knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits. If the agency loses because its hearsay evidence does not meet the preponderant evidence standard, fees may be denied; the situation is distinct from a case that fails because the agency presents no evidence to support its case. <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. DOJ</span>, 11 MSPR 177, 178-79 (1982) (there was no evidence of the agency's bad faith or grossly negligent presentation of the case (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Trowell v. USPS</span>, 2 MSPR 600, 602, 3 MSPB 117 (1980))).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board decisions concluding that factually close cases do not warrant fees suffered more criticism and greater scrutiny following <span class="Italic">Yorkshire v. MSPB</span>, 746 F.2d 1454 (Fed. Cir. 1984), discussed below, deciding that substantial innocence--one basis for a fee award--should be determined on the basis of the result of the case rather than on the basis of the evidence that motivated the agency to take the action. The Board's theory was discredited in <span class="Italic">Thomson v. MSPB</span>, 772 F.2d 879 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">on remand</span>, 33 MSPR 106, 111 (1987). The court determined that fees are not barred because a case is determined on the basis of credibility. [<span class="Italic">Thomson</span> is discussed below under "<a href="0100-2023-22-072.html#sec15-73">Substantially Innocent</a>."] After the <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span> decision, one could question whether the clearly without merit criterion was retained as an independent basis for the award of a fee. If, after all, the case was clearly without merit, the employee would be substantially innocent. The Board has not abandoned the standard, however, but may confuse the manner that it describes the standard, as in <span class="Italic">Hoyt v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 28 MSPR 275, 277-78 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant contends...that an award of attorney fees is warranted under the second <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criterion--where the agency's action was clearly without merit or was wholly unfounded, or the employee is substantially innocent of the charges brought by the agency....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under this criterion, the focus is on the evidence presented during the proceedings before the Board and its officials; and a fee award is warranted where the appellant prevails on substantially all the charges <span class="Italic">and</span> the Board or the presiding official finds that the agency's unsustained charges were wholly unfounded because incredible or unspecific evidence was presented which was fully countered by the <span id="Page_4575"></span>appellant. <span class="Italic">Yorkshire v.
