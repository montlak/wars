<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-86"><span class="space">j.</span> Adverse Action or Performance-Based Appeal Arising From Last Chance or Other Settlement Agreement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">For its jurisdictional analysis, the Board treats an appeal from a removal based on a last chance agreement as a separate appeal (rather than as a petition for enforcement), regardless of whether the last chance agreement was in settlement of an earlier Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Herbert v. USPS</span>, 86 MSPR 80, 83 &#x00B6; 5 (2000) ("Where, as here, an appeal involves a removal for violating a settlement agreement, the Board normally treats the matter as a petition for appeal of the removal action, rather than a petition for enforcement of the settlement agreement, even if the agreement was in settlement of an earlier Board appeal."); <span class="Italic">Trotta v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 6, 9 (1997); <span class="Italic">Lockridge v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 613, 623 (1996); <span class="Italic">Rogers v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 647, 650 (1993); <span class="Italic">Sawaya v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 54 MSPR 311, 314 (1992), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Link v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 56 MSPR 254, 259 (1993). <span class="Italic">Trotta</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, explained, 73 MSPR at 9:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As a general rule, a petition for enforcement is the proper mechanism for obtaining relief where a party alleges breach of a settlement agreement by another party....&#8197;As a narrow exception to this rule, however, the Board has held that an appellant's request for enforcement of a last-chance settlement agreement should be docketed as a petition for appeal, rather than as a petition for enforcement where, as here, the appellant's challenge to the agency's compliance with the agreement involves a subsequent removal action taken pursuant to the terms of the agreement....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gutierrez v. USPS</span>, 90 MSPR 604, 609-10 &#x0026; n.5 (2002), said of the timing of appeals based on removals following a violation of a last chance agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, if the appellant proves that the agency misrepresented his right to appeal a removal, this fact may be considered in determining whether the appellant can establish good cause for his delayed filing. Generally, an appellant may establish good cause for an untimely filing of an involuntary resignation or retirement appeal if, at the time of the employee's resignation or retirement, the agency knew or should have known of facts indicating that the action was involuntary but did not inform the appellant of his appeal rights.[5] <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Ragland v. Department of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6; 5 (1999); <span class="Italic">see also Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 669 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (an agency's failure to notify an employee of his appeal rights under circumstances requiring it to do so will generally justify a waiver of the filing deadline). If the appellant had appeal rights, and he was unaware of such rights because the agency, deliberately or otherwise, affirmatively misrepresented to the appellant that he had no right of appeal to the Board, good cause would be established for the delay in filing his appeal so long as the appellant established that he was diligent in filing his appeal after he learned he could do so. <span class="Italic">See Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 583, 588 (1995) (an appellant who should have been advised of his appeal rights, but was not, is not required to show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights; rather, the question is whether the appellant was diligent in filing an appeal after he learned he could do so);<span class="Italic"> Butler v. Department of the Interior</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 465 (1980). However, if the appellant failed to put the agency on notice that he considered his resignation or retirement involuntary, he was not entitled to notice of Board appeal rights and therefore must establish that he exercised due diligence in discovering and pursuing those rights. <span class="Italic">Ragland</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Blaske v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;If the appellant was subject to a last-chance settlement agreement in which he waived his right to appeal to the Board, he would also have to establish that he put the agency on notice that he considered the settlement agreement invalid or that he contested the agency's assertion that he breached the agreement in order to establish good cause for his delayed filing on the basis of the agency's failure to provide him with notice of his appeal rights. Thus, to establish that he is entitled to a waiver of the time limit for filing an appeal based on the agency's failure to provide him with notice of his appeal rights, the appellant must show (1) that he put the agency on notice that he considered his resignation involuntary <span class="Italic">and</span> (2) that he considered the last chance agreement invalid or that he contested the agency's assertion of breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Clark v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wyatt v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WYATT_JULIAN_AT_3443_04_0335_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_250322.pdf">101 MSPR 28</a>, 40 &#x00B6; 21, 2006 MSPB 2 (2006<span class="Italic">)</span>, reiterated the <span class="Italic">Guiterrez</span> analysis when the appeal followed a settlement agreement resulting in a downgrading:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that there may be a question as to whether the appellant's attempt to appeal his reduction in grade was timely. In order to be timely, the appellant must file an adverse action appeal no later than 30 days after the effective date of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of the agency's decision, whichever is later. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). In this case, the parties executed the settlement agreement on August 6, 1999, <span id="Page_989"></span>but the appellant did not file this appeal until February 11, 2004. Thus, the appellant's appeal of his allegedly involuntary reduction in grade appears untimely. However, the Board will waive the timeliness of an appeal for good cause shown, and, in a case such as this, where the appellant has alleged that a presumptively voluntary action was involuntary and thus appealable to the Board, the good cause determination depends on a number of factors. For example, if the appellant put the agency on notice that he considered the settlement agreement invalid and his reduction in grade involuntary, the agency would have been required to provide the appellant with notice of his appeal rights, and its failure to do so would generally justify a waiver of the filing deadline so long as the appellant established that he was diligent in filing his appeal after he learned that he could do so. <span class="Italic">See Gutierrez v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 604, &#x00B6; 10 (2002). On the other hand, if the appellant failed to put the agency on notice that he considered his reduction in grade involuntary and that he considered the settlement agreement invalid, the agency was not required to provide him with notice of the right to appeal the presumptively voluntary action, and the appellant would then have to establish that he exercised due diligence in discovering and pursuing his appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 989 F.2d 1164, 1165-70 (Fed. Cir. 1993), assessed how time is calculated for an appeal from an action taken by the agency under a last chance agreement that waives the employee's right to appeal the previously proposed adverse action. The court decided that the employee's obligation is to notify the agency of the alleged breach of the last chance agreement. Then the agency is to give the employee notice of Board appeal rights. The employee must act reasonably quickly in protesting the violation of the agreement to the agency. <span class="Italic">Clark</span> is consistent with some Board law discussed earlier concerning appellate time limits for constructive adverse actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Clark was employed as a Supervisor of Mails in the United States Postal Service. On October 20, 1988, the Postal Service gave Mr. Clark a "Notice of Proposed Reduction in Grade and Reassignment," alleging that he had consistently failed to follow instructions and to perform his assigned duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 26, 1988, before any action was taken, the parties entered into a "last chance" settlement agreement which provided that the proposed reduction in grade would be rescinded if Mr. Clark agreed to follow instructions and to avoid further poor work performance. The agreement also provided that, if Mr. Clark breached the agreement, the reduction in grade would be reinstated and any appeal rights would be waived.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service reinstated the reduction by letter, dated January 30, 1990, because petitioner had allegedly breached the agreement. The letter stated that the reduction would be effective no sooner than the beginning of the pay period following petitioner's receipt of the letter (effectively on February 10, 1990), and that petitioner had waived his right to appeal through any "administrative, contractual, or court procedures," pursuant to the terms of the last chance settlement agreement. Accordingly, the letter did not include any notice of appeal rights. For several months, Mr. Clark took no action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 19, 1990, Mr. Clark sought the advice of an attorney. Mr. Clark filed an informal administrative complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), on June 27, 1990. In it, Mr. Clark challenged his demotion; however, he never filed a formal complaint. Instead, Mr. Clark filed an appeal with the MSPB on July 10, 1990, about four months after the deadline required by 5 CFR 1201.22(b) (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his appeal, Mr. Clark contested the Postal Service's allegations that he breached the settlement agreement by failing to follow instructions and having poor work performance. Mr. Clark asserted that he did not fail to follow instructions and was not guilty of poor work performance. Mr. Clark also claimed he was discriminated against on the basis of race.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 20, 1991, the agency filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely. Under 5 CFR 1201.22(b), appellant had only 20 days from the day after the effective date of the action to file an appeal, which would have been March 2, 1990. Therefore, the agency argued that Mr. Clark's appeal should be dismissed as untimely because it was not filed until July 10, 1990.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the agency's motion, Mr. Clark argued that the appeal should not be considered untimely because when he received his reduction in grade on February 10, 1990, he was acting <span class="Italic">pro se</span> and first pursued his remedies through the EEOC. It was not until later, he said, that he learned that the MSPB was the proper forum for his complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her September 6, 1991 decision on remand, the AJ found that appellant had failed to establish good cause for a waiver of the filing deadline. Her basis was that appellant did nothing for more than four months after his demotion became effective on February 10, 1990, until he first sought the advice of an attorney on June 19, 1990. The AJ noted that it was not until shortly after this time that Mr. Clark filed his EEOC action. The AJ also noted that appellant offered no explanation for the four-month period of inaction, and therefore, found that Mr. Clark failed to show due diligence under the circumstances, a prerequisite to establishing good cause for waiver of the filing deadline. The appeal was therefore dismissed. On December 11, 1991, the full Board denied Mr. Clark's petition for review, and the AJ's initial decision became final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Clark now argues that, under our holding in <span class="Italic">Stewart</span> [<span class="Italic">v. USPS</span>, 926 F.2d 1146 (Fed. Cir. 1991)], the Board abused its discretion in denying him a hearing before dismissing his appeal, because he established good cause for filing late due to the agency's failure to notify him of his appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 669 (Fed. Cir. 1988). These arguments raise two issues of first impression: first, does <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> extend to last chance settlement agreement cases, and second, when is an employee entitled to notice of appeal rights concerning an agency action pursuant to a last chance settlement agreement?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Clark argues that the AJ abused her discretion in not affording him a hearing before the Board on the merits of his case. Our holding in <span class="Italic">Stewart</span> establishes an employee's limited right to be heard on a nonfrivolous factual issue of compliance with a last chance settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, 926 F.2d at 1149. Nothing in the <span class="Italic">Stewart</span> case, however, suggests that it is unnecessary also to meet the requirement of timeliness. Common sense also suggests no justification for ignoring the deadline as the employee would know immediately if the agency's assertion of breach of the agreement was untrue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of her findings on the timeliness issue, discussed in the following section, we cannot say that the AJ's denial of a hearing on compliance was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner's primary argument on the timeliness issue is that, based on our holding in <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, the Board abused its discretion in failing to find that he had shown good cause for filing in July because the agency failed to notify him of his appeal rights in January 1990.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> involved the Postal Service's refusal to reinstate an employee who had recovered from an occupational illness which had resulted in her removal. The denial of reinstatement is a final agency action that is appealable to the Board. The regulations make the appeal right explicit and expressly require the agency to give the non-reinstated employee notice of his or her appeal rights. 5 CFR 353.308(a). The agency's letter advising Ms. Shiflett of the denial of reinstatement did not advise her of her appeal rights. She first pursued an administrative grievance, which was ultimately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Her appeal to the Board, almost a year after the adverse action, was dismissed as untimely. Although Ms. Shiflett alleged that she had good cause for filing late, the Board did not waive the time limit. In concluding that the Board abused its discretion in failing to find good cause, our court noted, "[t]he critical and controlling fact in this case is...the flagrant violation of the regulations by the respondent in failing to give petitioner notice of her appeal rights in the form and manner prescribed by the regulations." 839 F.2d at 673.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of the instant case are distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>. First, the employee's right to appeal in <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> was clear and well known to the agency as of the time it first acted. In the instant case, in contrast, it was not clear at the time of Mr. Clark's removal that petitioner had a limited right of appeal. That right was made clear in <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, which was not decided until after the agency had demoted Mr. Clark and Mr. Clark had appealed to the MSPB and then to this court. Therefore, until Mr. Clark's case was remanded from the Federal Circuit or at least until <span class="Italic">Stewart</span> issued, the agency was not aware that Mr. Clark's demotion might be appealable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, in <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, there was a regulation facially applicable to petitioner's case expressly requiring the agency to give the employee notice of her right to appeal: "When an agency refuses to restore, or determines that it is not feasible to restore an employee under the provisions of law and this part, it <span class="Italic">shall notify the employee in writing</span> of the reasons for its decision and <span class="Italic">of his or her right to appeal</span> to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board's regulations." 5 CFR 353.308(a). In contrast, there is no regulation expressly requiring an agency to give an employee notice of appeal rights when taking action pursuant to a last chance settlement agreement in which appeal rights have been waived. Therefore, <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> does not apply to the facts of this case, and the agency's failure to notify Mr. Clark of appeal rights in the January 1990 letter was not improper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner asserts that <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> is not distinguishable because 5 CFR 1201.21, which generally requires an agency to give an employee notice of his or her appeal rights "on a matter that is appealable to the Board," required the Postal Service to give him notice in this case. As mentioned above, at the time the agency would have given Mr. Clark notice, it was unclear that the action was appealable to the Board. Accordingly, that regulation did not require the Postal Service to give Mr. Clark appeal notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_990"></span>The AJ based her decision that Mr. Clark had not filed his appeal in a timely manner on his failure to take any action for more than four months after his demotion. The AJ concluded that petitioner did not show the due diligence required to establish good cause for a waiver of the filing deadline. This finding is supported by substantial evidence in the record, and therefore we cannot say that the AJ's decision not to waive the time limit was an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Mr. Clark has not otherwise shown good cause for his late filing and because neither <span class="Italic">Stewart</span> nor <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> requires that the AJ have a hearing on compliance with the settlement agreement <span class="Italic">before</span> deciding whether petitioner has proven an excuse for filing late, we must affirm. The Board did not abuse its discretion by its sequencing of the issues for decision. Indeed, in choosing to adjudicate timeliness before compliance, the AJ practiced appropriate trial management and sensible judicial economy. Furthermore, the Board did not abuse its discretion in failing to hold a hearing as to timeliness, because the parties agreed to submit this issue on the written record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although 5 CFR 1201.21 did not require the agency to give notice to Mr. Clark when it demoted him, it could apply in future cases now that <span class="Italic">Stewart</span> has been decided and the limited right to appeal is clear. The question then becomes whether and when <span class="Italic">thereafter</span> the agency became obligated to notify Clark. To answer this question we must decide when an agency is required to give an employee notice of his or her appeal rights under 5 CFR 1201.21 after taking action pursuant to a last chance settlement agreement in which appeal rights are waived. That issue has never been decided by this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a typical last chance settlement agreement, the employee waives all rights to appeal. Generally speaking, then, there <span class="Italic">is</span> no right to an appeal, assuming that the agreement is valid and enforceable, except to the limited extent allowed by <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>. Under <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, if a petitioner raises a nonfrivolous issue concerning compliance with a last chance settlement agreement, the Board has jurisdiction, but in the first instance only to determine compliance with the settlement agreement. 926 F.2d at 1148. Thus, as the right to appeal is contingent on the employee having made a nonfrivolous allegation concerning compliance with the settlement agreement, the agency's obligation to give the employee notice of his or her appeal right under 5 CFR 1201.21 must also be contingent upon the employee having provided it with a nonfrivolous allegation concerning compliance with the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A similar situation exists where an employee voluntarily retires or resigns. Normally, such an employee does not have any right to appeal. 5 CFR 752.401(b)(9); <span class="Italic">Christie v. United States</span>, 518 F.2d 584, 588-89, 207 Ct. Cl. 333 (1975). However, where the employee makes a nonfrivolous challenge concerning the voluntariness of the retirement or resignation, the Board does have jurisdiction to hear that issue. <span class="Italic">Covington v. DHHS</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 944 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Burgess</span>, 758 F.2d at 643. The holding of <span class="Italic">Covington</span> is thus similar to that in <span class="Italic">Stewart.</span> <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, 926 F.2d at 1148.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases where the Board would have <span class="Italic">Covington</span>-type jurisdiction, the agency becomes obligated to inform the employee of his appeal rights, only after the employee puts the government on notice that he views his resignation as involuntary. <span class="Italic">McCormack v. United States</span>, 204 Ct. Cl. 371, 380 (1974) (stating that "[a]fter the plaintiff made it sufficiently clear to the Government that he deemed his resignation to be other than voluntary, the Government was required to state in detail the various procedures available to the plaintiff to contest the allegedly adverse action and the remedies available").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, voluntary resignation cases are similar to last chance settlement agreement cases both because of the contingent nature of the appeal right and because of the contingent nature of the agency's obligation to give the employee notice of his or her appeal rights. We therefore adopt a test for agency actions pursuant to last chance settlement agreements similar to that established in <span class="Italic">McCormack</span>. We hold that an agency taking such action is only required to notify an employee of his or her appeal rights if and when the employee puts the agency on notice that he or she contests the agency's assertion of a breach of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That does not mean however, that in every instance where the agency fails to give an employee notice of his or her appeal rights, the AJ reviewing the appeal necessarily would abuse her discretion if she did not waive the time limit for filing as suggested by <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>. The agency's obligation to give the employee notice of his or her appeal right in <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> was not contingent upon any action by the employee. In last chance settlement agreement cases, on the other hand, as we held above, the agency's obligation to give notice of appeal rights is contingent on the employee putting the agency on notice that he or she challenges the alleged non-compliance with the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the issue under consideration is whether the AJ abused her discretion by refusing to waive the time limit, this distinction is critical. While the employee in <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> was in no way responsible for the agency's failure to give the required notice, the employee in this and other last chance settlement agreement cases in fact determines whether the agency must give notice at all. Therefore, the employee's delay in notifying the agency should be factored into the AJ's discretionary decision to waive the time limit. The more the employee delays, the less likely the equities will weigh in his or her favor. After all, the employee should immediately know at the time the agency takes adverse action against him or her whether he or she has a basis to assert non-compliance with the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears from the record in this case that Mr. Clark did not inform the agency that he contested the Postal Service's allegations that he breached the settlement agreement until nearly six months after he was informed that the agency intended to remove him for breaching the agreement. Thus, even if 5 CFR 1201.21 had required the agency to give notice at some point in this case, the AJ would not necessarily have abused her discretion in not waiving the delay in filing because of Mr. Clark's delay in notifying the agency that he believed he had complied with the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Zordel v. DOD</span>, 99 MSPR 554, 557-58 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2005), stated the Board's position as to timing of an appeal of a termination based on violation of a last chance agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that in the ID, the AJ stated that the agency's decision to reinstate the removal did not contain any notice of appeal rights because by doing so the agency would have been subject to the argument that it had waived the settlement agreement provision wherein the appellant agreed not to contest any reinstatement of the removal action. In fact, however, under certain circumstances, an agency must inform an appellant, who has entered into a last-chance settlement agreement and waived appeal rights, of the right to appeal a reinstated agency action. Specifically, an agency is required to give notice of appeal rights if and when the employee puts the agency on notice that he contests the agency's assertion of breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 989 F.2d 1164, 1170 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is some evidence in the record that the appellant disputed the agency's assertions that she breached the agreement. As early as March 3, 2004, the appellant had contacted the agency and stated that she was going to file an appeal, and that she was a "value-added employee." She also stated to an agency official that she wanted an overall justification of the removal action and told an agency official that she neither agreed nor disagreed with the agency's decision to remove her. Because it appears that the appellant disputed the agency's assertions of breach, the agency may have been required to give the appellant notice of her appeal rights. However, not only did the agency fail to give the appellant this notice, it had specifically advised her that she had no appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ should have apprised the parties of the agency's obligations under <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, afforded the parties an opportunity to submit evidence and argument on that issue, and determined whether the lack of notice of appeal rights, coupled with the agency's assertion that the appellant had no appeal rights, constituted good cause for the appellant's delay in filing her appeal. However, the AJ failed to do so. The fact that the AJ failed to give the appellant notice of the <span class="Italic">Clark</span> standard may have prejudiced her rights because she was not given an opportunity to show that the agency was required to give her appeal rights and that the agency's failure to do so caused her untimely filing. Accordingly, based on the foregoing, we vacate the ID.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Plant v. VA,</span> AT-0752-10-0180-I-1 (NP 1/7/2011) ("The issue of whether the agency was required to give the appellant notice of appeal rights when it terminated his employment greatly affects the determination of whether he established good cause for the untimely filing of his appeal. In<span class="Italic"> Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 989 F.2d 1164, 1170 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the court held that an agency is required to provide such notice to an employee being removed pursuant to an LCA that includes a waiver of Board appeal rights only 'if and when the employee puts the agency on notice that he or she contests the agency's assertion of a breach of the agreement.' In this case, we find no indication in the record that the appellant put the agency on notice that he was contesting the agency's assertion of a breach of the last chance agreement before filing the instant appeal. Accordingly, the agency was not required to give him a notice of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vasquez v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 128 (1994), followed a practical approach and rejected as untimely an appeal following the agency's enforcement of a last chance agreement. The Board reasoned that the appellant should have been aware of his filing time from past experience with the Board.</p>
