<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-52"><span class="space">3.</span> Taint of Reprisal by Lower Level Official; Cat's Paw</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Taint of officials charged with reprisal was explored in <span class="Italic">Richard v. DOD</span>, 66 MSPR 146, 154-55 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant claims that, despite the administrative judge's finding that the deciding official, Thomas L. Goodman, testified that he was not aware of the appellant's Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) activity, the deciding official also testified that he considered the appellant's oral reply to the notice of proposed removal, in which the appellant stated that, "When I won the EEO suit, DODDS refused to provide me with a transportation agreement." The appellant contends that the deciding official's notes of the appellant's oral reply indicate that she made such a statement, and that the deciding official was therefore aware of her protected activity before he removed her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the appellant to establish a claim of retaliation for filing EEO complaints, she must show that: (1) She engaged in EEO activity; (2) the accused official knew of such activity; (3) the adverse action under review could, under the circumstances, have been retaliation; and (4) after careful balancing of the intensity of the motive to retaliate against the gravity of the misconduct, a nexus is established between the motive and the subsequent action. <span class="Italic">See Warren v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 658 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Ally v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 680, 685-86 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant filed a discrimination complaint in 1985 that resulted in an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) decision directing the agency to appoint her to a teacher position retroactive to August 23, 1982....&#8197;The appellant correctly asserts on review that, based on her oral and written replies to the notice of proposed removal, it appears that Goodman, despite his testimony to the contrary, knew or should have known that she had filed a discrimination complaint that resulted in her employment with the agency. The record also shows that Robert K. Jones, who was the appellant's supervisor and the proposing official on the performance-based action, and Edna A. Brower, who was the deciding official on the performance-based action and the proposing official on the directed reassignment action, were aware that the appellant had been appointed to her position in 1987 as a result of an EEOC decision. Nevertheless, we find that the appellant has not shown that the removal action could, under the circumstances, have been retaliation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, 804 F.2d at 658, the court held that "if officials having knowledge of the protected disclosures, <span class="Italic">and</span> even slight involvement in them, are in charge of advising or effectuating the removal of the [employee] for misconduct or inadequate performance, this may justify an inference of retaliatory motive sufficient for test (3)." (emphasis supplied). <span class="Italic">See also Peterson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 54 MSPR 178, 184 (1992) (where the appellant's supervisor knew of the protected activity but was not accused of involvement in any of the alleged acts of prohibited discrimination, the appellant failed to show that the adverse action could have been retaliation). Here, although the relevant agency officials knew that the appellant had been appointed to her position as a result of a successful discrimination complaint, the appellant did not show or even allege that these officials had any involvement in the acts found by the EEOC to be discriminatory.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Campo v. USPS</span>, 96 MSPR 418, 424-25 &#x00B6; 14 (2004) ("Considering that the appellant never alleged that Copeland and Foster were aware of his protected activity when Copeland proposed the removal action and Foster decided to remove the appellant, that Foster was not named as a discriminating official in the EEO complaints, and that the appellant has not asserted any other motive for Foster to retaliate against him for filing EEO complaints, we find that the appellant did not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation for engaging in protected activity."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">McCardle v. EEOC</span>, SF-0752-16-0689-I-3 (NP 12/7/2022) ("Even if we assumed for the purposes of our analysis that these agency officials harbored some animus against him, the appellant offers no evidence that these officials improperly influenced the proposing or deciding officials.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An assertion of reprisal was rejected in <span class="Italic">Cole v. USPS</span>, 86 MSPR 572, 576 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2000), involving an appeal from enforced leave imposed after the employee was referred for a medical evaluation. Although the individual making the referral knew of, and may have been troubled by, the appellant's EEO activities, the physician who made the decision to refer the appellant for further medical evaluation, resulting in his enforced leave status, had nothing to do with the events involved in the EEO case. The physician was sufficiently detached from the workplace events that her medical determinations, and their effect upon the appellant's employment status, were not tainted by reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Kane was a contract physician for the agency. It is true, as the administrative judge found, that she initially determined the appellant to be fit for duty on the day he was referred to the medical unit, and that she provisionally changed her mind three days later, pending the result of the psychiatric examination to which she then referred him. Although the administrative judge also stated that Dr. Kane did not explain the reason for her change of mind, we find this insufficient as a basis for finding retaliation under the circumstances presented. Dr. Kane testified that she "wanted to make sure" of her initial finding, and that it is "usual procedure" to designate the referred employee not fit for duty pending the result of the examination. Given the serious consequences that could result from retaining a potentially dangerous employee on duty, the agency's responsibility to maintain a safe work place for all of its employees, and the doctor's misgivings based on her observations and independent medical judgment, we find that standing alone, Dr. Kane's concerns and resulting desire to assure herself that her initial impression was accurate are not suspicious actions sufficient to invoke the spectre of reprisal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, whether Dr. Kane's change of mind was unsound or unwarranted is beside the point absent any evidence that she had knowledge of the appellant's prior protected activities, or that Harrison was responsible for or influenced her decision in any way. The initial decision appears to assume, but does not explain, why Harrison's motives should be imputed to Dr. Kane or why Dr. Kane's fitness for duty determination should be imputed to Harrison or any other agency officials. Based on the record before us, we find no basis for doing so. Nothing here suggests that Harrison had the authority to dispute the determination of a medical professional, or ignore or countermand it. Absent such evidence, or a showing that Harrison improperly influenced Dr. Kane's decision, we conclude that there is no "genuine nexus" between a retaliatory motive and the enforced leave<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Body-Text">An agency demonstrated an absence of reprisal when the deciding official was <span id="Page_3408"></span>uninvolved in the events leading to what was characterized by the appellant as reprisal, and the deciding official's determination to remove the appellant was not the result of influence by other agency officials who were involved in activities connected with the appellant's reprisal claims. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Haack v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 275, 282 (1995) ("The appellant submitted no evidence that he engaged in EEO activity or that the deciding official was aware of any such activity, and thus has failed to show that his alleged EEO activity was a motivating factor in the agency's decision to remove him."); <span class="Italic">Golden v.

<p class="Body-Text">Decisions allow for the possibility that the decisional process is tainted by the actions of lower level officials, e.g., the proposing official. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jaramillo v.

See</span> <span class="Italic">Marsh v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 47, 51 (1994). Furthermore, the appellant offered no evidence to refute the agency's contentions concerning the seriousness of the appellant's failure to follow proper stain control procedures.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reprisal was found in <span class="Italic">Rhee v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/RHEE_MIA_S_SF_0752_11_0122_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_697748.pdf">117 MSPR 640</a>, 658-59 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 34-36, 2012 MSPB 26 (2012), considering circumstantial evidence and noting of the burden of proof:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, citing the Supreme Court's recent holding in <span class="Italic">Staub v. Proctor Hospital</span>, 131 S. Ct. 1186 (2011), argues that, even assuming Ammari's referral to IAD could have tainted the deciding official's determination, the appellant nonetheless failed to demonstrate a nexus between Ammari's retaliatory motive and the adverse action. In <span class="Italic">Staub</span>, the Court ruled that "if a supervisor performs an act motivated by antimilitary animus that is intended by the supervisor to cause an adverse employment action, and if that act is a proximate cause of the ultimate employment action, then the employer is liable under [the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA)]." <span class="Italic">Staub</span>, 131 S. Ct. at 1194. It also stated, however, that "[i]f the employer's investigation results in an adverse action for reasons unrelated to the supervisor's original biased action...then the employer will not be liable." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1193. The agency argues that Ammari's input to IAD could not have been the proximate cause of the deciding official's decision because "the purpose of IAD's and [the proposing official's] inquiries was to determine whether...Ammari's allegations had a factual basis [, and t]heir inquiries substantiated the allegations independent of ASAC Ammari's input."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has not determined whether the holding in <span class="Italic">Staub</span> applies to reprisal cases under section 2302(b)(9). Unlike USERRA, an appellant may not establish EEO reprisal by merely showing that her protected activity was a motivating factor<span class="Italic">.</span> Rather, as stated above, an appellant alleging EEO reprisal must instead prove that the action was taken because of the protected activity. <span class="Italic">Pyun</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 249, &#x00B6; 12. If the Board were to apply <span class="Italic">Staub</span> directly to an EEO reprisal case, the appellant would then only need to prove her supervisor's animus was directly related to the adverse action and not that the animus was necessary to bring about the action. <span class="Italic">See Staub,</span> 131 S. Ct. at 1192 ("Proximate cause requires only some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged, and excludes only those links that are too remote, purely contingent, or indirect.") (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unnecessary for the Board to determine, in the context of this appeal, whether the Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Staub</span> applies to EEO reprisal cases. As discussed above, Ammari was clearly the source of the information that ultimately formed the basis of the charge against the appellant. Moreover, as the decision letter makes clear, in determining to suspend the appellant, Peacock relied heavily on the appellant's past disciplinary record in which Ammari played an ongoing role. Further, even assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that IAD's and the proposing official's inquiries determined that Ammari's allegations had a factual basis, this does not establish that the agency's "investigation result[ed] in an adverse action for reasons unrelated to the supervisor's original biased action." <span class="Italic">Staub,</span> 131 S. Ct. at 1193. Here, the matter was investigated only because of Ammari's referral and repeated inquiries. Absent these actions and Ammari's prior discipline of the appellant, we find that the agency would not have taken action here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Rhee</span>, <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, PH-0752-12-0073-I-1 (NP 6/20/2014), applied a cat's paw approach:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, although acknowledging that the deciding official in the instant case did not know him and therefore could not have had a motive to retaliate against him, the appellant argues that other officials who were involved in his prior discipline and in his protected activity did have such a motive. In examining retaliatory motive for an agency action, the officials "involved" in the action may encompass more than just the proposing and deciding officials, and may include other officials upon whom the proposing or deciding officials relied for information. <span class="Italic">Rhee</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 30. Here, the appellant argues that the proposing official in the instant case was the same individual who issued him the Letter of Requirement and was also the deciding official in all four suspensions. In addition, the appellant alleges that he named as an alleged discriminating official in an amendment to an EEO complaint, the individual who later proposed the first 3-day suspension. It is undisputed that the deciding official relied on the appellant's past record. However, in analyzing the appellant's retaliation claim, the administrative judge also did not consider whether the deciding official, in imposing the penalty, may have relied on information provided by other officials involved in those prior actions who may have had a retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">Rhee</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 30.</p>
