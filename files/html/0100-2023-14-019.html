<h5 class="h5" id="sec7-20"><span class="space">a.</span> Off-Duty Offense</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Off-duty offenses involving fraud support a demonstration of nexus more through injury to notions of trust and confidence than through demonstrated impairment of an employee's ability to perform his duties. In <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 409, 413-15 (1988), the appellant was a secretary serving overseas. He was involved in a black market scheme involving purchase and sale of cars. He was permitted to perform his duties for about two years following the misconduct. But nexus existed; removal was sustained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kruger v. Department of Justice,</span> 32 MSPR 71, 74 (1987), the Board determined that an agency may show a nexus between off-duty misconduct and the efficiency of the service by demonstrating: (1) A rebuttable presumption in certain egregious circumstances; (2) the misconduct adversely affects the appellant's or coworkers' job performance or the agency's trust and confidence in the appellant's job performance; or (3) the misconduct interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concurs in the finding of the administrative judge in this case that the appellant's misconduct did not adversely affect his job performance. The Board finds by a preponderance of the evidence, however, that the appellant's misconduct interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission and affected the agency's trust and confidence in his job performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The testimony and documentary evidence submitted by the agency in this case established that the appellant was the ringleader of a black market scheme in which he solicited agency personnel to transfer tax-exempt privately owned motor vehicles to non-tax-exempt Filipino nationals in violation of the agency's regulations. Two agency enlisted military personnel were court-martialed for their participation in the appellant's black marketing scheme, and the record shows that at least one of them was imprisoned for twelve months and received a bad conduct discharge for his part in the scheme. In conducting the black market scheme, the agency's official Merchandise Control Records were falsified in order to conceal the improper transfer of the motor vehicles to non-tax-exempt Filipino nationals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such actions, which resulted from the appellant's misconduct, interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">See Kruger,</span> 32 MSPR at 74. The written statement of the appellant's immediate supervisor, who was the proposing official, and of the administrator of the Clark RMC, the appellant's second-level supervisor and the deciding official, show that the appellant's conduct adversely affected the agency's trust and confidence in his ability to perform his duties with confidentiality. This is particularly true since the appellant has access to personnel files and sensitive information and his job requires contact with the public and other agencies<span class="Italic">. See Kruger,</span> 32 MSPR at 74.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have previously held, an agency is not required to demonstrate a specific impact on the appellant's job performance or service efficiency to establish the requisite nexus. Rather, it is sufficient for an agency to establish that public perceptions of an employee's misconduct "would impair the efficiency of the agency by undermining public confidence in it, thereby making it harder for the agency's other workers to perform their jobs effectively...." <span class="Italic">Kruger,</span> 32 MSPR at 75. <span class="Italic">See Allred v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 786 F.2d 1128, 1131 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The Board also finds that the agency's showing of the requisite nexus for the removal action has not been denigrated by its delay in initiating the action. <span class="Italic">See Kumferman v. Department of the Navy,</span> 19 MSPR 5, 7 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 785 F.2d 286 (Fed. Cir. 1986).[6] Further, the written statements of support by the appellant's co-workers and his satisfactory job performance during the period that the agency delayed effecting the removal action do not alone outweigh the agency's legitimate apprehension as to his continued employment and the effect of his proven misconduct on the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Allred,</span> 786 F.2d at 1131-32; <span class="Italic">DeDonato v. United States Postal Service,</span> 25 MSPR 286, 291 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part and vacated in part on other grounds,</span> 785 F.2d 320 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Quander v. Department of Justice,</span> 22 MSPR 419, 422 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 770 F.2d 180 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Therefore, the Board finds that the agency has shown by a preponderance of the evidence a nexus linking the appellant's off-duty misconduct with the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Kruger,</span> 32 MSPR at 76.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Further, the Board finds that the agency reasonably delayed effecting the removal action until the OSI completed its investigation and released its report of the appellant's misconduct, in the absence of any showing by the appellant that such delay prejudiced his rights or his ability to defend himself against the charge<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Kumferman v. Department</span> of <span class="Italic">the Navy,</span> 785 F.2d 286, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Cates v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 24 MSPR 468, 471 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1065 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Wilkes v. Veterans Administration,</span> 6 MSPB 611, 6 MSPR 732, 734 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Fike v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 10 MSPR 113, 116-17 (1982), an IRS employee development specialist was convicted of a charge of false pretense arising out of a false report to his insurance company of the theft of his car. Some publicity of the criminal conduct identified the appellant as an IRS officer. The Board sustained the removal, determining as to nexus:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]ppellant was employed by an agency which must maintain public confidence in its image of integrity, depending as it does essentially on voluntary compliance of the public. <span class="Italic">See Hoover v. United States</span>, 513 F.2d 603, 206 Ct. Cl. 640 (1975); <span class="Italic">Birnholz v. United States,</span> 199 Ct. Cl. 532, 537 (1972). Appellant's position as a manager for the agency in a position involving contact with subordinate employees and the public; the adverse publicity generated by his arrest and conviction; and the fraudulent and dishonest nature of his conduct were sufficient to establish the required nexus as we articulated in <span class="Italic">Merritt, supra</span>. Accordingly, the Board finds that appellant's removal based on his conduct as charged by the agency would promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Beck v. DOJ</span>, 67 MSPR 219, 223-24 (1995), upheld removal of a GS-9 Correctional Treatment Specialist based on charges involving improper disbursement of union funds while the appellant served as local union president. The appellant's conduct correlated with the need to maintain workplace discipline:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]mposing discipline for the conduct charged promotes the efficiency of the service, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(a), assuming that the conduct occurred off-duty and not on agency premises. An agency can establish a nexus between imposing discipline for off-duty conduct and the efficiency of the service by showing, among other things, that the conduct adversely affects the agency's trust or confidence in the appellant's job performance. <span class="Italic">See Royster v. Department of Justice,</span> 58 MSPR 495, 499 (1993). The Unit Manager of the Chicago, Illinois Metropolitan Correctional Center, where the appellant was stationed, stated that the appellant's actions had "destroyed [his] credibility" and had "demonstrated that [he is] not one to whom the care, custody, and correction of Federal criminal offenders may be entrusted." The Warden of the Metropolitan Correctional Center expressed a similar opinion. The judgments of the Unit Manager and the Warden appear warranted, given that deceitfulness lies at the heart of the appellant's misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant's misconduct, even though not committed during the course of his duties as a Correctional Treatment Specialist, is directly connected to the federal workplace. His misuse of union funds was a breach of his fiduciary duty to union members, who are federal employees, and whose right to form and to join a labor organization has been found by Congress to be in the public interest<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101, 7102. Indeed, it was the appellant's status as a member of a bargaining unit made up of federal employees that allowed him to serve as an officer of the union, which in turn provided him with the opportunity to misuse funds belonging to the union. Accordingly, we are not persuaded by the appellant's argument that his misconduct should be of no concern to the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fouquet v. USDA</span>, 82 MSPR 548, 555 &#x00B6; 18 (1999), provides another example of a nexus determination based on appellant's position of trust in an agency, coupled with off-duty conduct involving transactions in stolen property:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the administrative judge did not make specific nexus findings as to the stolen property charge, we believe that nexus is evident. The appellant held a high-level management position in which she was entrusted with oversight of billions of dollars in agricultural commodity payments each year. The appellant's off-duty misconduct of facilitating the commission of a crime, accepting and using stolen furniture, appliances, and computer equipment in her home, and later selling a stolen computer printer to an agency employee establishes that the appellant seriously compromised the trust the agency had in her to function in her position. <span class="Italic">See Scott v. Department of Justice,</span> 69 MSPR 211, 243 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 99 F.3d 1160, 1996 WL 601430 (Fed. Cir. 1996). We therefore find nexus between the sustained misconduct of theft and the appellant's position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Stuhlmacher v. USPS</span>, 89 MSPR 272, 278 &#x00B6; 16 (2001) (nexus between off-duty criminal conversion of merchandise from a store and position of postmaster that involved fiduciary responsibility of up to $25,000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Failure to pay for a small amount of food at a cafeteria for agency personnel provided nexus for adverse action based on off-duty conduct, <span class="Italic">Chin v. DOD</span>, 2022 MSPB 34, &#x00B6; 23 (2022) (Member Limon dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An agency may establish nexus between off-duty misconduct and the efficiency of the service by preponderant evidence by showing that the misconduct adversely affects the appellant's or coworkers' job performance or the agency's trust and confidence in the appellant's <span id="Page_2309"></span>job performance. <span class="Italic">Ellis</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 407, &#x00B6; 9. The appellant's subsequent performance evaluation is inconsequential because an agency is not required to demonstrate a specific impact on the appellant's job performance or service efficiency to establish a nexus between the appellant's off-duty misconduct and the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 409, 414 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 884 F.2d 1398 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table). Further, the Board previously has found that off-duty misconduct involving an offense of theft can reasonably cause an agency to lose trust or confidence in an employee's ability to function in his position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fouquet v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 548, &#x00B6; 18 (1999). Here, the administrative judge found that the appellant occupied a position of public trust and his collateral responsibilities included "identifying and protecting information, personnel, property, facilities, operations[,] or material from unauthorized disclosure, misuse, theft, assault, vandalism, espionage, sabotage[,] or loss." Given the seriousness of the appellant's actions and his responsibilities as a Security Specialist, we find that the appellant's misconduct adversely affected the agency's trust and confidence in his ability to perform his job. Therefore, we find that there is a nexus between the sustained misconduct and the efficiency of the service warranting disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considered the nexus between a guilty plea for a count of mail fraud, involving the private practice of a physician who was also employed by the Postal Service, in <span class="Italic">Gallagher v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPR 572, 6 MSPB 482 (1981). High visibility of the physician in the federal service, involving interaction with local, state, and federal health agencies, hospitals, medical societies, and private physicians, made it necessary for the appellant to maintain a public image of professional trustworthiness and propriety. Because both the nature and gravity of the offense (a felony) and the professional capacity involved (the practice of medicine) were common to his agency position, impairment of the efficiency of the public service could be presumed, subject to rebuttal. Although the appellant introduced evidence demonstrating his competence as a physician and his previous good service with the agency, the newspaper articles introduced into the record concerning his conduct supported the presumption that his reputation was impaired among agencies with whom he would deal as a government physician. No evidence to the contrary was offered. In the final analysis, it was the negative publicity that had an adverse effect on the efficiency of the service; the appellant's public image was necessarily damaged through that publicity with detrimental effect on both his ability to perform his duties satisfactorily and on the agency's ability to accomplish its mission through him as its representative. The Removal was affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Conviction of a management specialist for receiving and aiding in the concealment of stolen property supported removal as a result of the nexus between his position, requiring oversight of government funds and credit, the trust required by that position, and the lack of honesty demonstrated by the conviction. <span class="Italic">Fleming v. USDA</span>, 24 MSPR 485, 488 (1984). A felony conviction and imprisonment for theft raised a presumption that the appellant, a postal garageman, would likely act dishonestly <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> his agency employment. <span class="Italic">Parrish v. USPS</span>, 12 MSPR 459, 463 (1982); <span class="Italic">see Headley v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 14 MSPR 57, 58 (1982) (police officer was removed for involvement in an off-duty burglary).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gamble v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPR 578, 581, 6 MSPB 487 (1981), described the removal of a janitor who failed to inform a state welfare agency (that continued to pay his wife a $15 weekly supplementary benefit due to appellant's prior unemployment) of his new employment with the Postal Service. The removal was based on "dishonest conduct." The agency argued that appellant might have access to mail and could not be trusted. But the Board determined that the agency's attempt to directly connect the conduct to an element of the appellant's custodial position was so attenuated as to lose meaning:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It seems apparent that any employer would want its employees to be honest. However, commission of a crime does not necessarily reflect on the honesty of an individual <span class="Italic">vis a vis</span> his employment. When an agency makes such a claim, as it does, <span class="Italic">sub silentio</span>, in this case, it must necessarily prove the elements of an offense which raises a presumption that the employee would likely act dishonestly with the employer. The appellant may, of course, offer evidence to rebut such presumption....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board concluded, however, that Gamble's deliberate misrepresentation of his employment status to a state welfare representative for the purpose of defrauding the government of public funds was sufficient to raise a presumption that the conduct impaired the efficiency of the public service. Because the appellant presented no contrary evidence, the removal was sustained with the cautionary advice that removal might have been unduly harsh had mitigating factors been present under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. <span class="Italic">See O'Keefe v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 475, 477 &#x00B6; 2 (2001) (involving misrepresentation in a mortgage application), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">O'Keefe v. USPS</span>, 318 F.3d 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (requiring reanalysis of facts and charges); <span class="Italic">Miles v. DCAA</span>, 12 MSPR 416, 417 (1982) (conduct involving welfare fraud is sufficient to raise a presumption of nexus); <span class="Italic">Gordon v. GPO</span>, 9 MSPR 354, 357 (1981), a charge of defrauding the VA of educational benefits: a printing plant worker's removal was sustained because his conduct cast doubt on his honesty and reliability, an "essential ingredient of the employer-employee or coworker relationship," and because the appellant presented no evidence to rebut the presumed impairment of service efficiency); <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. IRS</span>, 8 MSPR 536, 540 (1981) (adverse action against employees who agreed to misrepresent material employment information on a mortgage company form).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not all courts agree with the Board's deferential nexus analysis. In <span class="Italic">Gloster v. GSA</span>, 720 F.2d 700, 703 (D.C. Cir. 1983), a custodial worker was dismissed after she was convicted of a charge of welfare fraud of about $314. The agency witnesses stated that her offense was not job-related; rather, she was fired because it was unseemly to allow someone who had defrauded the government to continue working for the government. The Board sustained the dismissal because defrauding the government was a serious offense. The court reversed, stating of the nexus requirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The efficiency-of-the-service standard...has been interpreted, in accordance with judicial interpretation of similar standards in prior statutes, to require an agency that proposes to remove an employee for misconduct to demonstrate a sufficient nexus between the misconduct and the job performance of the employee or others to warrant removal.... The nexus requirement is particularly strict in cases involving non-work-related misconduct....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Act further reinforces this interpretation by providing [at 5 USC 2302(b)(10)] that an agency may not:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">discriminate for or against any employee...on the basis of conduct which does not adversely affect the performance of the employee...or the performance of others; except that nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit an agency from taking into account in determining suitability or fitness any conviction of the employee...for any crime....5 USC 2302(b)(10) (1982)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proviso in this section does not mean, however, that an agency may dispense with the requirement of demonstrating a nexus between its disciplinary action and the efficiency of the service when the misconduct complained of is criminal. The Conference Report on the bill that was enacted as the Civil Service Reform Act explains the purpose of the proviso as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[C]onviction of a crime may be taken into account when determining fitness or suitability of an employee or applicant. This provision is not meant as an encouragement to take conviction of a crime into account when determining the suitability or fitness of an employee or applicant for employment. Nor is it to be inferred that conviction of a crime is meant to disqualify an employee or an applicant from employment. The conferees intend that only conduct of the employee or applicant that is related to the duties to be assigned to an employee or applicant or to the employee's or applicant's performance or the performance of others may be taken into consideration in determining that employee's suitability or fitness. Conviction of a crime which has no bearing on the duties to be assigned to an employee or applicant or on the employee's or applicant's performance or the performance of others may not be the basis for discrimination for or against an employee or applicant. H.R. Conf. Rep. 1717, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 131 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 USCCAN 2723, 2860, 2864.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court concluded in <span class="Italic">Gloster</span> that although a required showing of nexus is not excused in cases involving criminal offenses, in some cases a presumption or inference of nexus may be made that eliminates the need to prove through evidence a particular showing of impairment of service efficiency. This inference may be rebutted. Without evidence of a security risk or evidence of the notoriety of the offense, there was no proof that the offense affected the ability of the employee to do her job or the ability of other employees to do theirs. Because the absence of risk was evidenced through concessions by the agency and findings of the Board, the court concluded that an inference of nexus was rebutted. It reversed the Board with directions to order the employee's reinstatement with back pay. The Board generally omits reference to <span class="Italic">Gloster</span> in its nexus analyses.</p>
