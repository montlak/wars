<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-61"><span class="space">4.</span> Collective Bargaining Contract Stay Provision; Postal Service Employee; Agency-Initiated Stay</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Some collective bargaining contracts provide that the effective date of an adverse action is stayed pending appeal. Under one Postal Service contract, once the action is appealed, the employee is placed into a nonduty status pending the outcome of an appeal or grievance. The Postal Service arrangement does not affect the effective date of the removal, <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. OPM</span>, 62 MSPR 536, 550 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As a result of a collective bargaining agreement, the Postal Service retains employees who appeal a removal action to the Board on the agency rolls in a non-pay status until the final disposition of the appeal; if the employee does not prevail on appeal, he is then separated from the Postal Service's rolls. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Benjamin v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 555, 557 (1986). The Board, however, views the removal of an employee covered by the collective bargaining agreement as being effective on the effective date contained in the agency's decision notice, not the date reflected in the PS Form 50 when the employee is eventually separated from the Postal Service's rolls after final disposition of his Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Benjamin</span>, 29 MSPR at 557. Thus, even though the Postal Service did not separate the appellant from its rolls until August 18, 1992, his removal was effective June 8, 1990, the date reflected in the Postal Service's original decision notice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McNeil v. USPS</span>, 98 MSPR 18, 22-23 &#x00B6; 9 (2004), explained as to the nonpay status of Postal employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, a petition for appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date of the action being appealed or 30 days after the date of receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). The agency's decision notice indicated that the appellant's removal was effective January 18, 2003. According to a certified mail receipt, the appellant received the decision notice on January 23, 2003. Thus, this appeal should have been filed no later than February 22, 2003, and the appellant's petition for appeal filed on October 31, 2003, was over eight months late. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). This is true even though the Postal Service retained the appellant on the agency's rolls in a non-pay status until the final disposition of his grievance. The Board views the removal of such an employee as being constructively effective on the effective date contained in the agency's decision notice, not the date when the employee is eventually separated from the Postal Service's rolls. <span class="Italic">See Nabors</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. at 659 n.4;<span class="Italic"> Benjamin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 555, 557 (1986). Further, the appellant does not have a right to request that the Board review the final grievance decision, and thus the date of the arbitration award does not determine the timeliness of this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Zuhlke v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 401, 404 n.4 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mitchell v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-13-1706-I-1 (NP 7/10/2014), reprised the theme:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges in his petition for review that he is still an active Postal Service employee. The appellant submits a screen print from the agency's attendance system that shows him as an active employee. The Board has previously acknowledged that the Postal Service is unique in that the agency does not drop an employee from its rolls on the effective date of removal but retains an employee on the rolls until his case has been disposed of, either by settlement or exhaustion of his Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Benjamin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 555, 556-57 (1986). We also note that the additional screen print which the appellant provided references him as being in a leave status of "full day LWOP--pending term." This leave status reflects the agency's processing procedures referenced in <span class="Italic">Benjamin</span> and does not support the appellant's claim that he is still an active employee.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If, in accordance with Postal Service practices, an individual assumes a nonpay, nonduty status during the pendency of an appeal from a termination, the time for filing the appeal to the Board runs from the termination, not from a later "resignation" from the attenuated employment status. <span class="Italic">Munson v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-2120); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Wasserman v.

USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 579, 580-81 (1991)). The Board should accept jurisdiction of a timely appeal under these circumstances, and any action of the employee subsequent to the effective date of the action and the nonduty status, e.g., resignation (to apply for retirement contribution refunds), constitutes no more than a "ministerial" relinquishment of the nonduty, nonpay status and has no effect on the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Benjamin v.

<p class="Body-Text">In a variant on the unusual Postal Service practice of maintaining discharged employees on the rolls pending challenges to their removals under grievance procedures, the Board determined that the effective date for purposes of an appeal may have been extended based upon the explicit change of the appellant's removal date by management in accordance with the grievance process invoked by the appellant, <span class="Italic">McGarrity v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency employed the appellant as a Letter Carrier at the Huntington Post Office, Huntington, New York. On or about September 27, 2005, the agency informed the appellant that, effective October 28, 2005, he would be removed based on alleged misconduct. On October 20, 2005, the appellant filed a grievance of the agency's decision. On November 7, 2005, a joint union-agency dispute resolution team issued a "Step B Decision" that resolved the appellant's grievance and upheld the underlying removal action, but set the appellant's "removal date" as November 7, 2005. In a letter dated November 14, 2005, the union informed the appellant of the adverse "Step B Decision" and reminded him that he could challenge the removal before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 13, 2005, the appellant filed an appeal with the Board. The administrative judge dismissed the appellant's appeal as untimely filed. She found that the 30-day filing period began running, at the latest, on November 7, 2005, and that, accordingly, the appeal, filed on December 13, 2005, was late.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A Board appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). On September 27, 2005, the agency issued a letter of decision setting the effective date of the appellant's removal as October 28, 2005. The due date for any appeal would ordinarily have been November 27, 2005.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the appellant filed a grievance. The general rule is that an individual who is affected by a personnel action that is both appealable to the Board and covered by a negotiated grievance procedure may contest the action before the Board or in a grievance, but not both. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), (e)(1); <span class="Italic">Crawford-Graham v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 389, &#x00B6; 6 (2005). This rule does not apply, however, to an employee of the Postal Service; such an employee can file a grievance and a Board appeal from the same action. <span class="Italic">See Marjie v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 95, 98 (1996). Pursuit of a grievance does not extend the time for filing a Board appeal, however. <span class="Italic">See Masdea v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 556, &#x00B6; 8 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances presented here, the "Step B Decision" is the equivalent of an amended decision, or, as the appellant puts it, an "amended termination." Although the "Step B Decision" was issued in response to the appellant's grievance, it was not an arbitration award or similar third-party ruling that would have no effect on the Board's filing deadlines. <span class="Italic">See Masdea</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 556, &#x00B6; 8. Rather, the "Step B Decision" was signed by an agency official, and it modified a fundamental feature of the agency's September 27, 2005 decision letter, namely, the effective date of the appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">Cf. Mathis v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 231, &#x00B6; 5 (2005) (where the agency changed the effective date of the appellant's removal to a date later than the one specified in the removal decision, the later effected date controlled for purposes of determining the Board's filing deadline); <span class="Italic">accord Suber v. Department of the Navy</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 498, 499 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_946"></span>The agency does not contest the appellant's allegation that he received the "Step B Decision" on November 16, 2005. This allegation is plausible on its face, considering that the union's letter transmitting the "Step B Decision" was dated November 14, 2005. The appellant then filed his appeal on December 13, 2005, fewer than 30 days after he received the amended decision. The appeal was therefore timely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that under a practice that appears to be unique to the U.S. Postal Service, when a bargaining unit employee grieves a removal, the agency ordinarily carries the employee on the rolls beyond the date that the removal was set to become effective until the grievance is resolved. The Board has held that its filing deadline runs from the date that the removal was originally set to become effective--the "constructive" effective date--even though the actual separation occurs later. <span class="Italic">See McNeil v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 18, &#x00B6; 9 (2004). Assuming for the sake of argument that in this case the appellant was merely carried on the agency rolls until November 7 and that his removal was "constructively" effective on October 28, we find, as an alternative to our finding above that the appeal was timely filed, that the appeal was untimely filed but with good cause. Again, the "Step B Decision" informed the appellant that his "removal date" was November 7, 2005; it did not inform him that the "constructive" effective date of his removal was October 28 or otherwise explain the distinction between the actual and the "constructive" effective date of a personnel action. We find that the appellant reasonably interpreted the "Step B Decision" as changing the effective date of his removal to November 7, and as provided in the Board's regulation, he filed his appeal within 30 days of the date that he received the "Step B Decision." Thus, he acted with due diligence, assuming in the alternative that his appeal could be considered untimely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a Postal Service case, the Board caused many a jurisdictional snag by condoning an agreement that an employee twice removed (once while on duty status and once while on nonduty status allowed under the negotiated agreement following the first removal) could contest the second removal and have the outcome of the first removal dependent on the outcome of the second. <span class="Italic">Wilkins v. USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 579, 584 (1991); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">McGrath v. USPS</span>, 22 MSPR 241, 243 (1984) (when the arbitrator maintained jurisdiction over a prior removal case for six months, and the agency reinstituted removal prior to the lapse of the arbitrator's jurisdiction, the Board had jurisdiction over the removal appeal from a final decision issued after the six-month period of retained jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wilkins</span> was developed, to an extent, in <span class="Italic">Hopkins v. USPS</span>, 108 MSPR 25, 28-30 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-13, 2008 MSPB 18 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has viewed the removal of a Postal Service employee, who is retained on the agency's rolls in a non-pay status until the final disposition of a grievance, as being constructively effective on the effective date contained in the agency's decision notice, rather than on the date when the employee is eventually separated from the Postal Service's rolls. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McNeil</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 18, &#x00B6; 9. The AJ appears to have relied upon this principle in finding that the effective date of the appellant's removal was June 3, 2005.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has applied the general principle set forth above based on its interpretation of collective bargaining agreements entered into between the Postal Service and certain employee unions. <span class="Italic">See Wilkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 579, 580-84 (1986); <span class="Italic">Benjamin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 555, 557 (1986). The Board in <span class="Italic">Wilkins</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. at 580, for example, relied upon Article 16.5 of a collective bargaining agreement that covered Postal police officers and provided that a Postal Service employee who files a grievance concerning the action "'shall remain on the rolls (non-pay status) until disposition of the case has been had either by settlement with the Union or through exhaustion of the grievance-arbitration procedure.'" The Board in <span class="Italic">Benjamin</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. at 557, held that language similar to that set forth in <span class="Italic">Wilkins</span> only delays a final administrative act, and does not change the fact that the removal was conclusive, final, and effective as of the date set forth in the decision letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has nevertheless found that a settlement agreement reached during a grievance could serve to change the employment status of an employee who has been kept on the agency's rolls in a non-pay status after a removal, and thereby alter the general rule that the effective date of a removal is the date set forth in the decision letter. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Wilkins</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. at 582-84, the parties entered into an agreement settling a grievance under which the processing of Mr. Wilkins' grievance of a first removal action would be suspended pending Board adjudication of his appeal of a subsequent removal. If the second removal were upheld by the Board, Mr. Wilkins would concede to the reinstatement and propriety of the first removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 584. Conversely, if the second removal were overturned, the agency would reinstate Mr. Wilkins retroactively to the effective date of the first removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board held in <span class="Italic">Wilkins</span> that the agreement effectively constituted "disposition of the...case...by settlement with the Union," sufficient to remove the situation from the parameters of Article 16.5 of the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the Board held that the first removal was "constructively rescinded" by the settlement agreement, and Mr. Wilkins' employment status at the time of the second removal was such that the action had force and effect and was within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency's decision letter here informed the appellant that, if he appealed the action he would remain on the agency's rolls in a non-pay, non-duty status until disposition of his case was reached by settlement or exhaustion of administrative remedies, the record does not include a copy of any collective bargaining agreement that applies to the appellant, who was represented during the grievance proceedings by the National Rural Letter Carriers' Association. Thus, it is not clear from the existing record whether the general principle set forth in <span class="Italic">McNeil, Wilkins</span>, and <span class="Italic">Benjamin</span> should apply in this case. More important, if a collective bargaining agreement provision similar to those described in <span class="Italic">Wilkins</span> and <span class="Italic">Benjamin</span> applies, the pre-arbitration settlement agreement in this case, under which the appellant's removal was held in abeyance, may have effectively rescinded the June 3, 2005 removal and set the stage for a different removal date, such as the January 12, 2007 date set forth in the Postal Service Form 50.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the AJ finds on remand that June 3, 2005, is not the appropriate effective date for the appellant's removal because of the pre-arbitration settlement, the record does not address when the agency first informed the appellant of his January 12, 2007 removal "per pre-arbitration agreement." When an agency issues a decision notice to an employee on a matter that is appealable to the Board, the agency must provide the employee with notice of Board appeal rights. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21. An appellant who was not provided a required notice of appeal rights is not required to show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights; the question then is whether he was diligent in filing an appeal after he learned he could do so. <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 583, 588 (1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Murray v. DOD</span>, 92 MSPR 361, 364-67 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-13 (2002), determined that the Board is not divested of jurisdiction over an adverse action appeal by a provision of a collective bargaining contract that stayed the effect of the suspension pending the Board appeal. Harkening to law developed in labor relations, <span class="Italic">DOD, AAFES v. FLRA</span>, 659 F.2d 1140 (D.C. Cir. 1981), the Board noted that the agency's decision was a complete resolution of the matter and that the decision was not tentative, provisional, contingent, subject to recall, revision, or reconsideration by the agency. The only remaining step was execution of the decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 92 MSPR 392 (2002) (involving a settlement agreement). For discussion of the legality, under federal labor law, of stay provisions in other contracts and their effect on Board appeals jurisdiction, review <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 712 F.2d 669 (D.C. Cir. 1983). <span class="Italic">Goeke &#x0026; Bottini v. DOJ</span>, 122 MSPR 69, 75-76 n.5, 2015 MSPB 1 (2015), determined that decisions to impose suspensions of more than 14 days were appealable despite the agency's effective stay of implementation of those suspensions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the administrative judge explained that appellant Bottini has not served any portion of his 40-day suspension, and that appellant Goeke has only served 1 day. Despite the fact that neither appellant has served more than 14 days in a nonpay status, the administrative judge concluded that the Board has jurisdiction over these appeals because "the agency's actions bear all the attributes of finality" discussed in <span class="Italic">Murray v. Department of Defense</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 361, &#x00B6; 12 (2002), and because the agency "has given no indication that it will not eventually carry out the suspensions, at least if they are not reversed." In <span class="Italic">Murray</span>, the Board held that it had jurisdiction over a suspension in excess of 14 days which had been stayed pending the employee's Board appeal. 92 M.S.P.R. 361, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13. The agency has not challenged the administrative judge's findings on review or contested the Board's jurisdiction over these appeals, and we agree with the administrative judge that the Board has jurisdiction over both appeals challenging the appellants' suspensions.</p>
