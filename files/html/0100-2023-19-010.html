<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-11"><span class="space">c.</span> EEO Class Action</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The class appeal or complaint procedure is seldom employed in MSPB litigation. As to timeliness of a Board appeal from a mixed case initiated as an EEO class complaint, the Board announced in <span class="Italic">Carey v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 103 MSPR 534, 538-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-22, 2006 MSPB 295 (2006), what amounts to a constructive "opt-in" procedure for persons encompassed within the class of an EEO complaint who wait out the EEO process and then seek to obtain hearings before the MSPB: "the filing of a timely class complaint of discrimination at the agency level extends the time for filing a Board appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b) if the appellant was a member of the class, intended to challenge the personnel action covered by the class complaint, and deliberately delayed filing a Board appeal based on a good faith belief that his or her rights were being pursued on a class basis at the agency level." The Board's injection of a requirement that individuals within a class demonstrate that they relied upon the EEO class complaint to vindicate their rights is not found in either regulations of the MSPB or EEOC, but was a requirement, imposed over the dissent of Member Sapin, to avoid addressing an antiquated set of appeals arising out of a 1995 RIF. Under <span class="Italic">Carey</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants filed these appeals in 2005, challenging a RIF that the agency conducted in 1995. Whether the appeals may proceed depends on how we interpret and apply several related rules.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who is affected by an action that is appealable to the Board may file a formal complaint of discrimination at the agency level or may appeal directly to the Board, but not both. Whichever is filed first is deemed a binding election to proceed in that forum. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(a), (b); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(b); <span class="Italic">Gomez-Burgos v. Department of Defense,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 245, 248 (1998); <span class="Italic">Shalwala v. Small Business Administration</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 168, 170-71 (1996). A Board appeal "must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). However--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the appellant has filed a timely formal complaint of discrimination with the agency...[A]n appeal must be filed [with the Board] within 30 days after the appellant receives the agency resolution or final decision on the discrimination issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b). In addition--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;When a class appeal is filed [with the Board], the time from the filing date until the judge issues his or her decision under paragraph (b) of this section is not counted in computing the time limit for individual members of the potential class to file individual appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3326"></span>(b)&#x2003;If the judge denies the request [for class treatment], the appellants affected by the decision may file individual appeals within 30 days after the date of receipt of the decision denying the request to be heard as a class appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.27.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is for the agency, not the Board, to determine whether a formal EEO complaint was timely filed. <span class="Italic">See Moore v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 6 (2002). Furthermore, the Board will defer to the EEOC on procedural matters affecting formal EEO complaints. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 341-42 (1995). Based on these two established principles, one could argue, as the dissent does, that these appeals were timely filed. According to the Final Agency Decision, Ms. Throckmorton and Ms. Nichols filed their formal EEO complaint five days after EEO counseling ended, making their complaint timely. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.106(b). Ultimately the EEOC ordered the agency to treat that complaint as a class complaint, and the appellants were members of the class. Ms. Throckmorton filed a Board appeal by the 30-day deadline following the Final Agency Decision, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b), and the appellants filed these appeals within 30 days of receipt of the AJ's decision denying Ms. Throckmorton's request for class treatment, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201. 27(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rationale outlined above for finding that these appeals were timely filed actually depends on a third principle that is not established, namely, a timely-filed class complaint of discrimination automatically triggers 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b) and extends the deadline for all class members to file Board appeals. The AJ appears to have taken the opposite view, suggesting that the filing of a class complaint of discrimination at the agency level never triggers the deadline-extending rule of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b) for class members other than class representatives. The correct rule lies somewhere between these two extremes. We hold that the filing of a timely class complaint of discrimination at the agency level extends the time for filing a Board appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b) if the appellant was a member of the class, intended to challenge the personnel action covered by the class complaint, and deliberately delayed filing a Board appeal based on a good faith belief that his or her rights were being pursued on a class basis at the agency level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A rule that the filing of a timely class complaint of discrimination never triggers section 1201.154(b) as to non-representative class members would weaken the class complaint system. Such a rule would force any class member who wished to protect his or her right to Board review either to file an individual discrimination complaint or to appeal directly to the Board. If enough individuals made the choice to opt out of the class in order to protect their Board appeal rights, the EEOC's class complaint procedures would be rendered ineffective; the efficiency and uniformity benefits that flow from investigating and deciding allegations of discrimination on a class basis would be lost.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, a rule that the filing of a timely class complaint of discrimination automatically triggers section 1201.154(b) as to all class members would devalue administrative finality, and in some instances could encourage an individual to pursue a belated appeal that he or she originally had no interest in pursuing. As explained below, the cases presently before the Board are illustrative of both problems.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin our discussion by observing that EEO counseling is merely a prelude to the first of three major steps that a federal employee may take to challenge a RIF or other action that is appealable to the Board and that the employee believes is discriminatory. The first step is the filing of a formal EEO complaint with the employing agency, which triggers an agency investigation and a Final Agency Decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. Parts 1614A, 1614C. The second step is a Board appeal, which consists of a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> proceeding before an AJ on the merits of the underlying personnel action and the discrimination claim. If either party is dissatisfied with the AJ's decision, it may file a petition for review before the full Board. If the appellant is dissatisfied with the Board's decision on the discrimination issue, he or she may seek review before the EEOC. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701, 7702. The third step is a civil action in federal court, where the discrimination issue is again considered <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(e)(1); 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 216, 633; 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency EEO counselor appears to have delayed the very first step in the above-described process by over 4 years. Under rules that were in effect in 1995 and that are materially identical today, EEO counseling should take just 30 days, with the possibility of extensions of an additional 60 days upon the consent of the counselee. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105 (1995); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.105 (2006). The appellants do not explain how a maximum counseling period of 90 days ballooned to over 4 years, and we are at a loss to understand what happened from 1995 to 2000. Ms. Throckmorton was one of the two employees who sought counseling and asked for recognition of a class on November 10, 1995, yet by that time she had already filed an individual Board appeal. Ms. Throckmorton thus made a binding election to proceed before the Board and to forego the EEO complaint process. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(a), (b); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(b); <span class="Italic">Gomez-Burgos,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. at 248. We find it difficult to accept the notion that Ms. Throckmorton was properly in EEO counseling concerning the RIF while she was litigating a Board appeal from that very same RIF to a final decision on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEO complaint took another odd turn when, 8 years after the RIF, the EEOC ordered the agency to process it as a class complaint with Ms. Throckmorton and Ms. Nichols as the class representatives. Before the EEOC issued its order in 2003, Ms. Throckmorton and Ms. Nichols had already abandoned the agency EEO process by filing individual appeals with the Board. Since Ms. Throckmorton and Ms. Nichols gave up their right to file formal complaints of discrimination at the agency level by electing to file Board appeals, they were not appropriate class representatives. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jung v. Ass'n of American Medical Colleges</span>, 300 F. Supp.2d 119, 136 n.8 (D.D.C. 2004) (the named representative must satisfy all jurisdictional prerequisites before a class action can go forward); <span class="Italic">Levels v. Akzo Nobel Salt, Inc.</span>, 178 F.R.D. 171, 179 (N.D. Ohio 1998) (same). Indeed, according to the AJ's findings in the now-final Board decision denying Ms. Throckmorton's request for class certification, the EEOC instructed the agency to certify a class of about 70 people, even though roughly one-third of them had no interest in pursuing a discrimination complaint, another one-third of them were barred by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> from asserting discrimination claims, and a few of them were deceased. The effect of the EEOC's 2003 decision was to breathe life into discrimination claims that many individuals had no interest in pursuing, that the class representatives were legally barred from pursuing, and that the agency may not have been eager to investigate because, among other things, 8 years had passed since the RIF that was the subject of the class complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite our concerns about the delay in completing EEO counseling and the appropriateness of the class certification, the appellants should not be harmed by any procedural irregularities if they intended to preserve their right to file Board appeals but delayed doing so because they reasonably believed that Ms. Throckmorton and Ms. Nichols were pursuing EEO counseling and a discrimination claim on their behalf. That is not what happened, however. Based on the appellants' arguments on timeliness made to the AJ, the appellants first became interested in formally challenging the RIF in 2003, when they were notified that the EEOC OFO had ordered the agency to investigate the complaint of Ms. Throckmorton and Ms. Nichols as a class complaint. As noted above, the appellants were informed in 1995 that they had 30 days to appeal the RIF actions to the Board. The AJ's show-cause order on timeliness stated that it did not appear that the appellants delayed filing their Board appeals because others were pursuing a class EEO complaint on their behalf, and afforded the appellants an opportunity to explain why they were appealing the RIF 10 years after it had occurred. In response, the appellants did not allege that they delayed filing because they believed that their rights were being protected during more than 4 years of EEO counseling and an additional 3 years leading up to certification of the class complaint. Indeed, appellant Carey makes clear in her submission that she did not make any effort to find out what was happening during the more than 4 years of EEO counseling that was supposedly being conducted on her behalf, and she appears to admit that she was not even aware that counseling was taking place. Appellant Butler does not give any explanation for his failure to pursue his rights or make inquiries between 1995 and 2003. In sum, the appellants have not shown, or even alleged, that as to the first 8 years in the 10-year period between the RIF and their filing of these appeals, they delayed filing with the Board based on a belief that their rights were being preserved because others were pursuing relief on their behalf at the agency level and before the EEOC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To sum up, in interpreting the Board's regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b), we must balance the need for finality in personnel actions that are not explicitly challenged by the individuals affected with the efficiency and uniformity benefits in having discrimination complaints investigated and decided on a class basis. In the present cases, the balance tips in favor of finality. The appellants were informed that they could appeal the RIF to the Board within 30 days. They did not do so, nor did they delay filing based on a belief that others were pursuing a discrimination complaint on their behalf. The dissent does not even suggest that there is anything unfair in dismissing these particular appeals, filed 10 years after the RIF, as untimely, and under the facts of these cases we see no unfairness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, the main concern expressed in the dissent is that the benefits of class litigation may be lost if individual filing deadlines are not suspended while class proceedings are conducted. This concern is addressed by our holding today. If a class member delays filing an individual Board appeal because he is relying on a class representative to pursue his rights at the agency level, then 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b) will operate to extend the deadline for filing a Board appeal. On the facts presented in these cases, though, section 1201.154(b) was not triggered. The purpose of section 1201.154(b) is to allow an individual who wishes to pursue the EEO process at the agency level to do so without losing his right of Board appeal. That purpose would not be served by treating these cases as timely filed under section 1201.154(b) because for the first 8 years after <span id="Page_3327"></span>the RIF, the appellants did not wish to pursue the EEO process at the agency level and did not wish to file Board appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, having found that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b) did not extend the deadline for filing these appeals, we conclude that the appeals were filed more than 9 years beyond the deadline. To establish good cause for the untimely filing of an appeal, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). Based on the appellants' arguments on timeliness made to the AJ, described above, the appellants have not shown good cause. They were aware that they could file Board appeals within 30 days, they did not do so, and for the first 8 years after the RIF they did not reasonably believe that they were permitted to delay filing their Board appeals while some other process worked itself to a conclusion.</p>
