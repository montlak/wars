<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-178"><span class="space">c.</span> Pre-<span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Tunik</span></span> Decisions; Judicial Independence</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Tunik</span>, definition of a constructive adverse action against an ALJ generated a small body of case law involving attempts to construe as removals, suspensions, or reductions in pay certain agency actions that arguably interfere with the ability of judges to pursue their judicial duties. The decisions have some continuing significance to the extent they comment on judicial independence--a concept relevant to more recent performance-based complaints against ALJs. One of the more comprehensive discussions of the preexisting definition of an action constructively within the Board's jurisdiction appeared in the decision styled <span class="Italic">In re Doyle</span>, 29 MSPR 170, 173-75 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Judge Doyle argued that the agency had failed to give him the notice required under 5 USC 7513(b) for actions covered in section 7512. He also argued that the agency's action had impaired the performance of his official duties, which required him to travel to hear cases. He filed an "appeal" on the form available for appeals to the Board under 5 USC 7701. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.24(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A reduction in pay is an adverse action under section 7512, which gives rise under section 7513(d) to an appeal to the Board under section 7701. A reduction in pay is also covered under section 7521, which requires a hearing prior to the agency's taking the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the Board proceeds on the allegation of a reduction of pay under sections 7512 or section 7521 has significant consequences. If the action falls under section 7521, not only does that section require a pre-action hearing, but also that section requires the Board to give a hearing under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 USC 557) and to render the decision itself. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.132. Moreover, the Board notes that an action "initiated" under section 7521 is excluded from the coverage of section 7512. 5 USC 7512(E).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board holds that when an administrative law judge's allegation concerns an agency action covered under section 7521 and he alleges the action was taken without the required hearing and decision by the Board, the Board must consider the complaint under section 7521 regardless of the form of the complaint. Because of the significant protections afforded an administrative law judge under section 7521, the Board considers Judge Doyle's complaint as having invoked the Board's authority under section 7521.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The Board suggests that when alleging that an agency has taken an action covered by section 7521 without following the required procedures, an administrative law judge should file a pleading with the Board invoking that section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The substantive differences in the procedural entitlements under section 7701 and section 7521 also affect the issue for decision by the Board. A proceeding initiated by an administrative law judge under section 7521 does not raise an issue of the merits of the agency action. The only issue before the Board is whether the alleged action falls under section 7521 and was taken prior to the hearing and Board decision required under that section. That showing is sufficient to establish that the agency acted unlawfully and that the administrative law judge is entitled to relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to considering whether the alleged non-payment of the voucher was a reduction in pay, Judge Reidy also examined the action as a possible constructive removal under section 7521. Judge Reidy recognized that some agency actions might constitute a "removal" under section 7521 although their effect was not to separate an administrative law judge from federal employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the arguments of the agency and OPM, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 did not change the concept of what might constitute a "removal" under section 7521. To accomplish the legislative purpose of section 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act (Pub. L. 79-404, 60 Stat. 240 (1946)), subsequently enacted as 5 USC 7521 (Pub. L. 89-554, 80 Stat. 528 (1966)), "removal" has consistently been interpreted as protecting an administrative law judge from actions of his employing agency that could impair his qualified judicial independence. The purpose of this protection is to insulate the administrative hearing process from the improper influence of the employing agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ramspeck v. Federal Trial Examiners</span>, 345 U.S. 128, 129-134, 73 S. Ct. 570, 571-574, 97 L. Ed. 872 (1953); <span class="Italic">Benton v. United States</span>, 488 F.2d 1017, 1020-1022, 203 Cl.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although section 7521 of the Reform Act was revised to specify forbidden actions in addition to removal, the revision did not substantively change section 7521.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Benton v. United States</span>, 488 F.2d 1017, 203 Cl.

Ct. at 269. Consistent with the court's position in <span class="Italic">Benton</span>, the Board also recognizes the possibility of an agency's constructively removing an administrative law judge by cumulative administrative actions or active intervention in a manner calculated to prevent the impartial exercise of his judicial functions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">In re Doyle</span>, 24 MSPR 409 (1984) adopting the Recommended Decision of Chief Administrative Law Judge John J. McCarthy. Whether the Board takes jurisdiction over an action as a "constructive removal" within section 7521 depends on the sufficiency of the allegations in showing that the challenged action has a pernicious effect on the complaining judge's qualified independence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying this analysis to Judge Doyle's complaint, we find for the reasons stated in the Recommended Decision that Judge Doyle's allegation of non-payment of a single voucher is not a reduction in pay and, in this case, is insufficient to constitute a constructive removal under section 7521. Judge Doyle's complaint is a frivolous attempt to invoke the Board's jurisdiction over actions that, as he has alleged them, present no threat to the performance of his judicial functions.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Interference with an ALJ's qualified judicial independence is considered to be a constructive removal and, contrary to the agency's suggestion, an affected ALJ has standing to appeal such a matter to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521. <span class="Italic">See Stephens v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To state a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of constructive removal, the claimant must allege facts, which if proven true, could establish that the agency's action or intervention "affect[ed] the ability of the ALJ to function as an independent impartial decision maker." <span class="Italic">Stephens</span>, 986 F.2d at 496, quoting <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>, 931 F.2d at 858 ("Well-pleaded allegations tying the agency actions to impairment of their decision-making independence are, at minimum, necessary to establish <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> Board jurisdiction."); <span class="Italic">see also Ferdon v.

In determining whether a claimant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of constructive removal, the presiding ALJ may consider the agency's documentary submissions but may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties unless such a determination can be made on the written submissions alone. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sannier</span>, 931 F.2d at 859; <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 329; <span class="Italic">see also Milanak v. Department of Transportation</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 219 &#x00B6; 9 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleged that the agency "directly and significantly" interfered with his "authority, duties and decisional independence" on at least two occasions. In Count 1, the appellant alleged that he was assigned a case involving a claimant named Jeremiah Ned in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 554 and 556. In February and again in April 2001, Mr. Ned's representative, John Donahue, sent letters to the appellant requesting a favorable on-the-record (OTR) decision in the Ned case. An OTR decision is akin to summary judgment and may be issued by the presiding ALJ without receiving testimony or additional evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 404.948(a) and 416.1448(a). "For unknown reasons, [Mr. Donahue's] letters were not given to [the appellant] until May 1"....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In March and again in April 2001, Mr. Donahue wrote letters to Hearing Office Chief (HOC) Riley Atkins in which he complained "about the failure of [the appellant] to issue a favorable decision" with regard to his OTR request. Thereafter, HOC Atkins and Regional Chief Administrative Law Judge (RCALJ) David DeLaittre "made a verbal inquiry on or about April 6 about any policy [the appellant] had regarding on the record favorable decisions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 1, 2001, the appellant reviewed the OTR request in the Ned case and "learned of Donahue's" complaint letters that had been sent to his managers. After reviewing the record evidence to determine whether an OTR decision was warranted, the appellant denied the OTR request. The next day, RCALJ DeLaittre effectively "revoked" the appellant's "decisional authority" in the Ned case when he reassigned it to another ALJ after agency officials became "upset" with the appellant's ruling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged, based "[u]pon information and belief," that such reassignments were "made based on management's perception of how a judge might rule in a particular case." The appellant further alleged that his "whistleblowing <span id="Page_2269"></span>was a contributing factor in management's illegal actions" and further, that his managers took the reassignment action in reprisal for "EEO complaints" that he had previously filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After carefully reviewing the appellant's submissions, we find, as did the presiding ALJ in this case, that the appellant's allegations in Count 1 sufficiently articulate facts which, if proven true, could establish that the agency's action had a pernicious effect on the appellant's qualified judicial independence by preventing him from exercising his judicial functions in the Ned case<span class="Italic">. See In re Sannier</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 420, 426 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 931 F.2d 856 (Fed. Cir. 1991)...Here, a showing that the agency reassigned the Ned case from the appellant to another ALJ in an effort to manipulate or control the outcome of this case could clearly constitute an <span class="Italic">active intervention</span> by the agency which affected the appellant's ability "to function as a independent and impartial decision maker." <span class="Italic">See Sannier</span>, 931 F.2d at 858. Similarly, a showing that the agency stripped the appellant of his judicial functions in the Ned case to, punish him for his whistleblowing and/or EEO activity could also constitute a constructive removal via <span class="Italic">active intervention.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's suggestion that the appellant's claims in Count 1 failed to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case for constructive removal because his factual allegations "do not support an inference that the Appellant's qualified judicial independence has been impaired" defies logic. Here, the agency's intervention, as alleged, effectively stripped the appellant of his ability to exercise his judicial function in the Ned case altogether. <span class="Italic">Cf. Stephens,</span> 986 F.2d at 496 (petitioner did not satisfy <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> burden under 7521 because he did not show how requirement that he attend an "instructional program is calculated to interfere with his impartial decisionmaking"); <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>, 931 F.2d at 859 (petitioners failed to allege "how or why" agency's actions compromised their judicial independence). Accordingly, the appellant's allegations in Count 1 constitute a prima case of constructive removal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In Count 2, the appellant alleged that the agency's practice of reassigning "cases outside the usual rotational procedures" mandated by the APA directly interfered with his judicial independence by "revok[ing] his authority to act" in the cases affected by this practice. Specifically, the appellant alleged that "at least one other judge ha[d] been observed taking cases assigned to [the appellant] or his group" in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3105.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleged, as he did in Count 1, that agency officials removed the case from his docket in an effort to manipulate the outcome of judicial decisions based on the agency's "perception of how a judge might rule in a particular case" and because the agency was retaliating against the appellant for his whistleblowing and EEO activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The APA mandates that ALJs "shall be assigned to cases in rotation so far as practicable." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3105. The federal courts have interpreted this "so far as practicable" language to afford agencies a "modicum of discretion" to depart from this rotational order when such a departure is made to further the interest of administrative efficiency. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Tractor Training Service v. Federal Trade</span> Commission, 227 F.2d 420, 423 (9th Cir. 1955) (agency's decision to disturb distribution of case rotation and reassign a case from an East Coast hearing examiner to a different examiner in Oregon was justified, under APA, in "the interests of economy"), citing <span class="Italic">Ramspeck</span>, 345 U.S. at 139, 73 S.

Bureau of Hearings and Appeals,</span> 548 F. Supp. 1349, 1369-70 (E.D.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, where a claimant makes a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency abused its discretion under the APA when it reassigned a case from the claimant to another ALJ in violation of the rotational order mandated by section 3105, and that such a reassignment affected his ability to function as an independent impartial decision maker, the claimant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> jurisdictional burden is satisfied under section 7521. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Aaacon</span>, 792 F.2d at 1163 (claimant must demonstrate that agency abused its discretion when it reassigned case outside the rotational order mandated by the APA to support constructive removal finding).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleged that the agency abused its discretion when it reassigned cases outside the rotational distribution procedure mandated by section 3105. Specifically, the appellant alleged that agency officials removed at least one case from his docket in an effort to manipulate the outcome based on the agency's "perception of how a judge might rule in a particular case" and because the agency was retaliating against him for his whistleblowing and EEO activity. <span class="Italic">[S]ee also</span> <span class="Italic">Bennett</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 120 (<span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case based on administrative action is established where ALJ makes specific allegations linking agency's action in a way that supports an inference that agency took actions in an attempt to influence ALJ's findings or outcome of his decisions). We find that the agency's action, as alleged, could constitute a constructive removal by active intervention because the agency departed from the rotational assignment of cases mandate of the APA, without good cause, and effectively stripped the appellant of his authority "to function as an independent impartial decision maker" in at least one case. <span class="Italic">See Stephens,</span> 986 F.2d at 496.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize, however, that the agency may subsequently refute the appellant's allegations in Count 2 by demonstrating that it reasonably exercised its discretion under the APA when it departed from the rotational distribution of cases mandated by section 3105 and reassigned a case from the appellant's docket to another ALJ. <span class="Italic">Cf</span> <span class="Italic">Aaacon</span>, 792 F.2d at 1163 (agency demonstrated that good cause validated departure from APA mandate); <span class="Italic">Tractor Training Service,</span> 227 F.2d at 423 (same); <span class="Italic">Lawson,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. at 678-79 (same); <span class="Italic">In re Sannier</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. at 425 (same). Conversely, the appellant may, in turn, refute the agency's contention by introducing additional evidence to support a finding that "the intent and effect" of the agency's action was "to interfere with" his qualified judicial independence. <span class="Italic">Aaacon</span>, 792 F.2d at 1163. In any event, these determinations should be made by the presiding ALJ only after all of the evidence has been considered in this matter as discussed below. In sum, we find that the appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of constructive removal in Count 2.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]n ALJ may properly consider claims of discrimination and retaliation in an alleged constructive removal appeal for the limited purpose of determining whether the agency improperly infringed on the appellant's qualified judicial independence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fahrenbacher</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 260 &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Tripp v.

<p class="Body-Text">Cases not rising to the level of allegations of actual interference in the ALJ decisionmaking process included challenges to minor discipline as a constructive removal.

Relying on <span class="Italic">In re Doyle</span>, 29 MSPR 170 (1985), the Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, involving an allegation by an ALJ that he was constructively removed and reduced in pay through a written reprimand and disputes over travel vouchers, that "agencies do not need to establish that good cause exists for the reprimands which they issue because they do not need our authorization to issue reprimands":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n order to effectuate the protective purposes of section 7521, the Board will consider allegations contained in a filing submitted by an administrative law judge, in order to determine whether the employing agency has improperly taken an action described in section 7521 without the required hearing. <span class="Italic">In re Doyle,</span> 29 MSPR 170 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, in order to insure that agencies do not interfere with the quasi-judicial independence of administrative law judges, the Board also "recognizes the possibility of an agency's constructively removing an administrative law judge by cumulative administrative actions or active intervention in a manner calculated to prevent the impartial exercise of his judicial functions," and, therefore, will take "jurisdiction over...a <span id="Page_2270"></span>'constructive removal'...[where the agency's conduct] has a pernicious effect on the complaining judge's qualified independence." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 175.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a proceeding initiated by an administrative law judge, there is only one issue before the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">whether the alleged action falls under section 7521 and was taken prior to the hearing and Board decision required under that section. That showing is sufficient to establish that the agency acted unlawfully and [that] the administrative law judge is entitled to relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 174.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before discussing Perry's exceptions, we feel constrained to comment upon the frivolous nature of this action. That portion of Perry's travel voucher dispute which was unresolved when he filed this complaint was so minor that it was <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span>. Perry, therefore, had no reasonable basis to believe that his travel voucher allegations were distinguishable, in any material fashion, from those alleged in <span class="Italic">In re Doyle</span>...where we held that "Judge Doyle's allegation of non-payment of a single voucher...[did not constitute] a reduction in pay" and where we found the complaint to be "a frivolous attempt to invoke the Board's jurisdiction over actions that...[presented] no threat to the performance of his judicial functions." Similarly, Perry could not have rationally thought that the SSA's issuance of a single written reprimand amounted to sufficiently pernicious agency conduct that the Board would find that he had been constructively removed from the administrative law judge position.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Dissatisfied employees, even dissatisfied administrative law judges, are allowed to seek review of the appropriateness of minor management actions, like the issuance of reprimands, through the filing of grievances under the provisions of 5 CFR Part 771.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Agencies must establish the existence of good cause before they can take any of the actions set forth in 5 USC 7521(b), and we have held that good cause for such actions cannot be predicated on grounds which improperly interfere with an administrative law judge's performance of judicial functions. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Manion</span>, 19 MSPR 298, 303 (1984). Reprimands, however, are not among the actions set forth in section 7521. As a result, agencies do not need to establish that good cause exists for the reprimands which they issue because they do not need our authorization to issue reprimands.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's decision to give an administrative law judge a single reprimand is not within the Board's jurisdiction. Congress gave the Board prior-approval power over serious ALJ disciplinary actions in order to protect the administrative adjudicatory process--not to have the Board sit in judgment over all agency managerial and supervisory decisions, no matter how minor, regarding administrative law judges.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) of the Social Security Administration (SSA) assigned to the Lansing, Michigan, Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) instituted this case contending that they had been constructively removed without being afforded the rights to which they were entitled under 5 USC 7521. Specifically, they alleged that because of the perception of Regional Chief Administrative Law Judge Theodore Haynes (RCALJ) that administrative law judges should be able to hear 40 cases per month and because of the relatively low production of the Lansing OHA, the following "punitive" measures had occurred: (1) service areas were transferred from the Lansing OHA; (2) the Lansing OHA received rumored threats that it would close; (3) support staff at Lansing was diminished and not replaced; (4) transfer requests would not be approved for "low producers"; and (5) ALJs from Lansing were publicly criticized. The ALJs also contended that as a result of these "punitive" measures, claimants were denied timely and quality service due to the lack of staffing and that the cumulative effect of these managerial measures was an impingement of their independent adjudicative authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[S]o long as the agency's actions do not affect the ability of the ALJ to function as an independent and impartial decisionmaker, they are permissible....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[E]ven if the Board were to assume that the ALJs have suffered, among other things, staffing shortages, transfer restrictions and reduced service areas due to management's perception that the Lansing ALJ production rate was low, they have not alleged in any of the many papers submitted that these actions of management have interfered with their impartial decisionmaking ability.[3] Although in the exceptions of ALJ King, he contends that the push for greater production has led to an increase in "reversal rates," he does not allege that his decisionmaking has been affected by this management policy. Thus, the ALJs have not established that they have been constructively "removed" as contemplated under 5 USC 7521, and the Board has no jurisdiction over their complaint.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7521 establishes and limits Board jurisdiction concerning adverse personnel actions taken against ALJs, and further specifies those actions that may be initiated "only for good cause established and determined by the Merit Systems Protection Board on the record after opportunity for hearing before the Board," 5 USC 7521(a). However, section 7521(b) specifically excludes from Board review reductions in force, suspension or removal for national security reasons, and actions by the Special Counsel that would otherwise require a "good cause" finding by the Board. Also omitted are reprimands and other less serious disciplinary acts. "Reprimands...are not among the actions set forth in section 7521. As a result, agencies do not need to establish that good cause exists...because they do not need [Board] authorization to issue reprimands." <span class="Italic">In re Perry</span>, 39 MSPR 446, 450 (1989). Clearly, the Board was given "prior-approval power over <span class="Italic">serious</span> ALJ disciplinary actions in order to protect the administrative adjudicatory process--[but it was not Congress' intention] to have the Board sit in judgment over all agency <span class="Italic">managerial and supervisory decisions</span>, no matter how minor, regarding [ALJs]."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners do not, and cannot, contend under these facts that they were subjected to any of the enumerated adverse personnel actions listed in subsection (b). Instead, they argue solely that the agency's managerial actions constituted a constructive removal. Although a "constructive" removal is not specifically enumerated in subsection (b), the Board, as well as this court, has recognized that certain acts may be the equivalent, for purposes of Board jurisdiction, of formal removal.... As to ALJs, the Board recognizes the possibility that an ALJ may be constructively removed by "cumulative administrative actions or active intervention...[which] prevent the impartial exercise of his judicial functions...[and which have] a pernicious effect on the complaining judge's qualified independence."...Therefore, as long as the agency actions are not alleged to affect the ability of the ALJ to function as an independent and impartial decision maker, they cannot trigger Board jurisdiction under section 7521....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that "even if [it] were to assume that the ALJs have suffered, among other things, staffing shortages, transfer restrictions and reduced service areas due to management's perception that the Lansing ALJs production rate was low, they have not alleged in any of the many papers submitted that these actions of management have interfered with their impartial decisionmaking ability."...Well-pleaded allegations tying the agency actions to impairment of their decisionmaking independence are, at minimum, necessary to establish <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While ALJ King does contend that the increased pressure to process more cases has led to a higher "reversal rate," he has not specifically alleged that his decision-making has been <span class="Italic">affected</span> by the agency's management decisions. Therefore, petitioners' constructive removal claim properly was not entertained by the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners assert that "[w]hatever [they] may or may not be able to establish as to the merits of their allegations, given the favorable reading required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [or similar procedural guidelines]," they are entitled to a hearing.... While courts and the Board should not eviscerate legitimate appeals solely on the ground of a too strict reading of the allegations, petitioners' attempt to paint themselves as victims of a technical trap is disingenuous. Even if we, as did the Board, assume <span id="Page_2271"></span><span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the agency explicitly instituted overall targets or goals for the number of appeals to be adjudicated per month, such production targets simply are not, by themselves, probative that the ALJ's impartiality or independence in a particular appeal has been or would be compromised. Consequently, since petitioners fail to allege that the productivity targets compromised their judicial independence, much less how or why, we have no occasion to determine whether, under these circumstances, their decisionmaking integrity was affected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners argue that the Board erred by not holding a hearing in regard to their claims. However, the Board is not required to hold a hearing when facts giving rise to jurisdiction are not properly alleged, even though, as here, its existence may be asserted.... This court did note in <span class="Italic">Manning</span>, however, that the Board <span class="Italic">may</span> hold a hearing if non-frivolous jurisdictional allegations are made and cannot be decided on written submissions alone<span class="Italic">. Manning</span>, 742 F.2d at 1428. Upon review of the pleadings and record, however, the Board clearly did not err by deciding the question of its subject matter jurisdiction without a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, ALJs Youngblood and King both appeal the Board's determination that the relief petitioners seek is beyond the reach of section 7521. As the Board correctly noted, its <span class="Italic">original</span> jurisdiction granted under section 7521 does not provide it with authority to either discipline respondents, restore service areas, or require that certain staffing levels be maintained or increased; rather, it only mandates that the Board hold prior hearings to determine "good cause" as to adverse personnel actions specified in the statute.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">White v. SSA</span>, 76 MSPR 447, 461-62 (1997) (for IRA jurisdiction, a personnel action did not encompass administrative adjustments of an ALJ's caseload).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Administrative controls, and the training and supervision of ALJs, did not ordinarily constitute a constructive removal under law predating <span class="Italic">Tunik</span>. <span class="Italic">In re Stephens</span>, 52 MSPR 522, 526-28 (1992) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Stephens v. MSPB</span>, 986 F.2d 493 (Fed. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">post</span>), concluded that an ALJ was not constructively removed when an agency established a program of instruction, including monitoring selected hearings, to improve the ability of the ALJ to process cases assigned to him. Because the ALJ did not demonstrate through his pleadings that the instructional program interfered with his decisional independence, the Board was not required to convene a hearing before dismissing the ALJ's complaint for lack of jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction over actions against ALJs is established and limited at 5 USCA &#x00A7; 7521. That section specifies that certain personnel actions, including removals, may only be taken against an ALJ "for good cause established and determined by the Merit Systems Protection Board on the record after opportunity for a hearing before the Board." 5 USCA &#x00A7; 7521(a). Required attendance at an instructional program is an administrative matter that is not among those actions enumerated at section 7521.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, however, has long recognized the possibility that an agency may constructively remove an ALJ by "cumulative administrative actions or active intervention in a manner calculated to prevent the impartial exercise of his judicial functions." <span class="Italic">In re Doyle,</span> 29 MSPR 170, 175 (1985); <span class="Italic">see also In re Doyle,</span> 24 MSPR 409, 413 (1984). It is undisputed here that such a constructive removal would fall within the Board's jurisdiction under 5 USCA &#x00A7; 7521. What is disputed is whether the facts asserted by the complainant constitute agency actions calculated to prevent the impartial exercise of his judicial functions. Judge Reidy held unequivocally that they do not. Complainant fails to show, in his complaint and in his exceptions, that they do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As Judge Reidy asserted in the Recommended Decision, the complainant bears the burden of establishing by preponderant evidence the Board's subject matter jurisdiction in this case. <span class="Italic">Sannier v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 931 F.2d 856, 858 (Fed. Cir. 1991); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)]. "Well-pleaded allegations tying the agency actions to impairment of...decisionmaking independence are, at minimum, necessary to establish <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> Board jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Judge Reidy correctly noted that the complainant's allegations are conclusory at best, and that they do not show how the requirement that he attend the instructional program is calculated to interfere with his impartial decisionmaking. Put simply, the allegations are made, but they are not "well pleaded."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his exceptions, the complainant argues that <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> requires mere allegations of constructive removal to give rise to Board jurisdiction, rather than a showing by preponderant evidence. This is incorrect. In <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> the court affirmed a Board decision dismissing the complaint of three ALJs claiming constructive removal. "[A]s long as agency actions are not alleged to affect the ability of the <span id="Page_2272"></span>ALJ to function as an independent and impartial decision maker," the court stated, "they cannot trigger Board jurisdiction under section 7521." <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> at 858.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The complainant misreads this holding to argue that the mere fact that he made an allegation of agency infringement on his judicial independence, invokes the Board's jurisdiction. In fact, in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> the complainants made general allegations that "the cumulative effect of these managerial measures was an impingement of their independent adjudicative authority." <span class="Italic">In re Sannier</span>, 45 MSPR 420, 423 (1990). What the Board and the court held, was that the allegations lacked sufficient specificity to qualify as constructive removal. The court held that the facts giving rise to Board jurisdiction were not "properly alleged," although the existence of jurisdiction was asserted. <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>, 931 F.2d at 859. In this case, as well, the complainant merely sets forth the details of the instructional program, then makes the bare allegation that his required attendance is "an unlawful action that threatens ALJ Stephens' decisional independence." Under <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>, such an unsupported, nonspecific claim is insufficient to invoke Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The complainant also argues that Judge Reidy erred in not holding a hearing on the jurisdiction question. He admits that under <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> the Board is not required to hold a hearing absent the proper allegation of facts giving rise to jurisdiction. The complainant argues, however, that <span class="Italic">Manning v. Merit Systems</span> <span class="Italic">Protection Board,</span> 742 F.2d 1424, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1984), requires that a hearing be held when non-frivolous issues of fact are raised that cannot be resolved by documentary evidence. As we hold above, the complainant has failed to properly allege facts giving rise to the Board's jurisdiction. Moreover, there are no disputed issues of fact in this case. The facts set forth in the complaint are not disputed by the agency, and are accepted by Judge Reidy. The only issue is whether the complainant has shown that his required attendance at the instructional program interferes with his judicial independence. As we hold above, he has not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the complainant argues that the Recommended Decision is in fact a decision on the merits of the complaint without a hearing and as such deprived him of due process rights. He alleges that under <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. 532, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed.2d 494 (1985), he may not be deprived of his statutorily-created property interest in continued employment without constitutionally adequate procedures. This argument is dependent upon complainant's successful establishment of the Board's jurisdiction over this case. As complainant has failed to show that he has suffered a constructive removal by the agency, he has not been deprived of a property interest and is, therefore, possessed of no due process rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The complainant also cites portions of the decision that hold that the instructional program was not shown to improperly interfere with his judicial independence as evidence that Judge Reidy has ruled on the merits of his complaint rather than on the jurisdiction issue. A hearing should have been held, the complainant argues, at which he could have introduced additional evidence as to how the agency's actions prevent the impartial exercise of his judicial functions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The findings in the Recommended Decision, however, go directly to the jurisdictional issue. A showing of constructive removal is necessary to give rise to the Board's jurisdiction. In the absence of well-pleaded allegations showing some connection between the agency's action and an impingement upon the complainant's judicial independence, there has been no such showing. <span class="Italic">See Sannier</span>, 931 F.2d at 858; <span class="Italic">see also In re Rowell,</span> 46 MSPR 568, 573-74 (1991). Judge Reidy's findings are essentially a description of what the complainant failed to show in order to invoke the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The complainant's status is similar to that of a probationary employee seeking to establish Board jurisdiction over an appeal by alleging marital status discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.806(b). In such cases, the Board exercises an initial jurisdiction, based on the mere allegation, to determine whether it does in fact have jurisdiction to proceed further and decide the case. <span class="Italic">Stokes v.</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 761 F.2d 682, 685 (Fed. Cir. 1985). To meet the jurisdictional burden of proof requires more than "the mere filing of allegations," but a proffer of evidence sufficient to enable a presiding official reasonably to conclude that they are not frivolous. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 685-86.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board's exercise of this initial jurisdiction provided the complainant with a forum in which to forge a link between the agency's actions and an impingement of his judicial independence. Given such a forum, the complainant failed to establish such a connection. We agree, therefore, with Judge Reidy's finding that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The result in <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> was affirmed, the court offering some observations concerning the right to a hearing when an ALJ alleges an infringement of his or her decisional independence, <span class="Italic">Stephens v. MSPB</span>, 986 F.2d 493, 496-98 (Fed. Cir. 1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The test for determining whether an ALJ has been constructively removed is set forth in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]n ALJ may be constructively removed by "cumulative administrative actions or active intervention...[which] prevent the impartial exercise of his judicial functions...[and which have] a pernicious effect on the complaining judge's qualified independence." <span class="Italic">In re Doyle</span>, 29 MSPR 170, 175 (1985). Therefore, as long as the agency actions are not alleged to affect the ability of the ALJ to function as an independent and impartial decision maker, they cannot trigger Board jurisdiction under section 7521.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 858.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on that quotation from <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>, Stephens concludes that the only threshold requirement for establishing MSPB jurisdiction pursuant to section 7521 is a nonfrivolous <span class="Italic">allegation</span> that the agency actions have affected his impartial decision-making ability. Stephens asserts, therefore, that because he made such an allegation, the Board does have jurisdiction, or at the least, he is entitled to a hearing on the issue of the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Stephens' conclusion, however, reflects an improper and incomplete reading of <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>. In that case, the ALJ petitioners had made specific allegations that certain productivity targets imposed by their agency undermined their "independent adjudicative authority." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 857. The court concluded that the allegations alone were inadequate, stating: "Even if we, as did the Board, assume <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the agency explicitly instituted overall targets or goals for the number of appeals to be adjudicated per month, such production targets simply are not, by themselves, probative that the ALJ's impartiality or independence in a particular appeal has been or would be compromised." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 859. "Well-pleaded allegations tying the agency actions to impairment of...decisionmaking independence are, at minimum, necessary to establish <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> Board jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 858. Because the petitioners failed to allege "how or why" the productivity targets compromised their judicial independence, the court affirmed the Board's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 859.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, petitioner, likewise, has done no more than make an unsubstantiated allegation that the requirement that he attend a program and course impaired his decisional independence. Such a conclusory allegation without more, per <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>, is not enough. Even if we accept the allegation as true, as was done in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>, the requirement that Stephens attend a program and course is "simply...not, by [it] sel [f], probative that the ALJ's impartiality or independence in a particular appeal has been or would be compromised." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As the Board aptly stated, "the complainant's allegations are conclusory at best, and...they do not show how the requirement that he attend the instructional program is calculated to interfere with his impartial decisionmaking. Put simply, the allegations are made, but they are not well-pleaded." 52 MSPR at 526.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioners in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> had also asserted that they were entitled to a hearing on the jurisdictional issue. 931 F.2d at 859. The court disagreed, stating: "[T]he Board is not required to hold a hearing when facts giving rise to jurisdiction are not properly alleged, even though, as here, its existence may be asserted." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 721 F.2d 355, 357 (Fed. Cir. 1983)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Manning v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 742 F.2d 1424, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1984), this court stated that "it would be appropriate for the MSPB to honor a request for hearing where a petitioner's allegations raise non-frivolous issues of fact relating to jurisdiction which cannot be resolved simply on submissions of documentary evidence." In this case, petitioner's allegations do not raise issues of fact. Nor has petitioner indicated in his appeal brief that he has any additional evidence which should be considered by the Board before a jurisdictional determination can properly be made. Indeed, petitioner merely asserts in his appeal brief that he "is entitled to an opportunity to prove his allegations." As mentioned above, even accepting all of petitioner's factual allegations as true, the Board still does not have jurisdiction because the program and instructional course do not impair petitioner's decisional independence. All of the legal issues relating to jurisdiction can be resolved on the documentary evidence submitted. Thus, petitioner is not entitled to a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner argues, nonetheless, that "[b]ecause the MSPB's jurisdiction and the merits of an alleged constructive removal are inextricably intertwined, the issue cannot be summarily determined adversely, and the complainant is entitled to a hearing on the merits of the issue." Petitioner relies on allegedly analogous involuntary resignation cases as support for his assertion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1985) ("An involuntary resignation is a removal...and as such the issue of jurisdiction is intertwined with the merits of [the] action.... It is this connection with the merits of an appeal which prompts the need for a hearing.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, if the merits of an appeal and the threshold question of jurisdiction are inextricably intertwined, analogous reasoning <span class="Italic">might</span> suggest that a petitioner is entitled to a hearing. The merits of this appeal, however, are not inextricably intertwined with the jurisdictional question. The jurisdictional question turns on the sole issue of whether the program and instructional course petitioner was required to attend infringed his decisional independence. The merits, on the other hand, would entail only a determination of whether good cause was shown for the agency to impose the program and course requirement on petitioner in the first instance. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7521(a). While the jurisdictional question requires scrutiny of the program and course itself, the merits determination would entail scrutiny of only petitioner's behavior which resulted in the requirement that he attend the program and course. Because these inquiries are separate and distinct, the issues are not inextricably intertwined. Thus, the reasoning applied in involuntary resignation cases does not apply to this case. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 978 F.2d 679, 686-89 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (discussing the distinction between a ruling on the merits and a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alternatively, petitioner argues that "the decisional independence of an administrative law judge is a 'property right' as that term is used constitutionally.... If the Board is permitted to dismiss without an evidentiary hearing, the petitioner's allegation of agency interference with his decisional independence, the petitioner will suffer deprivation of a constitutionally protected property interest without an opportunity to be heard." Petitioner asserts: "Due process requires some form of hearing before an individual is finally deprived a property interest."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner's argument is fatally flawed. Assuming--without deciding--petitioner does have a property right in his decisional independence and due process requires a hearing before that right can be taken away, petitioner has not shown that this right has been taken away. In other words, petitioner's due process argument fails for the same reason his argument based on his misreading of <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> fails, i.e., petitioner failed to show that his decisional independence has been taken away.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lawson v. DHHS</span>, 64 MSPR 673, 678-82 (1994), reaffirmed the Board's disinclination to find constructive action against an ALJ through agency administrative requirements not impeding the ALJ's decisional independence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Actions against ALJs under section 7521 are ordinarily initiated by the employing agency, which must obtain a finding of "good cause" by the Board before taking the actions covered by the statute. However, the Board has long recognized that a removal or other action under section 7521 may be effected by "cumulative administrative actions or active intervention in a manner calculated to prevent the impartial exercise of [the ALJ's] judicial functions." <span class="Italic">In</span> <span class="Italic">re Doyle,</span> 29 MSPR 170, 175 (1985). Thus an ALJ such as the appellant may initiate an action before the Board to obtain relief from such a constructive adverse action. In such a case the ALJ has the burden of establishing the Board's jurisdiction by the preponderance of the evidence<span class="Italic">. Sannier v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 931 F.2d 856, 858 (Fed. Cir. 1991); 5 CFR 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)]. "[A]s long as the agency actions are not alleged to affect the ability of the ALJ to function as an independent and impartial decision maker, they cannot trigger Board jurisdiction under section 7521."<span class="Italic"> Id</span>. <span class="Italic">(citation omitted.)</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that he has been constructively removed or suspended as a result of various administrative actions to which he objects. However, as Judge Zimmet found, the appellant acknowledges that he continues to perform his duties as an ALJ, and he has not alleged how his decisional independence has been impaired by the assertedly unfair or illegal actions of his superiors. His principal complaint which relates directly to his decision making concerns agency policies designed to minimize the revising of decisions in order to increase production. The appellant alleged that management, in an apparent effort to avoid revisions and resulting delays in case production, pressured him to sign decisions drafted for him by staff attorneys without reviewing them first. At the same time, he has admitted that the agency in response to his objections adopted a procedure permitting him to review and revise decisions drafted for him before they are placed in final form. Indeed, he has acknowledged that this procedure has resolved the issue concerning the revising of decisions after they are in final form. Thus, although the appellant continues to maintain that the agency's decision writing procedures are inconsistent with his decisional independence, we find that he has failed to allege how they interfere, or are calculated to interfere, with his ability to independently and impartially decide his cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, while the appellant complains of critical comments by his supervisors or attorney advisors concerning his decisions, he has not explained how such expressions of disagreement prevent him from deciding his cases as he sees fit. He has not made specific allegations linking such criticism to adverse administrative actions in a way which would support an inference that the actions were taken by his superiors in an attempt to influence his findings or the outcome of his decisions. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 986 F.2d 493, 496 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (ALJ failed to show a constructive removal within Board jurisdiction where his merely conclusory allegations did not show how agency's requirement that he attend an instructional program was calculated to interfere with his impartial decision making). In fact, the appellant's own allegations suggest that the reason for the asserted unfair treatment is reprisal for whistleblowing, rather than a managerial attempt to undermine his decisional independence or manipulate the outcome of his cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has not been constructively removed or <span id="Page_2273"></span>suspended by agency criticism of the content of his decisions or by agency policies concerning their drafting and review. An ALJ is subordinate to the agency in matters of policy and interpretation of law, and reasonable efforts to increase production levels are not an infringement of the ALJ's decisional independence. <span class="Italic">Nash v. Bowen</span>, 869 F.2d 675, 680 (2d Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 493 U.S. 812, 110 S. Ct. 59, 107 L. Ed.2d 27 (1989). "[P]roduction targets simply are not, by themselves, probative that the ALJ's impartiality or independence in a particular appeal has been or would be compromised." <span class="Italic">Sannier v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 931 F.2d at 859. We see no impairment of the appellant's independence, or evidence of an attempt to impair his independence, in the agency actions about which he complains.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the appellant has not stated a claim under section 7521 because the basis of his complaints is not that the agency is attempting to influence his decisions or undermine his ability to decide cases impartially. Rather, the gravamen of the appellant's complaint is that he is being subjected to unlawful or unfair treatment in administrative matters in reprisal for disclosures which he made concerning the Fort Smith and regional chief judges. Such a claim could constitute an appeal within the Board's jurisdiction over certain whistleblower reprisal cases under section 1221, but it is not cognizable as a constructive adverse action under section 7521. Moreover, although the agency actions which the appellant challenges do not fall within the Board's section 7521 jurisdiction, the appellant has other avenues of relief available to him, such as [ ] filing a grievance pursuant to 5 CFR Part 771, as he has in fact done with respect to denial of his travel reimbursement claims.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lawson</span> expressed the reluctance of the Board to view as a constructive adverse action problems concerning an ALJ's travel vouchers charges to leave, or AWOL, 64 MSPR at 680-81:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also claims that the agency has subjected him to a reduction in pay in violation of section 7521(b)(4) by wrongfully denying requests for travel reimbursement and by deductions from his pay due to his improper placement on absence without leave (AWOL). The appellant's argument ignores the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">In re Doyle,</span> 41 MSPR 31, 34 (1989), that "reduction in pay" for purposes of section 7521 is a reduction in "the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee...." In that case, the Board rejected an ALJ's claim that his pay was reduced when the agency placed him in AWOL status, and the Board noted that it had previously rejected the same ALJ's reduction-in-pay claim based on nonpayment of a travel voucher. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at n.5. "Reduction in pay" was first included as an action subject to section 7521 in the Civil Service Reform Act, which also added the definition of "pay, cited in <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> at 5 USC 7511(a)(4). The legislative history indicates that the definitions in section 7511(a)(2) through (5) reflected definitions found elsewhere in title 5 or in existing regulations or policy issuances. S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 48, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 USCCAN 2723, 2770. Although the section 7511(a) definitions explicitly apply only to subchapter I of Chapter 75 and not to subchapter II where section 7521 is located, subchapter II has no definitions and the Board properly filled this gap by reference to regulations and case law indicating, as reflected in related section 7511(a)(4), that a reduction in pay refers to reduction in the basic rate of pay set for a position. <span class="Italic">In re Doyle,</span> 41 MSPR at 34. <span class="Italic">See Garbacz v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 656 F.2d 628, 633-34 (Ct. Cl. 1981). The appellant has not been subjected to a reduction in pay under section 7521(b)(4) because there has been no reduction in his basic rate of pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that the appellant has failed to explain how the allegedly wrongful nonpayments of travel vouchers and pay deductions for AWOL involve agency efforts to control his decisions and impair his quasi-judicial independence. Moreover, with respect to the AWOL deductions, although the appellant disagrees with the policy requiring return to the office after a hearing, he does not appear to deny that he was voluntarily absent from the office during the times in question. Thus, these deductions cannot support an adverse action claim. <span class="Italic">See Rose v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 721 F.2d 355 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the travel vouchers, the appellant disagrees with the office travel policy which requires him to commute to certain hearing sites away from his duty station and does not allow him reimbursement for overnight accommodations. In his recommended decision, Judge Zimmet suggested that final nonpayment of travel vouchers could interfere with the appellant's decisional independence where overnight travel reimbursement is denied because this policy might influence him to hold truncated hearings in order to avoid overlong work days. We do not see why overlong days could not be avoided instead by continuing the hearings into the next day and returning home at an earlier hour. In any event, administrative policies which may be disliked by an ALJ, who as a result may be inappropriately derelict in his duties, are not for that reason actions calculated to interfere with his impartial decisionmaking. Indeed, such conduct by an ALJ would be subject to discipline. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Burris,</span> 39 MSPR 51, 56 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 878 F.2d 1445 (Fed. Cir.) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 493 U.S. 855, 110 S. Ct. 158, 107 L.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lawson</span> discounted concerns about case rotation and scheduling authority as a basis for an ALJ's appeal, 64 MSPR 681-82:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the agency's assignment of cases violates statutory and regulatory requirements that ALJs be assigned cases in rotation so far as practicable, that its travel policies violate statutes and regulations governing the hours of work, and that its withdrawal of his scheduling authority violates agency regulations. Again, however, the appellant's contentions do not tie these alleged violations to attempts to interfere with the appellant's decisional independence. Thus, the alleged violations are not matters subject to the Board's jurisdiction to review ALJ constructive adverse action claims.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Administrative inquiries into ALJ conduct and performance generated some constructive action appeals. An investigation into an ALJ's conduct toward those whose cases he adjudicates was not an action reviewable by the Board if there was no showing that the investigation affected on the ALJ's ability to hold full and fair hearings or to issue impartial decisions. There must be specific interference with the performance of his duties. That the ALJ's decisions could be reviewed and evaluated did not mean that he was pressured to resolve cases in a certain way<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">In re Rowell</span>, 46 MSPR 568, 573-74 (1991); <span class="Italic">In re Doyle</span>, 24 MSPR 409, 413 (1984) (Board declined to hold that allegations of interference with clerical support constituted a constructive adverse action: "While a case may be imagined where an agency might be deemed to have removed an administrative law judge from his position by actively intervening in a manner calculated to prevent the judge from performing his duties for a substantial period of time, the appeal in this instances falls far short of demonstrating that the alleged actions of the ALJIC had that purpose or effect.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal of supervisory or managerial responsibilities entrusted to an ALJ was not a constructive removal. ALJs could be designated as Chief ALJs, and their pay might be adjusted to compensate for the headaches of supervising an office of other, ALJs and supporting staff. An agency could remove supervisory responsibilities without filing a complaint against an ALJ (or having to defend an appeal from a constructive removal or reduction in grade or pay) if the agency did not diminish the ALJ's pay and if the ALJ continued his judicial work. The jurisdictional ramifications were explained, <span class="Italic">Butler v. SSA</span>, 331 F.3d 1368, 1369-74 (Fed. Cir. 2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The position of administrative law judge is created by statute. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3105, "[e]ach agency shall appoint as many administrative law judges as are necessary for proceedings required to be conducted in accordance with sections 556 and 557 of this title." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3105 (2000). Congress has also implemented a pay structure for administrative law judges and has delegated to the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") the authority to "determine, in accordance with procedures which the Office shall by regulation prescribe, the level in which each administrative-law-judge position shall be placed and the qualifications to be required for appointment to each level." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5372(b)(2) (2000). OPM has created a pay structure based on seniority, which is codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.210(a)-(f). One of the limited exceptions to this basic system is provided by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.210(h):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Subject to the approval of OPM, and on the appropriate recommendation of the employing agency, an agency may on a one-time basis, advance an administrative law judge in a position at AL-3 with added administrative and managerial duties and responsibilities one rate beyond that allowed under current pay rates for AL-3, up to the maximum Rate F.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to section 930.210(h), the SSA designates certain incumbent administrative law judges to act as Hearing Office Chief Administrative Law Judges ("Hearing Office Chiefs"). These assignments are made "with the approval of the incumbent." An administrative law judge so assigned becomes "responsible for the management of the hearing office to which assigned," in addition to his preexisting responsibility to "hold[ ] hearings and mak[e] and issu[e] decisions on appeals pursuant to the Social Security Act." The SSA assigns the following "added administrative and managerial duties and responsibilities" to those administrative law judges designated as Hearing Office Chiefs:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The [Hearing Office Chief] has administrative and managerial responsibility for all personnel in the hearing office (HO) and provides overall guidance and direction regarding adherence to time and attendance procedures; staffing, space, equipment and expert witness needs; rotational assignment of cases and review of work products; application of performance standards and appraisals; and approval of travel vouchers, itineraries and expenditures. The [Hearing Office Chief] provides advice and guidance to [administrative law judges] regarding the interpretation of applicable law, regulations, rulings and judicial precedents. The [Hearing Office Chief] participates in investigations, <span id="Page_2274"></span>in coordination with the Regional Chief Administrative Law Judge, into allegations of misconduct on the part of any employee, including [administrative law judges], ensures compliance with the principles of equal employment opportunity and [the Office of Hearings and Appeal's] Affirmative Employment Plan, and conducts labor management functions consistent with collective bargaining agreements. The [Hearing Office Chief] also ensures the timely and accurate response to public and congressional inquiries; performs liaison functions between the HO and various federal and local government agencies, including bar associations, medical and vocational rehabilitation associations; and conducts periodic training.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner, Larry J. Butler ("the petitioner"), began serving as the Hearing Office Chief of the SSA's Shreveport, Louisiana, Office of Hearings and Appeals on January 11, 2001. Pursuant to section 930.210(h), as a consequence of assuming additional administrative and managerial duties, the petitioner received a pay adjustment of one rate, from AL3/E to the maximum rate of pay, AL3/F. On September 17, 2001, the SSA's Acting Regional Chief Administrative Law Judge in Dallas, Texas, notified the petitioner that he was "removed as the [Hearing Office Chief] in the Shreveport Hearing Office." The letter notifying the petitioner of his "removal" stated, "the removal of a [Hearing Office Chief] is at the discretion of the Regional Chief Administrative Law Judge with the concurrence of the Chief Administrative Law Judge." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. According to the petitioner, he "was not given[ ] a statement of the grounds for his removal."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the Board, the petitioner alleged that he was removed in retaliation for his support of grievances filed by other administrative law judges, and that this action constituted a constructive removal in violation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.142. The petitioner also alleged that he was removed "without due cause, and without compliance with 5 C.F.R. [&#x00A7;] 930.214(a) requiring hearing before the [Board]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The petitioner admitted that he did not suffer a reduction in pay or grade upon losing his Hearing Office Chief duties. He contends, however, that he suffered other types of harm, including damage to reputation, diminished opportunities for advancement in the federal government, and the loss of certain perquisites, such as "a larger office than a line [administrative law judge,]...a dedicated printer...[and] paid parking by the agency, etc."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 23, 2001, the petitioner appealed the loss of his Hearing Office Chief duties to the Board. On November 13, the SSA filed a motion to dismiss for lack of Board jurisdiction. On December 12, 2001, in an Initial Decision, the Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress has granted the Board jurisdiction over appeals from certain adverse actions taken by agencies against administrative law judges. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521 (2000). OPM has promulgated regulations to implement this statute. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 930.201-930.216 (2003). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.214(a), the Board has jurisdiction over removals, suspensions, reductions in grade, reductions in pay, or furloughs for 30 days or less. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.214(a) (2003). In this case, the Board held that section 930.214(a) provided jurisdiction only if the SSA's action constituted a "removal" of the petitioner, since there had been no reduction in pay or grade. The regulations define "removal" as the "discharge of an administrative law judge from the position of administrative law judge or involuntary reassignment, demotion, or promotion to a position other than that of administrative law judge." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.202(f) (2003). Applying this definition of "removal," the Board concluded that "a plain reading of Section 930.202(f) does not encompass the reassignment or demotion of a <span class="Italic">hearing office chief</span> administrative law judge." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations also give the Board jurisdiction over certain "reassignments." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.205 (2003). Section 930.205 provides that an agency may only "reassign" an administrative law judge "from one administrative law judge position to another administrative law judge position" with prior approval of OPM, for <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management reasons, and "in accordance with regular civil service procedures and merit system principles." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.205 (2003). The Board determined that this regulation covers only "an 'administrative law judge,' not a hearing office chief administrative law judge" and concluded that it did not have jurisdiction under this regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9 (Fed. Cir. 1985), we determined that the Board did not have jurisdiction over an appeal from the reassignment of an employee to a position with the same grade and pay as his former position, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 10. We concluded that the Board did not have jurisdiction, because "the reassignment did not reduce Maddox's grade or pay." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The language of section 7512 is nearly identical to that of section 7521, the jurisdictional statute at issue in this case.... We conclude that section 7521 must be construed consistently with its sister provision, section 7512. In the present case, as in Maddox, the action taken by the SSA in divesting the petitioner of his Hearing Office Chief duties did not reduce the petitioner's grade or pay. We accordingly conclude that section 7521 does not vest the Board with jurisdiction over the action taken against the petitioner in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner contends, however, that we should construe section 7521 differently from section 7512, because, he asserts, the regulations implementing section 7521 define "removal" more expansively than we interpreted that term in <span class="Italic">Maddox</span>. The regulation implementing section 7521 defines the Board's jurisdiction in terms that track the language of the statute. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.214(a) (2003). However, unlike the statute, the regulations define "removal," stating that it includes the "discharge of an administrative law judge from the position of administrative law judge or <span class="Italic">involuntary reassignment, demotion, or promotion to a position other than that of administrative law judge</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 930.202(f) (emphasis added). The petitioner contends that this definition captures the action the SSA took against him in this case, because such action constituted either a "reassignment" or a "demotion." We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulation, properly read, covers only a "reassignment" or "demotion" "to a position other than that of an administrative law judge." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This interpretation is confirmed by OPM's commentary on the regulation upon its publication in the Federal Register:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">One commentator asked if in defining "removal" in &#x00A7; 930.202(f), OPM meant to provide that in addition to discharge of an administrative law judge, an involuntary reassignment, involuntary demotion or involuntary promotion to a position other than that of an administrative law judge would constitute removal. Such "involuntary" personnel actions to <span class="Italic">a position other than that of an administrative law judge</span> have long been defined by OPM as constituting removal from the position of administrative law judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Programs for Specific Positions and Examinations (Miscellaneous); Appointment, Pay, and Removal of Administrative Law Judges, 52 Fed. Reg. 34201, 34202 (Sept. 10, 1987) (emphasis added). In the present case, the petitioner was not demoted or reassigned "to a position other than that of an administrative law judge." Therefore, the action taken by the SSA in divesting him of his Hearing Office Chief duties did not constitute a "removal" as defined by the regulations, and the Board did not have jurisdiction over his appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521 or its implementing regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.214.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner further argues that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.205. That regulation provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency may reassign an administrative law judge who is serving under absolute appointment from one administrative law judge position to another administrative law judge position at the same grade in the same agency, with the prior approval of OPM on a noncompetitive basis, provided the assignment is for <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management reasons and in accordance with regular civil service procedures and merit system principles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.205 (2003). The petitioner contends that the action the SSA took in divesting him of his Hearing Office Chief duties constituted a "reassignment" under this provision without the prior approval of OPM, and that the Board has jurisdiction to determine whether such action was for <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management reasons and in accordance with regular civil service procedures and merit system principles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have not interpreted this regulation before. The issue is whether SSA's action in divesting the petitioner of his Hearing Office Chief duties constituted a "reassign[ment]...from one administrative law judge position to another administrative law judge position." The regulations define "administrative law judge position" as follows: "<span class="Italic">Administrative law judge position</span> means a position in which any portion of the duties includes those which require the appointment of an administrative law judge under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3105." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.202(c) (2003). The "duties" that require the appointment of an administrative law judge are the conducting of "proceedings required to be conducted in accordance with section 556 and 557 of this title." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3105 (2000). Section 556 and 557 relate only to the conduct of hearings. There is nothing in sections 556 and 557 concerning proceedings to be conducted by a "Hearing Office Chief" or the duties of a "Hearing Office Chief." Thus, the duties of an administrative law judge do not include the administrative and managerial duties of the Hearing Office Chief, and we conclude that a "Hearing Office Chief" is not a separate "administrative law judge position" as contemplated by section 3105. Rather, the title "Hearing Office Chief" merely indicates that an administrative law judge has assumed managerial responsibilities in addition to the statutorily prescribed duties for the conduct of hearings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, when the SSA divested the petitioner of his Hearing Office Chief duties, it did not constitute a "reassign[ment] ...from one administrative law judge position to another administrative law judge position." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.205 (2003). The petitioner retained his statutory duty to conduct "proceedings required to be conducted in accordance with section 556 and 557 of this title," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3105 (2000), and retained <span id="Page_2275"></span>his administrative law judge position. The action taken by the SSA did not, therefore, constitute a "reassignment" under section 930.205, and the Board did not have jurisdiction under that provision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Leave and attendance controls could not be transformed into constructive removals. An AWOL charge was not an action that ordinarily falls within the Board's jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7521, <span class="Italic">In re Doyle</span>, 41 MSPR 31, 33-34 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he issue presented...is whether the placement of an administrative law judge on AWOL constitutes an involuntary change in his status within the meaning of 5 CFR 930.202(f) or a suspension or reduction in pay or any action enumerated under 5 USC 7521....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Judge Doyle has not established jurisdiction by showing a removal or suspension, or constructive removal or suspension, since he has failed to demonstrate that his duties and responsibilities immediately following the brief AWOL period were different from before or that the agency prevented him from resuming his duties. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bucci v. Department of Education</span>, 36 MSPR 489 (1988). Moreover, Judge Doyle has not demonstrated that the agency action constituted pernicious interference with his status as an administrative law judge. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 930.202(f); <span class="Italic">Matter of Doyle</span>, 29 MSPR 170, 175 (1985) (to establish jurisdiction, the administrative law judge must show that the agency action impaired the impartial exercise of judicial functions). Additionally, a charge of AWOL is patently not a reduction in grade or a furlough. Indeed, an AWOL charge, in itself, is not even a disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 721 F.2d 355, 357 (1983) (an agency's placement of an employee in an AWOL status was not an appealable agency action under 5 USC 7501 where she was not deprived of the duties of her position to which she was assigned).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Judge Doyle's next exception, that the agency action constituted a reduction in pay, is without merit....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that the term "reduction in pay" contemplated by 5 USC 7521 refers to "the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by the employee...." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 531.202(i).... Since Judge Doyle's rate of basic pay was not affected by the agency's action of charging him with AWOL, the Board finds that the AWOL charge did not constitute a "reduction in pay" under 5 USC 7521....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ploss v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3354) (voluntary absence leading to an AWOL charge did not involve an appealable reduction of the basic pay rate); <span class="Italic">Lawson v. DHHS</span>, 64 MSPR 673, 680-81 (1994) (ALJ was not constructively suspended when charged AWOL).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bennett v. SSA</span>, 72 MSPR 116, 120-21 (1996), found the Board unwilling to find a constructive adverse action against an ALJ who alleged that his pay was docked for AWOL, his clerical support was withdrawn, his personal property was removed from a hearing room, and he was, among other actions, reprimanded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the CALJ that the petitioner did not make nonfrivolous allegations establishing <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> Board jurisdiction over his claim of constructive removal by cumulative administrative action. He has not made specific allegations linking the agency's actions in a way that would support an inference that the actions were taken by his superiors in an attempt to influence his findings or the outcome of his decisions. <span class="Italic">See Lawson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 64 MSPR 673, 679 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 73 F.3d 377 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). <span class="Italic">See also Stephens v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 986 F.2d 493, 496 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (conclusory allegations of interference with judicial independence are insufficient to establish Board jurisdiction). The petitioner's assertions in this regard are at best conclusory statements. Representative of his pleadings on the issue are the rhetorical question "how can a judge function as an independent decisionmaker without clerical support?," and the asserted truism, "[i]f the action was not required or appropriate, it can constitute interference with the judicial independence of an [ALJ]." Such statements fall far short of a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency acted with an intent or effect pernicious to the petitioner's impartial and independent adjudication of cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the petitioner's motion to certify the CALJ's order dismissing most of the petitioner's claims and limiting the hearing to one action, the petitioner argued that the CALJ adjudicated the case in a piecemeal fashion by considering each action to determine whether it constituted by itself a constructive removal. A determination of whether an ALJ has been constructively removed based on cumulative administrative action should be based on the totality of the circumstances, not upon a weighing of whether each individual action constitutes a constructive removal. <span class="Italic">Cf. Heining v. General Services Administration,</span> 68 MSPR 513, 522 (1995) (a determining of whether an employee has been constructively removed based on intolerable working conditions is based on the totality of the circumstances, not a consideration of individual actions in isolation). However, insofar as the petitioner failed to allege facts tying any of the individual agency actions to an effort to influence his decision making, he cannot be said to have made a nonfrivolous allegation of facts tying the series of actions as a whole to such an effort. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lawson,</span> 64 MSPR at 678-81.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we do not believe that the CALJ engaged in piecemeal adjudication as the petitioner suggests. A claim of constructive removal of an ALJ may be based on "cumulative administrative actions or active intervention." <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>, 29 MSPR at 175. Here, the CALJ determined that the petitioner failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that he was constructively removed by cumulative administrative actions. However, one of the actions identified by the petitioner--the overruling of an order he issued--also presented a claim of constructive removal by active intervention in the petitioner's cases. Finding that the petitioner had raised nonfrivolous issues of fact relating to jurisdiction which could not be resolved based solely on documentary evidence, the CALJ properly held a jurisdictional hearing on this claim of constructive removal by active intervention. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stephens,</span> 986 F.2d at 497.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under<span class="Italic"> Burris v. SSA</span>, 35 MSPR 213, 215 (1987), the Board lacked jurisdiction to consider an ALJ's claim that he was constructively suspended because he was required to vacate his office while he was on administrative leave pending the Board's resolution of the agency's proposal to remove him from the federal service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is an administrative tribunal created by Congress. As such, its jurisdiction is limited to those actions specifically made appealable to the Board by statute or regulation.... An employee seeking review of an agency action has the burden of establishing jurisdiction over the subject matter of the appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[C]omplainant was paid for the entire time he was on administrative leave.... Therefore complainant cannot reasonably claim that he was suspended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Complainant argues that respondent's request that he vacate his office while he was on administrative leave was effectively a transfer or a reassignment and, as such, constitutes a personnel action for the purposes of 5 USC 2302.... [I]t would nevertheless be outside the Board's jurisdiction because it has not been raised by the Special Counsel or in connection with an otherwise appealable action....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The authority of an agency to place an ALJ on paid leave pending Board disposition of charges was reaffirmed in <span class="Italic">SSA v. Anyel</span>, 58 MSPR 261, 263 n.2 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly before it filed its request with the Board, the agency placed the respondent in a paid, nonduty status pending adjudication of this case. The respondent has filed a motion in which she requests that we order the agency to restore her to duty. As the respondent acknowledges, however, regulations of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) permit agencies to place an administrative law judge in a nonduty status "pending adjudication of the existence of good cause for his or her removal." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 930.214(b). Furthermore, although it is true, as the respondent notes, that the CALJ has recommended that the Board authorize only a suspension, and not her removal, the question of whether the respondent should be removed is still pending before the Board. Accordingly, we deny the respondent's motion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v. SSA</span>, 76 MSPR 447, 460 (1997) (reduction in pay applies only to a reduction in the basic pay set for a position, not to deductions in pay for leave charged to an ALJ).</p>
