<p class="noindent">Temporary disaster employees were to be counted in election results. They had a reasonable expectancy of continued employment beyond their initial six-month appointment. They shared general supervision, work schedules, office conditions, and a working environment with other unit employees. They performed some of the same duties as other unit employees. <span class="Italic">SBA Lower Rio Grande Valley Dist. Office and AFGE Local 3904</span>, 16 FLRA 180, 180-81 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA and Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots</span>, 24 FLRA 922, 926 (1986) (including in unit were temporary intermittent observers who had reasonable expectancy of future employment of up to four years and who shared many working conditions with permanent part-time observers who were in unit). For analysis of unit membership of "flexible employees," refer to <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, 90th Missile Wing and AFGE Local 2354</span>, 48 FLRA 650 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">Temporary employees, including summer hires, who were not promised permanent positions or subsequent employment, were excluded from the unit as "temporary employees with no reasonable expectancy of continued employment." <span class="Italic">FMCS and NAGE Local R3-118</span>, 5 FLRA 28, 29-30 (1981). Employees appointed for six months with no guarantee of reappointment, serving in a special program, not subject to merit promotion or the federal retirement program, who received no differentials, holiday pay, insurance benefits, or sick and annual leave, and who did not have competitive status, were not considered to share a sufficient community of interest with other, regular employees to be included in a unit. <span class="Italic">USDA, APHIS, Plant Protection Quarantine, Pink Bollworm Rearing Facility and NFFE Local 376</span>, 6 FLRA 261, 262-63 (1981). If temporary employees are determined to be properly within a unit, the ensuing election will not be set aside if they are released following the regional director's order for an election. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Army Eng'r Activity, Capital Area, Ft. Myer, Va. and Int'l Ass'n of Fire Fighters</span>, 34 FLRA 38, 42 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_82"></span>"Stay at school" employees were included in a unit. They were classified under the General Schedule, paid according to the same pay schedule as other agency employees, shared common supervision and similar working conditions, and received annual and sick leave benefits. The employees received renewable one year appointments and could be employed by the activity for several years as they pursued their educations. They worked 20 hours or less per week, except during school vacations, when they could work full time. <span class="Italic">Corps of Eng'rs, Kansas City Dist. and NFFE Local 29</span>, 15 FLRA 548, 550 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOD, DCA and AFGE</span>, 59 FLRA 990, 992-94 (2004), determined that a unit properly included temporary student employees appointed for ninety days or more under a Student Educational Employment Program:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The RD did not err in finding reasonable expectation of continued employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Failure to apply established law</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A unit including temporary employees is appropriate if the temporary employees have a reasonable expectation of continued employment and the appropriate unit criteria in &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute are otherwise met. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Air Force, Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, Tex.</span>, 59 FLRA 739, 741 (2004) (citation omitted). The Authority has found that temporary employees had a reasonable expectation of continued employment where there was no specific term limitation on their employment and they were converted with some frequency to regular appointments. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, 90th Missile Wing (SAC), F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyo.</span>, 48 FLRA 650, 653, 655-56 (1993). Even where temporary employees are appointed for a specific term, they may have a reasonable expectation of continued employment beyond that term. In this connection, the Authority has found temporary student employees appointed to one-year terms pursuant to a "Stay-in-School Program" had a reasonable expectation of continued employment where the evidence established that the students' terms could be renewed annually if they continued to meet the criteria for the program, and the appointments were generally renewed. <span class="Italic">Corps of Eng'rs</span>, 15 FLRA 548.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the student employees at issue here are appointed to one-year terms, the RD found that "[t]he record revealed...that as long as students performed well and wanted to remain, their appointments were extended." As discussed further below, we find that the RD did not err in making that factual determination. Thus, this case is materially identical to <span class="Italic">Corps of Eng'rs</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that <span class="Italic">Corps of Eng'rs</span> should be reconsidered because, in that decision, the Authority failed to follow the Authority's prior decisions in <span class="Italic">Dep't of Agric., Animal Plant Health Inspection Serv., Plant Prot. Quarantine, Pink Bollworm Rearing Facility</span>, 6 FLRA 261 (1981) (<span class="Italic">APHIS</span>), and <span class="Italic">FMCS</span>, 5 FLRA 28 (1981). However, the facts in <span class="Italic">Corps of Eng'rs</span> were materially different from those in <span class="Italic">APHIS</span> and <span class="Italic">FMCS</span>. In <span class="Italic">APHIS</span>, the employees' appointments were limited to six months, and extensions were granted only occasionally. In <span class="Italic">FMCS</span>, three employees were appointed only for the summer, and one employee was appointed to a one-year term but had "very little prospect" of reappointment. 5 FLRA at 29. By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Corps of Eng'rs</span>, the employees were employed by the activity for one-year terms and generally had their appointments renewed. As the cases are distinguishable on this material point, the Agency does not demonstrate that the Authority erred by not following <span class="Italic">APHIS</span> and <span class="Italic">FMCS</span> in <span class="Italic">Corps of Eng'rs</span>, and we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that reconsideration of <span class="Italic">Corps of Eng'rs</span> is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the instant case is distinguishable from other cases cited by the Agency. Unlike <span class="Italic">FAA Technical Ctr., Atl. City Airport, N.J.</span>, 44 FLRA 1238 (1992), the student employees at issue here are not supervisors who were temporarily detailed to temporarily-established positions while retaining supervisory pay and grade; instead, they are appointed to positions in which they may remain indefinitely if they continue to perform satisfactorily and meet the pertinent regulatory criteria. In addition, unlike <span class="Italic">H.Q., XVIII Airborne Corps &#x0026; Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg, N.C.</span>, 36 FLRA 237 (1990), not only is there record evidence supporting a conclusion that the student employees have a reasonable expectation of continued employment, but also the RD found that the student employees and regular employees at the Activity generally perform the same work, share the same titles and series, work side-by-side, and utilize the same chain of command. Moreover, unlike <span class="Italic">United States Army Eng'r Activity, Capital Area, Fort Myer, Va.</span>, 34 FLRA 38 (1989), this case does not present a situation where changed circumstances subsequent to the hearing are claimed to demonstrate that the RD erred in finding regarding reasonable expectation of continued employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the RD's decision is consistent with Authority precedent, we conclude that the RD did not fail to apply established law in finding that the student employees have a reasonable expectation of continued employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the RD made factual errors in concluding that the temporary employees have a reasonable expectation of continued employment. As discussed above, the RD's conclusion that there is a reasonable expectation of continued employment is supported by his finding that "as long as students performed well and wanted to remain, their appointments were extended." Record evidence supports the RD's finding in this regard. <span class="Italic">See</span> Tr. at 308 (student whose term was extended testified that "it's pretty much the understanding...that you're on for how long you're in school, as long as you're in school[&#8197;]"); <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 313 (same student testified that, when he was hired, management told him that "the only stipulation" management had was that "you had to stay in school to keep the job[&#8197;]"); <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 253 (Agency chief negotiator testified that "according to the store management, they have submitted paperwork to extend" certain student employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the student employees do not have a reasonable expectation of continued employment because: the turnover rate of student employees has been greater than 50%; only eight of the current student employees have been employed at the Activity for over one year; only three employees have been accepted into career-conditional positions; and eighteen student employees have been terminated for failure to maintain their status as students. However, the Agency does not explain how these statistics demonstrate that student employees cannot remain at the Activity if they continue to qualify for employment and want to remain. In this connection, we note that there was testimony that the turnover rate at the Activity is high generally. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 282 (testimony that the Activity has "a high turnover rate in general because they are such low-grade positions").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also asserts that the RD erred in finding that the time and costs associated with background checks, and the fact that student employees are "known factors" and are largely trained, could be factors in determining whether to permanently hire student employees. Although the RD made these findings in his background findings of fact, he did not rely on them in his analysis and conclusions. Even assuming that these factors are relevant to determining whether the student employees have a reasonable expectation of continued employment, the Agency provides no evidence that the RD clearly erred in these findings, and record evidence supports the RD. <span class="Italic">See</span> Tr. at 123 (testimony of store director that "it does cost the agency to do background checks on the--the employees[&#8197;]"); <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 115 (with regard to whether student employees would have "an equal or better chance" than other applicants in getting a permanent position, store director testified "if everything worked out as far as their performance, customer service, attitude, then, yes, we certainly encourage that.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Agency has not demonstrated that the RD's finding regarding reasonable expectation of continued employment was based on clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The RD did not err in his findings regarding ability to negotiate student schedules.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the RD erred in finding that issues regarding student employee schedules could be addressed through collective bargaining.&#x2003;In this connection, the RD found that, although the Agency "is required to give consideration to a student [employee's] school responsibilities when establishing their work schedule, nothing in the record suggests or warrants a finding that the interests of management and the students cannot be accommodated through the collective bargaining process."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency provides no basis for concluding that the parties' current Master Labor Agreement (MLA) precludes negotiations over student schedules. In this connection, the Agency did not provide before the RD, and does not provide before the Authority, a copy of the current MLA. Although the Agency chief negotiator testified that the current MLA does not list scheduling of employees as a subject that may be negotiated locally, the Agency provides no basis for concluding that the RD erred by declining to credit this non-specific, unsupported testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, even assuming that the current MLA contains the same pertinent provisions as the parties' expired 1997 MLA--the primary focus of the chief negotiator's testimony--that would not provide a basis for finding that the RD clearly erred in this regard. In this connection, the chief negotiator relied on Article 6, Section 2 of the expired MLA, which pertinently provided that "[a] Supplemental Agreement is limited to: matters identified for supplementation in the MLA." Application, Attachment C at 10. However, Article 11, Section 14 of the expired agreement provided that "[f]ixed schedules" for full-time employees, and "[t]he numbers of fixed schedules for part-time employees[,]" may be "negotiated locally." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 30 &#x0026; 31. Thus, there is no basis for concluding that local negotiations over student schedules are prohibited. Accordingly, the RD did not err by relying on <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 24 FLRA 922, where the Authority held that the fact that additional issues could be resolved through collective bargaining supported the appropriateness of the unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, even if the current MLA precluded negotiations over student <span id="page_83"></span>schedules, the MLA could not be enforced in a way that would fail to accommodate student employees' academic schedules. In this connection, under pertinent regulations, "the student's work schedule should not interfere with the student's academic schedule." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(a)(3). As there is no dispute that the regulations were in effect prior to the effective date of the current MLA, the new MLA cannot be enforced in a manner that is inconsistent with the regulations. <span class="Italic">See GSA, Nat'l Capital Region</span>, 42 FLRA 121, 130 (1991) (Government-wide regulations control over conflicting provisions in a collective bargaining agreement unless the agreement was in effect prior to the date the regulations were prescribed). Accordingly, nothing in the MLA <span class="Italic">could</span> preclude the Agency from determining student schedules that take into account the students' academic schedules.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the RD did not commit a clear and prejudicial error concerning substantial factual matters, or fail to apply established law, in his findings regarding negotiation of student schedules.</p>
