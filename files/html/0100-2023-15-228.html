<p class="Body-Text">Although intent may be established by circumstantial evidence, incorrect information cannot by itself control the question of intent. <span class="Italic">Listerman v. DOJ</span>, 31 MSPR 179, 181 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hanna v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 233, 239 (1989). "Wrong information cannot, by itself, control the question of intent." <span class="Italic">Seas v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 422, 427 (1997) (modified by <span class="Italic">Boo v. DHS</span>, 122 MSPR 100, 2014 MSPB 86 (2014), to require an element of material gain in a falsification or misrepresentation case)). Plausible explanations are considered in determining whether falsification of or relating to government records is intentional. <span class="Italic">Walker v. USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 341, 343 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Haebe v. DOJ</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1305 n.35 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (a blunder, that is, "mere negligent disregard for the truth," does not constitute "reckless disregard" circumstantial evidence of intent); <span class="Italic">Blake v. DOJ</span>, 81 MSPR 394, 410-11 &#x00B6; 30 (1999) (plausible explanation deflected a charge of a false report of working conditions); <span class="Italic">Rackers v. DOJ</span>, 79 MSPR 262, 278 (1998) (plausible explanations must be considered; the intent to deceive is to be resolved from the totality of circumstances); <span class="Italic">Buhl v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 305, 311 (1988) (suitability determination; the Board considered implausible the appellant's denial of knowledge or memory of prior criminal proceedings that were omitted from his employment application). Explanations should be timely. That an appellant stated the truth three months later, and only while being investigated for his action, does not warrant an inference that he did not intend to deceive. <span class="Italic">Bradley v. VA</span>, 39 MSPR 598, 604 (1989), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Bradley v. VA</span>, 900 F.2d 233 (Fed. Cir. 1990). <span class="Italic">Listerman</span> determined there was no intent to defraud by an employee who initially made an incorrect claim on a voucher and then inquired into the correctness of the voucher and repaid the government for the difference between the advance he received and allowable expenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A mistake or a misunderstanding, coupled with disclosure of the facts surrounding a particular situation, weighs against drawing an inference of wrongful intent. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spruill v. USPS</span>, 84 MSPR 36, 46-47 &#x00B6; 28 (1999) (charge of submitting false information on a postal report: "While the appellant may have been careless, or even negligent, in not verifying the date of the two reports he signed, the agency did not charge him with such misconduct."); <span class="Italic">Tackett v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 624, 629 (1999) ("The testimony of both the appellant and Roman shows that, more likely than not, their conversations were mere miscommunications but, in any case, do not demonstrate intentional falsification on the part of the appellant."); <span class="Italic">Tackett v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 76 MSPR 649, 655 (1997) ("[T]he record does not show undisputedly whether the appellant intentionally falsified that time sheet or merely made a mistake, which she corrected after being questioned about it."); <span class="Italic">Bryant v. DOJ</span>, 39 MSPR 632, 637 (1989) (charge of misconduct during investigation: "We further note that there is no evidence that the appellant attempted to clarify the 'authorized' or 'accredited' nature of his degree on the applications."); <span class="Italic">Howell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 31, 38 (1987) (appellant's description of an occupational injury and medical treatment was not completely accurate, but not deliberately false).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Even if Kumferman was reckless in stating that the camera was destroyed when it had been mislaid, this does not constitute substantial evidence of an intent to defraud in view of the evidence of the attempted reentry of the camera on the records.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Federal Circuit determined that an incorrect and a false statement are not necessarily the same, it has determined that intent to falsify may be demonstrated through some degree of negligence. Intentional filing of false and fraudulent claims can be established if the evidence shows that the employee certified the claims as correct without examining them or checking their correctness or accuracy. The court reasoned that the conduct constituted gross negligence by an employee filing for temporary living expenses and, when committed by a postal inspector, established the intent necessary to sustain the charge. <span class="Italic">Waddell v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Naekel</span>, cited in <span class="Italic">Kumferman</span>, reviewed the law concerning falsification of employment applications. <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 782 F.2d 975, 977-80 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (following remand, 32 MSPR 488, 490-91 (1987)). The appellant was fired for not stating on his SF-171 that he was fired from a job and for not disclosing that he resigned from a job under threat of dismissal. The appellant pursued his case without counsel in the Federal Circuit. The Board's decision sustaining his dismissal was reversed. The court's opinion was significant because it touched on the materiality of a misstatement and reliance by an agency on the misstatement--issues the Board resolved against employees in prior decisions. Noted here is the discussion concerning the charged omission on the application of the threat of a discharge. The appellant's discharge was reversed, and in an unusual manner: the court was so vexed at the Board's handling of the case that it directed the Board to entertain a counsel fee petition for legal expenses incurred by the appellant during lower-level proceedings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To sustain a charge of "[s]ubmitting false information on official government documents," the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee knowingly supplied wrong information, and that he did so with the intention of defrauding the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tucker v. United States</span>, 624 F.2d 1029, 1033 (Ct. Cl. 1980)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As recognized by the presiding official, a charge of falsification of a government document requires proof not only that an answer is wrong, but also that the wrong answer was given with intent to deceive or mislead the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact of an incorrect response cannot control the question of intent. Were a bare inaccuracy controlling on the question of intent, the "intent" element of the charge would be subsumed within the distinct inquiry of whether the employee's answer adheres to the true state of facts. A system of real people, pragmatic in their expectations, would not easily tolerate a rule under which the slightest deviation from truth would sever one's tenuous link to employment. Indeed, an SF-171 does not require absolute accuracy. Instead, an employee must certify that the answers are "true, complete and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief, and are made in good faith." No more than that can reasonably be required. The oath does not ask for certainty and does not preclude a change in one's belief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, there exists no evidence of record which directly establishes Mr. Naekel's intention to deceive or mislead the FAA. However, there seldom is such direct evidence. As recognized in <span class="Italic">Tucker</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, circumstantial evidence must generally be relied upon to establish intent....&#8197;Thus, it was appropriate for the board to consider whether the evidence of record as a whole gave rise to an inference that Mr. Naekel possessed the requisite intent at the time he submitted his SF-171's. However, the agency's burden of proving the facts of its case remained the same, whether intent was proved directly or derived inferentially from circumstantial evidence. Either way, the fact sought to be proved must be supported by the preponderance of the evidence. Likewise, the substantial evidence standard by which this court must review findings of fact by the board...is constant, whether that fact is supported directly <span id="Page_2752"></span>or inferentially. With regard to each fact challenged on appeal, we must determine whether, considering the record as a whole, the board's decision was unreasonable that the agency satisfied its evidentiary burden....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Essentially, the only evidence from which to conclude there was deceptive intent is that offered in support of the fact that Naekel had been fired, and his omission of that fact from his employment form. Under some circumstances bad faith may reasonably be based solely on such facts. However, there is no <span class="Italic">per se</span> evidentiary rule that the omission of a firing establishes intent to deceive. All of the evidence must be considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the inquiry here was triggered by a statement by Naekel on an earlier SF-171 that he had been fired by Air Oregon, it is difficult to perceive how the agency was misled at all. A simple comparison of Naekel's various SF-171's reveals that some show a period of unemployment of approximately one month during a 16-year career and others show a job with Air Oregon during that time. As explained by Naekel, the Air Oregon job involved no formal hiring or firing. It was a fill-in job...&#8197;Had he not been fired from the job, its omission would not have raised any question of an incomplete record since the form states at the top that an applicant need only "account for periods of unemployment exceeding three months." It is not the mere omission of the job, but his answer that he had not been fired in the last five years from any job, that is the alleged offense. The agency asserts that the latter question is unrelated to the length of time one was in the position. In our view, the form is far from clear. It is not wholly unreasonable to believe that no questions relate to a fill-in job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another factor in Naekel's favor is that he had more than once disclosed to FAA that he had been "fired" from the Air Oregon job without an adverse effect on his certification for employment. It was entirely reasonable for him to believe that the temporary flying job was not material. Drawing an inference that Naekel expected to conceal his Air Oregon employment on subsequent SF-171's is insupportable here. The most routine check of his personnel file would disclose the position, as it did. Given the FAA's desperate need for air controllers in the fall of 1981, it is patently ridiculous to conclude that the Air Oregon firing would have affected the agency's employment decision on Naekel more than it had in 1979....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, there is positive evidence supporting Naekel's good faith. The record contains Naekel's testimony that, by the time he filled out the subject applications, he no longer believed he had been "fired." He supported the reasonableness of his belief with a plausible explanation, based upon advice from two outside sources, one an attorney, to the effect that an illegal ultimatum cannot result in a lawful firing. Growing precedent supports this legal premise....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, assuming that Naekel was legally fired despite his belief to the contrary, the board's inference of his intent to deceive or mislead the FAA concerning this employment is unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to sustain a charge of intentionally submitting false information, the agency "must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee knowingly supplied wrong information, and that he did so with the intention of defrauding the agency." <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 782 F.2d 975, 977 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In <span class="Italic">Naekel,</span> we explained that the charge of falsification requires proof "not only [of a false statement], but also that [the false statement] was given with intent to deceive or mislead the agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 978. A false statement alone "cannot control the question of intent." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Otherwise, "the 'intent' element of the charge would be subsumed within the distinct inquiry of whether the employee's [statement] adheres to the true state of facts." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The agency may establish an employee's intention to deceive or mislead the agency by circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Kumferman v. Dep't of Navy,</span> 785 F.2d 286, 290 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A charge that an employee knowingly supplied wrong information with an intent to defraud the agency requires first that the agency prove that the information submitted included a false statement. The test here is objective and is made without regard to the employee's subjective understanding or knowledge. Second, the agency must prove that the false statement was material. Third, the agency must show that the employee acted with the requisite intent. Our cases confirm that the intent element itself requires two distinct showings: (a) that the employee intended to deceive or mislead the agency, and (b) that he intended to defraud the agency for his own private material gain. <span class="Italic">See Bradley</span>, 900 F.2d at 237 (finding the false statement motivated by a desire for privacy rather than a desire to defraud). Under the first intent prong (a), it is sufficient that the employee either knew that the submission included a false statement of material fact, or was reckless with respect to ascertaining the truth of the statement. <span class="Italic">See Kumferman,</span> 785 F.2d at 290.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, an employee's good faith explanation can negate an inference of intent to deceive or mislead the agency. <span class="Italic">See Naekel,</span> 782 F.2d at 979-80; <span class="Italic">Kumferman,</span> 785 F.2d at 290; <span class="Italic">Dennis v.

Thus, a reasonable good faith belief in the truth of a statement precludes a finding that an employee acted with deceptive intent.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also refers to its conclusion that the appellant knew, or should have known, that his statements at the grievance meeting were untruthful as support for its position that such statements were made with the intention of defrauding, deceiving, or misleading the agency. A conclusion that an appellant has provided incorrect information, however, does not control the question of intent for purposes of adjudicating a falsification charge. <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 525, &#x00B6; 9 (2008); <span class="Italic">Mendez v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 596, &#x00B6; 16 (2001). Our review of the circumstantial evidence in the record below indicates that the appellant made his statements in the grievance meeting, not to deceive or mislead the agency, but to underscore his position that his performance appraisal should reflect the positive assessment set forth in the document that Sepulveda completed before he retired, which was missing from the appellant's 971 folder. Because the appellant's hearing testimony constitutes a plausible explanation for his statements and the agency has pointed to no record evidence that would support a conclusion that he made them with the intention of defrauding, deceiving, or misleading the agency, the agency has also failed to prove the intent element of its untruthfulness charge. <span class="Italic">See Nelson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 7 (1998).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although an appellant's intent may be inferred from evidence of her reckless disregard for the truth or for ascertaining the truth, the falsity of her statements alone is not enough to sustain a charge of falsification or fraud. <span class="Italic">See Mooney v. Department of Defense</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 524, 526-27 (1990). For example, an appellant's negligent misstatement--even her recklessly negligent misstatement--without other evidence does not establish that she has given an intentionally false statement. <span class="Italic">Kumferman v. Department of the Navy</span>, 785 F.2d 286, 290 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Proof of her mistaken view or misunderstanding, along with her disclosure of the facts surrounding the particular situation, weigh against an inference of wrongful intent. <span class="Italic">Howell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 31, 37-38 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Freeman v. USPS,</span> 148 Fed. Appx. 934, 937-38 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), involving alleged misstatements on workers compensation forms, distinguished between error and intentional falsification, as the court required the government to shoulder the higher burden to demonstrate intentional falsification:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Misrepresentation involves two elements that the government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) supplying incorrect information and (2) doing so knowingly, with an intent to deceive or mislead the agency. <span class="Italic">See Bryant v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 202, 207 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 243 F.3d 559 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Freeman and the government principally dispute whether substantial evidence of intent supports the administrative judge's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Freeman contends that the administrative judge improperly shifted the burden of proof from the agency to him on the issue of intent. In his view, the administrative judge went too far in requiring him to prove a lack of deceptive intent, when the government bears the burden of proof on this issue. He claims there is no evidence that the incorrect dates he entered on his form were anything other than simple mistakes, which may have been due to his attention deficit disorder.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government contends that the case law supports finding intent to deceive when the accused offers no credible explanation for supplying incorrect information. For that proposition, it cites <span class="Italic">Kumferman v. Department of the Navy</span>, 785 F.2d 286, 290-91 (Fed. Cir. <span id="Page_2753"></span>1986). The government also asserts that Freeman did not argue before the administrative judge that his error was the product of simple inadvertence, but only that his allegedly low IQ and/or ADHD caused his error, a contention that the administrative judge rejected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden of proof rests on the agency to show intent; if it fails to do so, Freeman is not required to disprove intent. It is true that we have, in some cases, permitted an inference of intent when an employee failed to explain false information. <span class="Italic">See Kumferman</span>, 785 F.2d at 290-91. However, that case presented us with additional circumstantial evidence of intent, namely, a missing government-owned camera that was found in the employee's home seven months after he stated he was planning to ship it out for repair. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 291. If, on the other hand, the employee does provide a plausible explanation, "[t]he fact of an incorrect response cannot control the question of intent." <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 782 F.2d 975, 978 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In the present case, the record shows that Freeman provided a plausible explanation for supplying erroneous information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to his psychiatrist, Freeman suffered from moderate to severe ADHD, which impaired his ability to concentrate on paperwork. The administrative judge acknowledged that Freeman had ADHD, but relied on the fact that Freeman had never before sought workplace accommodations for his disorder to conclude that he should have had no problems filling out the OWCP form. In our view, the conclusion that Freeman's ADHD had no effect on his ability to fill out the form does not follow from the fact that he could perform his job without accommodation. There is no evidence that Freeman's job duties ordinarily involved filling out forms. He may well have been entirely capable of sorting and delivering mail without accommodation, and yet have suffered lapses in concentration that made unfamiliar paperwork difficult to follow. It is plausible that this condition could have led to mistakes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not think this explanation differs in kind from the one Freeman presented to the administrative judge. As the administrative judge noted, "individuals with [ADHD] may fail to give close attention to details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork or other tasks. Work is often messy and performed carelessly and without considered thought." Thus, ADHD and inadvertence are not two distinct theories; ADHD is an explanation of why Freeman was prone to mistakes and lends credence to his "mistake" explanation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government apparently provided no evidence of intent to deceive beyond the bare falsity of the information Freeman submitted. Evidence that Freeman never needed accommodation to perform his letter carrier duties is not evidence of deceptive intent, because it does not lead to the conclusion that he could be expected to fill out the CA-7 form mistake-free. Under <span class="Italic">Naekel</span>, intent cannot be inferred in such circumstances from the falsity of the information alone, so there is no substantial evidence of intent to deceive or mislead. 782 F.2d at 978. On that basis, we overturn the administrative judge's decision to sustain the charge of willful misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency charges the employee with providing incorrect information as to time and attendance, but the narrative supporting the charge and the penalty analysis demonstrate that the agency treated the matter as an intentional false statement, the Board holds the agency to the higher level of proof involved in a charge of intentional false statement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">George v.
