<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-242"><span class="space">2.</span> Requested by Agency</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 693, 695-96 (1986), the agency petitioned for a stay because the appellant in another case, Mr. Okonski, challenged a RIF involving the Community Services Administration, claiming the same position won by Mr. Jenkins in his appeal. Okonski lost his appeal before the AJ and petitioned for review. The agency was concerned that if Okonski won, it would have to follow Board orders requiring back pay for two employees involving the same position. The agency sought to stay the <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span> case until the <span class="Italic">Okonski</span> PFR was decided. The Board ruled in <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span> that a stay could be obtained under specified conditions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having previously held that agencies cannot seek stays even where proper OPM, or improper agency, petitions for reconsideration have been filed, we are now faced with the question of whether agencies can seek stays because subsequent cases might have an effect on a previously issued final judgment. We hold that stays may be sought in such a situation, but that the agency must meet the following criteria in order to obtain a stay. First, the agency must show that it could not have avoided being placed in this situation, e.g., by moving to consolidate the cases in question, or by filing a petition for review with the Board to prevent the first case from becoming final. If the agency satisfies this <span id="Page_1816"></span>criterion, then it must also show that there is a strong likelihood that the Board (or the court, where applicable) will issue a decision in the pending case which is inconsistent with the case in which the stay is requested, <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Fucik v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 9 MSPB 847, 10 MSPR 649 (1982); that irreparable harm will result if the stay does not issue and the predicted result occurs in the pending case, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Fucik</span>; <span class="Italic">Berard v. OPM</span>, 24 MSPR 347 (1984); that the stay would be in the public interest; and finally that other interested parties will not be substantially harmed by the stay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Berard</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Berard</span> we held that where a stay of a decision is requested pending judicial review of that same decision, the Board will balance the likelihood of success on the merits against the other three factors which are relevant to such a stay, i.e., irreparable harm, harm to other interested parties, and the public interest. A showing that the agency's situation was unavoidable is not required in such a case, and thus was not discussed. Where it is required, as here, it is a prerequisite to a stay, and the other criteria alone will not be examined absent such a showing. If the prerequisite is met the Board will consider the remaining four <span class="Italic">Berard</span> factors, giving them weight in accordance with the teaching of <span class="Italic">Berard</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, we find that the agency has not met the first criterion. The agency should have been aware of the possibility of multiple claims of entitlement to the same position despite the fact that the appeals were filed in different regions and, therefore, should have been prepared to request consolidation.... By requesting consolidation, the agency could thus have kept the decision from becoming final pending the Board's consideration of the two appellants' conflicting claims to the same position....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The same reasoning was applied to a request for a stay of one Board final decision pending the outcome of judicial review of another, with the same result, <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 690, 692-93 (1986) (also involving the CSA RIF):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In order to obtain a stay, the agency must meet the criteria articulated in <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span>: first, it must show that the situation was unavoidable; if it meets this criterion, it must then also show: (1) that there is a strong likelihood that inconsistent decisions will issue; (2) that irreparable harm will result if the stay is not granted; (3) that other parties will not be injured; and (4) that the stay would be in the public interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, while certain of the appeals were consolidated below, there was no consolidation which encompassed all employees who asserted conflicting claims to the same positions. The agency did not file a petition for review in any of the appeals in question, and no motion to consolidate was filed at the Board level. Had the agency filed petitions for review and a motion to consolidate in all the cases in question, the initial decisions would not have become final and the employees who sought judicial review would not have been able to do so, since the decisions in their cases would not be final or appealable. Thus, we find that the agency has not shown that the situation in which it now finds itself is unavoidable.</p>

DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 697, 698-99 (1986) (reiterating the <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span> requirements: a stay can be sought when the situation necessitating the stay is unavoidable; the necessity for a stay is avoidable when the agency can file a motion with the regional office to consolidate all cases that might result in inconsistent decisions, seek an interlocutory appeal of the denial of that motion, or file PFRs in all cases involving conflicting claims, followed by a motion to consolidate PFRs).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">This discussion relates the limited circumstances that exist apart from the OPM reconsideration process. The agency may not file a stay request based on an OPM request for Board reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Schuck v. USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 52, 53 (1985) ("As the Director possesses the exclusive statutory authority to petition the Board for reconsideration of a final decision, it is procedurally more efficient for the Director to request a stay if one is to be requested."). Under <span class="Italic">Maxfield v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 12 MSPR 539, 540 (1982), the authority to request a stay of a Board order was vested in the Director of OPM under 5 USC 7703(d). The authority to request a stay was limited to OPM by reason of administrative economy. <span class="Italic">Pfaehler v. DHHS</span>, 21 MSPR 137, 138 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Alfaro v. FAA,</span> 20 MSPR 127, 129 (1984) ("Permitting only the Director to apply for a stay enables the Board to treat stays in conjunction with the petitions for reconsideration to which they relate and, therefore, act more quickly in resolving such requests."). Denying a stay requested by an agency pending Board consideration of a motion by OPM for reconsideration, <span class="Italic">Miller v. DHHS</span>, 8 MSPR 692, 693-94 (1981), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 29, 1981, the Board issued an opinion and order in this case, ordering the cancellation of appellant's removal and directing the agency to substitute in its place a demotion to a nonsupervisory position. The agency has moved for a stay of that order, alleging that it has asked the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to consider petitioning the Board for reconsideration of the Board decision pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7703(d) provides that the Director of OPM must petition the Board to reconsider an appellant decision prior to petitioning for judicial review in any case in which OPM did not previously intervene. OPM had not intervened in the instant case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The authority of the government to seek judicial review of a final appellate decision of the Board is extremely circumscribed. Only OPM enjoys that authority, and even its role is limited. OPM action under section 7703(d) is predicated upon a determination by the Director that "the Board's decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive." The legislative history of this section indicates that OPM's authority was to be used "only in...exceptional cases." Furthermore, the purpose of the reconsideration provision was "to avoid unnecessary appeals by the Director." S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 64 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, pp. 2723, 2786. The section was enacted as part of the Civil Service Reform Act which itself was designed to "streamline the appeals process, eliminating unnecessary levels of appeal." S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 10 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, p. 2732.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the statute nor the Board's regulations authorize an agency to request a stay of a final order of the Board under the instant circumstances. The effect of granting the agency's motion in this case would be severalfold. If the Board's decision is ultimately reversed, a stay could arguably avoid the necessity of further personnel actions by the agency, and also serve to obviate the need for recoupment of any backpay awarded to appellant. However, a stay would also have the effect of creating another uncontemplated level of administrative review of the agency's action during the pendency of which appellant will be deprived of the benefits of the final order of the Board. Nothing in section 7703(d) or its legislative history suggests either the necessity or the desirability of such a result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the circumscribed nature of OPM's authority to request reconsideration, the probability of the Director so requesting the Board is highly speculative in this and most Board matters. Furthermore, any harm the agency may suffer as a result of the denial of an agency request for a stay may be remedied in the event of ultimate reversal of the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Guerrero v. VA</span>, 106 MSPR 142, 143-44 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1-3, 2007 MSPB 148 (2007), employed a multifactor analysis to deny a stay to an agency, whose adverse action was reversed, while the agency sought to convince OPM to request reconsideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is before the Board on the request of the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) to stay enforcement of the Board's final decision in <span class="Italic">Guerrero v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, AT-0752-06-0144-I-2 (May 8, 2007) for 15 days while DVA consults with the Office of Personnel Management about filing a petition for reconsideration. The Board held in <span class="Italic">Guerrero</span> that the agency failed to prove its charges that the appellant made false statements on two employment application forms for the position of GS-13 Supervisory Biomedical Engineer and misrepresented his qualifications for employment. Thus, the Board ordered the agency to cancel the appellant's removal and restore him to employment, effective October 28, 2005. The appellant has responded in opposition to the stay request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may exercise its discretion to stay the enforcement of a final decision pending judicial review or reconsideration by the Board. <span class="Italic">Briggs v. National Council on Disability</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 296, 299 (1995). In determining whether to grant a stay, the Board considers four criteria: (1) whether the party requesting the stay has made a strong showing that it is likely to prevail on the merits; (2) whether the requesting party will be irreparably harmed absent a stay; (3) whether the issuance of the stay will substantially harm other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Byrd</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 649, 651 (1994). The Board balances the likelihood of success with the other factors. <span class="Italic">Briggs</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 299. Where the requester makes a convincing argument that the last three criteria are met, the Board will issue a stay if there is a serious legal question on the merits. Where, however, support for a stay based on the last three criteria is slight, a stay will be granted only if the possibility for success on reconsideration is strong. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency offers no argument that it is likely to prevail on the merits, much less a showing of a serious legal question. Further, the agency has failed to make a convincing argument that the last three criteria have been met. With respect to the second criterion, substantial harm to the requesting party, the agency has offered nothing beyond its bare assertion that it will suffer such harm. Moreover, the Board's decision indicates that the appellant worked for one year in his position, yet, the agency has failed to offer any evidence that the appellant's performance during that year was anything other than satisfactory. With respect to the third criterion, harm to other parties, the agency asserts that a stay will not substantially harm the appellant because he is currently on paid administrative leave and will continue to remain in this status while the agency consults with OPM as to whether to seek reconsideration. The appellant, however, has responded that issuance of a stay will cause harm to his professional credibility and negate peer respect in the workplace. We find some merit to this argument. Additionally, we do not find that <span id="Page_1817"></span>the public interest demands, as the agency suggests, that it be given time to determine whether reconsideration is necessary as the Board already carefully considered the facts in reaching its decision. Finally, while it is true that the stay request is for a short period of time, we do not find that this is a sufficient basis to grant the stay request.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Filiberti</span>, 27 MSPR 35, 37, 39 (1985), the employer agency intervened to request a stay pending judicial review of a Board order directing that the respondents be suspended. The agency's argument was that it would be irreparably harmed: if the respondents prevailed in their appeals, the agency would have to provide them with back pay for services they did not render. The Board denied the stay application and instead decided that the Back Pay Act recognizes that back pay is recoverable when no work is performed: "The Act provides that the employee is deemed to have performed service for the agency during the period of the unwarranted personnel action. 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(B)." In a sequel, the Board declined the invitation of the intervenor agency employer to modify a Board penalty because the agency concealed material information that should have been submitted to the Board. The Board said of the agency's actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Such concealment by the intervenor should not be tolerated. The well-known equitable doctrine of "clean hands" is applicable here: the person who seeks equity must do equity. If the intervenor seeks relief from a Board order, it must be truthful and forthcoming in its request.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board again rejected the agency's protestations about possible financial losses in the absence of a stay of a restoration order pending judicial review. <span class="Italic">Briggs v. Nat'l Council on Disability</span>, 68 MSPR 296, 301 (1995), pointed out the harm that befalls an appellant who is not reinstated to a position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has previously held that the fact that an employee may receive salary or back pay on the basis of a Board reinstatement order that could later be overturned does not demonstrate irreparable harm. <span class="Italic">See Parton v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 9 MSPB 258, 9 MSPR 638, 640 (1982). Additionally, the agency has offered nothing to support its bare allegation that there would be little or no possibility of recouping the monies paid to the appellant if the Board's decision was reversed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are also not persuaded by the agency's argument that the appellant will suffer "little or no harm" if a stay is granted because the agency will continue her in an administrative leave status with full salary and benefits. This argument overlooks the fact that the agency's continued refusal to comply with the Board's final order in this appeal may have the effect of depriving the appellant of important benefits. As the Federal Circuit has recently recognized, "[t]here are many benefits, both tangible and intangible, which may accrue to an employee who is actually present and working, instead of being away from work while on administrative leave." <span class="Italic">DeLaughter v. USPS</span>, 3 F.3d 1522, 1524 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fucik v. DHUD</span>, 10 MSPR 649, 650-51 (1982), adjudicated an agency's request, arising out of a pre-Reform Act case, that the Board stay its remedial order as the agency sought to take its case into the Court of Claims under the same standards applicable to a stay request by OPM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Parton v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 9 MSPB 258, 9 MSPR 638 (1982), a case processed under the Civil Service Reform Act, the Board was requested to stay compliance with a decision pending consideration of a request for further review by the Office of Personnel Management preliminary to action in the court of appeals. There, we adopted the standards applied by the courts of appeals pursuant to Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure in determining whether to stay the effectiveness of a final order pending a request for reconsideration. Thus, we held that we would not issue such a stay unless the petitioner establishes that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;it is likely the Board erred in issuing its final order;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;without such relief, irreparable injury will result;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;the stay would not substantially harm other parties interested in the proceedings; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;the stay would promote, or at least would not adversely affect, the public interest. <span class="Italic">See National Association of Farmworkers</span> <span class="Italic">Organizations v. Marshall,</span> 628 F.2d 604, 613 (D.C. Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Association v. Federal Power Commission,</span> 259 F.2d 921, 925 (D.C. Cir. 1958).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the instant case is not directly appealable to the court of appeals, Rule 18 is inapplicable. Court of Claims Rules 149 and 150, on which the agency relies, contain no provision for staying the effectiveness of our action. Nonetheless, the Board finds that 5 USC &#x00A7; 705 provides such general authority. It states, in relevant part, that "[w]hen an agency finds that justice so requires, it may postpone the effective date of the action taken by it, pending judicial review." While this section also provides that a reviewing court may stay an action on basically the same grounds referenced above in connection with Rule 18, it does not specifically require that an administrative agency apply those same rules. However, the Board finds it appropriate to do so and we hereby adopt those grounds as the basis for our determination on the agency's motion for stay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts, in support of its motion, that the time for compliance with the Board's decision should be extended to provide an opportunity for it to comment to the court on the merits of the decision. It states that back pay and reinstatement at this point would be unfair to all parties and might foreclose its right to further appeal. It also contends that there are two questions of law raised by the Board's decision; first, whether it was proper for the Board to rely on the position classification standards in making its determination, and second, whether the Board exceeded its authority in making a decision as to the classification of appellant's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having considered the agency's position, the Board finds that it has not met the requirements for a stay. No showing has been made that compliance would terminate its right to proceed under Court of Claims Rule 150 and the rule itself does not specify that such would be the result. As to the question of the fairness of what might turn out to be premature compliance, as we noted in our order in <span class="Italic">Parton, supra,</span> procedures exist for effecting recovery of any back pay award if it is later found to be erroneous. <span class="Italic">See</span> 31 USC &#x00A7; 951 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> and 4 CFR parts 102-105.[2]...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also Miller v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 8 MSPB 340, 340, 8 MSPR 692, 693 (1981), where a stay pending a possible administrative request for reconsideration was denied, finding that "...a stay would also have the effect of creating another uncontemplated level of administrative review of the agency's action during the pendency of which appellant will be deprived of the benefits of the final order of the Board."</p>
