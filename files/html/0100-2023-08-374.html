<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-366"><span class="space">d.</span> Age Limit on Appointment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Isabella v. Dept. of State</span>, 102 MSPR 259, 260-62 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-7, 2006 MSPB 157 (2006), determined that age limitations on appointments may be challenged under VEOA when provisions of veterans preference laws require waiver:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In June 2004, the appellant applied for a position as a Foreign Service Diplomatic Security Special Agent with the agency under vacancy announcement SA-04-01. The vacancy announcement provided that "Special Agent Candidates must be appointed <span class="Italic">prior</span> to their 37th birthday." The agency contended that it terminated consideration of the appellant because he was only months away from his 37th birthday, which was November 8, 2004. The agency asserted that no candidates considered under this vacancy announcement could have been appointed until November 15, 2004, at the earliest, because that was the pre-scheduled appointment date for members of the first training class of Special Agent candidates that could include individuals selected under vacancy announcement SA-04-01.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge explained the Board's VEOA jurisdiction, and ordered the appellant to file evidence and argument demonstrating that he had veterans' preference eligibility, showing that he had exhausted his remedies with the Department of Labor (DoL), and explaining how he believed his veterans' preference rights were violated. The appellant provided documentation showing that he had exhausted his remedies with DoL, that he had been on active duty during 2003 and 2004, and that he had received the Bronze Star, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. He also argued that the agency could have appointed him before his 37th birthday by expediting his application or by appointing him without competition under the Veterans' Readjustment Act (VRA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the VEOA, the Board has jurisdiction over a preference eligible's allegations that an agency has violated his veterans' preference rights only if: (1) He has first exhausted his DoL remedy; and (2) he has made nonfrivolous allegations that he is a preference eligible within the meaning of the VEOA, that the actions at issue occurred on or after the October 30, 1998 enactment date of the VEOA, and that the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation related to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Abrahamsen v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 6 (2003); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a. It is undisputed that the appellant exhausted his DoL remedies and made nonfrivolous allegations that he is a preference eligible and that his nonselection occurred after October 30, 1998.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue is whether he made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation related to veterans' preference. The appellant's allegations on this point should be liberally construed. <span class="Italic">Abrahamsen</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 9. When an appellant "claim[s] that his veterans' preference rights were violated," this aspect of VEOA's jurisdictional requirements is satisfied. <span class="Italic">Young v. Federal Mediation &#x0026; Conciliation Service</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 99, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 6-7 (2002), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 66 Fed. Appx. 858 (Fed. Cir. 2003). For example, the Board has previously held that a mere claim that use of a particular appointing authority violated an individual's veterans' preference rights is sufficient to satisfy this jurisdictional requirement. <span class="Italic">Abrahamsen</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant argued that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights when it failed to select him for the Special Agent position. In determining the qualifications of a preference eligible for an appointment in the competitive service, examining agencies must waive age requirements, such as the one at issue here, unless the requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of the position. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3312(a)(1). Nothing in the record indicates whether the age requirement for this position was essential to the performance of its duties. If the age requirement was not essential and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3312(a)(1) applied to the appointment, the agency would have been required to waive the age requirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Isabella</span> was remanded to the Board's regional office, the AJ denied corrective action, Isabella filed another PFR, and the Board granted a remedial order after considering the evidence pertaining to the age limitation that the agency sought to impose. <span class="Italic">Isabella v. Dept. of State</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ISABELLA_ROBERT_P_AT_3443_05_0550_B_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_280837.pdf">106 MSPR 333</a>, 337-38, 344-62 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-8, 20-45, 2007 MSPB 186 (2007) (OPM reconsideration petition denied, 109 MSPR 453 (2008)), stated that an age barrier to law enforcement positions violated veterans preference rights. The agency was ordered to reconstruct the selection process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the remand, the administrative judge ordered the parties to file evidence and argument addressing whether the maximum entry age for the Special Agent position is essential to the performance of the duties of the position. In response to this order, the agency noted that the Secretary of State has specific statutory authority to prescribe a maximum entry age for the Special Agent position and that the agency's age requirement is consistent with the requirements for other federal law enforcement personnel. It also argued that the agency's requirement was "consistent with the long history of clearly stated Congressional intent to ensure a youthful and vigorous federal law enforcement force" and stated that the duties of the position are rigorous and demand the sort of "youth and vigor" referenced in the legislative history regarding the age limits for other federal law enforcement officers. The agency further noted that the vacancy announcement indicated that applicants were required to be fit for strenuous exertion and able to pass physical fitness tests. The agency concluded its argument by stating that the age requirements are essential to the performance of the duties of the Special Agent position and to ensure "that the Department has a Special Agent force of sufficient physical stamina and vigor to carry out the critical duties of these positions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also submitted a copy of the action memorandum dated January 4, 1988, through which Secretary of State George P. Schultz approved a maximum entry age of less than 35 years of age for Special Agents and a copy of the memorandum dated October 29, 1996, through which Secretary of State William Christopher approved raising the maximum entry age to less than 37 years of age. The earlier memorandum indicated that the agency's then-current hiring standards for security officers included physical testing requirements and a minimum age standard, but the maximum age for such positions was the same as the remainder of the Foreign Service, 60 years of age. The memorandum went on to explain that law enforcement work imposes exceptional physical demands and stress and recommended that the Department of State should enter on duty only candidates less than age 35 "in conformance with the practice of most federal law-enforcement agencies."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_687"></span>The second memorandum indicated that the Federal Law Enforcement Pay Reform Act of 1990 had raised the mandatory retirement age for law enforcement officers from 55 to 57 years of age and that most federal law enforcement agencies had raised the maximum entry age for their law enforcement officer positions from less than 35 to less than 37 years of age to allow for a minimum of 20 years service. This memorandum stated that past agency policy decisions had clearly established that an age limit is necessary and appropriate for the appointment of "Security Officers" and that the agency would be "hard pressed to make a case that its maximum age should be lower than that of other law enforcement agencies where the special agent duties are just as physically demanding."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his response, the appellant did not contest the agency's arguments regarding the basis for its position that the maximum entry age was essential to the performance of the duties of the position. Instead, the appellant argued that he believed that he could have been appointed prior to his 37th birthday and that he would have been eligible to "buy back" the necessary retirement time in order to allow him to retire at age 57.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 10, 2006, the administrative judge issued an initial decision in which he denied corrective action with respect to the appellant's VEOA appeal, finding that the physical demands of the Special Agent position are consistent with those of other federal law enforcement officers and noting that the rationale for imposing maximum entry ages and mandatory retirement ages for such positions is to ensure that "federal law enforcement officers [are] 'young men and women capable of meeting the vigorous demands of occupations which are far more taxing physically than most in federal service.'"<span class="Italic"> Isabella v. Department of State,</span> MSPB Docket No. AT-0330-05-0409-B-1, slip op. (Initial Decision, Oct. 10, 2006) (citing<span class="Italic"> Fagergren v. Department of the Interior,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 649, 651 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 166 Fed. Appx. 483 (Fed. Cir. 2006)). The administrative judge concluded that the maximum entry age for the Special Agent position was essential to the performance of the duties of that position and that the agency therefore did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights by failing to waive this requirement in considering the appellant's application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a preliminary matter, we note that the agency asserted that the Secretary of State has designated all Foreign Service positions, including Special Agent positions, as excepted service positions, and the appellant has not contested this assertion. In addition, the agency's assertion appears consistent with the provisions of the Foreign Service Act of 1980. Pursuant to the Act, the Secretary of State is authorized to designate and classify positions in the Department of State and at Foreign Service posts which are to be occupied by "members of the Service," and such positions are excepted from the competitive service. 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3981. The Act defines "members of the Service" to include "Foreign service personnel...who provide skills and services required for effective performance of the Service," 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3903, and, despite the fact that 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4823 provides that Special Agent positions shall be filled in accordance with the provisions of the Act and title 5, the language of &#x00A7; 4823 does not indicate that Special Agents are not members of the Service. Accordingly, we find that the record establishes that the Special Agent position at issue in this appeal is an excepted service position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Now that the record is complete, we find that the appellant has established that he is preference eligible and that his nonselection occurred after October 30, 1998 by preponderant evidence. The appellant established his status as preference eligible by submitting a copy of his DD Form 214 which indicated that he was the recipient of the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, and the agency has not contested the authenticity nor the accuracy of this document.<span class="Italic"> See Trabue v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 8 (2006) ("[A]n employee's DD-214 showing receipt of any Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal is acceptable proof of entitlement to veterans' preference, regardless of whether the DD-214 form specifies the name of the theater or country of service for which the medal was awarded."). The appellant was not selected for a position for which he timely applied in 2004, so it is obvious that the nonselection occurred after October 30, 1998.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be entitled to relief under VEOA, however, the appellant must also prove by preponderant evidence that the agency's action violated one or more of his statutory or regulatory veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See Walley v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 279 F.3d 1010, 1019 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the Board's regulations place the burden of proof on the appellant with respect to merits issues that are also jurisdictional issues); <span class="Italic">Dale v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 10 (2006) (to be entitled to relief under VEOA, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that the agency's selection violated one or more of his statutory or regulatory veterans' preference rights). Accordingly, the question as to whether the appellant is entitled to relief with respect to his VEOA appeal turns on whether the agency was required to waive the maximum entry age for the Special Agent position pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3312(a)(1) and 3320.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he history of various provisions of the Foreign Service personnel system indicates that Congress intended to treat Diplomatic Security Service Special Agents in accordance with the treatment provided to law enforcement officers in other federal agencies. For example, the authority of the Secretary of State to prescribe maximum entry age restrictions for the position of Special Agent provided by 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4823 is essentially identical to the authority the heads of other executive agencies have to determine and fix the maximum age limits for an original appointment to a position as a law enforcement officer or firefighter provided by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(d), (e). The legislative history of 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4823 indicates that Congress provided the Secretary of State the authority to prescribe minimum and maximum entry age restrictions because "[s]uch age requirements are commonly found in organizations having security-related and law enforcement responsibilities." H.R. Rep. No. 99-494, at 10 (1986). In 1998, Congress enacted the "Department of State Special Agents Retirement Act of 1998," Pub. L. No. 105-382, 112 Stat. 3406 (1998), for the purpose of providing "that the annuities of certain special agents and security personnel of the Department of State be computed in the same way as applies generally with respect to Federal law enforcement officers." H.R. Rep. No. 105-755(I), at 1 (1998). Section 3 of this Act provided that individuals covered by the Act "shall be separated from the Service on the last day of the month in which such individual...attains 57 years of age or completes 20 years of service if then over that age." Pub. L. No. 105-382, &#x00A7; 3 (codified at 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4052(a)(2)). The legislative history of this Act indicates that Congress enacted the mandatory retirement provisions to subject Foreign Service special agents "to the same mandatory retirement provisions that currently apply to law enforcement officers under the Civil Service Retirement System." H.R. Rep. No. 105-755(I), at 10. In addition, as described previously, the memoranda through which Secretary of State Schultz initially set the maximum entry age at less than 35 years of age and Secretary of State Christopher raised the maximum entry age to less than 37 years of age indicate that the recommendations which these officials approved were based, in large part, on the treatment afforded to law enforcement officers by other federal agencies. <span class="Italic">See supra,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6. Based on the discussion set forth above, we accept the agency's contention that the age limits applicable to the Special Agent position in the Diplomatic Security Service exist for the same purpose as the age limits applicable to law enforcement officer positions in other federal agencies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the question is whether age is essential to the performance of the duties of federal law enforcement officer positions. As a general rule, maximum age requirements are prohibited with respect to civil service positions in the federal government by virtue of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(a) and 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a. Section 3307(a) of title 5 establishes a general rule prohibiting the establishment of maximum age requirements for competitive service positions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f),[6] appropriated funds may not be used to pay an employee who establishes a maximum-age requirement for entrance into the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;These exceptions allow the heads of the applicable agencies to fix maximum entry ages for original appointments to positions as air traffic controllers (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(b)), United States Park Police (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(c)), law enforcement officer and firefighter positions subject to the Civil Service Retirement System (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(d)), law enforcement officer and firefighter positions subject to the Federal Employees' Retirement System (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(e)), and nuclear material couriers (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(f)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(a). Congress enacted 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a as an amendment to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) to make the provisions of the ADEA applicable to federal executive agencies. The Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-259, &#x00A7; 28(B)(2), 88 Stat. 55 (1974) (codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a)). In pertinent part, this section provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003; Federal agencies affected</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">All personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least 40 years of age...in executive agencies as defined in section 105 of title 5...shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003; Enforcement by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission...; <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...Reasonable exemptions to the provisions of this section may be established by the Commission but only when the Commission has established a maximum age requirement on the basis of a determination that age is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification necessary to the performance of the duties of the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a), (b). Thus, unless a position is exempt from the <span id="Page_688"></span>provisions of the ADEA, a federal executive agency may not set a maximum age requirement for a position unless the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) determines that age is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification (BFOQ) necessary to the performance of the duties of the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.201(b) ("The Commission may exempt a position from the provisions of the ADEA if the Commission establishes a maximum age requirement for the position on the basis of a determination that age is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification necessary to the performance of the duties of the position."); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 338.601 (a maximum age requirement may not be applied in either competitive or noncompetitive examinations for positions in the competitive service except as provided by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307 or the ADEA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC regulations implementing the ADEA make it exceptionally difficult, however, to establish age as a valid qualification requirement for a position that is not exempt from the ADEA. These regulations state, "[T]his concept of a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification will have limited scope and application. Further, as this is an exception to the Act it must be narrowly construed." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1625.6(a);<span class="Italic"> see also Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Criswell,</span> 472 U.S. 400, 412 (1985) ("The restrictive language of the statute and the consistent interpretation of the administrative agencies charged with enforcing the statute convince us that, like its Title VII counterpart, the BFOQ exception 'was in fact meant to be a narrow exception to the general prohibition' of age discrimination contained in the ADEA."). The regulations further provide as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employer asserting a BFOQ defense has the burden of proving that (1) the age limit is reasonably necessary to the essence of the business, and either (2) that all or substantially all individuals excluded are in fact disqualified, or (3) that some of the individuals so excluded possess a disqualifying trait that cannot be ascertained except by reference to age. If the employer's objective in asserting a BFOQ is the goal of public safety, the employer must prove that the challenged practice does indeed effectuate that goal and that there is no acceptable alternative which would better advance it or equally advance it with less discriminatory impact.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1625.6(b). With respect to alternatives that might effectuate the employer's goals with less discriminatory impact, the U.S. Supreme Court has stated, "Application of the [ADEA] starts with a presumption in favor of requiring the employer to make an individualized determination." <span class="Italic">Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents,</span> 528 U.S. 62, 87 (2000); <span class="Italic">see also Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia,</span> 427 U.S. 307, 316 n.10 (1976) (noting that the introduction of individual examinations augmented the rationality of the state's mandatory retirement scheme).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the concept of age as a BFOQ for a particular position is closely related to the concept of age as a requirement that is essential to the performance of the duties of the position. In fact, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which has the authority to prescribe and enforce regulations for the administration of the provisions of title 5 that implement veterans' preference policy, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1302(b), (c), has implemented regulations which provide that agencies must waive requirements as to age when the requirement is not essential to the performance of the duties of an excepted service position, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.202(a), and prohibit the application of a maximum-age requirement in examinations for positions in the competitive service except as provided by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307 or by the ADEA, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 338.601.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM, however, has not promulgated regulations describing when an age requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of a position. Nevertheless, in its Operating Manual concerning Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions, OPM expressly ties the waiver of age requirements for preference-eligible candidates to the provisions of the ADEA. Specifically, the manual provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Title 5 U.S.C. 3307(a) prohibits the establishment of a maximum entry age for Federal positions, except as provided below. The prohibition against establishing maximum entry age limits applies to noncompetitive actions as well as to competitive appointments, to the excepted as well as to competitive services, and to all agencies, including OPM.... There are no maximum entry age restrictions for most positions in the competitive service except as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...The head of any agency is authorized to establish a maximum entry age for original appointment to positions of law enforcement officers or firefighters; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Title 29 U.S.C. 633a permits agencies to establish a maximum age requirement only in instances where they have proven to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that age is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> occupational qualification necessary for the performance of the duties of a particular position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Maximum age restrictions established under 29 U.S.C. 633a or under the special authorities in 5 U.S.C. 3307 are not waived for persons entitled to veterans preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM, Operating Manual, Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions, Part E.9(c)(2), available online at <a href="http://www.opm.gov/employ/qualifications/SEC-II/s2-e8.asp">http://www.opm.gov/employ/qualifications/SEC-II/s2-e8.asp</a> [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-policies/#url=e9b">http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-policies/#url=e9b</a>] . Thus, this manual essentially provides that agencies are not required to waive age restrictions for preference eligibles in only two circumstances: (1) when the EEOC has determined that age is a BFOQ necessary for the performance of the duties of a particular position; or (2) when the maximum age restriction was established pursuant to one of the special authorities provided by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(b), (c), and (d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we stated in our prior decision remanding the appellant's VEOA appeal, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3312(a)(1) and 3320 require agencies to waive age requirements in determining the qualifications of a preference eligible for appointment to a position in the competitive or excepted service unless the requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of the position. <span class="Italic">Isabella,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 259, &#x00B6; 13. Thus, the guidance set forth in OPM's Operating Manual suggests that OPM has determined that age requirements are essential to the duties of a civil service position only when the EEOC has determined that age is a BFOQ necessary for the performance of the duties of a particular position or when the age restriction was established pursuant to a special statutory authority. To the extent that OPM has interpreted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3312(a)(1) to equate the concept of an age requirement that is essential to the performance of the duties of a position with the concept of a BFOQ that is necessary to the performance of the duties of a position, we believe that OPM's interpretation is persuasive and entitled to considerable weight. <span class="Italic">See Brandt v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 14 (2006) (although positions expressed by OPM in issuances that were not subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures are not entitled to the deference accorded to regulations, they are entitled to some weight in accordance with such factors as the consistency of the agency's position, its formality, and its persuasiveness). OPM's interpretation that maximum age restrictions established under the ADEA or under special statutory authorities are not waived for persons entitled to veterans' preference has been in place since at least May of 1981,<span class="Italic"> see</span> Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), chapter 338, subchapter 5, &#x00A7; 5-3 (May 7, 1981), and the interpretation was published in formal documents, i.e., the FPM and an operating manual "directed primarily to personnel specialists who need to determine whether applicants meet the minimum requirements for the position being filled." OPM, Operating Manual, Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions, Section I, available online at <a href="http://www.opm.gov/qualifications/sec-i/s1-a.asp">http://www.opm.gov/qualifications/sec-i/s1-a.asp</a> [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-policies/">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-policies</a>/] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, while neither the FPM nor the Operating Manual explain the reasoning supporting OPM's interpretation, OPM's position regarding BFOQ's is persuasive. The Veterans' Preference Act requires agencies to waive an age requirement unless "the requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of the position." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3312(a)(1). The adjective "essential" means "absolutely necessary; indispensable." <span class="Italic">The Random House College Dictionary</span> 451 (revised ed. 1980). While the ADEA speaks in terms of a BFOQ "necessary to the performance of the duties of the position," 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(b), the criteria the EEOC applies in determining whether an age requirement qualifies as a BFOQ permit employers to use age as a qualification for a position only when age is "reasonably necessary to the essence of the business," when all or substantially all of the individuals excluded are disqualified or the disqualifying trait for some of the individuals cannot be ascertained except by reference to age, and, with respect to positions in which the employer's objective is the goal of public safety, when there are no acceptable alternatives which would better advance the employer's objective or equally advance it with less discriminatory impact.<span class="Italic"> See supra,</span> Accordingly, while the ADEA uses the term "necessary" rather than the term "essential" to describe the standard an agency must meet in order to impose an age requirement with respect to a position, it is apparent that the regulatory BFOQ criteria are designed to allow an employer to impose an age requirement only when the employer establishes that age is "absolutely necessary" or "indispensable" to the performance of the duties of the position. Therefore, for all practical purposes, the EEOC's determination that age is a BFOQ necessary for the performance of the duties of the position is equivalent to a finding that age is essential to the performance of the duties of the position. Because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3312(a)(1) does not require agencies to waive an age requirement that is essential to the performance of the duties of the position, OPM's position that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3312(a)(1) does not require agencies to waive maximum age restrictions for preference-eligible applicants when the restrictions were established in accordance with the provisions of the ADEA is reasonable and persuasive. In addition, OPM's position is consistent with both the veterans' preference requirement at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3312(a)(1) and the merit system principle that all employees and applicants should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management with regard to age. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_689"></span>However, OPM's position that agencies are not required to waive age requirements established pursuant to special statutory authorities is not as persuasive. First, the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3312(a)(1) does not exempt statutorily-authorized age requirements from those that an agency must waive on behalf of preference eligibles, and the agency has pointed to no authority to suggest that Congress intended to exclude statutorily-authorized age requirements from the waiver provisions of the Veterans' Preference Act, at least where the statute authorizing the age requirement was not enacted based on a congressional finding that age was essential to the performance of the duties of the position. The Secretary of State derives the authority to set a maximum entry age for the position of Diplomatic Security Service Special Agent from 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4823, but the legislative history of that provision indicates that Congress granted the Secretary such authority on the grounds that "age requirements are commonly found in organizations having security-related and law enforcement responsibilities." <span class="Italic">See supra,</span> &#x00B6; 24. Thus, while the legislative history of this Foreign Service provision indicates that Congress authorized a maximum entry age for the Special Agent position as consistent with the practice of other law enforcement organizations, it does not indicate that Congress made a specific finding that age was essential to the performance of the duties of the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Still, as we stated previously, it is apparent that Congress intended to treat Diplomatic Security Service Special Agents in accordance with the treatment provided to law enforcement officers in other federal agencies. <span class="Italic">See supra,</span> &#x00B6; 24. Thus, if Congress authorized maximum entry age requirements for other federal law enforcement officers based on a finding that age was essential to the performance of the duties of those positions, the agency could reasonably argue that such a finding should carry over to the authority 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4823 grants to the Secretary of State. Accordingly, we will consider whether Congress authorized federal agencies to fix maximum entry age limits for law enforcement officer positions based on a finding that age was essential to the performance of the duties of such positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307 in 1974 to include subsection (d), the exception from the general rule for law enforcement officers and firefighters, to coincide with changes Congress enacted with respect to the retirement provisions for these employees. Pub. L. No. 93-350, 88 Stat. 355 (1974). The changes to the retirement provisions included a requirement to separate a law enforcement officer or firefighter from the service on the last day of the month in which such employee became 55 years of age or completed 20 years of service if then over that age.[8] <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00A7; 4 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8335(b)). However, Congress also amended the retirement provisions to allow such employees to retire earlier and with an annuity calculated at a higher percentage of average pay as compared to most other federal employees. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5 (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(c)(1)) (entitling a law enforcement officer or firefighter to an annuity after becoming 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service as a law enforcement officer or firefighter, or any combination of such service), 6 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(d)(1)) (establishing the annuity of an employee retiring under the provisions applicable to law enforcement officers and firefighters as 2.5% of average pay multiplied by so much of their total service as did not exceed 20 years, plus 2% of average pay multiplied by so much of their total service as exceeded 20 years).[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The amendment also permitted the head of an agency to exempt an employee from the mandatory retirement provision until the employee became 60 years of age when the head of the agency determined that the public interest so required. Pub. L. No. 93-350, &#x00A7; 4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;At the time, the basic annuity for civil service employees was 1.5% of their average pay for each of the first five years of service, 1.75% for the next five years of service, and 2.0% for additional years of service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(a) (1970). Prior to the 1974 amendments, a law enforcement officer could retire at age 50 with an annuity of 2.0% of average pay multiplied by the number of years of service if he completed 20 years of service, the head of the agency recommended that he receive an enhanced annuity, and the Civil Service Commission concurred. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(c) (1970);<span class="Italic"> see Stewart v. Smith,</span> 673 F.2d 485, 487 &#x0026; n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Smith,</span> 673 F.2d 485 (D.C. Cir. 1982), the court addressed the propriety of a maximum entry age that the Department of Justice Bureau of Prisons established for its law enforcement positions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(d). The appellants had challenged the age limit on the basis that it violated the ADEA and the Administrative Procedures Act. <span class="Italic">Stewart,</span> 673 F.2d at 487. In rejecting the appellants' arguments, the court extensively discussed the basis for the passage of Pub. L. No. 93-350.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In describing the legislative history of the law, the court stated that Pub. L. No. 93-350 was expected to improve the incentives for early retirement of law enforcement officers in two ways: The amendments made it more economically practicable for law enforcement officers to retire early by providing an extra half a percentage point multiple for the first 20 years of service; and the amendments made it less worthwhile for such employees to work beyond 20 years by lowering the rate of computation for years of service in excess of 20 years. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 487 n.4. With respect to the authority to set maximum entry age limits for law enforcement officer and firefighter positions, the court found that the legislative history of the amendments indicated that Congress intended to provide agencies with the authority to structure their hiring practices to implement the retirement scheme for law enforcement officers. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 493.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court also determined that the age limit being challenged as violative of the ADEA in <span class="Italic">Stewart,</span> i.e., the Department of Justice Bureau of Prisons' choice of 34 as the maximum age for entry into its law enforcement positions, was supported by the statutory scheme implemented by Pub. L. No. 93-350. The appellants had argued that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(d) should be interpreted as merely authorizing maximum entry ages for law enforcement officer positions, with the legality of the maximum age policy adopted by the agency remaining contingent on whether the policy met the ADEA's BFOQ standard. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 490-91. The Department of Justice had argued that &#x00A7; 3307(d) took maximum age rules for law enforcement officer positions outside the ambit of the ADEA, noting that &#x00A7; 3307(d) and the ADEA set out different procedures for establishing age-based requirements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 491-92. The court accepted the Department of Justice's argument and agreed that &#x00A7; 3307(d) was an exception to the ADEA, noting that accepting the appellants' argument would require the court to adopt a strained reading of &#x00A7; 3307(d):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Appellants' attempt to superimpose ADEA standards on agency discretion under section 3307(d), however, seems problematic when section 3307(d) is read in its entirety; for instead of simply lifting a general ban on agencies' setting age qualifications for law enforcement employment, section 3307(d) sets forth a specific procedure for agencies to follow in setting such qualifications. Under section 3307(d), and implementing executive orders, an entry age qualification must be proposed initially by the agency and concurred in by OPM. In contrast, the ADEA vests sole authority to establish exemptions from the general ban against age discrimination with the EEOC.... And, once the legislative history of section 3307(d) is examined, it is evident that Congress meant to do what the statute's terms suggest, namely, to provide for maximum age requirements for law enforcement officers on the theory that these jobs involve special concerns that require consideration of factors not ordinarily accounted for in the ADEA's independent scheme for evaluating age restrictions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 492. The court also noted that the legislative history indicated that Congress provided agencies with the authority to set maximum entry ages for law enforcement officers to enhance the scheme which required mandatory retirement at an early age. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 493. For example, the court cited a letter the Civil Service Commission sent to the relevant congressional committees that stated, "It is important...to have a limit on the age of entry that is related to [mandatory retirement at age 55] so persons entering the occupations can be provided a full career." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing H.R. Rep. No. 93-463, at 9 (1973)). The court further noted that Congress enacted the provisions of the law to promote the "youth and vigor" of the law enforcement profession and that the maximum entry age limit enabled employees to complete 20 years of service by the time they reached the mandatory retirement age of 55.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 495. The court concluded that the exception set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(d) "served to remove maximum entry ages from the scope of the ADEA and represents Congress' judgment that such maximum entry ages are an appropriate tool for controlling the age composition of an agency's workforce."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 500.[10]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10] Other federal courts, as well as the EEOC, have generally concluded that statutory provisions which authorize maximum entry ages and mandatory retirement ages are generally exceptions to, rather than implementation of, the ADEA provisions applicable to federal employees. <span class="Italic">See Reed v. Reno,</span> 146 F.3d 392, 394 (6th Cir. 1998) ("It is well-established that the maximum entry age for law enforcement officers is a valid exception to the ADEA."); <span class="Italic">Strawberry v. Albright,</span> 111 F.3d 943, 947 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (finding that the mandatory retirement provisions contained in the Foreign Service Act of 1980 and incorporated in the Foreign Service Pension System were not controlled by the ADEA);<span class="Italic"> Patterson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 901 F.2d 927, 929-30 (11th Cir. 1990) (rejecting the argument that a maximum age limit adopted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(d) must be considered under the ADEA's BFOQ standards);<span class="Italic"> Brumbaugh v. Dahlberg,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A05531 (Mar. 29, 2001) (concluding that 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10218, which mandates separation of all non-dual status military technicians who are eligible for an unreduced annuity, is a statutory exception to the ADEA); <span class="Italic">DiLuglio v. Perry,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01931715 (Aug. 22, 1994) ("The legislative history of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(d) demonstrates that Congress sought to create a special age entry rule--an exception to the ordinary prohibition <span id="Page_690"></span>against age-based discrimination under the ADEA--where a young work force was necessary due to the nature of the work, and where law enforcement officers would receive especially generous retirement benefits to offset a shorter work life.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the legislative history of Pub. L. No. 93-350, and the court's reliance on that history in <span class="Italic">Stewart</span> as support for its conclusion that the authority to set maximum entry age requirements for law enforcement positions was a tool Congress provided to federal agencies to control the age composition of their law enforcement workforce, there is little doubt that Congress enacted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(d) in recognition of the fact that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">these occupations should be composed, insofar as possible, of young men and women physically capable of meeting the vigorous demands of occupations which are far more taxing physically than most in the Federal Service. They are occupations calling for the strength and stamina of the young rather than the middle aged. Older employees in these occupations should be encouraged to retire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 93-948 (1974). Our reviewing court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, has also recognized that three of the most probative factors in assessing whether a position exists as a law enforcement position subject to the special retirement provisions are related to age, i.e., whether there is an early mandatory retirement age, whether there is a youthful maximum entry age, and whether the job is physically demanding so as to require a youthful workforce. <span class="Italic">Watson v. Department of the Navy,</span> 262 F.3d 1292, 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2001),<span class="Italic"> cert. denied,</span> 534 U.S. 1083 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, while the legislative history of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307(d) and the special retirement provisions for law enforcement officers clearly establishes Congress' concern with the age composition of federal agencies' law enforcement officers, it also establishes that Congress' primary concern was not age, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, but the effect that advancing age might have on the physical capabilities necessary to meet the vigorous demands of these positions. <span class="Italic">See Crowley v. United States,</span> 398 F.3d 1329, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (there are 2 major factors that should be considered in determining whether a position should be conferred law enforcement officer status: First, and predominant, is the physical vigorousness required by the position; if the position is found to be vigorous, then the second major factor necessary to establish law enforcement officer status--hazardousness--must be considered). The U.S. Supreme Court addressed the implications of this distinction in<span class="Italic"> Johnson v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore,</span> 472 U.S. 353 (1985). In <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> the city attempted to defend an ADEA claim, which challenged a municipal code provision that required firefighting personnel below the rank of lieutenant to retire at age 55, by asserting as an affirmative defense that age was a BFOQ for the position. The district court rejected the defense, concluding that the city had not shown that there was a factual basis to believe that all or substantially all of the firefighters above the retirement age would be unable to perform their jobs safely and efficiently nor that it was impossible or impractical to deal with the firefighters above the mandatory retirement age on an individualized basis. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 359.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the district court, holding that, because Congress had selected 55 as the retirement age for most federal firefighters, the same age constituted a BFOQ for all state and local firefighters as well, as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 360. In considering the case, the U.S. Supreme Court stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We must first resolve whether the age-55 retirement for federal firefighters reflects a congressional determination that age 55 is a BFOQ within the meaning of the ADEA, as the city urges, or whether Congress established the mandatory retirement age based on an analysis different from that mandated by the BFOQ standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 363. The Court first noted that neither the language of the ADEA nor the language of the mandatory retirement provision "reflect[ed] anything more than a congressional decision that federal firefighters must retire, as a general matter, at the age of 55." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Court further noted the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The history of the civil service provision, [i.e., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8335(b), the mandatory retirement provision for firefighters and law enforcement officers under the Civil Service Retirement System,] however, makes clear that the decision to retire certain federal employees at an early age was not based on BFOQs for the covered employment. This history demonstrates instead that Congress has acted to deal with the idiosyncratic problems of federal employees in the federal civil service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 363-64. The Court then described the history of the various federal statutes related to special retirement provisions for federal law enforcement officers, including a 1947 statute that permitted investigatory personnel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to retire at age 50 with an enhanced annuity, a 1948 statute that extended the program to anyone whose duties for at least 20 years were primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of persons suspected or convicted of federal crimes, a 1972 statute that extended the special retirement provisions to federal firefighters, and, finally, the 1974 statute which required these employees to retire at age 55 if they had completed 20 years of service. After setting out the history of the various retirement provisions applicable to federal law enforcement officers and firefighters, the Court stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Congress undoubtedly sought in significant part to maintain a youthful work force and took steps through the civil service retirement provisions to make early retirement both attractive and financially rewarding. However, neither the language of the 1974 amendment nor its legislative history offers any indication why Congress wanted to maintain the image of a "young man's service," or why Congress believed that older employees in fact could not meet the demands of these occupations. Indeed, Congressmen who opposed the bill voiced their concern for the singling out of one group of employees for preferential treatment through enhanced annuities and early retirement, and did not even acknowledge that the exigencies of the job might have anything to do with Congress' willingness to accord special treatment to a group of employees. Moreover, the allowance that firefighters who had not yet served for 20 years could remain in their jobs, along with other exceptions to the general rule of retirement casts serious doubt on any argument that Congress in fact believed that either the employee or the public would be jeopardized by the employment of older firefighters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The absence of any indication that Congress established the age limit based on the demands of the occupation raises the possibility that the federal rule is merely "an example of the sort of age stereotyping without factual basis that was one of the primary targets of the reforms of the ADEA," and surely belies any contention that the age limit is based on actual occupational qualifications. Without knowing whether Congress passed the statute based on factual support, legislative balancing of competing policy concerns, or stereotypical assumptions, we simply have no way to decipher whether it is consistent with the policies underlying the ADEA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 365-66 (citations and footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court also discussed Congress' treatment of the civil service mandatory retirement provisions when Congress extended the coverage of the ADEA to federal employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Instead of delaying the passage of the ADEA while those Committees studied the mandatory retirement provisions in light of the proposed ADEA, Congress decided to preserve the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> with respect to the retirement program, pending further study. This express purpose definitively rules out any conclusion that Congress approved the retirement programs in light of the ADEA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 367. The Court noted that, when the Subcommittee on Compensation and Employee Benefits of the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service held hearings on the retirement provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8335(b), the subcommittee considered a report from the General Accounting Office which found that "[r]etirement policies that disregard differences in physical abilities and productive capacity are costly and wasteful." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 368 n.11 (citing the Report to the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service by the Comptroller General of the United States: <span class="Italic">Special Retirement Policy for Federal Law Enforcement and Firefighter Personnel Needs Reevaluation</span>, at 10 (1977)). The Court also cited a report published by the House Select Committee on Aging which stated, "It is impossible to justify mandatory retirement or maximum hiring age policies based on arguments of public safety or job-related performance." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing Chairman, House Select Committee on Aging, <span class="Italic">The Myths and Realities of Age Limits for Law Enforcement and Firefighting Personnel</span>, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., IV (Comm.Print 1984)). In the end, the Court concluded as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In sum, almost four decades of legislative history establish that Congress at no time has indicated that the federal retirement age for federal firefighters is based on a determination that age 55 is a BFOQ within the meaning of the ADEA. Congress adopted what might well have been an arbitrarily designated retirement age in an era not concerned with the pervasive discrimination against the elderly that eventually gave rise to the ADEA. Thereafter, although Congress retained mandatory limitations in 1978, while questioning whether they continued to make good policy sense, it did so for the sake of expediency alone. On considering the language and history of the civil service provision, we find it quite possible that factors other than conclusive determinations of occupational qualifications might originally have led to the passage of this federal rule, and that the reason for its retention after 1978 further undercuts any argument that Congress has determined that age is a BFOQ for federal firefighters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the absence of an indication that Congress in fact grounded the age limit on occupational qualifications, we will not presume that it did so intend. The myriad political purposes for which Congress might properly make decisions affecting federal employees, and <span id="Page_691"></span>that body's uncontested authority to exempt federal employees from the requirements of federal regulatory statutes, simply do not permit the conclusion that Congress passed or retained this retirement provision because it reflects BFOQs. We therefore conclude that the civil service provision does not articulate a BFOQ for firefighters, that its presence in the United States Code is not relevant to the question of a BFOQ for firefighters, and that it would be error for a court, faced with a challenge under the ADEA to an age limit for firefighters, to give any weight, much less conclusive weight, to the federal retirement provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 369-70 (footnote omitted);<span class="Italic"> cf. Murgia,</span> 427 U.S. at 310 n.2 (although the Court found that a Massachusetts law that required uniformed state police officers to retire upon attaining age 50 rationally furthered the purpose of assuring the physical preparedness of the state police and therefore did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court noted that the appellee made no claim under the ADEA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the above discussion demonstrates, the U.S. Supreme Court, after reviewing the legislative history on which the agency in this case relies as support for its argument that age is essential to the performance of the duties of the position, rejected the notion that the legislative history of the mandatory retirement provision for federal law enforcement officers and firefighters indicated that Congress set the mandatory retirement age for such positions based on "the demands of these positions" or "actual occupational qualifications." <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> 472 U.S. at 365-66. Thus, in accordance with the decision in<span class="Italic"> Johnson,</span> we find that Congress did not establish the mandatory retirement age for federal law enforcement officers based on the demands of the positions or actual occupational qualifications. Because Congress did not set the mandatory retirement provisions for federal law enforcement officers based on the demands or occupational qualifications of these positions, we find that the mandatory retirement age is not essential to the performance of the duties of federal law enforcement officer positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit explained in <span class="Italic">Stewart,</span> the purpose for setting a maximum entry age for a position with a mandatory retirement age generally would be to enhance the retirement scheme by allowing persons entering the position to enjoy a full career prior to reaching the mandatory retirement age. <span class="Italic">Stewart,</span> 673 F.2d at 493. Thus, if the mandatory retirement age were essential to the performance of the duties of the position, it could be argued that a maximum entry age designed to allow an employee to enjoy a full career and still meet the requirements for an immediate annuity upon reaching the mandatory retirement age would also be essential to the performance of the duties of the position. However, where the mandatory retirement age is not itself essential to the performance of the duties of the position, an agency cannot rely on the fact that a maximum entry age will serve to effectuate the mandatory retirement age as support for the proposition that the maximum entry age is essential to the performance of the duties of the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence in this case indicates that Secretary of State Schultz approved the maximum entry age of less than 35 years of age, and Secretary of State Christopher approved the maximum entry age of less than 37 years of age, for the position of Diplomatic Security Service Special Agent based on the practice of other federal law enforcement agencies. However, as explained in the preceding paragraph, the practice of other federal agencies, i.e., the practice of establishing a maximum entry age for law enforcement officer positions based on the years of service necessary to qualify for the law enforcement officer enhanced annuity at the mandatory retirement age, is insufficient to establish that the maximum entry age is essential to the performance of the duties of the position. Because the record establishes that the maximum entry age for the position of Special Agent is not essential to the performance of the duties of the position, we find that the appellant established that the agency's failure to waive this age requirement violated the appellant's rights under statutes related to veterans' preference, specifically, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3312(a)(1) and 3320.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board determines that an agency has violated a preference eligible's rights under a statute related to veterans' preference, the VEOA provides that the Board shall order the agency to comply with the statute it violated, to award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual by reason of the violation, to award an amount equal to back pay as liquidated damages if the Board determines that the violation was willful, and to award reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c. In this case, the record does not establish whether the agency would have actually appointed the appellant to the position, even if it had properly waived the maximum entry age requirement and continued to process the appellant's application, because the record indicates that there still were several steps left in the appointment process the appellant would have had to successfully complete prior to his appointment at the time the agency terminated its consideration of the appellant's application. <span class="Italic">See supra,</span> &#x00B6; 11. In <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Army,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 18 (2006), the Board determined that the proper remedy where an agency violates a statute related to veterans' preference by denying an appellant the right to compete for a particular position is to order the agency to reconstruct the selection process. Accordingly, we find that the proper remedy with regard to the appellant's VEOA appeal is an order requiring the agency to waive the maximum entry age requirement on the appellant's behalf and to reconstruct the selection process, including affording the appellant any other advantage to which his status as a preference eligible might entitle him. <span class="Italic">E.g., see supra,</span> &#x00B6; 11 n.2.</p>
