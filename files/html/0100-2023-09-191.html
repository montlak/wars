<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-188"><span class="space">c.</span> Class Action</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Class actions usually begin an appeal by one or more appellants representing a large group of presently unidentified individuals with similar claims, for example, Robin Hood Doe on his own behalf and as representative of all employees subjected to RIF by the Department of Commerce in Washington during May 2000. Consolidated cases begin with an identified group of employees, e.g., Jane Doe, Manny, and Moe. The distinction is significant: a class action may provide protection to employees affected by an action, e.g., a RIF, who do not file individual appeals. Contrast consolidation, involving only those appeals actually filed by individuals. <span class="Italic">Bacon v. DHUD</span>, 20 MSPR 408 (1984). The Board discerned no error in the consolidated rather than class action treatment, even though some employees affected by the RIF did not file appeals. In <span class="Italic">Bacon</span>, the employees who filed appeals and whose appeals were consolidated suffered no harm. The problem was for those putative class members who did not file their own appeals. There are very few class actions and not many Board decisions addressing them.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's practice favors consolidation of appeals, e.g., the air traffic controller litigation. It is yet unclear to what extent class action treatment is acceptable in Board cases. The AJ has discretion to permit adjudication through a class action. <span class="Italic">Certain Former CSA Employees v. DHHS</span>, 762 F.2d 978, 985-86 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (consolidation would result in a more manageable proceeding and would assure the preservation of both the individual appellate records and individual rights as to noncommon issues: "The petitioners have not given any convincing reason why the Board's ruling was unwarranted. Indeed, in view of our decision on the merits of the case, it is difficult to see how the petitioners have been prejudiced by the Board's failure to convert their individual appeals into a class action. Even if the Board had provided for class action treatment in deciding the common issues, it still would have been necessary under the Board's decision to remand the case for separate hearings with respect to the individual petitioners."); <span class="Italic">Boudreaux v. Dept. of Army</span>, 82 MSPR 393, 397-98 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (1999) (no abuse of discretion in the denial of a class action treatment; the AJ determined that the numerosity and commonality requisites of a class appeal were not met); <span class="Italic">Bacon v. DHUD</span>, 20 MSPR 408, 416-17 (1984) (AJs are granted broad discretion as to class action orders; no prejudice was shown through a decision to consolidate rather than certify class action). Class action treatment was permitted, following the procedures outlined by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to address a legal issue involved in the administration of survivor annuity elections. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Timbers v. OPM</span>, 21 MSPR 129, 132 (1984). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Wassenaar v. OPM</span>, 55 MSPR 517 (1992), <span class="Italic">post.</span> A class action was also employed to challenge examination practices applied by OPM to candidates for ALJ positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Azdell v. OPM</span>, 87 MSPR 133, 144 &#x00B6; 14 (2000). If a case is filed as a class action by a representative of a class of employees under 5 CFR 1201.27 (2022), the agency should respond to the class appeal with reference to the class nature of the case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Board regulations for the processing of class appeals, 5 CFR 1201.27 (2022), state:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appeal</span>. One or more employees may file an appeal as representatives of a class of employees. The judge will hear the case as a class appeal if he or she finds that a class appeal is the fairest and most efficient way to adjudicate the appeal and that the representative of the parties will adequately protect the interests of all parties. When a class appeal is filed, the time from the filing date until the judge issues his or her decision under paragraph (b) of this section is not counted in computing the time limit for individual members of the potential class to file individual appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Procedure</span>. The judge will consider the appellant's request and any opposition to that request, and will issue an order within 30 days after the appeal is filed stating whether the appeal is to be heard as a class appeal. If the judge denies the request, the appellants affected by the decision may file individual appeals within 30 days after the date of receipt of the decision denying the request to be heard as a class appeal. Each individual appellant is responsible for either filing an individual appeal within the original time limit, or keeping informed of the status of a class appeal and, if the class appeal is denied, filing an individual appeal within the additional 35-day period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Standards</span>. In determining whether it is appropriate to treat an appeal as a class action, the judge will be guided but not controlled by the applicable provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Electronic filing</span>. A request to hear a case as a class appeal and any opposition thereto may not be filed in electronic form. Subsequent pleadings may be filed and served in electronic form, provided that the requirements of &#x00A7; 1201.14 are satisfied.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> includes guidance on the processing of class actions in Chapter 3:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">CLASS ACTIONS</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.27.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Initial Processing</span>. The initial processing of a class action appeal is identical to that of an individual appeal. The appeal is acknowledged and the file requested from the agency. However, the 3-workday time limit for issuing the acknowledgment order may be waived for efficiency in grouping appeals from potential class members. The agency must be asked specifically, either in a modification of the acknowledgment order or in a separate order, to respond to a request to have the appeal processed as a class action. The Board's e-filing system may not be used to file a request to hear a case as a class appeal or any opposition thereto. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(c)(1). Thus, any appeal filed electronically that requests class certification may be rejected, using the procedures noted above in chapter 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Standards</span>. The Board's regulations state that the AJ should be guided, but not controlled, by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in deciding whether to handle an appeal as a class action. However, it remains true that the class representative must be able to fairly and adequately protect the interest of the class without a conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Processing of Appeals Certified as a Class Action</span>. The procedures for individual appeals set forth in the Board's regulations and in this Handbook generally must be followed. However, the procedures, including time limits, may be modified as they are for mass consolidations. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and related case law should also be consulted for guidance concerning additional processing steps and requirements such as the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Identification of all members of the class.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Notification to all class members of the following: the AJ will remove the member from the class upon his or her request; a decision, favorable or not, will include all members who do not request exclusion; and any member of the class who does not request exclusion may participate in the proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;Notification to each class member of any hearing scheduled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;Notification to class members of the initial decision. The decision should describe the factors that render particular appellants members of the class, and should include information concerning the right of class members to seek individual relief where appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Multi-Region Class Action Appeals</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;When the CAJ identifies an appeal as a potential multi-region class action, he or she must immediately notify ORO. The CAJ must provide the name of the representative of the potential class, the approximate number in the class, and the agency's identity based on the evidence then available.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;A copy of the appeal, request for certification, and any other relevant document must be sent to ORO as expeditiously <span id="Page_1172"></span>as possible, by overnight mail if the day of ORO's receipt will be a workday, by fax, or a scanned copy by e-mail. As noted above, a request for class action status may not be e-filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;ORO will notify all RO's and direct that affected appeals be held in abeyance pending further notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;ORO will notify OCB, OGC, the Director of OAC, and the Chief Counsels to the Board of the pending action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(5)&#x2003;Cases may be assigned to the ALJ, an AJ, or the Board for ruling on a motion for certification of a class action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(6)&#x2003;Following a ruling, regions shall advise the parties of reassignment of cases and forward appeals to the designated AJs.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Beasley v. IRS</span>, 15 MSPR 16, 21-23, nn. 7-8 (1983), on interlocutory appeal, considered the class action appeal (treated as a motion for class certification) of employees disciplined for accepting unemployment compensation benefits while they were on the agency payroll. Before receiving the agency response to the appeal, the AJ determined the issue was not properly maintainable as a class action because of lack of numerosity and the possibility of conflicts among subclasses (employees who resigned, those suspended, those who were probationers). The AJ's action was premature; the agency had the right to respond before a ruling could be made. Discovery was appropriate on issues concerning class certification, and a hearing on certification issues might be necessary. A class of 46 was sufficiently numerous for a class action. There did not appear to be conflicts among potential subclasses; existence of potential subclasses did not defeat either commonality of issues as to the class or the appellants' ability to represent the class on those issues. Certification of the class was denied because issues of nexus and mitigation of penalties depended on assessment of each appellant's circumstances at the time the disciplinary actions were taken. Those issues required evidence so particularized for each appellant that the issues could not be presented for class treatment as common issues of fact within the meaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Class action treatment was denied in <span class="Italic">Wassenaar v. OPM</span>, 55 MSPR 517, 521-23 (1992), involving a challenge to OPM's method of computing law enforcement retirement survivors' annuities. The putative class members could not be included because they had not yet exhausted the reconsideration procedures administered by OPM, that is, they had not exhausted their administrative remedies. Citing <span class="Italic">Bowen v. City of New York</span>, 476 U.S. 467, 483-86 (1986) (an adjudicator can certify a class if the adjudicator waives exhaustion requirements), <span class="Italic">Wassenaar</span> examined the requisites for waiver, including (a) the challenge to the legality of the OPM determination would be collateral to the claims for individual benefits; (b) absent members of the class would be irreparably injured if exhaustion was required; or (c) exhaustion would be futile. In <span class="Italic">Wassenaar</span>, the challenge was not collateral to individual claims because by seeking monetary relief, it went beyond an attempt to secure a determination that the OPM statutory interpretation was wrong. There was no basis to determine that members of the class would be irreparably harmed if the exhaustion requirement was not waived; the members could secure individual and retroactive relief through the administrative process. As to futility, although there was no reason to believe that OPM would vary its statutory interpretation, alternative bases might be employed by OPM to resolve claims; OPM should be permitted to apply its special expertise and to make findings of fact that the Board would later apply. <span class="italic">Kluge v. DHS</span>, 60 F.4th 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2023), affirmed the Board's denial of class action status for employees seeking military differential pay under 5 USC 5538. The court evaluated the issue of class-wide treatment under FRCP 23 and determined that the sought-after class lacked commonality, and that efficiency did not dictate class treatment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The risk in filing a class action is the possibility that some individuals will rely to their detriment on protection by the class appeal and then fail to file their own timely appeals if the class action is disallowed. The problem of detrimental reliance by potential class members was recognized in <span class="Italic">Former CSA Employees v. DHHS</span>, 10 MSPR 235 (1982), denying class action status, granting "limited consolidation," and requiring the agency to notify all former CSA employees of their status and to advise them of their right to appeal to the Board within 20 days from their receipt of the agency notice. Responsibility for prosecuting an appeal remains with the employee involved in a class action. <span class="Italic">Stevenson v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 15 MSPR 221, 222-23 (1983), not a class action, but described as "700-800 employees who filed 'unsigned' appeals with the Board challenging the agency's RIF actions," dismissed as untimely the RIF appeals of some employees whose unsigned appeals were submitted by a labor union. The employees were advised of the correct procedure for filing appeals. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-09-017.html#sec2-18">Indefinite Suspension; Enforced Leave</a>," for discussion concerning appellants who await the outcome of related cases.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Allman v. DHUD</span>, 21 MSPR 531, 532 (1984), implied that if an appeal is filed as a class action and the motion for class certification is denied, the time for individuals other than the class representatives (named appellants) to file appeals is tolled by the amount of time that remains from the date the original class appeal was filed to the last day that the appeal could have been filed. <span class="Italic">Cheeseman v. OPM</span>, 21 MSPR 118, 127 (1984), provided a more generous approach:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]t would...be inequitable to foreclose an individual who failed to file a timely appeal because he or she believed that the matter was already on appeal as a result of the class action certification. Nevertheless, we reject appellants' assertion that the Board should require OPM to provide all members of the class an opportunity to show that they can meet their burden. Instead, we hold that a determination of an appellant's diligence must be made on an individual basis in those cases in which it is an issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Case law is modified by the regulation, quoted above, setting 35 days as the period for filing individual appeals after class status is denied, although the regulation leaves it to individuals to determine for themselves the status of the class action and, more significantly, the denial of class certification. For the class to protect itself, it must have knowledge of the Board proceedings. "[N]othing in statute, regulation, or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires an administrative judge to notify putative members of the class of the denial of class certification." <span class="Italic">Patrick v. USDA</span>, 72 MSPR 509, 517, 518 (1996) (affirming an AJ's determination assessing appeals from allegedly involuntary retirements that "questions of reliance do not lend themselves to class treatment"). The Board provided some protection for potential class members in an appeal that apparently specifically identified class members<span class="Italic">.</span> In <span class="Italic">Scott v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 71 MSPR 42, 45 (1996), involving a putative class of employees seeking the classification of law enforcement officers for early retirement determinations, class action status was denied by the AJ. On a PFR the Board directed the AJ to docket a separate appeal for each appellant identified in the initial class appeal if the AJ continued to deny class action status.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The problems concerning the limited tolling effects of a class action, at least under prior Board regulations, were illustrated by <span class="Italic">Turner v. MSPB</span>, 806 F.2d 241, 245 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Some employees, on whose behalf class representatives attempted to pursue a class action involving a RIF and transfer of function, were notified that the class action would not be entertained. They were advised by their employer's successor that they could file individual Board appeals within 20 days. They missed the deadline by three years and argued the delay was justified because they were awaiting exhaustion of all avenues for reviewing the Board's decision not to entertain a class action. The Federal Circuit did not accept their contention:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although the petitioners may believe that it would have been better Board practice to defer the filing of individual appeals until this court determined the class action certification issue, that was a decision for the Board and not for the petitioners to make.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[E]ven assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the petitioners' time for appeal was tolled until this court in <span class="Italic">Former CSA Employees</span> affirmed the Board's denial of class action certification, that would not aid the petitioners. They did not even file their appeals within 20 days of that decision, although the union had warned at least one of them to do so. Instead, Turner waited more than two months and Mickens and Ashe waited almost six months before filing their individual appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only excuse they offer for this delay is the contention that the time for appeal was tolled until the time for seeking Supreme Court review had expired. The likelihood of Supreme Court review and reversal of our decision is too remote and speculative to warrant the additional extension of any tolling period that the petitioners seek.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board is not inclined to permit individuals to file Board appeals based on EEO class action status without an affirmative demonstration that they purposefully delayed initiating an MSPB appeal while they awaited the outcome of the EEO class case. The Board announced a constructive "opt-in" procedure in <span class="Italic">Carey v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/CAREY_MARY_A_DE_0351_05_0341_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_247793.pdf">103 MSPR 534</a>, 539 &#x00B6; 13, 2006 MSPB 295 (2006) ("We hold that the filing of a timely class complaint of discrimination at the agency level extends the time for filing a Board appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b) if the appellant was a member of the class, intended to challenge the personnel action covered by the class complaint, and deliberately delayed filing a Board appeal based on a good faith belief that his or her rights were being pursued on a class basis at the agency level.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming that a case is appropriate for class action treatment, the Board apparently approves of the practice of having the AJ notify potential members of the class of the opportunity to present evidence or argument concerning their inclusion in the class and their right to notify the Board of their decision to opt out of the class and pursue individual appeals. The AJ's order will provide a cutoff date for responses. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jude v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 5, 7 (1991) (class appeal concerning the implementation of a compensation program causing the appellants to be reduced in pay).</p>
