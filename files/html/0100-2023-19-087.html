<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-83"><span class="space">a.</span> Lifting Requirements</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Disability discrimination was found on appeal to the EEOC after an agency fired an employee rather than permitting him to handle job responsibilities other than lifting more than 70 pounds. The agency failed to offer reasonable accommodation. Lifting was not an absolute requirement of the job. <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. USPS</span>, 18 MSPR 525, 528 (1984) ("There is ample evidence of an agency practice permitting other employees with lifting restrictions, including pregnant women, to be placed in the mail handler position at any time on a temporary basis"; "[E]ven if the 70-pound lifting requirement were shown to be necessary, there is no evidence that the agency ever considered modifying or restructuring appellant's position, a means of reasonable accommodation[.] ").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Clark v. DLA</span>, 36 MSPR 162, 166-68 (1988), analyzed as a defense to a removal based on physical inability to perform a job the contention that the agency was required to accommodate the employee by reducing his weight-lifting requirement to 25 pounds:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the Navy,</span> 36 MSPR 148, 152 (1988) the Board stated that the elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case generally include (1) a showing that the appellant is a handicapped person under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a) and that the action appealed to the Board was based on his handicap; and (2) to the extent possible, articulation of a reasonable accommodation under which the appellant believes he could perform the essential duties of his position or of a vacant position to which he could be reassigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in <span class="Italic">Savage,</span> at 152-53, the Board stated that the agency may rebut a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by articulating a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action. Such a reason may be a showing that the action was not based on the appellant's handicap, or a showing that the appellant is not a qualified handicapped person by, for example, establishing that accommodating the appellant would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the agency in question. Factors to be considered in determining whether a proposed accommodation would impose an undue hardship include: (1) The overall size of the agency's program with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities and size of budget; (2) the type of agency operation, including the composition and structure of the agency's work force; and (3) the nature and the cost of the accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the case at hand, the appellant established that he has a physical impairment which substantially limits the major life activity of work, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a), and that the agency removed him because of that impairment. Further he articulated a reasonable accommodation, a weight lifting requirement reduced to twenty-five pounds, under which he could perform the essential duties of the positions of Motor Vehicle Operator and Preservation Packer, two of the positions that the agency considered for restructuring. Thus, he made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's rebuttal to the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is limited to a broad contention that accommodation in these two positions would be an undue hardship because it needs all employees to be able to perform the full range of duties, including lifting weight in excess of twenty-five pounds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's assertion that it can never accommodate a qualified handicapped employee in these particular job categories through modification of weight lifting requirements, whether essential or not, does not constitute articulation of a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions and is insufficient to show undue hardship. Acceptance of this assertion would allow the agency to circumvent its regulatory responsibility to handicapped employees, who satisfy their evidentiary burden of identifying a vacant position to which they could be reassigned, by a blanket refusal even to consider what <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> requires. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704(c) The agency has offered no specific evidence supporting this bald assertion. Nor has the agency submitted specific evidence to show that budgetary restrictions prevent the accommodation in the two positions identified by the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Robinson v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy,</span> 36 MSPR 156 (1988). Thus, the Board finds that the agency did not articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions and therefore failed to rebut the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Caseres v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 642, 645 (1997), pointed out the need for agencies to develop a proper evidentiary basis for an assertion that accommodation for lifting requirements is an undue hardship:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant must also demonstrate that he is a qualified disabled person, i.e., that he can perform the essential duties of his position with or without reasonable accommodation. If accommodation is required, he must articulate a reasonable accommodation under which he believes he could perform the necessary duties of his position or a vacant position to which he could be assigned without endangering his own safety and health or that of others. <span class="Italic">See Gray</span> at 147-48. The appellant asserted that if he were allowed to use a lumbosacral corset and a cart to deliver mail and if he could minimize lifting, pushing, and pulling heavy objects, he would be able to perform his duties as a postal carrier. The weight of the medical evidence in the record supports the appellant's assertion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency asserts that the administrative judge did not properly consider its contention regarding the undue hardship on the efficiency and economy of the agency if the appellant were accommodated. Although one of the agency's officials testified that he believed that an employee would have to be hired to work with the appellant to do any necessary lifting and loading of mail and parcels, this assertion was not otherwise substantiated. Moreover, in light of the administrative judge's proper finding concerning the appellant's ability to perform his duties, the record does not support a finding that he would need assistance, other than the use of a lumbosacral corset and a cart, to perform his duties or that this accommodation would be inefficient or cause undue hardship to the agency. The administrative judge therefore properly determined that the agency offered no legitimate justification for its failure to provide reasonable accommodation to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Hall v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 626, 630 n.2 (1988), the appellant's medical condition precluded his continued service as a truck driver, yet the appellant maintained that he should be assigned to a clerk position that he would be able to perform if the lifting requirements for that position were reduced. The Board concluded that because the agency did not consider restructuring of the clerk position to reduce the lifting requirement, the agency did not rebut the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">Hall</span> also implied that the duty of an agency to consider reassignment of an employee exists irrespective of its advice to the employee to seek a transfer to another position, particularly if the positions available through merit promotion application could not be performed without restructuring of the jobs.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As reasonable accommodation, an agency was required to offer retention in the position of tool and parts attendant, a job requiring some lifting of heavy objects, when the accommodation needed was assistance from other employees. The accommodation also required agency tolerance for brief absences of the appellant to obtain assistance from other employees. It was not necessary for the employee to perform the lifting requirements of his job. There was no evidence that the accommodation would impair the safe operation of agency functions. <span class="Italic">Royal v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 21 MSPR 609, 611 (1984). But assistance from other employees may be impractical and, therefore, not a required accommodation, as in <span class="Italic">Moon v. Dept. of Army</span>, 63 MSPR 412, 422 (1994), involving a disabled electronics technician whose medical restrictions severely limited the weight of objects she could handle:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends on review that there was sufficient work on small items to occupy her full-time. She asserts that there are 21 full-time Engineering Technicians, and that 5 to 7 percent of their workload would translate to 42 to 58 hours per week spent on small items. The AJ found, however, that the appellant's calculation assumes that each unit requires the same amount of time regardless of its size, and that the evidence shows that the time required to complete work on each item varies. Moreover, the number of light-weight units available at any given time is not evenly distributed throughout the year and sometimes there are no lightweight units available and, thus, no work to be performed on them. An agency official also testified that providing a person to assist the appellant in lifting heavier items would effectively require the agency to hire another person to stand by the appellant nearly full-time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Except for the possibility of restructuring the appellant's work environment, her suggested accommodation would require the agency to rewrite her position description, creating a new and distinct position consisting only of work on smaller items. However, as the administrative judge found, the agency is not required to create a new position in order to accommodate an employee's handicap. <span class="Italic">See Bolstein v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 55 MSPR 459, 464 (1992) (an agency is not required to provide an accommodation that would result in a substantial modification of job requirements); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 46 MSPR 506, 509 (1990). Thus, the administrative judge correctly determined that the appellant failed to show that she is a qualified handicapped employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the appellant were a qualified handicapped employee, however, the administrative judge found that the agency has been operating under a hiring freeze and undergoing a reduction in personnel for some time. On consideration of these factors, we concur in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's suggested reasonable accommodation would place an undue hardship on the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Simpson v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 346, 351-54 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-18, 2010 MSPB 43 (2010), a mail processing clerk had a back condition and other medical problems that allowed him to perform window sales duties with a 20 pound limit on lifting and a restriction that he not stand for more than an hour. He left work for about a year because of the medical problems and sought to return to work with a 10 pound lifting restriction, a limit of 15 minutes on standing, and a restriction on his ability to engage in customer contact. The employee <span id="Page_3482"></span>was removed for being on LWOP in excess of a year, in accordance with the Postal Service Employee and Labor Relations Manual. He was an individual with a disability, but the agency was not required to accommodate that disability because it lacked work that was within his restrictions and because he failed to participate in the interactive process to determine an appropriate accommodation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ADAAA did not change the statutory provision regarding reasonable accommodation relevant herein. Pub. L. No. 110-325, &#x00A7; 6(h). An agency must provide reasonable accommodation to the known limitations of a qualified individual with a disability unless to do so would create an undue hardship. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 12112(a), (b)(5)(A); <span class="Italic">Paris v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 11 (2006); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9. A qualified individual with a disability is a person with the skills, training and experience to perform the essential functions of a position, with or without reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(8); <span class="Italic">Paris</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 11; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The ID stated that to be a qualified individual with a disability, an individual was required to show that he could perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering his health and safety or that of others, citing 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(6). However, the health and safety showing is no longer part of the definition of a qualified individual with a disability and, thus, is not part of the appellant's burden of proof. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(8); <span class="Italic">Paris,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 11; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). Rather, under ADA standards, an agency may defend against a claim of discrimination by asserting that an individual poses a direct threat[6] to the health or safety of himself or others in the workplace. <span class="Italic">Cano v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 284, &#x00B6; 14 (2007); <span class="Italic">Boots v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 500, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2007); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.15(b)(2). This situation may arise, e.g., where an agency asserts that an individual fails to meet the medical standards established for a position. <span class="Italic">See Boots,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 500, &#x00B6; 2; <span class="Italic">McAlexander v. Department of Defense,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 384, &#x00B6; 2 (2007). In this case, however, the agency did not assert or show that the appellant failed to meet a medical or other qualification standard because he was a direct threat to the health or safety of himself or others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Direct threat means a significant risk of substantial harm to health or safety that cannot be reduced by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). An employer may require, as a qualification standard, that an individual not pose a direct threat to himself or others. Appendix to 29 C.F.R. part 1630, discussing 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant did not show that he was denied reasonable accommodation.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency constructively suspends an employee when it fails to return the employee to work within his medical restrictions, when he requests it, for more than 14 days, where it is bound to do so by policy, regulation, or the accommodation obligation under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Mills v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant made a reasonable accommodation request when he asked to return to work within his medical restrictions. <span class="Italic">See Paris</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 17 (an employee need only let his employer know in general terms that he needs accommodation for a medical condition); <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act,</span> <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada">www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html</a> [now at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada</a>], at 5 (to make an accommodation request, an individual need only let the employer know that he needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition and need not use the words "reasonable accommodation"). Having done so, the agency was required to engage in an interactive process to determine an appropriate accommodation. <span class="Italic">Paris</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 17; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(3); <span class="Italic">see also EEOC Enforcement Guidance</span> at 6. The appellant, however, was also required to cooperate in the interactive process. "Both parties...have an obligation to assist in the search for an appropriate accommodation, and both have an obligation to act in good faith in doing so." <span class="Italic">Collins</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 332, &#x00B6; 11 (citing <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Phoenixville School District</span>, 184 F.3d 296, 312 (3rd Cir. 1999)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service requires return to work medical clearance for absences due to an illness or injury when it has reasonable belief that the employee may not be able to perform the essential functions of his position or may pose a direct threat to the health or safety of himself or others. Thus, when the appellant first sought to return to work, the agency sought updated information about his orthopedic conditions as well as other conditions mentioned in his medical documentation (depression, hypertension, bilateral carpel tunnel syndrome and sleep apnea) to determine if he could return to work in his prior position. The agency also repeatedly sought medical clearance for other conditions noted in his documentation--Alzheimer's symptoms, gastric bypass and, again, sleep apnea to no avail. The appellant, however, failed to clearly respond to the agency's requests. In addition, at no time from when the appellant requested to return to duty until he was removed did he explain how he could perform his prior Modified Mail Processing Clerk position with additional restrictions, nor did he suggest any position whose essential functions he could have performed with or without accommodation. Conversely, the deciding official on the appellant's removal, Postmaster Joel Smith, testified that he looked for a position for the appellant in each of the five facilities under his jurisdiction but there was no work within the appellant's limitations. HCD (testimony of Smith).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we conclude that the evidence shows the agency engaged in good faith in the required interactive process to determine an accommodation, but that the appellant was not responsive to the agency's requests for medical information and never articulated a reasonable accommodation, including identifying any position to which he could have been reassigned. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant did not prove that he was denied reasonable accommodation and, accordingly, did not show that the agency constructively suspended or unlawfully removed him. <span class="Italic">See Taylor,</span> 184 F.3d at 317 ("an employer cannot be faulted if after conferring with the employee to find possible accommodations, the employee then fails to supply information that the employer needs"); <span class="Italic">Beck v.
