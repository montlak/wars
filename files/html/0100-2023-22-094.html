<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-94"><span class="space">3.</span> Civil Rights Case</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">42 USC 2000e-16(c) (and the provisions it incorporates, 42 USC 2000e-16(d) and 42 USC 2000e-5(k), and its relative, the Rehabilitation Act), provide independent authorization for counsel fees. The tests for recovery are simpler than the Board's complex formulations under the Back Pay Act and 5 USC 7701(g). Fee recoveries under the Civil Rights Acts can be considerably greater than under the Reform Act. The CSRA essentially allows for the rate set by a retainer agreement, and fees are earned at the rate prevailing under that agreement for the year that services are performed. With civil rights cases, recoveries may, in some courts, be at current hourly rates for work done in prior years (when retainer agreements might set a lower rate), and rates may be adjusted to generous proportions under the so-called <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.</span>, 572 F. Supp. 354, 371 (D.D.C. 1983). The fees awarded under the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix for DC Metro practitioners are at the Justice Department's website, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/page/file/1189846/download">https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/page/file/1189846/download</a> [now referred to as the <span class="Italic">Fitzpatrick Matrix</span>]. For a practitioner of more than 31 years experience (think here of an author of this text), the 2021 <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rate is $736 per hour. Nice work if you can get it. Some courts operate on variations of the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix. Decisions must be researched to determine how a particular court will set hourly rates in a civil rights case. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-22-152.html#sec15-151"><span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A finding of discrimination or reprisal establishes fee entitlement; no showing that the fee award is in the interest of justice is required. <span class="Italic">Key v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 142, 147-48 (1987). For a discussion of the Board's power to award fees in pre-Reform Act cases leading to Board findings of discrimination, refer to <span class="Italic">West v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 24 MSPR 99, 102-03 (1984). Recovery of costs under the Civil Rights Acts is more encompassing than under the Reform Act [discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-22-170.html#sec15-168">Costs and Expenses</a>"]. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Key</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Chin v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 55 MSPR 84, 86 (1992) (plaintiff entitled to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses for copying, postage, mailing, and faxing incurred in successful litigation of discrimination claim).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The mixed cases taken into federal district court will apparently sustain fee recovery under Title VII rather than under 5 USC 7701(g), even as to the claims adjudicated in court that involve civil service rather than civil rights issues. This is because mixed cases must be taken into district court under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wood v. Regan</span>, 38 FEP Cases 1480, 622 F. Supp. 399 (E.D. Pa. 1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 800 F.2d 1142 (3d Cir. 1986). On the subject of judicial review of fee awards under the Civil Rights Acts, if the appellant prevails on a discrimination claim (even if, on appeal to EEOC, the Commission finds discrimination and the Board then accepts the Commission's findings), an ensuing counsel fee award is reviewable by a district court because the "attorney fee phase of a meritorious discrimination case is part and parcel of the claim on the merits." <span class="Italic">Kean v. Stone</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/19911202926f2d27611159">926 F.2d 276</a>, 287 (3rd Cir. 1991).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kelly v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 430, 433 (1990), discussed distinctions between fee awards based on the CSRA and the Civil Rights Acts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases in which prohibited discrimination under 5 USC 2302(b)(1) has been found, the Board has authority under 5 USC 7701(g)(2) to award fees in accordance with the broader standards prescribed under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC 2000e-5(k)....&#8197;This broader standard applies to cases in which the Board has found discrimination on the bases set out at 5 USC 2302(b)(1), including race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicapping condition. It is also applicable to cases of reprisal for protected EEO activities....&#8197;In the initial decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant had established that the agency's action resulted, in part, from reprisal based on the appellant's having filed EEO complaints....&#8197;We find, therefore, that fees should be awarded under 5 USC 7701(g)(2), that the appellant need not establish that an award of fees is otherwise warranted in the interest of justice....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Revising earlier law, <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 103, 112-14 (1991), declared as to the rate for fees awarded following settlement of a mixed case appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 7701(g)(2), prevailing appellants--including those who are not entitled to a fee award under 5 USC 7701(g)(1)--are entitled to a fee award if "the decision is based on a finding of discrimination...." The Board has held that, in an appeal settled without a decision on the merits, and in the absence of a term in the settlement agreement disposing of the issue of attorney fees, a prevailing appellant is entitled to a fee award under section 7701(g)(2) if he asserted facts that, if proven, could form a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination....&#8197;For the reasons stated below, we hereby modify this holding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The plain language of section 7701(g)(2) indicates that a fee award under that section would not be appropriate in the absence of a finding of discrimination. In <span class="Italic">McGovern v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 42 MSPR 399 (1989), the decision in which the standard applied in <span class="Italic">D'Iorio</span> and <span class="Italic">Futrell</span> was first articulated, the Board appeared to concede that this was "the seeming import" of section 7701(g)(2). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 403. In concluding that no such finding was required for a fee award under that section, the Board relied on the section's legislative history, which it described as "somewhat ambiguous," and on its belief that a contrary holding "would encourage future potential appellants to bypass the Board and to seek their remedies in the Equal Employment <span id="Page_4631"></span>Opportunity Commission or in Federal district court." <span class="Italic">McGovern</span>, 42 MSPR at 403-05. For the reasons stated below, we hold here that these reasons cannot override the plain language of the section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we note that the legislative history that was characterized in <span class="Italic">McGovern</span> as ambiguous consisted of the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[S]tatutory law already provides for the award of attorney fees whenever a party in a discrimination suit prevails. [Subsection 7701(g)(2)] preserves the right of the Board to award fees under this different standard <span class="Italic">whenever it finds the employee's rights under laws prohibiting discrimination have been violated</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1272, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 63 (1978). The Board stated in <span class="Italic">McGovern</span> that, although this language "could be construed to make an explicit finding of discrimination the <span class="Italic">sine qua non</span> for use of the Title VII standard, it [was] equally amenable to the conclusion that Congress merely meant to distinguish mixed cases from nonmixed cases." We do not regard this language as ambiguous, however. Instead, we find that the reference to a "find[ing that] the employee's rights under laws prohibiting discrimination have been violated" offers strong support for the view that fees may not be awarded under section 7701(g)(2) in the absence of a finding of discrimination (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we do not believe that the Board's interpretation of the section at issue should be influenced by a fear that a contrary interpretation will encourage potential appellants to avoid Board review of their cases. People choosing a forum probably are likely to be concerned more with their chances of success on the merits of their cases than with the standard under which any fee award motions they ultimately may file will be considered. The <span class="Italic">McGovern</span> holding therefore seems unlikely to affect a potential appellant's choice of forum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that the standard articulated in <span class="Italic">McGovern</span> was intended to avoid "the potential for abuse if any allegation of discrimination, no matter how frivolous, were to be considered sufficient to invoke the more liberal standard for an award of attorney fees under section 7701(g)(2)." <span class="Italic">McGovern</span>, 42 MSPR at 405. We see no indication, however, that the standard has had--or will have--the effect of reducing the potential for abuse. On the contrary, the standard fails to make any distinction between allegations of discrimination that have none. Instead, it benefits those appellants who phrase their pleadings in a manner that meets the standard, regardless of the unavailability of substantiating evidence, and it penalizes other appellants, even if, in the absence of the settlement, they could have proved discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we hold that section 7701(g)(2) governs attorney fee awards only in appeals in which there has been a finding of discrimination prohibited by 5 USC 2302(b)(1) (footnote omitted). In this case, because there has been no such finding in connection with the appellant's removal or placement on enforced leave, the appellant has not shown his entitlement to a fee award under that section in connection with either appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1989 the Board decided <span class="Italic">McGovern v. EEOC</span>, 42 MSPR 399 (1989), determining that the more liberal counsel fee provisions of the civil rights statutes would be applied to appellants prevailing in mixed cases even without a finding of discrimination, e.g., when an individual prevailed on a nondiscrimination theory in an appeal prosecuted as a mixed case. To avoid the prospect of every appeal being filed with EEO allegations, the Board set a standard for the application of the fee provisions of 7701(g)(2), relying on <span class="Italic">Wood v. Regan</span>, 622 F. Supp. 399 (E.D. Pa. 1985). Under <span class="Italic">McGovern</span>, 42 MSPR at 405-06:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he question to be answered is whether the appellant's pleadings, supplemented, if necessary, by the record as it existed at the time of the Board's decision on the merits, disclose facts which, if proven, could form a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. Even if the facts are disputed by the agency, the appellant's version must be accepted for the purpose of determining whether the allegation, if proven, would support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">McGovern</span> result was explained in <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 45 MSPR 475, 479-80 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board held that 7701(g)(2) governs if the appellant's pleadings, supplemented, if necessary, by the record as it existed at the time of the Board's decision on the merits, disclose facts that, if proven, could form a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. The Board held further that, even if the facts alleged by the appellant are disputed by the agency, the appellant's version must be accepted for the purpose of determining whether the allegation, if proven, would support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McGovern</span> was extended to cases that were settled. The Board would examine the appellant's allegations to determine whether, if proven, those allegations would establish discrimination. The fact that the agency disputed the EEO claim was immaterial. The appellant's version was to be accepted for the purpose of determining whether the allegations, if established, would support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> claim. <span class="Italic">D'Iorio v. DHUD</span>, 43 MSPR 531, 535 (1990) (disability discrimination allegation: "[a]ppellant's factual assertions, if proven, would establish a <span class="Italic">prima</span> <span class="Italic">facie</span> case of discrimination[.] "); <span class="Italic">Futrell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 19, 23-24 &#x0026; n.6 (1989) ("We find that one could infer from the appellant's allegations in this regard, if proven, that with respect to these positions, he was a qualified handicapped employee whose condition the agency failed to accommodate"; "[E]ven if the facts are disputed by the agency, the appellant's version must be accepted for the purpose of determining whether the allegations, if proven, would support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> claim.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Counsel fees were allowed in <span class="Italic">Schroeder v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 606, 609-10 (1990), on analysis of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case based on allegations in a disability discrimination case that was settled:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination, an appellant generally must: (1) Show that he is a "handicapped person" under 29 CFR 1613.702(a) (footnote omitted) and that the action appealed to the Board was based on his handicap; and (2) to the extent possible, articulate a "reasonable accommodation" under which he believes he could perform the essential duties of his position or of a vacant position to which he could be reassigned....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant has made factual assertions that, if proven, would form a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. He has shown that he is a handicapped person and that his removal was explicitly based on his resulting inability to perform the duties of his position. Furthermore, by requesting that the agency reassign him to either of two specific positions that he asserts he could perform and that were available, he has articulated methods by which he believes the agency could reasonably accommodate his handicap.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1990, apparently realizing that counsel would claim discrimination in every case to boost rates, the Board shifted its emphasis from allegations to proof of discrimination. It decided that if an appeal before the Board settled, the appellant who asserted facts that, if proved, could form a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of prohibited discrimination, and who prevailed as a result of the settlement of his appeal, was entitled to an award of attorney fees in accordance with the civil rights standard of 5 USC 7701(g)(2) if no term in the settlement agreement otherwise disposed of the discrimination issue. The Board went on in <span class="Italic">Lokos v. EEOC</span>, 44 MSPR 115, 122 (1990), to describe the elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is defined as that showing which, unless affirmatively disproved by some contrary evidence, will stand independently as legally sufficient to prove a charge or defense (citations omitted). In order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination with respect to an adverse action, an employee must show that: (1) He is a member of a protected class; (2) he was the object of an adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal relationship between his membership in the protected class and the adverse action that he suffered....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Commenting in <span class="Italic">Lokos</span> about the information provided in the appellant's petition for appeal, the Board essentially entered into analysis of evidence rather than allegations and discounted information concerning the statistics of the office makeup and anecdotal evidence of remarks of a racial nature, 44 MSPR at 122-23:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that these statistics, without more, are not sufficiently significant to establish a causal connection between the appellant's race and age and the adverse action taken against him, and thus to constitute a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race and age discrimination....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant indicated in his petition for appeal that witnesses had informed him and others that racially disparaging remarks were made about whites by the deciding official and that the deciding official had expressed a desire to rid his office of white, male attorneys.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Absent any indication of precisely what these remarks were, where, when and to whom they were made, and whether and how they affected the specific adverse action taken against the appellant, we cannot find that the appellant's speculative and general assertions, even if taken as true, form a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case sufficient to support a finding that his race was causally connected to the adverse action against him....&#8197;Moreover, as we noted above, the charges and specifications against the appellant, had they been sustained, would have been sufficient to support a removal action, and there is no showing of pretext on the part of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant contends that he was treated disparately from several other attorneys who, he alleges, engaged in an outside practice of law...yet were never disciplined, despite the fact that the Regional Attorney had knowledge of that misconduct. We find that the appellant's assertions in this regard are too conclusory and vague to constitute a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination on the basis of disparate treatment....&#8197;While the Board must accept the appellant's version of the facts as accurate for purposes of evaluating his allegations of discrimination...we need not accept the appellant's legal conclusion that the other attorneys' alleged outside practices were technically in violation of the relevant regulations. In any event, even if we accept as true the appellant's assertion that others were violating regulations prohibiting outside legal work, the appellant has not shown that such misconduct was sufficiently similar to that with which he was originally charged...to support an allegation of prohibited disparate treatment....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">From <span class="Italic">Lokos</span> and factual analysis, the Board moved to the 1991 <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> decision, <span id="Page_4632"></span><span class="Italic">supra</span>, calling for factual findings to justify the higher rates permitted in mixed cases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Burch v. DHS</span>, 109 MSPR 426, 427-432 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-18, 2008 MSPB 185 (2008), resolved the tangled question of entitlement to fees on a finding of reprisal for filing an age discrimination complaint. Although EEOC's position is that fees cannot be awarded for time spent in administrative proceedings under the ADEA, the Board took a different approach and awarded fees under the authority of the provisions of the Reform Act prohibiting retaliation for the exercise of statutorily protected rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), the Board may require an agency to pay reasonable attorney fees when those fees have been incurred by an employee who is the prevailing party in a Board appeal and when a fee award is warranted in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 420, 426 (1980). That section provides further that an award is warranted in the interest of justice in "any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge in this case found that the appellant was the prevailing party in his removal appeal, and that he had incurred attorney fees in pursuing that appeal. She also found that the agency had engaged in a prohibited personnel practice by retaliating against the appellant for exercising his right to file a complaint of age discrimination, and she accordingly concluded that an attorney fee award was warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency does not challenge the administrative judge's findings that the appellant was the prevailing party and that he incurred attorney fees in pursuing his appeal. It argues, however, that, according to a court decision issued 17 days after the administrative judge issued her initial decision on the merits of the appellant's appeal, the Board lacks the authority to adjudicate a federal employee's claim of retaliation for filing an age discrimination complaint, and that a finding on such a claim therefore cannot serve as the basis for an attorney fee award. Specifically, it notes that the appellant's complaint of age discrimination was filed under authority of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA); it refers to 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a as "the statutory provision which made the ADEA applicable to federal employees"; and it states that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held in <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez v. Potter,</span> 476 F.3d 54, 57-60 (1st Cir. 2007), <span class="Italic">rev'd,</span> 128 S. Ct. 1931 (2008), that Congress did not intend to provide, in that statutory section, for a cause of action for retaliation for filing an age discrimination complaint. In the absence of any authority to consider a claim of such retaliation, the agency argues, the administrative judge erred in making the finding that formed the basis for her attorney fee award, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, her finding that the agency had committed a prohibited personnel practice by retaliating against the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note first that the U.S. Supreme Court granted a petition for a writ of <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez,</span> and that, after the agency had filed its petition for review in the case now before us, the Court reversed the First Circuit decision on which the agency relies. <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez,</span> 128 S. Ct. at 1935. In its decision, the Court held that 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a prohibits retaliation against a federal employee for filing an age discrimination complaint. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1943.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perhaps more important under the circumstances present here, the Board has a separate statutory basis for its consideration of reprisal claims such as that raised by the appellant in this case. The provision at issue in <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez,</span> i.e., 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a, is the statutory basis for the consideration of reprisal claims that are raised in complaints filed with employing agencies under 29 C.F.R. part 1614, that concern alleged reprisal for filing age discrimination complaints, and that do not challenge actions that are otherwise appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Forman v. Small,</span> 271 F.3d 285, 290 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (the employee claimed the agency retaliated against him for his age discrimination complaint by failing to forward a subsequent complaint related to his non-promotion), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 536 U.S. 958 (2002). Title 5 of the U.S. Code, on the other hand, authorizes the Board to consider claims of reprisal for filing age discrimination complaints when those claims are related to actions that are otherwise appealable to the Board. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B), the Board may not sustain, on appeal, any action if the appellant shows that the action was based on any prohibited personnel practice described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b). Section 2302(b) includes, in paragraph (9) of its definition of a "prohibited personnel practice," "any personnel action taken against any employee...because of...the exercise of any...complaint...right granted by any law, rule, or regulation...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Clearly, a federal employee's filing of a complaint of employment discrimination based on age constitutes the exercise of a complaint right granted by law and regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(b) (authorizing the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to enforce the prohibition on age discrimination against federal employees, and requiring that agency to include in its "rules, regulations, orders, and instructions...a provision that an employee...shall be notified of any final action taken on any complaint of discrimination filed by him thereunder"); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of Defense,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. 549, 554 (1991) (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) applies to the filing of discrimination complaints); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.103 (providing for the filing of complaints of age discrimination by federal employees who are at least 40 years old). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B), therefore, the Board has the authority to adjudicate, in a case in which the appellant is challenging an appealable action, the appellant's claim of retaliation for filing an age discrimination complaint. <span class="Italic">See Morey v. Department of the Navy,</span> 34 M.S.P.R. 97, 100 (1987) (a claim that the agency committed a prohibited personnel practice is a material issue in an appeal of an action over which the Board has appellate jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency presents another argument in support of its position that attorney fees may not be awarded in a case in which reprisal for filing an age discrimination complaint is found. It states that the EEOC has held that fees may not be awarded in such a case, and it urges the Board to follow this holding in order to avoid the "anomalous result" of having eligibility for a fee award depend on the forum into which the employee brought his claim. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 10-11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Terracina v. Sullivan,</span> EEOC Doc. 05910888, 1992 WL 1374362, *3 (Mar. 11, 1992), the EEOC held that the ADEA did not provide for the awarding, at the administrative level, of attorney fees in a federal sector complaint. In stating this holding, that agency relied on a decision in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reached the same conclusion. <span class="Italic">Id.; see Palmer v.</span> <span class="Italic">General Services Administration,</span> 787 F.2d 300, 300-02 (8th Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal courts appear to have split on the issue of whether the ADEA authorizes attorney fee awards based on findings of reprisal for those complaints. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Craig v. O'Leary,</span> 870 F. Supp. 1007, 1009 (D. Colo. 1994) (referring to disagreement among federal circuits). Again, however, we need not address the scope of the authority granted by that statute. Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the ADEA provides the Board with no authority to award attorney fees based on a finding of reprisal for filing a discrimination complaint, a separate statutory provision does provide it with this authority. As noted above, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) authorizes the Board to award attorney fees when an appellant is a prevailing party and an award is warranted in the interest of justice. It provides further, as we also have noted, that an award is warranted in the interest of justice when the agency has engaged in a prohibited personnel practice. It is this authority, and not any provision of the ADEA, on which the Board relies in awarding fees in a case such as this.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, and in light of the administrative judge's earlier finding that the agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that it removed the appellant in retaliation for filing a discrimination complaint--we agree with the administrative judge that an award of attorney fees in this case is appropriate.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In a separate initial decision, the administrative judge denied the appellant's motion for an award of compensatory damages, finding that the only statutory authority for such an award was the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA), and that that act did not apply to cases of age discrimination, reprisal for age discrimination, or other practices prohibited under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). <span class="Italic">Burch v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, MSPB Docket No. DE-0752-06-0538-P-1 (Initial Decision, Feb. 6, 2008). In its petition for review in the present case, the agency asserts that the administrative judge's decision to award attorney fees "is impossible to reconcile...with her decision denying compensatory damages...." We see no inconsistency between those decisions. As explained above, the attorney fee award is based on an authority separate from the CRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subparagraph (2) of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g) provides that, when the decision entitling an appellant to an attorney fee award "is based on a finding of discrimination prohibited under [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;] 2302(b)(1)..., the payment of attorney fees shall be in accordance with the standards prescribed under section 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 2000e-5(k))." In its petition for review, the agency argues that the administrative judge's findings on the merits of the appellant's appeal do not provide a proper basis for awarding attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraph (g)(2) of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 does not provide a separate basis on which an appellant may be entitled to a fee award. Instead, it provides that the amount of a fee award authorized under paragraph (g)(1) is to be calculated, under some circumstances, on the more inclusive standards of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(k). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2); <span class="Italic">Raney v. Federal Bureau of Prisons</span>, 222 F.3d 927, 935 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("By providing separate subsections 7701(g)(1) and 7701(g)(2), Congress merely recognized that [certain] federal employees...are entitled to obtain not only reasonable attorney fees,...but also [additional] costs...."). Even if 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2) were inapplicable here, therefore, the appellant would remain entitled to an award of fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial decision on the motion for an attorney fee award, the administrative judge in this case calculated the award under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). She suggested, in doing so, that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2) was inapplicable because the award was based on a finding of reprisal prohibited under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), rather than on a finding of discrimination prohibited under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4633"></span>It is true that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2) refers only to a finding of discrimination prohibited under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), and not to a finding of reprisal prohibited under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). It also is true that the administrative judge did not find that the agency had discriminated against the appellant based on his age. The Board has held, however, relying on the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act, that Congress intended that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(g)(2) be applied to any fee award that is based on a finding that "the employee's rights under the laws prohibiting discrimination have been violated." <span class="Italic">Bartel v. Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 451, 457 (1986). In <span class="Italic">Gomez-Perez,</span> 128 S. Ct. at 1943, the Supreme Court held that the ADEA--a law prohibiting discrimination--prohibits reprisal against a federal employee for filing an age discrimination complaint. Furthermore, the Board has noted that a federal employee's rights under regulations implementing antidiscrimination legislation include freedom from reprisal for exercising the right to file a discrimination complaint, and it has indicated, therefore, that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2) governs calculation of awards based on findings of reprisal for filing such a complaint. <span class="Italic">Bartel,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. at 457.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, the standards to which 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2) refers would appear to be applicable here. We note, however, that the appellant has not challenged the administrative judge's statements indicating that those standards should not be applied. Perhaps more important, the appellant has claimed an award based only on the hourly fees charged by her attorneys. The award he seeks does not include any expenses or costs that would be recoverable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2) but not under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Chin v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 55 M.S.P.R. 84, 86 (1992) (out-of-pocket expenses may be awarded under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(k)); <span class="Italic">Bartel,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. at 456-57 (costs not usually included in an attorney fee award may be included in an award under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(k)). We therefore need not give any further consideration to the appellant's rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other distinctions between plain vanilla civil service fee awards and awards of fees in cases involving findings of discrimination include the possibility of an award of interest on counsel fees. Interest was made available for qualifying cases under the 1991 amendments of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of Army</span>, 78 F.3d 645, 651-52 (D.C. Cir. 1996).</p>
