<h3 class="h3" id="sec12-111"><span class="space">G.</span> ALCOHOLISM AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE</h3>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3531"></span>The Board distinguishes disabilities associated with no misconduct but with potential accommodative burdens, and disabling conditions, e.g., alcoholism or drug use, associated with misconduct charges. The analysis in the physical impairment case is straightforward, usually requiring consideration of whether an impairment exists; whether an impairment substantially limits the major life activity of the appellant; whether the impairment caused the difficulties leading to the appealed action; and whether the impairment can be accommodated, and, if so, whether the accommodation present an undue hardship to the agency. In the drug or alcohol case, matters become more complicated, usually requiring consideration of whether an impairment exists that limits a major life activity; whether the impairment caused the misconduct or performance deficiencies leading to the appeal; whether the misconduct so serious or so integrally related to the agency mission that the employee cannot be considered "qualified" for accommodation; and whether, If accommodation is required, its imposition constitute an undue hardship to the agency. Assuming the need for accommodation, may the agency concurrently discipline the employee through means short of removal for misconduct? The analysis that follows is complex: conflicting Board and court cases balance the national interest in assisting a protected class of disabled workers against the risk of accommodation to the government and its work force.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Early Board decisions concentrated on the alcoholic employee, and there was much discussion about appropriate accommodation. The focus shifted during the Reagan Administration to drug offenders, drug testing, and accommodative requirements for drug abusers. Because both alcohol and drug impairment are treated under the Rehabilitation Act, some case law applies to both problems.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That alcoholism is a disease has not been the subject of much debate. In a dissenting opinion on whether alcoholism can serve as a basis for disability retirement, Board Member Devaney, supporting the position that the disease should qualify for retirement eligibility, wrote in <span class="Italic">Winslett v. OPM</span>, 30 MSPR 444, 445 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alcoholism is a disease and may so dominate a person's life that he or she is unable to engage in normal activity. Many alcoholics cannot abstain from the consumption of alcoholic beverages even after seeking professional treatment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, House Comm. on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act, H.Rep. No. 1663, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1970 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 5719, 5720-21 (medical authorities are now nearly unanimous in their recognition of alcoholism as a disease that is one of the most serious health problems in the country); Public Health Service Act, 42 USC 290dd (in <span class="Italic">Ruzek v. GSA</span>, 7 MSPR 437 (1981), the Board held that alcoholism is a handicapping condition and that discrimination based on alcoholism is prohibited by the Act); <span class="Italic">Powell v. Texas</span>, 392 U.S. 514, 522, 88 S. Ct. 2145, 2149, 20 L. Ed.2d 1254 (1968) ("there is widespread agreement today that 'alcoholism' is a 'disease' for the simple reason that the medical profession has concluded that it should attempt to treat those who have drinking problems"); <span class="Italic">Purter v. Heckler</span>, 771 F.2d 682, 696-97 (3d Cir. 1985) (Social Security Administration's amending of its regulations to provide that alcoholism is to be assessed like any other disability is a "reflection of the general shift away from society's traditional perception of alcoholism as a self-inflicted condition and towards a recognition that it is a disease often not subject to individual control").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">We begin with a description of the elements of a disability discrimination defense for both alcohol- and drug-impaired employees, taken from <span class="Italic">Alex v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 605, 608-10 (1988), involving demotion of an individual involved in an assaultive incident following excessive drinking:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Beginning with <span class="Italic">McCaffrey v. United States Postal Service,</span> 36 MSPR 224 (1988), the Board set forth a minimum evidentiary standard of drug addiction or alcoholism that must be met before an appellant can claim entitlement to accommodation. The Board made it clear in <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span> that isolated or casual use of drugs or alcohol by appellants claiming handicap discrimination would be insufficient alone to overturn otherwise warranted agency disciplinary actions for failure to accommodate alleged drug addiction or alcoholism. Rather, the burden is upon the appellant to establish that his level of drug or alcohol use constitutes drug addiction or alcoholism. 36 MSPR at 228-29. To do this, he must provide evidence: (1) From himself concerning his pattern of drug or alcohol use and its effect on him and (2) from experts in the field as to whether that pattern along with the other symptoms demonstrated by the appellant constitutes the handicap of drug or alcohol abuse. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The expert evidence must show the existence of a drug or alcohol dependency at the time of the misconduct at issue. This evidence may include: (1) Objective clinical findings such as test results and observation of physical signs; (2) medical diagnoses based on evaluation; and (3) evaluation and assessment by a non-medical expert in the field of drug or alcohol rehabilitation. 36 MSPR at 230. An appellant must prove not only that he suffers from a handicapping condition, but that the condition caused his misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence in this case establishes that the appellant, at the time of his misconduct, had consumed ten to eighteen cans of beer. Evidence also exists in the form of a statement by the appellant to the effect that, following the incident, he sought the services of a psychiatrist who prescribed "medication" and referred him to a rehabilitation program in which he enrolled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the record in this case is insufficient to determine whether the appellant meets the heightened evidentiary standard set forth by the Board in <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span>. It is therefore appropriate to, and we hereby do, remand this case for the administrative judge to take evidence on the issues of whether, pursuant to that standard, the appellant suffers from the handicapping condition of alcoholism, and, if so, whether that condition caused his misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, on remand, the administrative judge concludes that the first of these questions has been answered in the affirmative, he must then proceed to address the causation question in the manner set forth by the Board in the recently-issued case of <span class="Italic">Brinkley v.</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration,</span> 37 MSPR 682 (1988). In <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span>, the Board found that the proscription of discrimination against handicapped individuals was inapplicable to employee misconduct that is not itself the concurrent product of mental or physical impairment caused by drug addiction or alcoholism. <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span>, at 687. The Board further found that, absent an evidentiary connection between the alleged drug addiction or alcoholism handicap and the employee's misconduct, the agency's discipline is necessarily imposed for the independent acts of misconduct, and not solely because the employee is an addict or an alcoholic or because the agency regards the employee as an addict or an alcoholic. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the second step of the administrative judge's analysis, assuming he finds that the employee suffers from a handicapping condition, is to determine whether there is a direct connection between the agency's charge and the appellant's alleged handicap because, pursuant to <span class="Italic">Brinkley</span>, the accommodation requirement does not extend to adverse actions unrelated to the alleged alcohol or drug handicap. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 688.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the administrative judge finds such a connection, it still does not necessarily follow that the appellant has established his affirmative defense. In <span class="Italic">Hougens v. United States Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 38 MSPR 135 (1988), the Board found that an employee who is an addict or an alcoholic can commit misconduct that is so serious as to disqualify him from being able to perform the essential functions of his position. In such cases, the employee is taken outside the scope of the protecting legislation because the misconduct renders him not a "qualified" handicapped individual, and thereby obviates an agency's accommodation obligation under the 1973 Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Hougens,</span> at 142. Thus, whenever the agency proves misconduct affecting the core of the appellant's job-related responsibilities or the agency's mission, or misconduct so egregious or notorious that the employee's ability to perform his duties or to represent the agency is hampered, the Board will sustain the agency's disciplinary action absent a rehabilitation offer because the agency no longer has this obligation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 142-43. The Board also held in <span class="Italic">Hougens</span> that where a qualified handicapped employee is entitled to reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act, an agency may nevertheless impose reasonable discipline other than removal for any misconduct, while concurrently affording the abusing employee an opportunity to rehabilitate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 148.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant whose drinking affects his conduct at work but who performs his duties satisfactorily when not under the influence of alcohol was considered a qualified disabled person. <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 656, 658 n.1 (1983). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Lavalley v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 129, 132 (1991) (accommodation was not required when the appellant did not show a direct connection between alcoholism and drinking beer during the day and opening sealed mail and divulging the contents of mail to coworkers; "sufficient evidence exists showing that the appellant was able to maintain control of his faculties and go about the business of working even while under the influence of 2-4 beers that he consumed during lunch"). [Refer to Chapter 8 concerning "<a href="0100-2023-15-283.html#sec8-281">Drug and Alcohol Offenses</a>" and for Executive Order 12564 under "<a href="0100-2023-15-287.html#sec8-285">Safe Harbor Provision</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most decisions addressing alcoholism review alleged denial of reasonable accommodation. As to discrimination against persons afflicted with alcoholism, <span class="Italic">SSA v. Boini</span>, CB-7521-13-0192-T-1 (NP 2/22/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]lthough alcoholism is a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1615.103, neither the Rehabilitation Act, nor the ADA, immunizes disabled employees from being disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, provided the agency would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability, <span class="Italic">see Burton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 16 (2009). We find no support for the respondent's assertion that the petitioner would have proposed a different action had the respondent not suffered from alcoholism, and we thus find no merit to the respondent's contention that the agency's allegedly differing treatment of him based on his alcoholism serves as a mitigating factor. <span class="Italic">See Avery</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 150, &#x00B6; 11 (recognizing that <span id="Page_3532"></span>a claim of disparate treatment may be part of the larger good cause calculus).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cases involving disabilities asserted to result from use of narcotics present their own analytical difficulties, because under the Rehabilitation Act a qualified individual with a disability does not include any employee who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs. <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 112 MSPR 288, 295-96 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-18, 2009 MSPB 185 (2009), reviewing an arbitrator's award, explained nuances in appeals involving affirmative defenses of disability based on present or past drug use, with discussion of the effect of rehabilitation efforts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act), as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-336, "a qualified individual with a disability" does not include "any employee or applicant who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs...." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12114. The ADA amended the Rehabilitation Act to define "drug" to mean "a controlled substance, as defined in schedules I-V of section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812)." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(6)(B). It further defined the "illegal use of drugs" to mean the use of drugs, "the possession or distribution of which is unlawful under the Controlled Substances Act...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 12111(6)(A). This does not include the use of drugs "taken under supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other uses authorized by the Controlled Substances Act, or other provisions of Federal law." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant must establish his affirmative defense of disability discrimination by preponderant evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not specify the drug or drugs to which he was addicted. He asserted, however, that he entered a drug treatment program in January 2006 and again in November 2007 after his removal. He also testified that he enrolled in Narcotics Anonymous. He, however, has not asserted that his addiction was to prescription drugs taken under supervision by a licensed healthcare professional or used as authorized by the Controlled Substances Act or other provisions of Federal law, or in any way indicated that it was not to a controlled substance. In view of his participation in at least two rehabilitation programs and his enrollment in Narcotics Anonymous, we find that he has not met his burden of proving by preponderant evidence that he was addicted to drugs that are not disqualifying under the ADA. <span class="Italic">See Little v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 574, 583 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12114(b), an individual is not excluded from Rehabilitation Act protection under certain circumstances: successful completion of a supervised drug rehabilitation program where such individual is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs; or such individual has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and is no longer engaging in such use; or such individual is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is no longer engaged in such use; or such individual is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use. Nothing in the record shows that the appellant met any of these criteria prior to the date his removal was proposed or effected as he testified that he returned to a drug treatment program after his removal in January 2007 and was not sober until November 2007. Accordingly, the appellant has not shown that he was entitled to the protections of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the appellant was covered under the Rehabilitation Act, we discern no error in the arbitrator's conclusion that he failed to show disability discrimination. As noted by the arbitrator, the appellant failed to demonstrate that he was removed on the basis of his drug addiction rather than on the basis of the charged misconduct, and the appellant did not present evidence that the agency tolerates the sort of misconduct that he committed from the non-disabled. <span class="Italic">See Fitzgerald v. Department of Defense,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 463, 468-69 (2000) (the Rehabilitation Act does not require an agency to excuse a disabled employee's violation of uniformly-applied, job-related rules of conduct). Moreover, he did not show that he was unable to comply with his leave restriction as a result of his drug addiction. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Further, even if the appellant made a request for an accommodation, he did not show that a reasonable accommodation existed. <span class="Italic">See Paris v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 24 (2006) (an appellant cannot prevail on a disability discrimination claim based on denial of a reasonable accommodation merely by "articulating" a reasonable accommodation; ruling for an appellant on that basis would relieve him of his burden of proof, and could lead to an unenforceable decision). We therefore conclude that, under the Board's limited authority pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121, there is no basis to reverse the arbitrator's award.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Also addressing the relation between drug involvement, rehabilitation, and disability accommodation, <span class="Italic">Pappas v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, AT-0752-15-0407-I-1 (NP 2/11/2016), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant had not established his disability discrimination claim because he was "currently engaging" in the illegal use of drugs and therefore was not eligible for protection under the Rehabilitation Act. The appellant challenges this finding on review, arguing that he successfully completed, or was participating in, a supervised drug rehabilitation program and no longer engaged in the illegal use of drugs. For the reasons discussed below, we agree with the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-336, to establish disability discrimination, an employee must show, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that: (1) he is an individual with a disability, as defined by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g); and (2) he is a qualified individual with a disability, as defined by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 13 (2014). A "qualified individual with a disability" does not include an employee "who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs, when the covered entity acts on the basis of such use." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12114(a). However, under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12114(b), an individual is not excluded from Rehabilitation Act protection as someone currently engaged in the illegal use of drugs if he: (1) successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program where he is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs; (2) has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and is no longer engaging in such use; (3) is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is no longer engaged in such use; or (4) is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use. <span class="Italic">See Adams v. Department of Labor</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 288, &#x00B6; 17 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in the record shows that the appellant met any of these criteria prior to the date his removal was proposed. Here, the agency proposed the appellant's removal in November 2014, and described specific prior conduct to support its charge of illegal drug use--namely, that the appellant provided a specimen that was positive for illegal drugs and that he admitted to using illegal drugs. After the appellant's admission of drug use and the collection of the positive specimen, but prior to the proposal to remove him, the appellant entered a drug rehabilitation program. The appellant completed this program in August 2014,<span class="Italic"> id.</span>, and, in December 2014, during his response to the proposal, he stated that he had not used drugs since that time. The appellant was removed in February 2015. The appellant's admission to the misconduct, completion of a rehabilitation program, and statement in his oral reply that he had been drug-free do not negate this prior drug involvement. Therefore, we find that the appellant used drugs recently enough to exclude him from coverage as a qualified individual with a disability and that the agency could properly remove him based, in part, upon his illegal drug use. Accordingly, the appellant has not shown that he was entitled to the protections of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the appellant was covered under the Rehabilitation Act, the appellant failed to demonstrate that he was removed on the basis of his drug addiction rather than on the basis of the charged misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Adams</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 288, &#x00B6; 18. Further, the appellant did not present evidence that the agency tolerates the sort of misconduct that he committed from the nondisabled. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant is not immunized from being disciplined for misconduct provided that the agency would have imposed the same discipline on an employee without a disability. <span class="Italic">Burton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 16 (2009). He has presented no evidence that the agency would not have disciplined other employees without a disability for similar misconduct. Accordingly, he has failed to establish his affirmative defense of disability discrimination.</p>
