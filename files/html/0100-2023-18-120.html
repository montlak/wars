<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-121"><span class="space">10.</span> Changes in Proposing, Deciding Official</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit criticized rather blatant manipulation of the agency decisional process in <span class="Italic">Boddie v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 827 F.2d 1578, 1580-81 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The appellant was involved in an altercation with a subordinate. Local agency regulations stated that discipline of employees should be proposed at the lowest practical supervisory level. The appellant's supervisor, initially reluctant to take any disciplinary action, was pressured by his superiors to demote the appellant to a lower supervisory position, and he prepared and signed a proposal letter. But before the notice of proposed charges was delivered to the appellant, another supervisor was substituted as the proposing official. He then issued a more severe demotion proposal, reducing the appellant to a nonsupervisory position. The court concluded the agency erred and reversed the Board's decision sustaining the agency action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We do not say that some other official could <span class="Italic">never</span> be substituted for the first-level line supervisor, but if that were done it would have to be done before Moran had begun to consider the charge and discipline, if any, to be levied on Boddie, and certainly before Moran had made up his mind what the proposed discipline should be. If higher-level management thought from the beginning that this was a special case requiring a certain type of punishment, management should have immediately removed the matter from Mr. Moran. It was wholly improper to wait until staff-level personnel completely failed to persuade Moran of the upper-level position, and until after he had finally executed his own letter of charges. That last-minute substitution definitely deprived Boddie of his right, granted in the Navy Yard's regulation, to have his own first-level supervisor propose the charges against him and the discipline to be imposed on him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have no doubt that this procedural error was harmful to Boddie. As a result of the substitution,...petitioner suffered the penalty of a sharp and deep demotion.... "This evidence of differing views within the agency as to the penalty to be imposed upon" Boddie clearly demonstrates that had Moran been the proposer "the outcome <span class="Italic">could</span> have been different." <span class="Italic">Mercer v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 772 F.2d 856, 859-60 (Fed. Cir. 1985). This is sufficient to invoke the harmful error doctrine as embodied in the Civil Service Reform Act.... <span class="Italic">Cheney v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 720 F.2d 1280 (Fed. Cir. 1983), was different. There, the upper-level employee who was substituted for the initial decider had the authority to overrule the initial decider, and therefore the court held the earlier substitution of the upper-level employee was harmless error. In the current case, there is no indication that Moran's decision could be similarly overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ruling in <span class="Italic">Depte v. United States</span>, 715 F.2d 1481 (Fed. Cir. 1983), that agency procedure need not meet due process standards where a full <span class="Italic">de novo</span> hearing is held before the MSPB, is inapplicable to matters of penalty. On that question, the Board's decision is not <span class="Italic">de novo</span> but gives considerable deference to the employing agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wilkowski v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 86 MSPR 496, 498-500 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11 (2000), summarized and applied <span class="Italic">Boddie</span> and required an AJ to consider whether a switch in deciding officials prejudiced the appellant when the first official who received the appellant's reply could have made a decision before being replaced and would have issued a lesser penalty than the removal ultimately imposed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, has addressed the issue of whether an agency may replace one deciding official with another when the original deciding official has already arrived at a conclusion regarding the action to be taken, and when the penalty imposed is more severe than the one the originally designated deciding official would have imposed. In <span class="Italic">Cheney v. Department of Justice</span>, 720 F.2d 1280, 1284-85 (Fed. Cir. 1983), it indicated that doing so was <span id="Page_3303"></span>error. It also indicated that the error would require the overturning of the action if it "denied [the employee] some opportunity of avoiding dismissal, however, slim, that the correct procedures...would have permitted." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1285. Although the court did not overturn the action in that case, its decision that the action could be sustained was based on evidence establishing that the approval of the official who ultimately served as the deciding official would have been required even if the originally designated deciding official had performed that function<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1284-85. In light of this evidence, the court found that the error was not harmful and therefore did not preclude the sustaining of the action taken against the employee<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The court addressed a somewhat similar situation in a later decision, <span class="Italic">Boddie v. Department of the Navy</span>, 827 F.2d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1987). In that case, the agency replaced the originally designated deciding official after he had prepared and signed a decision to demote the employee to a supervisory position<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 1579-80. The replacement deciding official then issued a decision demoting the employee to a nonsupervisory position at a level lower than the supervisory position to which the originally designated deciding official would have demoted him<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. The court stated that there was no indication that the official who ultimately made the decision had the authority to overrule the originally designated official; that the outcome of the case therefore could have been different if the originally designated official had not been replaced; that the court accordingly had "no doubt" that the procedural error the agency had committed in replacing the deciding official was harmful; and that the action therefore was to be canceled<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1580-81.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency appears to argue that the facts in <span class="Italic">Boddie</span> are distinguishable from those alleged by the appellant, we do not find the reasons it has offered persuasive. First, while the agency argues that Ms. Fenchel had not issued her decision before Mr. Hoglund replaced her, the <span class="Italic">Boddie</span> court indicated that an agency was not free to replace a deciding official at any time before that official had actually issued a decision. That is, it stated that, any such replacement "would have to be done before [the original deciding official] had begun to consider the charge and discipline, if any, to be levied," and that it would "certainly [have to be done] before [that official] had made up his mind what the proposed discipline should be." <span class="Italic">Boddie</span>, 827 F.2d at 1580. Moreover, while the original deciding official in <span class="Italic">Boddie</span> had prepared and signed a decision before he was replaced, as we have noted above, and while the appellant does not argue that Mr. Fenchel had done so, we see no material distinction between the two situations. Whether it is signed or not, an unissued decision would have no legal effect on the employee's status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also attempts to distinguish <span class="Italic">Boddie</span> from the facts alleged in this case by contending that Mr. Hoglund was permitted under its delegations of authority to serve as the deciding official. We note, however, that the <span class="Italic">Boddie</span> court specifically referred to the possibility that the replacement official might have the authority to serve in this capacity, and that it indicated that the substitution nevertheless was improper when made in an untimely manner as indicated above<span class="Italic">. Boddie</span>, 827 F.2d at 1580.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the agency has cited <span class="Italic">Monroe v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 770 F.2d 1044, 1047 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 475 U.S. 1045 (1986), for the proposition that an agency does not err by replacing a deciding official who has left his position. In <span class="Italic">Monroe</span>, however, the deciding official who was replaced had left his position without making a recommendation or decision regarding the action to be taken in the case in which he had been designated<span class="Italic">. See Monroe</span>, 770 F.2d at 1046. In the present appeal, the appellant has alleged that Ms. Fenchel did not leave her position until July 3, 1999; that she would have testified, if the administrative judge had permitted her to testify, that she advised Mr. Hoglund well before her replacement, i.e., on or about April 22, 1999, that she would not remove the appellant; and that she also would have testified that she "was fully prepared and capable of rendering a written final decision in this matter prior to her departure...." The facts in <span class="Italic">Monroe</span> therefore are distinguishable from those alleged by the appellant in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency committed harmful procedural error when Mr. Hoglund replaced Ms. Fenchel as the deciding official in his case. We find further that Ms. Fenchel's proffered testimony could be relevant and material to the issue the appellant has raised, and that the appellant's request that that witness be called to testify should have been approved.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Boddie</span> and <span class="Italic">Wilkowski</span> were qualified by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Bross v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 389 F.3d 1212, 1217-18 (Fed. Cir. 2004), concluding that due process is not violated by switching deciding officials before a final agency decision is made. In <span class="Italic">Bross</span>, a labor contract set the decision level for an adverse action at the third level in the supervisory chain in the normal, nonprecedential case. The third level supervisor was not inclined to sustain dismissal of an employee who used agency computer equipment briefly to access child pornography. That supervisor had not yet made up his mind when agency officials elevated the proposal and decision level to the fourth level of management, where a different agency official imposed removal. The court agreed with the Board and the agency that the switch in deciding officials was justified by the precedential nature of the case, and the agency could consider the significance of the maximum penalty in its determination of whether the decision level should be elevated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bross also argues, relying on our decision in <span class="Italic">Boddie v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 827 F. 2d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1987), that harmful error occurred because the decision to elevate his case to a higher level was made too late. The relevant regulation in <span class="Italic">Boddie</span> required that "[d]iscipline of employees...should be effected at the lowest practical supervisory level." 827 F.2d at 1579. <span class="Italic">Boddie</span> involved the last-minute substitution of a higher-level supervisor for the employee's immediate supervisor as the proposing official in disciplinary proceedings which led to the employee's demotion. The higher-level official took a harsher action than the immediate supervisor had already decided to propose, as reflected in a draft letter of charges. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1579-80.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bross relies particularly on the following language from <span class="Italic">Boddie</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We do not say that some other official could <span class="Italic">never</span> be substituted for the first-level line supervisor, but if that were done it would have to be done before [the lower-level official] had begun to consider the charge and discipline, if any, to be levied on [the employee], and certainly before [the lower-level official] had made up his mind what the proposed discipline should be.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1580. We conclude that <span class="Italic">Boddie</span> only bars a change in the proposing and deciding official after the lower-level official reaches a decision. Otherwise the level of the decision-maker could never be elevated, since effectively the decision to elevate is likely to occur only in cases where consideration has already begun at a lower level. The holding of <span class="Italic">Boddie</span> is in accordance with this principle. We concluded in <span class="Italic">Boddie</span> that it was "wholly improper" to delay elevation of an adverse action to a higher-level official until after "staff-level personnel completely fail[ ] to persuade" the lower-level official that more stringent measures are required, and the lower-level official has already finalized a decision and "executed his own letter of charges." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1580. Thus, <span class="Italic">Boddie</span> only holds that elevation to a higher level is improper when the decision on the adverse action has already been made.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In this respect, we disagree with the Board's earlier interpretation of <span class="Italic">Boddie</span>. <span class="Italic">See Wilkowski v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 496, 498-99 (2000) (finding replacement of the deciding official improper under <span class="Italic">Boddie</span> when the original officer had yet to finalize a decision)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is not like <span class="Italic">Boddie</span>. Wright had not yet reached a decision as to the appropriate penalty when he was displaced by Clark as the proposing and deciding official. Although he was more willing than personnel and legal staff to consider penalties short of removal, he still was considering removal as an option, and one of his colleagues even recalled his stating, prior to Clark's decision to elevate the case, that "he didn't really want to be the person who would have to remove [Bross]." Unlike <span class="Italic">Boddie</span>, no decision had been made regarding the appropriate penalty when Clark took over as the proposing and deciding official.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Considering <span class="Italic">Bross</span> and <span class="Italic">Boddie</span>, <span class="Italic">Goeke &#x0026; Bottini v. DOJ</span>, 122 MSPR 69, 76-81 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-19, 21, 23, 2015 MSPB 1 (2015), determined that harmful error occurred when the agency substituted a proposing official, who was inclined to take no action after much factual analysis, with a proposing official who recommended adverse action that was sustained by the agency's deciding official:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Boddie</span>, the Federal Circuit held that the agency committed harmful error when it did not follow its internal disciplinary procedure, which established that "[d]iscipline of employees is a line management responsibility and should be effected at the lowest practical supervisory level." 827 F.2d at 1579. The employee's first-line supervisor in that case was not in favor of disciplining the employee, and after he was pressured into proposing the employee's demotion, the agency removed him from his role as the proposing official and appointed a higher-level official who proposed a more severe demotion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1579-80. In that case, the record reflected that the original proposing official "gave directions for [the] proposed charge to be put into written form...[and] it was so prepared and he signed it." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1579. Under those circumstances, the court held that it was "wholly improper" for the agency to replace the original proposing official after its higher-level managers "completely failed to persuade" him to issue the level of discipline that they thought was most appropriate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1579-80.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Federal Circuit suggested in <span class="Italic">Boddie</span> that the point at which the agency would be bound by the proposal of the original official was the point at which he had "begun to consider the charge and discipline, if any, to be levied," <span class="Italic">id</span>., in <span class="Italic">Bross</span>, the Federal Circuit clarified that "<span class="Italic">Boddie</span> only bars a change in the proposing and deciding official after the lower-level official reaches a decision," <span class="Italic">see Bross</span>, 389 F.3d at 1218. Accordingly, in <span class="Italic">Bross</span>, the court found that the agency did not commit harmful error <span id="Page_3304"></span>when it replaced the original proposing official because he "had not yet reached a decision as to the appropriate penalty" at the point in time he was removed from this role. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the PMRU attorney's memorandum disagreeing with OPR's findings of reckless professional misconduct qualifies as a decision on the proposed adverse action for purposes of precluding the agency from appointing a new proposing official under the standards articulated in <span class="Italic">Bross</span> and <span class="Italic">Boddie</span>. As noted, the PMRU attorney's recommendation is contained in a lengthy, thorough, detailed memorandum containing not only factual and legal citations, but also over 370 footnotes supporting his conclusions and recommendations. Although the memorandum was not dated, it bore the PMRU attorney's signature,[6] was prepared on agency letterhead, and most importantly, contained a thorough and complete recommendation which sufficed to allow the PMRU Chief to consider, and reject, the PMRU attorney's reasons for concluding that OPR's findings of reckless professional misconduct were not supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Thus, we conclude that the memorandum constituted a decision from the PMRU attorney "on the adverse action" for the purpose of precluding the agency from removing him as the proposing official and appointing another agency official to serve in his place. <span class="Italic">See Bross</span>, 389 F.3d at 1218; <span class="Italic">see also Boddie</span>, 827 F.2d at 1579-80.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The agency posited below that the PMRU attorney's memorandum was an incomplete draft because, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, it was undated, simultaneously addressed the conduct of both appellants, contained "some blanks that still need[ed] to be filled," such as names and dates, and only bore an electronic copy of the attorney's signature which was included as a default on all of the draft documents he produced. We find that the substance and thoroughness of the recommendation outweighs any suggestion that the document is other than a substantially finished and completed work product.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, moreover, that, although the memorandum begins with a summary suggesting that OPR's findings of reckless professional misconduct should not be adopted, the memorandum concludes with decisive language advocating that no disciplinary action is warranted. Goeke IAF, Tab 5, Subtab 4c, Ex. 2 ("Even had I concluded that reckless misconduct had occurred, all of the same concerns...would have counseled in favor of a low level of discipline," and "it is clear to me that no amount of 'discipline'...would be likely to accomplish any further deterrence of future misconduct[.] "). Thus, notwithstanding the agency's argument below that the PMRU attorney's memorandum was only an internal recommendation as to how the appellants' misconduct should be processed within the agency, we find that the memorandum is tantamount to a proposal from the PMRU attorney that no discipline should be issued. This case is therefore unlike <span class="Italic">Bross</span>, where the original proposing official was equivocal as to the appropriate level of discipline that should be imposed at the time he was removed from his role as the proposing official, <span class="Italic">see Bross</span>, 389 F.3d at 1218, and is more akin to <span class="Italic">Boddie</span>, where the agency improperly replaced the proposing official after a proposal imposing a lower-level of discipline had been prepared and signed, <span class="Italic">see Boddie</span>, 827 F.2d at 1579-80.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the agency's disciplinary process expressly provides that the PMRU Chief is charged with reviewing and making a preliminary determination of whether OPR's "finding of misconduct is supported by the evidence and applicable law," and the PMRU attorney, as the proposing official, is charged with conducting a first-level review of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and proposing some level of discipline, if any. Here, after the PMRU Chief reviewed OPR's ROI and made a preliminary determination that its findings of reckless professional misconduct should be accepted, the PMRU attorney conducted a second review of these findings. Had the PMRU disciplinary process been properly followed, the PMRU attorney would likely have proposed some level of discipline less than that imposed by the PMRU Chief, and it is equally likely that he would have proposed no discipline at all--based upon his conclusions that, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the disclosure failures were not the direct result of the appellants' professional misconduct, but rather were the culmination of a series of errors on the part of several agency officials. <span class="Italic">See</span> Goeke IAF, Tab 5, Subtab 4c, Ex. 2 (PMRU attorney memorandum concluding that "it is clear to me that no amount of 'discipline,' such as a letter of reprimand, or a suspension, would be likely to accomplish any further deterrence of future misconduct than their involvement in this prosecution and this misconduct investigation has already done"); ("After review of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor information, the [PMRU attorney] will decide whether disciplinary action is warranted. If the [PMRU attorney] determines that no disciplinary action is warranted, [he] will notify the subject attorney and the [PMRU Chief] ....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude that the agency's deviation from its PMRU disciplinary process led to a different result than it would have, had it followed its process. <span class="Italic">See Canary</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 12 (finding that an agency's substitution of a proposing official led to the imposition of more severe discipline and constituted harmful error). We are therefore constrained to find that this procedural error was harmful to the appellants' interests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In conclusion, in sustaining the initial decision, as modified, we find two instances of harmful procedural error and do not reach the merits of the substantive charges against the appellants. It may seem at first glance to defy common sense not to subject individuals engaged in what was characterized as reckless behavior to disciplinary action, especially when that behavior so publicly compromised the justice system with the consequence of interfering with the electoral process. However, the fact remains that the Department of Justice voluntarily created and adopted a disciplinary process not required by any external law, rule, or regulation, and allowed that process to evolve in practice over time. This process can be abandoned or modified prospectively by the agency at will. But once adopted and until modified, we are bound by our controlling courts to enforce it. <span class="Italic">See Romero v. Department of Defense</span>, 527 F.3d 1324, 1328-29 (Fed.

Here, there is no evidence that the Company Commander, rather than the Brigade Commander, was the properly authorized deciding official. Rather, the change in designation was made to be in compliance with written INSCOM policy identifying the proper deciding official. Moreover, there is no evidence that the Company Commander had considered the appellant's reply and reached a decision before he was replaced. Therefore, the appellant has not shown that there was procedural error. Nor has the appellant articulated how the alleged error was harmful to him. We accordingly find that the appellant has not carried his burden to prove there was harmful error by the agency in the application of its procedures in arriving at the decision on his indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bross</span> was noted in <span class="Italic">Probasco v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 413 Fed. Appx. 263, 265-66 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Probasco first argues that the AJ erred in not ad-dressing arguments that were not included in Probasco's prehearing submissions. This includes Probasco's claim that the Agency violated its own policies by allowing Morris rather than Roy Castoreno, Probasco's second-level supervisor, to initiate the removal. Probasco asserts that he became aware of the violation only after the first hearing on April 23, 2009, after belatedly obtaining an Agency memorandum that should have been provided during discovery.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not decide whether the AJ abused his discretion in declining to consider Probasco's arguments as to the alleged violation of the Agency's policy, for we conclude that any oversight would have been harmless error. The Agency memorandum cited by Probasco does not establish that the Agency was prohibited from substituting a higher-level supervisor as the initiating official for proposing an adverse action. In such cases, we have held that the replacement of an initiating official by a higher-level official is prohibited only if the substitution is made "after the lower-level official reaches a decision." <span class="Italic">Bross v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 389 F.3d 1212, 1218 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Here, Probasco has not alleged or presented any evidence that Castoreno considered Probasco's case and reached a decision before Morris was substituted as the initiating official. Thus, Probasco could not have prevailed on this theory, and the AJ's refusal to consider Probasco's arguments was at most harmless error.</p>

Substantial evidence supports the arbitrator's determination that the original deciding official, Warden Babcock, never came to a decision regarding Villareal's penalty, however. The draft letter was written sometime in July 2014, and Babcock did not retire until December 31, 2014. Indeed, Babcock <span id="Page_3305"></span>continued working for several months without signing or acting on the letter by instituting the suspension.

<p class="Body-Text">A switch in proposing and deciding officials, based on management's apparent belief that the first proposing or deciding official was likely to be too lenient in a penalty based on a workplace altercation, caused a removal to be set aside for harmful error in <span class="Italic">Canary v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/CANARY_ALETHIA_NY_0752_11_0145_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_DISSENTING_OPINION_809775.pdf">119 MSPR 310</a>, 315-16 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12, 2013 MSPB 25 (2013), a decision that did little to cite, distinguish, or clarify preexisting law:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's removal may not be sustained if she shows harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at its decision to remove her. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A); <span class="Italic">see Helms v. Department of the Army</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 6 (2010). An appellant bears the burden of proof to show harmful error by the agency in effecting an adverse action. <span class="Italic">Helms</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that the agency violated ELM &#x00A7; 651.75 when it replaced Ms. Davis as the deciding official. Section 651.75 of the ELM provides that the deciding official "must be higher in authority than the proposing official" and that, in field installations, such as the North Jersey L&#x0026;DC, the "installation head or designee usually makes the decision. We find no violation of the ELM here. Although Ms. Davis, as the installation head, would usually serve as the deciding official on a proposed adverse action, the ELM does not require it. The only requirement for the designation of a deciding official contained in the ELM is that the deciding official is higher in authority than the proposing official, <span class="Italic">id</span>., and Mr. Quental, as Manager, In-Plant Support, Northeast Area, was higher in authority than both Ms. Edwards and Ms. Flagg at the time. We also find that the agency did not otherwise commit procedural error when it replaced Ms. Davis with Mr. Quental because the agency had not yet issued proposed disciplinary action to the appellant at the time of the replacement. <span class="Italic">See Helms</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 7 (<span class="Italic">quoting Shiflett v. Department of Justice</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 289, &#x00B6; 9 (2005)) ("An agency commits procedural error when it replaces a properly authorized deciding official who has already considered an employee's reply to a proposed adverse action and arrived at a decision.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that the agency violated ELM &#x00A7; 651.73 when it replaced Ms. Edwards as the proposing official. Section 651.73 of the ELM provides that, "[u]nless the circumstances of a particular case make it impractical, the employee's immediate supervisor issues a written notice of proposed adverse action." The administrative judge found that it would not have been practical for Ms. Edwards to serve as the proposing official because she found that Ms. Edwards could not be objective given her prior experiences with the subordinate employee. We find, however, that the record is devoid of any reason that would make it "impractical" for Ms. Edwards to serve as the proposing official, including her alleged lack of objectivity. Indeed, first line supervisors will almost always have prior experiences with employees, but that fact does not make it impractical for them to act as proposing officials. In any event, the record here reflects that the agency replaced Ms. Edwards because it did not agree with the chosen course of disciplinary action against the appellant, not because it was not practical for her to serve as the proposing official. An agency is required to follow its own rules, including the ELM, regardless of whether those rules go beyond the requirements of government-wide statutes and regulations. <span class="Italic">Latham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 26 (2012). Therefore, while the agency may have otherwise had the discretion to replace Ms. Edwards as the proposing official, the ELM restricts such action here. Accordingly, we find that the agency committed procedural error when it replaced Ms. Edwards as the proposing official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Harmful error cannot be presumed; an agency error is harmful only where the record shows that the procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Bair v. Department of Defense</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 374, &#x00B6; 8 (2012). Here, Ms. Edwards testified that she would not have issued the appellant any discipline based upon her belief that the appellant acted in self-defense. The agency's violation of the ELM, therefore, caused it to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. Accordingly, we find that the agency's substitution of proposing officials constitutes harmful procedural error. Under these circumstances, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A), we must reverse the agency's action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Turner v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 565, &#x00B6; 9 (2000).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]gency officials could reasonably conclude that Ms. Edwards would not be objective in determining what discipline, if any, to impose on the appellant. Agency management needed to determine whether the appellant was culpable or had acted in self-defense during her June 7, 2010 encounter with Ms. Gillum, yet prior to that date Ms. Edwards had already formed an opinion that Ms. Gillum presented a threat to other employees and had tried unsuccessfully to have her barred from agency premises. It is entirely understandable for agency officials to have doubted that Ms. Edwards or anyone else at the appellant's postal facility was in a good position to judge whether the appellant's actions toward Ms. Gillum on June 7, 2010 were justified. Indeed, an agency official at the Northeast Area level decided to take the appellant's case completely out of the hands of local officials, i.e., Ms. Edwards and Plant Manager Carolyn Davis, because she believed that Ms. Davis was not "objective." This amounts to a determination that it was "impractical" for Edwards to serve as the proposing official. Such a determination, which the Board is in no position to second-guess, was within the agency's discretion under agency regulations. I would therefore conclude that the agency did not commit procedural error under its regulations when it replaced Ms. Edwards with Ms. Flagg.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I would further find that the agency's decision to replace Ms. Edwards with Ms. Flagg was timely made. When an agency rule provides that an employee's first-line supervisor will normally propose an adverse action, the agency commits procedural error if it designates a different proposing official after the first-line supervisor "had made up his mind what the proposed discipline should be." <span class="Italic">Boddie v. Department of the Navy</span>, 827 F.2d 1578, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Here, e-mail records show that an agency official at the Area level decided to replace Ms. Edwards at 6:49 <span class="small">A.M.</span> on July 8, 2010. Ms. Edwards interviewed the appellant that same day, and testified that she had not made up her mind about what action to take before the interview. Since the appellant, who bears the burden of proving her claim of harmful procedural error by preponderant evidence, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(iii) &#x0026; (b)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(C) and (c)(i)], has not shown or even alleged that Ms. Edwards met with the appellant and made up her mind about what discipline should be proposed very early in the morning of July 8, 2010, i.e., before 6:49 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, the agency's decision to replace Ms. Edwards was made in a timely fashion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Rose v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 232, 236-38 (1986), the proposing official noticed a removal. The deciding official reduced the removal to a suspension; before the suspension was served, however, the action was canceled and the proposing official again noticed a removal and designated a different deciding official. The appellant was then removed. On appeal, the removal was reversed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, we note first that the agency did not clearly explain why it changed deciding officials when it reinstituted the charges against the appellant. Although the proposing official stated that he chose the second deciding official in order to bring someone removed from the situation into that role, he failed to explain the need for such a person. There is no indication that the first deciding official was for any reason unavailable to act on the reinstituted removal action or that his actions in the first removal action were in any way injudicious or unwarranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the agency does not explain why an increased penalty is justified. Although the agency conducted a supplemental investigation into the charges against the appellant, the second deciding official did not rely on information obtained in that investigation. Moreover, we find that the supplemental investigation did not produce evidence weighing against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These concerns of the Board are factors important to a determination of whether the penalty imposed by the agency was within the parameters of reasonableness.... We find that the decision by the deciding official in the first adverse action, has evidentiary weight with regard to the propriety of the penalty imposed against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The removal decision failed to consider many of the factors weighed in the rescinded mitigation decision, and did not counter them in any way....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In the absence of an explanation for the substitution of deciding officials and for the increased penalty based on the same sustained charges and the same probative evidence against the appellant, we find that the agency has not met its burden to establish that the penalty of removal falls within the bounds of reasonableness in this case....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An unjustified switch in deciding officials resulted in mitigation of removal to the suspension recommended by the first deciding official, <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 646, 648-51 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cheney v. Department of Justice</span>, 720 F.2d 1280, 1283 (1983), the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit discussed an agency's substitution of deciding officials. The court found that any procedural error in the substitution was harmless because the decision by the initial official had always been subject to the approval of the second deciding official. During the course of the discussion, however, the court noted that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[Presenting the same case to two different deciding officials] may seem intrinsically unfair, at least on paper. That is, an accused employee may labor to convince a "deciding official" before whom he stands, and make an exceptionally favorable impression, which he could not reproduce at another time. The story may become a little shopworn if it has to be repeated to another, while the benefit of the favorable personal impression may be wholly lost if the new <span id="Page_3306"></span>"deciding official" is stationed at a distance and insulated from the effects of personal contact. It is a "heads I win, tails you lose" proposition in that, of course, the [second] official would not have seriously considered removing the [first] "deciding official" if the latter had been wholly unimpressed by [the appellant's] defense.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board addressed this issue in <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of the Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 232 (1986). In <span class="Italic">Rose</span>, a deciding official, with final approval authority, mitigated a penalty from a proposed removal to a suspension. The agency subsequently cancelled the decision and instituted another proceeding with a different deciding official who effected the employee's removal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 234. Although the agency had not committed procedural error, the Board found that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[i]n the absence of an explanation for the substitution of deciding officials and for the increased penalty based on the same sustained charges and the same probative evidence against the appellant,...the agency [has] not met its burden to establish that the penalty of removal falls within the bounds of reasonableness in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 238.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge correctly found that the agency did not meet its burden of showing the reasonableness of the penalty because it had not provided sufficient explanation for the substitution of a different deciding official and the imposition of a harsher penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In defense of its actions, the agency claims on petition for review that the substitution occurred because of the first official's failure to follow agency procedure and properly outline the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors considered in the mitigation of the penalty. The agency notes that the first official simply notified the personnel office of his decision and did not elaborate on his reasoning; therefore, the personnel office was unable to draft the formal letter. The first official testified, however (and the agency does not deny) that forwarding a decision to the personnel office for the drafting of a formal letter was within the normal operating procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the lack of specificity concerning the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the agency does not explain why it could not contact the first deciding official on his temporary duty assignment to obtain the required information, or complete the letter when he returned. As noted by the administrative judge, the subsequent proceedings by the second deciding official occurred after the first official had returned to his normal assignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also focuses on the fact that the first official considered the hiring freeze in effect at the time of the proceedings when deciding to mitigate the penalty. He was concerned that the agency would not have been able to rehire in that position if the appellant had been removed. Contrary to the agency's argument, nothing precludes the consideration of such a factor in the determination of a penalty, although, because it is not a factor directly relevant to either the offense or the appellant, it may generally deserve less weight. The first official testified that he considered the magnitude of the appellant's conduct (involving only $12.75) along with the personnel situation. Thus, the official apparently found that the appellant's conduct was not sufficiently egregious so as to require removal despite the workforce considerations of the agency. The official also questioned coworkers and found that the impact of the appellant retaining her position would be minimal. Further, as noted by the administrative judge, the first official arrived at his decision after warnings that mitigation based on the hiring freeze was inappropriate, and reaffirmed his decision at the hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency next argues that the first decision was not official because any decision was subject to review by the personnel office. The personnel office, however, was not empowered to make a determination of penalty nor to approve the penalty decided upon by the first official. The province of the personnel office was to ensure that the action met all personnel requirements procedurally, not to decide upon a penalty. Thus, contrary to the agency's argument, this case does not factually resemble <span class="Italic">Cheney</span>. As to the need for review of the decision by the Labor Counselor for legal supportability, consideration of the hiring freeze among other factors would not require a finding that mitigation was legal error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, while the agency argues that the first official's notification to the appellant of the decision before it was actually formally written was improper, it is not proscribed by the agency's regulations, which simply state that a written decision will be provided. The first official had directed the personnel office to prepare that written notification prior to his departure. In addition, he communicated his decision to the appellant orally because he was leaving the office for a month. Since he was the designated deciding official and had final approval authority, nothing precluded him from communicating his decision both orally and in written form.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the first deciding official considered the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and determined that a suspension of fourteen working days was reasonable. The agency has failed to submit a reasonable explanation for the substitution of the deciding officials and the imposition of a harsher penalty. Therefore, the administrative judge correctly found the penalty of removal to be unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Rose</span>, 31 MSPR at 238.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency's argument, however, that the administrative judge erroneously imposed a fourteen-(calendar) day suspension. As discussed above, the first official imposed a fourteen working day suspension. Throughout the initial decision, however, the administrative judge referred to the first official's penalty determination as a fourteen-day suspension. In addition, the thrust of the legal analysis by the administrative judge, affirmed in this Opinion and Order, is that the agency failed to provide a reasonable explanation for the substitution of officials and that, consequently, the decision of the first official should be upheld. Thus, we find that a fourteen-working day suspension is the maximum reasonable penalty under these circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">No error occurred when an agency switched the deciding official following the oral reply. A summary of the oral reply and the written reply were available to the new deciding official, although the reply official did not submit a recommendation on the proposal, called for by 5 CFR 752.404. There was no indication that a recommendation from the reply officer would have been favorable, or that if it had been, it would have been accepted. There was no harmful error either in the change in deciding officials or in the omission of a recommendation from the reply official. <span class="Italic">Monroe v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 20 MSPR 620, 620-21 (1984). <span class="Italic">Monroe</span> was affirmed on appeal, <span class="Italic">Monroe v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 770 F.2d 1044, 1047 (Fed. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Sanders [the person who took the oral reply] was reassigned within the agency, it was appropriate that he prepare a summary of the oral response by Monroe. That summary was made available to Monroe, who submitted his own response detailing points of disagreement. Both were reviewed with other materials by Zimmerman [the second deciding official] before making his decision on the proposed removal. Thus, all of the information and arguments that Monroe made in the course of his oral reply were before the deciding official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that in the conduct of the oral response hearing procedural error could be shown, Monroe still would not prevail because he has not demonstrated that the failure of Sanders to make a recommendation denied him the opportunity of "avoiding dismissal, however slim." <span class="Italic">Cheney v. Department of Justice</span>, 720 F.2d 1280, 1285 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Monroe expressed to Sanders his own preference to rely on his written response as to many matters. This response and his critique of the summary of the oral reply prepared by Sanders were before the deciding official. We are at a loss, therefore, to understand what in Monroe's case Sanders could have considered that was not also before Zimmerman.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, Monroe has not demonstrated the harmfulness of the purported error of the agency by a showing that the absence or cure of the error "might have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different than the one reached."... This burden falls on Monroe.... "The court is not required to conjure up reasons why a procedure is harmful [merely] because of a bald allegation of harmfulness alleging different reasons or none...." <span class="Italic">Cheney</span>, 702 F.2d at 1285.</p>

Dept. of Treasury</span>, DA-0752-13-0519-B-1 (NP 8/25/2016) ("The appellant claimed harmful error because the deciding official was not in her direct chain of command as required by agency policy.

He also found that the appellant failed to allege or show how the result in her case would have been different if a different deciding official had decided her case.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">No error was committed when the official who received the reply was replaced with another deciding official who received the recommendation of the person who received the reply.
