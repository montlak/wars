<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-325"><span class="space">2.</span> Covered Personnel</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Campion v. MSPB</span>, 326 F.3d 1210, 1213-14 (Fed. Cir. 2003), explained that VEOA protections extend to those with defined veterans' status:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Section 3 of the VEOA provides administrative redress for preference-eligible veterans who allege that an agency has violated a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a (2000). Specifically, that section provides for the filing of a complaint with the Secretary of Labor and, if the Secretary of Labor is unable to resolve that complaint, appeal to the Board as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)(1)A <span class="Italic">preference eligible</span> who alleges that an agency has violated such individual's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d)(1)&#x2003;If the Secretary of Labor is unable to resolve a complaint under subsection (a) within 60 days after the date on which it is filed, the complainant may elect to appeal the alleged violation to the Merit Systems Protection Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). The statutory language makes clear that &#x00A7; 3330a provides a right of appeal to the Board only to "preference eligible[s]." Campion has not shown, or even alleged, that he is a preference-eligible veteran within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 2108 (defining the term "preference eligible" as used in 5 U.S.C.). Accordingly, the Board correctly concluded that he has no right of appeal under &#x00A7; 3330a.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Campion argues nonetheless that &#x00A7; 3330a should be read to confer a right of appeal to the Board on all veterans who have been afforded a right of access to employment opportunities under section 2 of the VEOA. We disagree. Section 2 of the VEOA provides, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Preference eligibles or veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service</span> may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) (emphasis added). Although that section provides both veterans who are preference eligible and those who have been honorably separated from the armed forces after three or more years of active service the same opportunity to compete for vacant positions, it says nothing about the redress available for violations of that section. Instead, &#x00A7; 3330a sets forth the redress available under the VEOA, and as discussed above, the plain language of &#x00A7; 3330a prescribes a right of appeal to the Board only for preference-eligible veterans.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Styslinger v. Dept. of Army</span>, 105 MSPR 223 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 22-30 (2007) (overruled as to VEOA right to compete claim for merit promotion positions sought by federal employees, <span class="Italic">Oram v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 2022 MSPB 30 (2022)), discussing the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2004, noted that VEOA was amended by that statute to give Board appeal rights to non-preference eligible veterans honorably discharged after three or more years of service who pursue appeals under 5 USC 3304(f)(1):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have denied the appellant's PFR and his request for regulation review, we nevertheless REOPEN this appeal on our own motion pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118 to address the administrative judge's conclusion that only preference eligibles are entitled to file VEOA appeals with the Board. Prior to the enactment of the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-454 (Dec. 10, 2004) (VBIA), the VEOA afforded the right to file a complaint alleging that an agency violated the complainant's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference only to preference eligibles. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1), (d)(1) (2000); <span class="Italic">see Campion v.

Cir. 2003) ("The statutory language makes clear that &#x00A7; 3330a provides a right of appeal to the Board only to 'preference eligible[s].'"). However, the VBIA amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1) to include a new subsection (B) which provides, "A veteran described in section 3304(f)(1) who alleges that an agency has violated such section with respect to such veteran may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, "a veteran described in section 3304(f)(1)" is one who has been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service. Section 3330a(a)(1)(B) affords such a veteran the right to file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor alleging that an agency has denied him the right to compete under merit promotion procedures for a vacant position for which the agency making the announcement would have accepted applications from individuals outside its own workforce. <span class="Italic">See Brandt v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 15 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant appeal, the agency has not contested the fact that the Assistant Chief of Staff position for which the appellant applied was one for which the agency was accepting applications from individuals outside its own workforce. Furthermore, while the appellant has essentially conceded that he does not qualify as a "preference eligible" as that term is defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108, the agency has not contested the fact that the appellant's honorable discharge or release from active duty after more than 21 years of active duty service with the U.S. Army from December 17, 1982, through April 30, 2004, currently qualifies him as a "veteran" for the purposes of Title 5 of the U.S. Code. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(C), (D) (for the purposes of Title 5, the term "veteran" includes, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, an individual who has been discharged or released from active duty in the armed forces under honorable conditions and served on active duty in the armed forces during the period beginning on August 2, 1990, and ending on January 2, 1992, or served on active duty at any time for a period of more than 180 consecutive days any part of which occurred during the period beginning on September 11, 2001, and ending on the date prescribed by Presidential proclamation or by law as the last date of Operation Iraqi Freedom).[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Subsection 2108(1), which was originally derived from the provisions of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, ch. 287, &#x00A7; 2, 58 Stat. 387 (1944), sets out the meaning of the term "veteran" for the purposes of "this title," i.e., title 5 of the United States Code, which includes the provisions of VEOA. The legislative histories of the VEOA and the VBIA suggest that Congress may have intended to give the term "veteran," as that term is used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) and 3330a(a)(1)(B), a broader meaning than the definition of the term set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1). <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, S. Rep. No. 108-352, at 11-12 (2004) (distinguishing veterans who would meet the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1) or (2) from veterans who have been separated from the Armed Forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service). However, to the extent that there may be some question as to whether a particular individual who does not meet the statutory definition of "veteran" set forth in &#x00A7; 2108(1) may nevertheless qualify as "veteran" for the purposes of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) and 3330a(a)(1)(B), we need not resolve that issue in this case because the record establishes that the appellant meets the definition currently set forth in &#x00A7; 2108(1) based on the dates of his service and the fact that he has been discharged or released from active duty. We also note, however, that there may be some question as to whether the appellant qualified as a "veteran" at the time he applied for the Assistant Chief of Staff position and at the time he filed this appeal (January 2, 2006). Prior to an amendment that took effect on January 6, 2006, pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-163, Div. A, Title XI, &#x00A7; 1112(a) (Jan. 6, 2006), the term "veteran" as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1) meant an individual who served on active duty during particular periods or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge had been authorized and "who had been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1) (2000). The 2006 amendment substituted the phrase "discharged or released from active duty in" for the phrase "separated from" to "clarify that veterans' preference eligibility for federal hiring authorized under section 2108(1) of title 5, United States Code, is available to military reservists who are discharged or released from active-duty service." H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 109-360, at 796 (2006), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 2006 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1678, 1834. We further note that, while Congress amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1) to make clear that a veteran need not be "separated from" the armed forces to qualify as a preference eligible, Congress did not amend 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) in a similar fashion and this subsection still applies to "veterans who have been <span class="Italic">separated from</span> the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service." (Emphasis added.) As explained <span class="Italic">infra</span>, the parties dispute whether the appellant, as a Regular Army officer who retired at the rank of Major based on his years of service, has been separated from the armed forces.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, assuming that the appellant was "separated" from the U.S. Army at the time he retired from active duty, the plain language of the VEOA would establish that the appellant, as a veteran who has been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service, had the right to file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor alleging that the agency violated his right under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) to compete for the Assistant Chief of Staff position for which he applied. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B). In addition, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1) provides that, if the Secretary of Labor is unable to resolve a complaint under subsection (a) (which would include a complaint filed by a non-preference eligible veteran under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B)) within 60 days after the date on which it is filed, the complainant may elect to appeal the alleged violation to the Board in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Board. Accordingly, by amending the VEOA to allow veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service to file complaints with the Secretary of Labor alleging violations of their rights to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), the VBIA granted the Board jurisdiction to consider an appeal filed by such a veteran, even if the veteran is not otherwise preference eligible, who, after exhausting his remedies with the Secretary of Labor, alleges that an agency violated his right under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) to compete under merit promotion procedures for a vacant position for which the agency will accept applications from outside its own workforce. Because the VBIA amended the VEOA to grant the Board jurisdiction over an appeal filed by a non-preference eligible veteran described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) who claims that an agency has violated his right to compete under that section, we find that the administrative judge erred in relying on the appellant's status as a non-preference eligible applicant <span id="Page_581"></span>for the position in question as a basis to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">A retired member of the armed forces may qualify as a veteran "who has been separated from the armed forces" for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) and 3330a(a)(1)(B).</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the fact that the appellant is not preference eligible does not deprive the Board of jurisdiction over his claim that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) by preventing him from competing for the Assistant Chief of Staff position, a question exists as to whether the appellant, who has conceded that he is not disabled and that he retired from the armed forces at the rank of Major after more than 20 years of active duty service, qualifies as a "veteran described in section 3304(f)(1)" entitled to file a VEOA complaint pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B) and (d). Subsection 3304(f)(1), by its terms, applies to veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service. The appellant has submitted a DD Form 214 which confirms that the appellant retired upon being discharged or released from active duty with the U.S. Army under honorable conditions after more than 21 years of active service, but it is not entirely clear that the appellant's retirement from the U.S. Army constitutes a "separation from the armed forces" for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) and 3330a(a)(1)(B). The appellant's DD Form 214 states that the appellant was a Regular Army (RA) officer at the time he retired, and the Army regulation this form cites as the authority for the appellant's "separation" states, "An RA Officer placed on the retired list continues to be an officer of the U.S. Army," Army Regulation 600-8-4, Officer Transfers and Discharges, &#x00A7; 6-8.a. (Apr. 12, 2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the regulation, we note that other authorities recognize that retired regular officers, such as the appellant, retain a unique relationship to the branch of the military service from which they retired. For example, Title 10 provides that a retired member of the Regular Army may be ordered to active duty by the Secretary of the Army at any time, 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 688(b)(1), and retired members of a regular component of the armed forces entitled to pay remain subject to the provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 802(a)(4). Several courts, including the United States Supreme Court, have also recognized the unique relationship that retired regular officers maintain with the branch of the military service from which they retired. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States v. Tyler</span>, 105 U.S. 244, 245 (1881) (an officer of the Army on the retired list was, by law, a part of the Army and was therefore entitled to a pay increase payable to commissioned officers below the rank of brigadier general); <span class="Italic">Adams v. United States</span>, 230 Ct. Cl. 1016 (1982) (the plaintiff, a retired regular Air Force officer who maintained his regular commission, was barred from becoming a member of the retired reserve because an Air Force manual prohibited commissioned officers of the Regular Air Force from being assigned to the retired reserve); <span class="Italic">Hooper v. United States</span>, 326 F.2d 982 (Ct. Cl. 1964) (because a retired member of a regular component of the armed forces remains subject to the exercise of jurisdiction by a military tribunal, the plaintiff was no longer entitled to retired pay after he was dismissed from the Navy as the result of a court martial); <span class="Italic">cf. Barker v. Kansas</span>, 503 U.S. 594, 599, 605 (1992) (although military retirees differed from state and local government employees because the military retirees remained in the service and were subject to restrictions and recall, the state could not discriminate against the military retirees by taxing their retirement pay when it did not tax the retirement pay of state and local government retirees, because the differences between the two groups did not justify disparate tax treatment by the state). Therefore, because Regular Army Officers on the retired list remain officers and maintain a relatively strong connection to the U.S. Army into retirement, it is not entirely clear that such an officer should be considered "separated from the armed forces" for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3304(f) and 3330a.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, upon considering the parties' responses to the show-cause order, we find, for the reasons set forth below, that regular officers on the retired list of their respective armed services have been "separated from the armed forces" for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3304(f) and 3330a. In order to determine whether the appellant qualifies as a "veteran" entitled to the benefit provided by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), we must construe the phrase "separated from the armed forces." As our reviewing court has stated on numerous occasions, "It is axiomatic that statutory construction begins with the language of the statute itself." <span class="Italic">Munson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 216 F.3d 1037, 1040 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Furthermore, a "fundamental canon of statutory construction is that, unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning." <span class="Italic">Rusin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 298, &#x00B6; 16 (2002) (quoting <span class="Italic">Perrin v. United States</span>, 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979)). However, the general rule that words in a statute must be construed in accordance with their ordinary meaning does not apply where the words have acquired a technical meaning or a definite meaning is apparent as indicated by the context of the words. <span class="Italic">See Seth-Morris v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 166, &#x00B6; 7 (2003) (citing 2A Norman J. Singer, <span class="Italic">Sutherland Statutory Construction</span> &#x00A7; 47:27 (6th ed. 2000)); <span class="Italic">see als</span>o 2A Norman J. Singer, <span class="Italic">Sutherland Statutory Construction</span> &#x00A7; 40:01 (6th ed. 2000) ("[T]he customary meaning of words will be disregarded when it is obvious from the act itself that the legislature intended that it be used in a sense different from its common meaning.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary defines the intransitive form of the verb "separate" to mean "to become divided or detached" or "to sever an association." Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary 1064 (10th ed. 2002). While the nature of the appellant's association with the U.S. Army may have changed as a result of his retirement, because the appellant remains an officer of that service, albeit on the retired list, the appellant has not become divided or detached from the armed forces, and his association with the U.S. Army has not been severed. Therefore, if the general rule that words should be construed in accordance with their ordinary meaning applied in this case, we would be constrained to find that the appellant, who remains an officer in the U.S. Army despite being retired, has not been "separated from the armed forces" as that phrase is used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) and 3330a(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the structure of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108 as it existed at the time the VEOA and the VBIA were enacted demonstrates that Congress intended the phrase "separated from the armed forces" to be used in a sense different from its common meaning for the purposes of title 5. Prior to the recent amendment of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1), <span class="Italic">see supra</span>, &#x00B6; 23 n.9, this subsection provided that the term "veteran" for the purposes of title 5 meant an individual who served on active duty in the armed forces under particular conditions and "has been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1) (1994). The phrase "preference eligible" is defined to include, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a "veteran" described in the various subparagraphs of subsection (1), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3), but, for most purposes, the statute specifically excludes a retired member of the armed forces from the definition of "preference eligible" unless the individual is a disabled veteran or retired below the rank of Major or its equivalent, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(4). The statute defines the phrase "retired member of the armed forces" to mean "a <span class="Italic">member</span> or former member of the armed forces who is entitled, under statute, to retired, retirement, or retainer pay on account of service as a member." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(5) (emphasis added). Thus, when these subsections are considered together, it is clear that, when Congress amended &#x00A7; 2108 to exclude certain retirees from the definition of "preference eligible,"[10] including a retiree such as the appellant who remained "a member...of the armed forces," it must have considered those retirees as having been separated from the armed forces. If Congress did not consider such retirees as having been separated from the armed forces, they would not have met the definition of "veteran" contained within 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1) and could not have qualified as "preference eligibles" under &#x00A7; 2108(3) based on their military service. Under such an interpretation, there would have been no need to specifically exclude them from the definition of "preference eligible" because they would have been excluded from this definition due to the fact that they would not have qualified as "veterans" who had been "separated from the armed forces." Thus, an interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108 prior to its recent amendment that would have excluded a retired regular officer from qualifying as an individual who "has been separated from the armed forces" would have rendered portions of &#x00A7; 2108(4) superfluous and redundant. Because the provisions of a statute should be read in harmony, leaving no provision inoperative, superfluous, redundant, or contradictory, <span class="Italic">see Holley</span>, 124 F.3d at 1468, we find that, when the VEOA was enacted in 1998 and the VBIA was enacted in 2004, a retired regular officer who remained a member of the armed forces qualified as an individual who "has been separated from the armed forces," as that phrase was used in &#x00A7; 2108(1) for the purpose of defining the term "veteran" for title 5 purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10] Congress enacted the exclusion of retired members of the armed forces from the definition of "preference eligible" as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, Title III, &#x00A7; 307(a)(4), (5), 92 Stat. 1111 (1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While there may be some basis to conclude that Congress intended to give the term "veteran" as used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) and 3330a(a)(1)(B) a broader definition than the definition set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1), <span class="Italic">see supra</span>, &#x00B6; 23 n.9, we have been unable to discern any basis to conclude that Congress intended to give the meaning of the phrase "separated from the armed forces" as used in &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) a more narrow application than the phrase had under &#x00A7; 2108(1). The legislative history of the VBIA does not evidence such an intent, and the provisions and the legislative history of the VEOA clearly indicate that one of the VEOA's primary purposes was to supplement the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 (VPA) by providing a mechanism through which preference eligibles could seek redress for alleged violations of the rights provided by the VPA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3330a-3330c; S.

Cir. 2003), the Federal Circuit cited <span class="Italic">Department of Revenue of Oregon v. ACF Industries, Inc.</span>, 510 U.S. 332, 342 (1994), for the proposition that "[i]t is a 'normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same <span id="Page_582"></span>act are intended to have the same meaning.'" The court further noted that this rule "has particular force 'where the words at issue are used in two different sections of a complex statutory scheme and those two sections serve the same purpose.'" <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, 331 F.3d at 1372 (citing <span class="Italic">National Organization of Veterans' Advocates, Inc. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 260 F.3d 1365, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2001)). In this case, the phrase "separated from the armed forces" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) is identical to the phrase that appeared in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1) at the time the VEOA and the VBIA were enacted. Furthermore, both sections in which the phrase appears served the same purpose, i.e., to describe the class of individuals who qualified for some benefit provided to particular veterans. Therefore, the analysis in <span class="Italic">Butler</span> supports the conclusion that the phrase "separated from the armed forces" as it appears in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) should be interpreted as having the same meaning that the identical phrase had with respect to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1), i.e., as not excluding retired regular officers who remain members of the armed forces from qualifying as "veterans." Applying this interpretation to the instant appeal, we find that the record establishes that the appellant, despite the fact that he maintains some connection to the U.S. Army as a regular officer on its retired list, qualifies as a "veteran described in section 3304(f)(1)," i.e., a veteran who has been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B).[11]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11] We also note that, when the provisions of title 5 of the United States Code treat military retirees less favorably with regard to employment-related rights or benefits than other veterans or preference eligibles, the difference in treatment is generally explicitly stated in the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3501(a)(3) (excluding certain preference eligible military retirees from being considered preference eligible for reduction in force (RIF) purposes), 3502(a) (for RIF purposes, a competing employee who is not a retired member of a uniformed service is entitled to service credit for the total length of time in active service in the armed forces, while a competing employee who is a retired member of a uniformed service, but is not considered preference eligible for RIF purposes, is only entitled to service credit for the length of time in active service in the armed forces during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized), 5595(h)(2)(B) (denying the resumption of severance pay to a separated employee who would otherwise be eligible for such benefit if such employee, upon separation, is entitled to immediate payment of retired or retainer pay as a member or former member of the uniformed services), and 6303(a)(3) (denying service credit for annual leave accrual purposes to certain employees who are retired members of a uniformed service).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the agency renews its argument that the Board does not have jurisdiction over this appeal because the agency is exempt from the requirements of Title 5 of the U.S. Code pursuant to the agency's authorizing statute, at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 903(i). That provision states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board shall, without regard to the provisions of Title 5 relating to the competitive service, appoint a Staff Director who shall be paid at a rate equivalent to a rate established for the Senior Executive Service under section 5382 of Title 5. The Board shall appoint such additional personnel as the Board determines to be necessary to provide adequate support for the Board, and may compensate such additional personnel without regard to the provisions of Title 5 relating to the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first sentence of the cited section clearly exempts the agency from the requirements of Title 5 relating to the competitive service with respect to the appointment of a Staff Director. The agency argues that the second sentence should be construed as providing the agency with an exception from the requirements of Title 5 relating to the competitive service with respect to the appointment of additional personnel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. The second sentence states that the agency may compensate additional personnel without regard to the provisions of Title 5 relating to the competitive service. It does not state that the agency may appoint additional personnel without regard to the provisions of Title 5 relating to the competitive service. If Congress had intended to exempt the agency from the provisions of Title 5 relating to the competitive service with regard to the appointment of additional personnel, then presumably it would have structured the second sentence in the same way as the first.
