<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-378"><span id="page_2407"></span><span class="space">4.</span> Failure to Discuss All Charges, Evidence, Issues</h4>
<p class="noindent">FLRA takes the approach under <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chap. 24 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995), that it reviews awards for legal error <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, and to accomplish that task FLRA expects sufficient factfinding by an arbitrator to support the legal conclusions embraced by the award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1437 and Dept. of Army, ARDEC</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1709-10 (1998). As a result of <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1437,</span> and kindred cases, some earlier decisions of FLRA accepting extremely abbreviated factual and legal analyses by arbitrators would likely not pass muster if reviewed today. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-166.html#sec9-164">Contrary to Law; Award is Inconsistent With Law, Rule, or Regulation</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-17-128.html#sec9-126">Nature of the Exception</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Assuming that the exceptions do not present legal issues requiring complex factual analysis, and assuming that a monetary award is not involved, FLRA traditionally defers to awards that resolve claims with or without complex analysis. An award is not deficient because the arbitrator fails to make specific findings of fact. <span class="Italic">PTO and POPA</span>, 32 FLRA 1168, 1174 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Pine Bluff Arsenal and AFGE Local 953</span>, 34 FLRA 293, 295 (1990) ("The Arbitrator was not obligated...to set forth findings or rationale more extensive than he did to support the award denying the grievance."). An arbitrator's failure to set forth specific findings or to specify and discuss all allegations in a grievance does not provide a basis for finding an award deficient. <span class="Italic">Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots, Marine Div., ILA, Canal Pilots Branch and Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 39 FLRA 707, 715 (1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRB Union</span>, 48 FLRA 1337, 1346-47 (1994) ("Further, we note that "[a]n arbitrator's failure to set forth specific findings, or to specify and discuss all allegations in a grievance, does not provide a basis for finding an award deficient....In this regard, an arbitrator is not required to specify or discuss specific items of evidence on which an award is based or which otherwise were considered by the arbitrator."); <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 259 and Dept. of Army Corps of Eng'rs, Memphis Dist.</span>, 45 FLRA 773, 779 (1992) ("In making the overall finding...the Arbitrator was not required to address specifically every argument that the Agency violated the agreement..."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">DOD, DCMA and AFGE Local 2128</span>, 59 FLRA 396, 404 (2003) (arbitrators are not obligated to provide rationale for their findings unless required to do so by contract, submission of parties, or law); <span class="Italic">accord,</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat. Border Patrol Council Local 2455 and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 62 FLRA 37, 39 (2007) (same as <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2128</span>). "[A]n arbitrator is not required to specify or discuss particular items of evidence that were considered." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1867 and Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Academy</span>, 59 FLRA 737, 738 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent">Factual and legal findings may be implied from other findings, as FLRA determined concerning the assertion that the arbitrator failed to determine a claim of discrimination as to challenged performance rating, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3911 and EPA Region 2</span>, 64 FLRA 686, 687 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by an exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 24,</span> 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv. v. FLRA,</span> 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable legal standard. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Def. Dep'ts of the Army &#x0026; the Air Force, Ala. Nat'l Guard Northport, Ala.,</span> 55 FLRA 37, 40 (1998) (<span class="Italic">DOD</span>). In this regard, an arbitrator's failure to apply a particular legal analysis "does not render [an] award deficient because...in applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether the arbitrator's legal <span class="Italic">conclusions</span> are consistent with law, based on the underlying factual findings." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council,</span> 54 FLRA 905, 910 n.6 (1998).

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator made factual findings that the Union had not demonstrated that the grievant's performance was rated improperly. As noted above, in analyzing whether the award is contrary to law, we defer to the Arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See DOD,</span> 55 FLRA at 40. The Arbitrator's finding that the grievant's rating was not improper establishes that the Agency had a legitimate basis for its rating of the grievant. In this context, it follows that the Arbitrator's statement that the discrimination claims were "moot" is, effectively, a conclusion that the rating was not discriminatory. The Union provides no basis for finding this conclusion contrary to law. Accordingly, we deny the exception.</p>

<p class="noindent">Although the arbitrator's reasoning need not be lengthy, there must be some reasoning to explain whether a grievance has been sustained based on a violation of contract or law or regulation and, if so, what is the appropriate remedy. Even expedited arbitrations must conform to that requirement, <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 64 FLRA 516, 519 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We acknowledge that the parties' agreement does not require the Arbitrator in an expedited arbitration to state explicitly all of his findings as part of his decision. Thus, it is possible that the Arbitrator had a basis for setting aside the suspension that is not specified in his written award. However, we also note that Article 25, Section 7(C) of the parties' agreement states that the arbitrator "shall include a brief written explanation of the decision." It seems reasonable to infer that this requirement for a written explanation includes an unstated corollary requirement that such explanation be internally consistent, which this award is not. Because we are unable to determine whether the award is deficient in this regard, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for clarification of the basis for the remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">Remands may occur when an arbitrator fails to resolve an issue essential to determine if an award draws its essence from the contract, as in <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;IS, and AFGE Local 4014</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-69.html">73 FLRA 354</a>, 354–55 (2022), involving application of a contract time limit for an arbitrator's resolution of a counsel fee request:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Where an arbitrator has not made sufficient factual findings for the Authority to assess or determine an Arbitrator's legal conclusions, and those findings cannot be derived from the record, the Authority will remand the award to the parties for further action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2054,</span> 63 FLRA 169, 172 (2009); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., Maritime Admin.,</span> 61 FLRA 816, 822 (2006); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1437,</span> 53 FLRA 1703, 1710-11 (1998).

<p class="noindent">Remanded was <span class="Italic">SBA and AFGE Local 2959</span>, 70 FLRA 649, 651-52 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator's conclusions are unsupported. For example, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency violated Article 37 by issuing the two-day suspension. Although the Arbitrator asserted that her conclusion was based on "all of the evidence presented, including the credibility of the witnesses," she did not indicate: what evidence she considered; how she balanced that evidence; whose testimony she credited; or on what bases she made her credibility determinations. As a result, the Arbitrator failed to sufficiently support her determination that the Agency did not have "just and sufficient cause" to issue the suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, in concluding that the Agency violated Article 37 by failing to expeditiously "initiate[&#8197;]" the suspension, the Arbitrator referenced only the date on which the Agency issued the suspension--December 15, 2015. But, as noted in other portions of the award, the grievant's first-line and second-line supervisors discussed disciplining the grievant as early as June 1, 2015; the Agency was "in the process of" disciplining the grievant on July 31, 2015; and the Agency proposed suspending the grievant on September 16, 2015. The Arbitrator, however, did not explain why she considered that evidence insufficient to establish that the Agency timely initiated the suspension under Article 37.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Arbitrator also concluded that the Agency created a "hostile work environment" for the grievant, "violated the [grievant's] privacy," and did not have "just cause" to issue--and "acted in bad faith" by issuing--the letter of warning. However, the Arbitrator did not indicate whether those conclusions represented statutory or contractual violations. If contractual, then the Arbitrator should have identified articles of the master agreement and discussed the evidence upon which she relied to conclude that the Agency violated those articles.[35] And if those violations were statutory, then the Arbitrator should have identified the relevant laws and applied the appropriate legal standards.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[35]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3974</span>, 67 FLRA 306, 308 (2014) (it is "critical to <span id="page_2408"></span>ascertain whether [an] [a]rbitrator addressed" a contractual issue or a statutory issue because if "he addressed a statutory issue, [then] he [would be] required to apply...statutory...principles"); <span class="Italic">Local 3506</span>, 64 FLRA at 584-85 (where it was unclear whether arbitrator resolved contractual or statutory issues, and arbitrator did not make sufficient factual findings for the Authority to "assess or determine" the arbitrator's conclusions, Authority remanded the award).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Concerning the violations of Articles 11 and 12, Article 11 provides, in relevant part, that the Union shall be given the opportunity to be present at any "formal discussion," consistent with &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, and Article 12 concerns official time. The Arbitrator did not explain why, under the Statute or either of those articles, the grievant was entitled to Union representation at the performance reviews.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Arbitrator: failed to support the conclusion that the Union did not act in bad faith during the grievance process;provided no explanation as to how the Agency violated Article 27 by issuing the suspension; failed to identify any particular section of Article 28 that the Agency violated with regard to the grievant's performance appraisal; and did not discuss the relevant legal standard in concluding that the Agency violated &#x00A7; 7116 of the Statute by "retaliati[ng]" against the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the awarded remedy of attorney fees with interest, the Authority has long held that, when resolving a request for attorney fees, arbitrators must set forth specific findings supporting their determinations "on each pertinent statutory requirement."[45] One of the prerequisites for an award of attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g) is that the award of fees be warranted in the interest of justice.[46] While the Arbitrator appeared to address &#x00A7; 7701(g)'s interest-of-justice requirement by finding that the grievant was "substantially innocent," the Arbitrator did not discuss the applicable legal standard.[48] Nor did she provide any reasoning for awarding interest. Accordingly, there is not a sufficiently articulated basis for the awarded remedy.[50]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing an arbitrator's interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement, the Statute provides that the Authority apply the deferential standard of review that Federal courts use in reviewing arbitration awards in the private sector. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a)(2). Under this standard, the Authority will find that an arbitration award is deficient as failing to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement when the appealing party establishes that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See United States</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Labor (OSHA) and National Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 34 FLRA 573, 575 (1990). The Authority and the courts defer to arbitrators in this context "because it is the arbitrator's construction of the agreement for which the parties have bargained<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 576.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union does not claim that the arbitrator misinterpreted a controlling provision of the agreement. Rather, the Union claims that the issue resolved by the Arbitrator under Article 4 of the agreement is actually controlled by Article 7 of the agreement, which was not interpreted by the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 7 of the agreement provides that negotiations to "add to, amend, or modify" the agreement may be "conducted only by mutual consent" of the parties. This requirement that negotiation over mid-term changes to the agreement be "only by mutual consent" would appear to limit "management-initiated changes" proposed under Article 4. However, without discussing Article 7, the Arbitrator found that management-initiated changes were "not limited."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It appears that there may be a conflict between the Arbitrator's interpretation of Article 4 and the terms of Article 7. At the very least, any interpretation of Article 4 must take into account the "mutual consent" provision of Article 7. The Arbitrator's decision fails to take this language into account. Absent findings by the Arbitrator on this matter, we are unable to determine whether the award is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the private sector, where "the arbitrator fails to discuss critical contract terminology, which terminology might reasonably require an opposite result, the award cannot be considered to draw its essence from the contract." <span class="Italic">Cannelton Industries v. District 17, UMWA</span>, 951 F.2d 591, 594 (4th Cir. 1991) (quoting <span class="Italic">Clinchfield Coal Co. v.

International Union, UAW</span>, 734 F.2d 321, 326 n.5 (7th Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">Young Radiator</span>). The practice of the courts in such circumstances of "critical ambiguity," <span class="Italic">Cannelton Industries</span>, 951 F.2d at 594, is to remand the dispute to the arbitrator, despite the "general rule...that a reviewing court should either enforce or vacate an arbitration award," <span class="Italic">Young Radiator</span>, 734 F.2d at 326.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has not previously decided a case where it appeared that there was an inconsistency between the agreement and the award at issue, but the relevant contract language was not interpreted by the arbitrator. However, no basis to depart from the private sector approach is argued or apparent. Accordingly, in this case and similar future cases, we will follow the practice in the private sector and remand such awards for the arbitrator to address the contract provision in dispute. A remand in such cases permits the arbitrator, who was the parties' choice to interpret and apply their agreement, to interpret in the first instance the provision that may be dispositive of the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In remanding the Arbitrator's award in this particular situation, we do not alter our practice of deferring to an arbitrator's interpretation of contract language and finding awards deficient when they fail to draw their essence from the parties' collective bargaining agreement. A remand is only appropriate in the unusual situation where it appears that the agreement and award are inconsistent, and the Authority is unable to assess the arbitrator's interpretation of relevant contract provisions.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">There appears to be a conflict between the Arbitrator's interpretation of Section 5(A)(1)-(2) and the plain terms of Section 5(A)(11). At the very least, any interpretation of Section 5 must take into account the "starting and leaving times" language in paragraph 11. The Arbitrator did not take paragraph 11 into account. Absent findings by the Arbitrator on this matter, we are unable to determine whether the award is deficient. Accordingly, we remand this matter to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to consider Article 14, Section 5(A)(11), in her interpretation of the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an interpretation of a contract provision appears to conflict with another provision within the same contract, the arbitrator must take the conflict into account or FLRA may remand the case for resubmission to the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 57 FLRA 690, 694 (2002) (grievance concerning nonpromotion; contract limitation concerning remedy of priority consideration: "[W]here an interpretation of a contract provision appears to conflict with another provision within the same contract, an arbitrator must take this conflict into account.").</p>

The grievance challenged discipline against an employee for failure to follow a reporting policy. The entire award was: "The grievance must be denied. The penalty imposed was reasonable." The award was not accompanied by any opinion or discussion. It did contain a signature of the arbitrator's name followed by the initials of the person who typed the award.

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Wissman v. Social Security Administration</span>, 848 F.2d 176 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the court discussed requirements as to the form of an arbitration award.

<p class="noindent-1">There is no obligation under the Statute that an arbitration award must be signed by the arbitrator.&#x2003;Moreover, the Union fails to establish that the award issued to the parties was not the award of the Arbitrator resolving the grievance submitted. The Union also fails to establish that the typed award denying the grievance because the penalty was reasonable does not constitute a written decision as assertedly required by the parties' collective bargaining agreement.</p>

The Authority previously has determined that arbitrators are not obligated to provide a rationale for their findings unless required to do so by contract, submission of the parties, or law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, North Carolina and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1770</span>, 41 FLRA 56 (1991) (arbitrator not obligated to discuss reasons in support of legal conclusion). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Wissman</span>, 848 F.2d at 178 ("[i]f there is no contractual or statutory obligation, an arbitrator is not required to set forth findings of fact, much less the specific findings"). In this case, there is no argument and no evidence that the parties' collective bargaining agreement or their submission to the Arbitrator required specific findings on the issue before him. There also is no argument, and it is not otherwise apparent, that there are statutory or regulatory requirements obligating the Arbitrator to set forth specific findings or rationale in support of his decision.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC, Newington</span>, 46 FLRA 451, 454-57 (1992), involving a challenge to a performance appraisal, noted that, counsel fee cases (or other awards conferring monetary benefits) aside, arbitrators need not spell out their awards with great specificity. Errors in the discussion leading to the award do not result in the award being set aside if the errors are not central to the result reached:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will find an award deficient when it is incomplete, ambiguous, or so contradictory as to make implementation of the award impossible. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Southeastern District and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2519</span>, 40 FLRA 937, 943 (1991). In this case, we find no basis for concluding that the award is deficient on these grounds. As the award denied the grievance, implementation of the award clearly is possible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, in cases such as the one before us "[a]n arbitrator's failure to set forth specific findings, or to specify and discuss all allegations in a grievance, does not provide a basis for finding an award deficient."<span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office and Patent Office Professional Association</span>, 41 FLRA 1042, 1049 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Patent Office</span>). In this regard, an arbitrator is not required to specify or discuss specific items of evidence on which an award is based or which otherwise were considered by the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Charleston Naval Shipyard, Charleston, South Carolina and Federal Employees Metal Trades Council</span>, 39 FLRA 987, 993 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Union points out, awards involving requests for attorney fees under the Back Pay Act are deficient unless, as relevant here, they are fully articulated and reasoned and contain certain findings and determinations....&#8197;However, the Union's exception provides no basis, and none is otherwise apparent to us, for extending such requirements to other awards. <span class="Italic">See generally</span>, <span class="Italic">Wissman v. Social Security Administration</span>, 848 F.2d 176, 178 (Fed. Cir. 1988) ("If there is no contractual or statutory obligation, an arbitrator is not required to set forth findings of fact, much less...specific findings...."). Accordingly, we conclude that this Union exception provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]here is no basis on which to conclude that, even if the Arbitrator misconstrued Authority precedent, that error was central to the award. In this regard, the Arbitrator did not find the grievance nonarbitrable. Further, the Arbitrator expressly found that exhibits at the arbitration hearing "show[ed] conclusively that [the] performance standards [met] <span id="page_2410"></span>all the requirements" of OPM and the MSPB. It is not clear, therefore, that the Arbitrator would have reached a different decision but for his statement regarding Authority precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]t is long established that mere disagreement with an arbitrator's reasoning accompanying an award does not provide a basis for finding an award deficient. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 41 FLRA at 212. Indeed, as noted previously, there is no requirement in cases such as this one that arbitrators set forth any specific findings or analysis in an opinion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Patent Office</span>, 41 FLRA at 1049. As such, it would be incongruous to review, and find an award deficient on the basis of, such opinion or analysis. <span class="Italic">See Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel</span>, 363 U.S. 593, 598 (1960) (Supreme Court explained that, to encourage arbitrators to give reasons for awards, an arbitrator's reasoning is not a basis for finding an award deficient; requiring opinions free from ambiguity would lead arbitrators to "play it safe" by not writing opinions). <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, North Carolina and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1770</span>, 41 FLRA 62 (1991) (Authority could not determine whether arbitrator's refusal to enforce a provision of a collective bargaining agreement was based on erroneous interpretation of law and regulation; Authority remanded the award to parties for resubmission to the arbitrator).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOD, DCMA and AFGE Local 2128</span>, 59 FLRA 396, 404 (2003) (if arbitrator's findings were inconsistent with remedy, "the Agency has not demonstrated that it is impossible to comply with the award"); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1869 and Dept. of Air Force, Charleston AFB</span>, 50 FLRA 172, 174 (1995) (restating limitations on FLRA review of reasoning of award).</p>
<p class="noindent">In some types of grievances FLRA insists that awards provide reasonably detailed explanations of how arbitrators arrived at their results. FLRA expects that when an arbitrator awards back pay for overtime or counsel fees that the arbitrator provide explanation sufficient to show that the grievants' claims and proof met the statutory criteria governing the awards of compensation. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">DOD, DLA, Defense Distribution Region W., Stockton and AFGE Local 1857</span>, 48 FLRA 221, 223-24 (1993) (summary award of overtime set aside for lack of specificity). [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-232.html#sec9-230">Overtime Compensation</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-17-417.html#sec9-415">Reasonable Rate; Time Reasonably Invested; Location of Counsel; Travel Time and Expenses</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">The decisions just discussed concern allegations that the arbitrator failed to discuss some factual issues or that the arbitrator failed to resolve some subsidiary legal issues. What occurs when the arbitrator fails to resolve a principal claim that is before him, i.e., one of two or more disciplinary actions against a grievant? If the parties have stipulated that the arbitrator has jurisdiction over the claim, the arbitrator is not to disregard the stipulation, as <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Oklahoma City Dist. and NTEU Chap. 45</span>, 37 FLRA 775, 781-82 (1990), remanding a case to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record in the case shows that the parties clearly stipulated the issues to be arbitrated, including the validity of the second 14-day suspension....&#8197;The Arbitrator had no authority to look behind the stipulation of the parties or to ignore the stipulation in deciding the case before him....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator was required to render his award on the issues that were properly stipulated by the parties....&#8197;[I]n light of the parties' express stipulation, the Agency's reference in its post-hearing brief to the issue of arbitrability regarding the second suspension...is insufficient to put the matter before the Arbitrator....</p>
