<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-142"><span class="space">10.</span> Constitution</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming no other basis exists for judicial review of agency personnel decisions, the Constitution may furnish the basis for consideration of constitutional claims. The lawsuit based on constitutional claims assumes a constitutionally protected interest. Property interests secured by the Constitution may arise from understandings, statutes, or rules that secure benefits and support claims of entitlement to those benefits<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Doe v. Gates</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>. If a plaintiff makes a case that a transfer was a pretext to suppress his First Amendment rights, he may be able to prevail in a resulting challenge to a dismissal based on his refusal to accept the transfer. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Singer v. Civil Serv. Comm'n</span>, 530 F.2d 247, 253 (9th Cir. 1976) ("As a probationary employee appellant had no right <span class="Italic">per se</span> to continued employment. However, even though a person has no 'right' to a valuable government benefit and 'even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons,' it may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests--especially his interest in freedom of speech."); <span class="Italic">Sexton v. Kennedy</span>, 523 F.2d 1311, 1315 (6th Cir. 1975) (although the court would consider First Amendment issues, the reassignment of the employee was established to be rationally based). The Director of the CIA may terminate employees when he deems it necessary in the interest of national security. There is no review by the MSPB. An employee claiming that dismissal by that agency violated constitutional interests could pursue a claim directly in court. <span class="Italic">Webster v. Doe</span>, 108 S. Ct. 2047 (1988), <span class="Italic">on remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Doe v. Gates</span>, 981 F.2d 1316, 1320 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (no constitutionally protected employment interest arising out of statements in agency handbooks that were contrary to the broad dismissal authority vested in the agency by statute). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-24-151.html#sec17-147">Injunction Action</a>," for constitutional claims in the courts.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In addition to First Amendment considerations, there are interests established by the Constitution that should not be denied without due process. Those interests are generally characterized as liberty interests and property interests. A leading case outlining both is <span class="Italic">Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth</span>, 408 U.S. 564, 572-79 (1972), stemming from nonrenewal of a teaching appointment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">While this Court has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty...guaranteed [by the Fourteenth Amendment], the term has received much consideration and some of the included things have been definitely stated. Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint, but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized...as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Meyer v. Nebraska,</span> 262 U.S. 390, 399. In a Constitution for a free people, there can be no doubt that the meaning of "liberty" must be broad indeed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bolling v. Sharpe,</span> 347 U.S. 497, 499-500; <span class="Italic">Stanley v. Illinois,</span> U.S. 405 U.S. 645.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There might be cases in which a State refused to reemploy a person under such circumstances that interests in liberty would be implicated. But this is not such a case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The State, in declining to rehire the respondent, did not make any charge against him that might seriously damage his standing and associations in his community. It did not base the nonrenewal of his contract on a charge, for example, that he had been guilty of dishonesty, or immorality. Had it done so, this would be a different case. For "[w]here a person's good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him, notice and an opportunity to be heard are essential." <span class="Italic">Wisconsin v. Constantineau</span>, 400 U.S. 433, 437. <span class="Italic">Wieman v. Updegraff</span>, 344 U.S. 183, 191; <span class="Italic">Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath</span>, 341 U.S. 123; <span class="Italic">United States v. Lovett</span>, 328 U.S. 303, 316-317; <span class="Italic">Peters v. Hobby</span>, 349 U.S. 331, 352 (DOUGLAS, J., concurring). <span class="Italic">See Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy</span>, 367 U.S. 886, 898. In such a case, due process would accord an opportunity to refute the charge before University officials. In the present case, however, there is no suggestion whatever that the respondent's "good name, reputation, honor, or integrity" is at stake.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, there is no suggestion that the State, in declining to reemploy the respondent, imposed on him a stigma or other disability that foreclosed his freedom to take advantage of other employment opportunities. The State, for example, did not invoke any regulations to bar the respondent from all other public employment in state universities. Had it done so, this, again, would be a different case. For "[t]o be deprived not only of present government employment but of future opportunity for it certainly is no small injury...." <span class="Italic">Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath, supra,</span> at 185 (Jackson, J., concurring). <span class="Italic">See Truax v. Raich,</span> 239 U.S. 33, 41. The Court has held, for example, that a State, in regulating eligibility for a type of professional employment, cannot foreclose a range of opportunities "in a manner...that contravene[s] ...Due Process," <span class="Italic">Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners,</span> 353 U.S. 232, 238, and, specifically, in a manner that denies the right to a full prior hearing. <span class="Italic">Willner v. Committee on Character,</span> 373 U.S. 96, 103. <span class="Italic">See Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy, supra,</span> at 898. In the present case, however, this principle does not come into play.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, the respondent has alleged that the nonrenewal of his contract was based on his exercise of his right to freedom of speech. But this allegation is not now before us. The District Court stayed proceedings on this issue, and the respondent has yet to prove that the decision not to rehire him was, in fact, based on his free speech activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hence, on the record before us, all that clearly appears is that the respondent was not rehired for one year at one university. It stretches the concept too far to suggest that a person is deprived of "liberty" when he simply is not rehired in one job, but remains as free as before to seek another. <span class="Italic">Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy, supra,</span> at 895-896.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Fourteenth Amendment's procedural protection of property is a safeguard of the security of interests that a person has already acquired in specific benefits. These interests--property interests--may take many forms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the Court has held that a person receiving welfare benefits under statutory and administrative standards defining eligibility for them has an interest in continued receipt of those benefits that is safeguarded by procedural due process. <span class="Italic">Goldberg v. Kelly,</span> 397 U.S. 254. <span class="Italic">See Flemming v. Nestor,</span> 363 U.S. 603, 611. Similarly, in the area of public employment, the Court has held that a public college professor dismissed from an office held under tenure provisions, <span class="Italic">Slochower v. Board of Education,</span> 350 U.S. 551, and college professors and staff members dismissed during the terms of their contracts, <span class="Italic">Wieman v. Updegraff,</span> 344 U.S. 183, have interests in continued employment that are safeguarded by due process. Only last year, the Court held that this principle "proscribing summary <span id="Page_5381"></span>dismissal from public employment without hearing or inquiry required by due process" also applied to a teacher recently hired without tenure or a formal contract, but nonetheless with a clearly implied promise of continued employment. <span class="Italic">Connell v. Higginbotham,</span> 403 U.S. 207, 208.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Certain attributes of "property" interests protected by procedural due process emerge from these decisions. To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it. It is a purpose of the ancient institution of property to protect those claims upon which people rely in their daily lives, reliance that must not be arbitrarily undermined. It is a purpose of the constitutional right to a hearing to provide an opportunity for a person to vindicate those claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Property interests, of course, are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law--rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits. Thus, the welfare recipients in <span class="Italic">Goldberg v. Kelly, supra,</span> had a claim of entitlement to welfare payments that was grounded in the statute defining eligibility for them. The recipients had not yet shown that they were, in fact, within the statutory terms of eligibility. But we held that they had a right to a hearing at which they might attempt to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Just as the welfare recipients' "property" interest in welfare payments was created and defined by statutory terms, so the respondent's "property" interest in employment at Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh was created and defined by the terms of his appointment. Those terms secured his interest in employment up to June 30, 1969. But the important fact in this case is that they specifically provided that the respondent's employment was to terminate on June 30. They did not provide for contract renewal absent "sufficient cause." Indeed, they made no provision for renewal whatsoever.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the terms of the respondent's appointment secured absolutely no interest in reemployment for the next year. They supported absolutely no possible claim of entitlement to reemployment. Nor, significantly, was there any state statute or University rule or policy that secured his interest in reemployment or that created any legitimate claim to it. In these circumstances, the respondent surely had an abstract concern in being rehired, but he did not have a property interest sufficient to require the University authorities to give him a hearing when they declined to renew his contract of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IV</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our analysis of the respondent's constitutional rights in this case in no way indicates a view that an opportunity for a hearing or a statement of reasons for nonretention would, or would not, be appropriate or wise in public colleges and universities. For it is a written Constitution that we apply. Our role is confined to interpretation of that Constitution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must conclude that the summary judgment for the respondent should not have been granted, since the respondent has not shown that he was deprived of liberty or property protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board does not directly review the constitutionality of federal statutes, it does apply to appeals otherwise within its jurisdiction the principles of constitutional law, e.g., due process in appeals and free speech protections. The Board also may make factual findings necessary for a reviewing court, e.g., the Federal Circuit, to decide statutory challenges.
