<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-45"><span class="space">2.</span> Premature Appeal That Ripens Into Appealable Action During Regional Adjudication or During PFR</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">It may occur that an appeal is premature when filed, but it matures during the ongoing appellate process at the regional or field office. Guidance concerning premature appeals in the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>, Chapter 2, section 2, advises:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Premature Appeals</span>. The CAJ (or designee) must review the appeal to determine if it was prematurely filed. If it is premature by 10 days or less, the office should docket the case as a new appeal, using the receipt date of the premature appeal....&#8197;If the appeal is more than 10 days premature, the CAJ must reject the appeal using the appropriate standard form. This procedure also applies to premature compliance appeals and attorney fee motions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming there is a question, the AJ must determine whether there is, in fact, an appealable action prior to the issuance of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Cardin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 2, 6, 4 MSPB 97 (1980). The proper procedure is for the AJ to issue a "show cause" order explaining to the appellant that there is a jurisdictional issue and stating how the appellant must respond to establish jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 441, 442-43 (1991); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Siegfried v. Dept. of Navy</span>, AT-0752-16-0185-I-1 (NP 9/14/2016) (when the appellant was a couple days late filing his removal appeal, the delay was waived because he earlier filed an appeal from the removal proposal and a constructive suspension; while the earlier appeal was pending adjudication, the removal was issued: <span id="Page_918"></span>"The Board's practice is to adjudicate an appeal that was premature when filed but becomes ripe while pending before the Board. <span class="Italic">Barrios v. Department of</span> [<span class="Italic">Interior</span>], 100 M.S.P.R. 300, &#x00B6; 6 (2005); <span class="Italic">Groshans v. Department of the Navy</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 629, 632 n.2 (1995). Thus, although the administrative judge properly informed the appellant that the Board lacks jurisdiction over a proposed action and directed him to file a separate removal appeal, it would have been appropriate for her to have adjudicated or separately docketed a removal appeal once the appellant's removal had been effected and his appeal became ripe."); <span class="Italic">Barrios v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 100 MSPR 300, 302 &#x00B6; 6 (2005) ("However, when the agency effected the appellant's removal, her pending appeal became ripe for the Board's consideration. <span class="Italic">See Groshans v. Department of the Navy</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 629, 632 n.2 (1995).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency effects the action while the issue of prematurity is being litigated through a PFR, the right to appeal vests and the case can proceed through remand from the Board to the region. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 18 MSPR 26, 27 (1983). The Board explained the phenomenon of latter day vesting of premature appeals in a constructive suspension case, <span class="Italic">Porter v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 585, 586-89 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-12 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a September 17, 1999 petition for appeal alleging that he was a preference-eligible PS-5 "Nixie Clerk," and that the agency had "intentionally and deliberately put [him] out of work" without pay beginning ten minutes before the end of his shift on September 7, 1999....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge ordered the appellant to prove that the appeal was within the Board's jurisdiction by showing that he was placed on enforced leave for more than fourteen days, his absence from work was involuntary, and he was a preference-eligible employee, manager or supervisor, or employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity who had completed one year of current, continuous service in the same or a similar position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without holding a hearing as requested by the appellant, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal, finding that the Board's jurisdiction is determined by the nature of the agency's action at the time an appeal of that action is filed, <span class="Italic">see Himmel v. Department of Justice,</span> 6 MSPB 408, 6 MSPR 484 (1981), and that the agency's action at the time of the appeal here was only a ten-day suspension....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a timely petition for review asserting that the Board received his appeal on September 21, 1999, fifteen days after he was put out of work, and that he filed his appeal within thirty-five days of the effective date of the action he was appealing. The agency has not filed a response.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly stated the general principle set forth in <span class="Italic">Himmel</span> that the nature of an agency's action against an appellant at the time an appeal is filed is determinative of the Board's jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Himmel</span>, 6 MSPB 408, 6 MSPR at 485, the appellant filed an appeal of the agency's action suspending him for thirty days. While the appeal was pending before the Board, the agency reduced the suspension to fourteen days and claimed that the Board no longer had jurisdiction over the appeal<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. The Board found that it unquestionably had jurisdiction over the appeal when it was filed, and that the agency could not divest the Board of jurisdiction by a post-appeal unilateral modification of the action unless the appellant consented to such divestiture or the agency completely rescinded the action being appealed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 406.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]his case is controlled by <span class="Italic">Gallegos v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 70 MSPR 483 (1996). In <span class="Italic">Gallegos,</span> the Board noted that the appeal was premature when it was filed because at that time less than fifteen days had passed since the appellant had been placed on enforced leave. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 486. The Board remanded the appeal, however, upon finding that the appeal was now ripe for adjudication and that more than fifteen days had passed before the administrative judge dismissed the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In reaching this decision, the Board analogized to a case where an appeal was filed before a reduction in force action was effected; although premature, the Board held in that situation that there was no need to dismiss the appeal and have the appellant refile it because the action had been effected while the appeal was pending. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Allbee v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 63 MSPR 678 (1994)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other Board decisions stand for the proposition that prematurely-filed constructive suspension appeals need not be dismissed because more than fourteen days had not elapsed before the appeals were filed. In <span class="Italic">Childers v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 486, 489 (1988), for example, the Board noted that "[a]t the time the appellant filed his petition for appeal, his enforced leave had not exceeded fourteen days in duration." Instead of dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, as the administrative judge did here, the Board remanded the case for a determination as to whether the time period that the appellant had been on enforced leave ultimately exceeded fourteen days. <span class="Italic">Id.; see also Patin v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 37 MSPR 3, 5 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that the appellant's premature filing does not artificially diminish the length of his alleged constructive suspension, we further find that he has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction that entitles him to a jurisdictional hearing. The appellant has alleged and/or presented evidence suggesting that is absence from work was involuntary and lasted more than fourteen days, and that he is a preference eligible who has completed one year of current, continuous service in the same or a similar position.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A premature appeal is dismissed without prejudice to its later timely filing. It is not to be dismissed with prejudice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. USDA</span>, CH-531D-12-0529-I-1 (NP 4/17/2013) ("Notwithstanding the appellant's failure to respond to the administrative judge's Order to file evidence and argument establishing the timeliness of this claim or good cause for the delay, the dismissal was improper because, given that the appeal was premature, the administrative judge did not have the authority to dismiss it with prejudice. Where an appeal filed under 5 C.F.R. Part 1201, Subpart E, is premature, the administrative judge '<span class="Italic">will</span> dismiss the appeal without prejudice to its later refiling under &#x00A7; 1201.22.' 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(c)."). If the appeal is dismissed as premature with instructions to refile at the appropriate time, the appellant is held to the requirement of a second timely filing. If the Board's instructions on the disposition of the premature appeal are unclear, and if the appellant's confusion or delay in refiling the appeal is reasonable, the Board will excuse the error and direct the processing of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hipolito v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 436, 438 (1991). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v.

<p class="Body-Text">When an AJ improperly rejected an appeal as premature and the appellant then delayed refiling, causing his subsequent appeal to be rejected as untimely, the Board interceded and directed processing of the appeal in <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS,</span> DA-0752-10-0459-I-1 (NP 1/7/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rejection of his January 26, 2010 appeal as premature is inconsistent with the administrative judge's finding that an appealable final agency decision was issued and the removal had become effective no later than January 14, 2010. Specifically, the agency conceded below that on November 9, 2009, it rendered a final appealable decision to remove the appellant. Further, the administrative judge found that the appellant's removal was effective on January 14, 2010, and the agency agrees with this finding on review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, the January 26, 2010 rejection letter notified the appellant <span id="Page_919"></span>that he had to wait for a final decision from the agency before refiling. This error seems to have caused, or at least substantially contributed, to the filing delay here. Thus, we find that the regional office should not have summarily rejected the appellant's January 26, 2010 appeal as premature. The appeal was timely and ripe for adjudication.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">When an appellant mistakenly failed to initiate a new appeal following the unsuccessful premature initiation of an appeal in a mixed case first filed as a discrimination complaint with the agency, and instead relied on a PFR of the initial appeal prematurely filed to keep his case before the Board viable, there was good cause to permit a subsequent untimely filing of a second appeal with the regional office. <span class="Italic">Reggans v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 260, 262-63, 3 MSPB 352 (1980); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Dwyer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 1 MSPR 450, 451 (1980) (determining that a PFR from an initial decision dismissing an appeal as premature was moot when a second appeal was filed following the effective date of action appealed). The existence of a PFR to a removal appeal did not permit the Board to accept jurisdiction over a retirement appeal without an OPM reconsideration decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 260, 264 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Williams v. USDA,</span> AT-0752-10-0451-I-1 (NP 9/20/2011), the appeal was premature and the dismissal of the appeal was challenged by a late PFR. By the time the PFR was adjudicated, the appellant had not yet received a final agency EEO decision, but the 120-day waiting period had passed. Rather than remanding the case, the Board denied the PFR and informed the appellant that he could file a new appeal with the Board's regional office.</p>
