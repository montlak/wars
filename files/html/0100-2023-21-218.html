<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-218"><span class="space">a.</span> Geographic Extent of Consideration: Local Commuting Area</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The restoration right for a partially recovered employee is within his or her local commuting area. In <span class="Italic">Dean v. USPS</span>, 115 MSPR 56, 61-64 &#x00B6; 14-21, 2010 MSPB 187 (2010), the appellant became compensably disabled from a position in New York and while the disability continued, Mr. Dean moved to Florida. He sought restoration in that sunnier state. The Board determined that he had no right to be considered for restoration outside the New York commuting area where he earlier worked:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's several requests for restoration, and his rejection of the Utica, New York, job offer, indicated that he was interested only in positions in Florida. However, for the following reasons, we find that OPM's regulations do not require the agency to attempt restoration outside the appellant's former Rochester, New York, commuting area.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulations set forth the agency's obligation to find work within the appellant's medical restrictions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Agencies must make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty. At a minimum, this would mean treating these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) (emphasis added). The plain language of the regulation indicates that the "local commuting area" is determined by the location of the individual's former duty station, rather than by the location of the individual's current residence. <span class="Italic">See generally Lengerich v. Department of the Interior</span>, 454 F.3d 1367, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (a regulation should be interpreted according to its plain language). Specifically, the regulation refers to "the local commuting area." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) (emphasis added). This language suggests that there is only one local commuting area in a given case, thus implying a fixed location for that commuting area. If OPM intended to make the location of the commuting area contingent upon the location of the individual's <span id="Page_4478"></span>residence at a given time, it would more likely have provided that the agency must attempt restoration "in the individual's local commuting area," or something to that effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the Board has "recognized that there is a hierarchy in the area of restoration rights according to the extent of an employee's recovery," and that "the geographic area of consideration is greater for fully recovered employees than for partially recovered employees." <span class="Italic">Farrell v. Department of Justice</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 504, 511 (1991), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Leach v. Department of Commerce</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 8 (1994). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b), individuals fully recovered after 1 year are entitled to priority consideration agencywide only if the agency is unable to restore them in their "former commuting area." To require an agency to attempt to restore a partially recovered individual outside the former local commuting area would afford that individual greater restoration rights than an individual fully recovered after 1 year, and would be inconsistent with the regulatory scheme as a whole. <span class="Italic">Lengerich</span>, 454 F.3d at 1370 (regulations should be interpreted according to their plain language and must be read as a whole).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, in defining the "local commuting area" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d), the Board has found instructive the definition of "local commuting area" found in OPM's reduction-in-force (RIF) regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.203:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Local commuting area means the geographic area that usually constitutes one area for employment purposes. It includes any population center (or two or more neighboring ones) and the surrounding localities in which people live and can reasonably be expected to travel back and forth daily to their usual employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See Sapp v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 189, 193 &#x0026; n.1 (1997). For purposes of OPM's part 351 RIF regulations, the "local commuting area" is determined with respect to the location of the agency facility in question rather than to the location of the residences of the individual employees who work there. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.402(b) (a RIF competitive area is determined in terms of the agency's geographical location and the minimum competitive area is a subdivision of the agency under separate administration within the local commuting area). In <span class="Italic">Sapp</span>, a restoration appeal in which the Board used the RIF regulation's definition of local commuting area, the Board remanded the case for findings on whether "the Santa Ana District [where the appellant had once worked] geographically encompasses the entire local commuting area or whether the local commuting area includes localities outside the Santa Ana District from which the appellant could have commuted to her former duty station." <span class="Italic">Sapp</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 193-194 (emphasis supplied). Thus, in <span class="Italic">Sapp</span>, the local commuting area was based upon the location of the individual's former duty station.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b) refers to 5 C.F.R. part 302 for guidance on how restoration of individuals in the excepted service who have fully recovered after 1 year should be accomplished. The regulatory language in that part indicates that the "commuting area" is determined relative to the agency's facilities--not to individuals' residences. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.303(b)(3) (individuals seeking restoration after compensable injury under this part are "considered in the commuting area where they last served") (emphasis supplied); <span class="Italic">see also Farrell</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 510-11 (referring to OPM's reemployment priority regulations for guidance on determining the geographical scope of an agency's obligation to search for positions for partially recovered individuals).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency was not required to attempt to restore the appellant in his new Florida commuting area, we find that the appellant's arguments on review that the Utica job offer was outside that area and that there were positions available for him in Florida do not establish that the agency's denials of restoration were arbitrary and capricious. We also find, for the same reason, that the documentary evidence accompanying the petition for review has no bearing on whether the agency's denials of restoration were arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that the agency's stated reason for denying the appellant's March 30, 2004 restoration request was erroneous, i.e., that because the appellant was not separated from service, restoration rights did not apply to him. It is well settled that an individual need not be separated from federal employment for restoration rights to attach. <span class="Italic">See Fitzsimmons v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 10 (2005); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 9 &#x0026; n.* (2005). Nevertheless, because the agency was not required to attempt to restore the appellant to duty outside the local commuting area surrounding his former duty station, its stated reason for not doing so is immaterial to the jurisdictional analysis under the particular facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also acknowledge a disparity between OPM's restoration regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) and the Department of Labor's (DOL) regulations at 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.508 regarding a compensably injured employee's return to work. As explained above, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) requires an agency only to attempt to restore a partially recovered individual within the former local commuting area. However, as the ECAB found in the appellant's workers' compensation appeal, 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.508 states that "[i]f possible, the employer should offer suitable reemployment in the location where the employee currently resides. Nevertheless, we find that 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.508 does not affect the geographic area in which an agency is required to attempt restoration under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). DOL's regulations pertain to whether an agency has offered a compensably injured employee suitable work that would warrant the reduction or termination of OWCP benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 10.508, .517. They do not pertain to an agency's restoration obligations<span class="Italic"> per se</span>, which are found in a separate set of regulations issued by OPM. 5 C.F.R. part 353, subpart C; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b) (authorizing OPM to issue regulations governing restoration to duty after absence due to compensable injury). Because the appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious according to the requirements of 5 C.F.R. part 353, subpart C, he has failed to establish Board jurisdiction over his appeal. We therefore affirm the administrative judge's finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's restoration appeal. <span class="Italic">See Chen</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vazquez v. USPS</span>, 114 MSPR 264, 269-72 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-19, 2010 MSPB 125 (2010), summarized decisions defining what constitutes a local commuting area for purposes of a restoration right of a partially disabled employee and the impact upon the area of consideration and the requirement that agencies accommodate disabled employees through placement in vacant positions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Agencies must make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty. At a minimum, this would mean treating these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). The Board has interpreted this regulation as requiring agencies to search within the local commuting area for vacant positions to which an agency can restore a partially recovered employee and to consider him for any such vacancies. <span class="Italic">See Sanchez v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 2010 MSPB 121, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Sapp v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 189, 193-94 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"For restoration rights purposes, the local commuting area is the geographic area in which an individual lives and can reasonably be expected to travel back and forth daily to his usual duty station." <span class="Italic">Hicks v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 9 (1999). It includes any population center, or two or more neighboring ones, and the surrounding localities. <span class="Italic">Sapp,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 193. The question of what constitutes a local commuting area is one of fact. The extent of a commuting area is ordinarily determined by factors such as common practice, the availability and cost of public transportation or the convenience and adequacy of highways, and the travel time required to go to and from work. <span class="Italic">See Beardmore v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 761 F.2d 677, 678 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (defining "local commuting area" in the context of a reassignment); <span class="Italic">see also Sanchez,</span> 2010 MSPB 121, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, all of the evidence shows that the agency searched for a suitable position for the appellant only at the LA BMC. Unless the LA BMC is the only agency facility in the local commuting area, the applicable regulation requires a more extensive search. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). Because the agency's search for available work was apparently limited to a single facility, it appears that the agency failed to search the entire local commuting area as required by OPM's regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). Evidence that the agency failed to search the entire local commuting area as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration. <span class="Italic">See Barachina v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 12, &#x00B6; 7 (2009); <span class="Italic">Urena v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 13 (2009).

U.S. Postal Service,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 688, &#x00B6; 8 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the documentary evidence suggests that the agency failed to search the entire local commuting area, the evidence in the record is insufficient for the Board to determine the extent of the local commuting area on review. Therefore, in the interest of justice, we reopen the record for further development on this issue, including the opportunity for further discovery by the parties. <span class="Italic">See Sapp,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 193-94 (the Board remanded the appeal for further development of the record regarding what constituted the "local commuting area" and whether the agency's job search properly encompassed that area).

<p class="Block-Quote1">We are cognizant that, while geographical location is a consideration in determining an appropriate reassignment under the Rehabilitation Act, the reassignment obligation under the Act is not necessarily limited by the local commuting area. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(2)(ii).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The language in OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) is explicit, however, that an agency's restoration obligation is limited to the local commuting area. OPM's intent to provide restoration rights only in the local commuting area is also clear from its explanation for adding the limiting phrase in issuing the regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 60 Fed. Reg. 45,650 (Sept. 1, 1995) ("[Section] 353.301(d) makes clear that partially recovered employees are entitled to restoration rights only in the local commuting area, not agencywide."). Therefore, we find that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) requires an agency to search for a restoration assignment for partially recovered employees only in the local commuting area and that its reference to the Rehabilitation Act means that in doing so, it undertakes substantially the same effort that it would exert under that Act when reassigning disabled employees within the local commuting area.

We note that the recent ADA Amendments Act of 2008 did not alter the substantive requirements for reasonable accommodation, including reassignment. Pub. L.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's obligation to provide reasonable accommodation to an individual with a disability under the Rehabilitation Act may include reassignment to a vacant position. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(9)(B); <span class="Italic">Smith,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Taylor,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 306, &#x00B6; 8; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(2)(ii).

<p class="Block-Quote1">We are cognizant that, while geographical location is a consideration in determining an appropriate reassignment under the Rehabilitation Act, the reassignment obligation under the Act is not necessarily limited by the local commuting area. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(2)(ii). "Rather, the extent to which an employer must search for a vacant position will be an issue of undue hardship." <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidanc</span>e at 20, Q. 27; <span class="Italic">see also EEOC Questions and Answers: Promoting Employment of Individuals with Disabilities in the Federal Workforce</span> (2008) at 18, Q. 24 ("Reassignment is not limited to the facility, commuting area, sub-component,...or type of work to which the individual with a disability is assigned at the time the need for accommodation arises.").[6] The language in OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) is explicit, however, that an agency's restoration obligation is limited to the local commuting area. OPM's intent to provide restoration rights only in the local commuting area is also clear from its explanation for adding the limiting phrase in issuing the regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 60 Fed. Reg. 45,650 (Sept. 1, 1995) ("[Section] 353.301(d) makes clear that partially recovered employees are entitled to restoration rights only in the local commuting area, not agencywide.")[7] Therefore, we find that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) requires an agency to search for a restoration assignment for partially recovered employees only in the local commuting area and that its reference to the Rehabilitation Act means that, in doing so, it undertakes substantially the same effort that it would exert under that Act when reassigning disabled employees within the local commuting area. By so reading the regulation, we have considered the text as a whole and given meaning to the entire text. <span class="Italic">See Lengerich v. Department of the Interior,</span> 454 F.3d 1367, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("[i]n interpreting a regulatory provision, we examine the text of the regulation as a whole"); <span class="Italic">Phipps v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;In addition, we note that at the time OPM issued this regulation, the EEOC's regulation at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(g) (1994) was in effect, which limited the reassignment obligation to a funded vacant position located in the same commuting area and serviced by the same appointment authority. The substantive provisions of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203 were superseded by the ADA regulations in 2002. <span class="Italic">See Collins,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 332, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(b).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this Opinion and Order, we have only addressed the scope of the agency's reassignment obligation under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) but we make no determination as to the scope of its obligation under the Rehabilitation Act. Rather, the administrative judge should address this issue on remand in the context of the appellant's disability discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">Cf. Sapp v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 411, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15 (1999) (finding that the appellant's restoration rights and right to reassignment under disability discrimination law are not synonymous and require separate adjudication) (clarifying <span class="Italic">Sapp,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 194-95). The administrative judge should take into consideration the results of the interactive process required to determine an appropriate accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Paris v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A Postal Service employee may file a Board appeal of an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 only if he is covered by 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a) or 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8). Thus, to appeal an adverse action under chapter 75, a Postal employee (1) must be a preference eligible, a management or supervisory employee, or an employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity, and (2) must have completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions. <span class="Italic">Paige v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 299, &#x00B6; 11 (2007). Based on the record evidence below, it appears that the appellant would be unable to establish Board jurisdiction under this standard because he lacks veterans' preference status, and he does not appear to be a manager, supervisor, or employee engaged in personnel work. <span class="Italic">See Coe v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 4 (2004). Nevertheless, as explained above, the appellant did not have an adequate opportunity to address the issue below. Therefore, if the appellant wishes to pursue his constructive suspension claim on remand, the administrative judge shall properly notify him of his jurisdictional <span id="Page_4481"></span>burden and afford the parties an opportunity to submit evidence and argument on the issue. <span class="Italic">See Brehmer,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 7<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The constructive suspension approach towards restoration claims was substantially modified by <span class="Italic">Kinglee v. USPS</span>, 114 MSPR 473, 2010 MSPB 153 (2010) (a constructive suspension claim should not be entertained as an adjunct to a dispute over restoration rights following partial recovery from a compensable injury).
