<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Thomas v. OPM</span>, 95 MSPR 695, 698-700 &#x00B6; 7-10 (2004), explained why OPM could pursue collection of survivor annuity payments from the appellant to secure the deposit her deceased husband was required by law to make for the appellant to be entitled to a survivor annuity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Henderson,</span> we found that OPM failed to demonstrate that it complied with the Board's order, on remand, to show that it had a lawful basis for its reduction of Henderson's survivor annuity.<span class="Italic"> Henderson,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 383, &#x00B6; 12. To the extent that our decision in <span class="Italic">Henderson,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 383, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11, reflected a different analysis and conclusion, we have overruled that portion of<span class="Italic"> Henderson. See Simpson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 52 &#x00B6; 15 (2004). In this case, we find that OPM has a lawful basis for its reduction of the appellant's survivor annuity and we substitute our <span id="Page_4429"></span>analysis of this issue in this case for the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">Henderson.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's entitlement to a survivor annuity must be determined from the statutes and regulations governing this benefit. <span class="Italic">See Shaughnessy v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 633, 637 (1990) (<span class="Italic">citing Zucker v. United States,</span> 758 F.2d 637, 640 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 474 U.S. 842 (1985)). In order for a retiree to provide for a survivor annuity, reductions must be made from the annuity that the retiree receives or his survivors will not obtain legal entitlement to a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(4), (k)(2)(A), and (k)(2)(B)(ii). An agency cannot be required to grant monetary benefits where all of the statutory and regulatory criteria for such benefits have not been met.<span class="Italic"> See Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414, 416 (1990). We must decide whether OPM's action in reducing the appellant's survivor annuity in order to collect the deposit her deceased husband was required by law to make in order for the appellant to be entitled to a survivor annuity constitutes a reasonable interpretation of Congress's intent regarding OPM's administration of claims for a survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. ch. 83. The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]f the statute speaks clearly "to the precise question at issue," we "must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." [Citation omitted.] If, however, the statute "is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue," we must sustain the Agency's interpretation if it is "based on a permissible construction" of the Act. [Citation omitted.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Barnhart v. Walton,</span> 535 U.S. 212, 217-18 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM bears the statutory responsibility for the administration of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347, including the adjudication of claims for survivor annuity benefits under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341. Pursuant to its statutory authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(a), to prescribe such regulations as are necessary and proper to carry out its administration of the Fund, OPM has promulgated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.661, which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;The deposits required to elect fully or partially reduced annuities under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.622, 831.631, 831.632, 831.682, 831.684, or 831.685 are not annuity overpayments and their collection is not subject to waiver. They are subject to reconsideration only to determine whether the amount has been correctly computed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulation is consistent with the clear statutory intent of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 that there not be multiple distributions, and, therefore, an excessive depletion of the Fund's assets, based on the contribution of a single retiree. Thus, we find that OPM's interpretation of its administrative responsibilities under 5 U.S.C. ch. 83 constitutes a reasonable construction of those statutes.<span class="Italic"> See Barnhart</span>, 535 U.S. at 217-18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM claims, and the appellant does not argue otherwise, that the deposit required to provide the appellant with statutory entitlement to a survivor annuity was not made. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.661(a). OPM therefore calculated the annuity payments the retiree had received in his lifetime and then computed how much he would have received had the necessary deductions been made to reflect a survivor annuity election. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(B)(ii). This amount was then subtracted from the retroactive payment that was made to the appellant to account for the payments she would have received between the retiree's death and the date on which OPM began making regular survivor annuity payments following our previous final order in this case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The record supports the administrative judge's finding that OPM correctly calculated the amount of the required deposit. We note that the appellant's only claim below and on review appears to be that OPM improperly reduced her survivor annuity to provide for "health benefits." The record supports the administrative judge's finding that OPM has properly addressed that claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The decision relied on in <span class="Italic">Thomas,</span> <span class="Italic">Simpson v. OPM</span>, 96 MSPR 52, 55-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4, 6-21 (2004), determined that OPM could attempt to collect from an individual receiving a survivor annuity an overpayment to the deceased spouse whose retirement coverage furnished the basis for the appellant's annuity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's spouse was an employee who became eligible to receive Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) disability retirement benefits as of December 21, 1990. When the appellant's spouse began receiving disability retirement benefits, OPM informed her that she was required to notify OPM of any Social Security disability benefits she received while receiving FERS disability benefits, so that her FERS disability benefits could be reduced as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8452(a)(2). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant's spouse failed to do so, however, and when OPM learned directly from the Social Security Administration (SSA) that she was simultaneously receiving SSA disability benefits, it notified her that she had received an overpayment of $11,157 in FERS disability benefits, and it began to collect the overpayment through a $25 per month offset of her FERS annuity. OPM collected $1,125 of the overpayment through the monthly annuity offsets prior to the spouse's death, and then subtracted $467.63 in accrued but unpaid monthly annuity payments, as permitted by the "priority of government claims" statute, 37 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3713. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> OPM first sought to collect the $9,564.37 balance of the overpayment from the appellant as the executor of his spouse's estate. When that effort failed and the appellant subsequently filed an application for FERS survivor annuity benefits under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(g), based on his now-deceased spouse's disability retirement benefits, OPM subsequently issued a reconsideration decision notifying the appellant that it would collect the balance of his spouse's overpayment debt through a $115.92 offset in his monthly survivor annuity payments for 82 months and a final offset of $.71. OPM also denied his request for a waiver of his spouse's overpayment debt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued on petition for appeal that: he had separated from his spouse prior to her death and had not received any benefit from his separated spouse's receipt of the FERS annuity payments; he was not responsible for his spouse's receipt of the annuity overpayment; and, therefore, he was not responsible for repaying his deceased spouse's annuity overpayment debt. The appellant also sought a waiver of the overpayment based on financial hardship. The administrative judge (AJ) set forth OPM's burden of proof to establish the overpayment, and the AJ informed the appellant of his burden of proof to establish entitlement to a waiver of the overpayment or an adjustment of the repayment schedule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision following a hearing, the AJ found that OPM had established that the appellant's spouse had received both SSA benefits and FERS benefits for the period of December 21, 1990, through March 31, 1993, thereby resulting in an overpayment of FERS benefits; and, further, that OPM had correctly calculated the amount of the overpayment. The AJ rejected the appellant's argument that, because he had not caused nor benefited from the FERS annuity overpayment to his separated spouse, OPM could not collect the balance of his now-deceased spouse's overpayment debt from him. The AJ noted that OPM had stipulated that the appellant was not at fault for the overpayment and, further, that the appellant had abandoned his effort to seek a waiver of the overpayment based on financial hardship. The AJ also rejected the appellant's claims that he was eligible for a waiver of the overpayment because he had changed his position in detrimental reliance on the annuity amount he should receive and because collection of the overpayment would be unconscionable. Thus, the AJ found that the appellant was not entitled to a waiver of the overpayment. Finally, the AJ noted that the appellant had not availed himself of the opportunity the AJ gave him to seek an adjustment of the repayment schedule based on financial hardship. Accordingly, the AJ affirmed OPM's reconsideration decision finding that the appellant's survivor annuity payments were subject to an offset to collect the annuity overpayment debt incurred by his deceased spouse and denying his request for a waiver of his deceased spouse's overpayment debt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM bears the statutory responsibility for the adjudication of claims made against the assets of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund), including claims for FERS survivor annuity benefits under 5 U.S.C. ch. 84. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461. In its adjudication of the appellant's claim against the assets of the Fund, OPM has sought to recoup the excessive distribution of the Fund's assets to his now-deceased spouse by temporarily reducing the amount of his entitlement to the assets of the Fund through an offset of his monthly annuity payments. OPM's FERS regulations provide for the collection of a debt owed to the Fund through an "offset of money due the debtor from the Federal Government." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.205(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has found that, in order for an agency to collect a debt by administrative offset against amounts payable from the Fund, the government must have a "claim" against a "debtor" as a result of a "debt" owed the United States. <span class="Italic">King v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 105 F.3d 635, 639-40 (Fed. Cir. 1997). There is no dispute in this case that there is a debt owed to the Fund as a result of the overpayment of its assets to the appellant's spouse and that OPM has made a claim to recover those assets. However, because neither 5 U.S.C. ch. 84 nor OPM's FERS regulations define the term "debtor," we must decide if OPM's action in making the appellant, in effect, a debtor is a reasonable interpretation of Congress's intent regarding OPM's administration of the Fund under 5 U.S.C. ch. 84. The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]f the statute speaks clearly "to the precise question at issue," we "must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." (Citation omitted.) If, however, the statute "is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue," we must sustain the Agency's interpretation if it is "based on a permissible construction" of the Act. (Citation omitted.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Barnhart v. Walton,</span> 535 U.S. 212, 217-18 (2002). Based on the analysis set forth below, we find that Congress has expressed its intent that, where there has been a prior distribution of the Fund's assets, any subsequent distribution of the assets will be reduced as necessary to avoid an <span id="Page_4430"></span>excessive depletion of the assets of the Fund.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant derives his entitlement to a FERS survivor annuity as a result of the federal service and FERS contributions of his now-deceased spouse. As a result of uncollected FERS annuity overpayments to the appellant's spouse, the spouse owed a debt to the Fund at the time of her death. A review of the FERS annuity statute, 5 U.S.C. ch. 84, the Debt Collection Act (DCA), 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3701, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, and the priority of Government claims statute, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3713, indicates that, where a former federal employee owed a debt to the Fund upon her death, Congress's intent is that her surviving spouse's entitlement to the assets of the Fund be reduced and that the Government's claim to the assets of the Fund (as a result of the debt) be given priority over the survivor's claim against the assets of the Fund. These statutes are discussed, in turn, below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's entitlement to a survivor annuity must be determined from the statutes and regulations governing this benefit. <span class="Italic">See Shaughnessy v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. 633, 637 (1990) (<span class="Italic">citing Zucker v. United States,</span> 758 F.2d 637, 640 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 474 U.S. 842 (1985)). Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(g)(1), (2)(A), if the surviving spouse of a "disability annuitant" is determined to be entitled to an annuity based on the services of the disability annuitant, the annuity shall be 50 percent of the annuity to which the disability annuitant was entitled to as of the day before the date of the disability annuitant's death. Congress clearly did not intend for a surviving spouse to be entitled to a greater annuity than the deceased spouse would have been entitled to as of the day before the date of the deceased spouse's death. Thus, the appellant's entitlement to the Fund's assets was subject to the same debt to the Fund that his spouse's entitlement was subject to as of the day before the date of her death. Further, as discussed below, a review of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8442 and 8445 demonstrates Congress's intent that payments from the Fund to a surviving spouse be reduced by payments made from the Fund to other entitled individuals. The obvious reason for this requirement is to avoid the depletion of the Fund's assets by not attempting to pay multiple annuities from one employee's contribution to the Fund.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(h), a surviving spouse's entitlement to an annuity is reduced by the amount of any annuity payments made to a former spouse of the deceased employee for whom the deceased employee had made an election to provide annuity benefits or who possesses entitlement to the survivor annuity as a result of a decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to a divorce. Similarly, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8445(b)(1), a former spouse's entitlement to an annuity is reduced by the amount of any annuity payments made to another former spouse of the deceased employee for whom the deceased employee had made an election to provide annuity benefits or who possesses entitlement to the survivor annuity as a result of a decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to a divorce. Moreover, the former spouse statute specifically provides that "[a]ny payment under this section to a person bars recovery by any other person." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8445(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A limited exception to the above-noted prohibition against multiple distributions of a deceased employee's contributions to the Fund is where the deceased employee has surviving children under the age of 18 (or under the age of 22 if attending school or over the age of 18 but incapable of self-support and unmarried). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8443. However, even under that limited exception, the total annuity to which a single child would be entitled is reduced by dividing the total number of qualified children, such that each child is only entitled to an equally divided share. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8443(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the statutory framework of 5 U.S.C. ch. 84 demonstrates Congress's intent that the appellant's entitlement to the assets of the Fund is subject to the same debt to the Fund that his deceased spouse's entitlement was subject to as of the day before the date of her death, as a result of the prior distribution of the Fund's assets to the deceased spouse. <span class="Italic">See also Pinnix v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 19 M.S.P.R. 449, 449-50 (1984) (OPM was not required to pay an otherwise entitled designated beneficiary a lump-sum annuity benefit because payments of survivor annuities to the deceased employee's spouse and stepchild had equaled the lump-sum credit to which the employee would have been entitled). Our analysis of Congress's intent regarding OPM's administration of 5 U.S.C. ch. 84 is consistent with Congress's authorization allowing the Social Security Administration (SSA) to collect overpayments of SSA benefits from related SSA benefits recipients who did not receive the benefits overpayments. <span class="Italic">See Groseclose v. Bowen,</span> 809 F.2d 502, 503-04 (8th Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The DCA, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3701 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, requires the heads of agencies to collect debts owed to the United States arising out of the activities of the agency or referred to the agency for collection. 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3711(a). By analogy, we note that the priority of Government claims statute, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3713(a)(1)(B), provides that a claim of the United States Government <span class="Italic">shall be paid first</span> when a person indebted to the Government becomes insolvent and the assets of the indebted person's estate are insufficient to pay all of the debts of the debtor. Consistent with this statutory obligation and authority, OPM has promulgated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.105, which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;OPM has charge of the adjudication of all claims for basic benefits arising under FERS and of all matters directly or indirectly concerned with these adjudications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;In the adjudication of claims arising under FERS, OPM will consider and take appropriate action on counterclaims filed by the Government as set-offs against amounts payable from the Civil Service Retirement Fund.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The DCA prohibits agency heads from discharging delinquent debts owed to an agency until the agency head has taken all appropriate steps to collect such debts through various delineated means, including administrative offset. 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3711(g)(9). The DCA defines "administrative offset" to mean "withholding funds payable by the United States (including funds payable by the United States on behalf of a State government) to, or held by the United States for, a person to satisfy a claim." 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3701(a)(1). The DCA requires agencies either to use the regulations on collecting by administrative offset promulgated by the Department of Justice, the General Accounting Office, or the Department of the Treasury; or to prescribe regulations on collecting by administrative offset consistent with the regulations referred to in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3716(a)(1). 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3716(a), (b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has promulgated regulations implementing its debt collection process for FERS annuitants at 5 C.F.R. part 845. <span class="Italic">See James v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 211, 216 n.3 (1996). OPM's FERS regulations provide for the collection of a FERS-related debt through an "offset." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.205(a). An "[o]ffset means to withhold the amount of a debt, or a portion of that amount, from one or more payments due the debtor...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.203. As noted above, OPM's FERS regulations do not define the term "debtor." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, given the statutory framework of 5 U.S.C. ch. 84, noted above, and the DCA's statutory requirement that agency heads collect debts owed to the Government, as noted above, we find that OPM's adjudication of the appellant's claim against the assets of the Fund is consistent with Congress's statutorily expressed intent regarding OPM's administration of the assets of the Fund under 5 U.S.C. ch. 84 and the DCA. Further, we find that OPM's interpretation of its administrative responsibilities under 5 U.S.C. ch. 84 and the DCA constitutes a reasonable construction of those statutes. <span class="Italic">See Barnhart,</span> 535 U.S. at 217-18. To the extent that our Opinion and Order in <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 383, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2002), indicates a different analysis and conclusion, we overrule that portion of <span class="Italic">Henderson</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ correctly found, OPM properly found that the appellant's spouse had received an overpayment of FERS disability annuity benefits as a result of her simultaneous receipt of SSA disability benefits for the period of December 21, 1990 through March 31, 1993. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8452(a) (2). The record supports the AJ's finding that OPM correctly calculated the amount of the overpayment. The record also shows that OPM followed its regulatory procedures for notifying the appellant of its intent to collect the overpayment through an offset of his monthly annuity payments. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.204.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we agree with the AJ that the appellant failed to meet his burden of showing that he is entitled to a waiver of OPM's collection of the annuity overpayment. Waiver of collection of an overpayment will be granted when the annuitant is both without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8470(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.301; <span class="Italic">Gulan v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 16, &#x00B6; 7 (2000). An annuitant bears the burden of proving that he is eligible for a waiver or an adjustment of the repayment schedule by substantial evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.307(b); <span class="Italic">Gulan,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 16, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because OPM has acknowledged that the appellant is without fault, he would be entitled to a waiver if he had also established that recovery of the overpayment would be against equity and good conscience. <span class="Italic">Gulan,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 16, &#x00B6; 9. Recovery of an overpayment would be against equity and good conscience if an annuitant shows that: (1) It would cause the annuitant financial hardship; (2) as a result of the annuitant's receipt of the overpayment he has relinquished a valuable right or has changed positions for the worse; or (3) recovery would be unconscionable under the circumstances. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.303.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant waived below his claim that recovery would cause him financial hardship <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.303(a). Further, the appellant not only did not receive the overpayment, he asserted that he had no knowledge of his deceased spouse's receipt of the overpayment. Therefore, the appellant could not have changed his position for the worse because of his receipt of the overpayment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.303(b). Thus, the only basis for a waiver would be if the appellant had shown that recovery would be unconscionable under the circumstances of this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.303(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that, while the unconscionability of collection is a basis to waive recovery of an overpayment, it is a high standard that <span id="Page_4431"></span>will only be granted under exceptional circumstances. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 214, &#x00B6; 18 (2000). Those circumstances may include, but are not limited to, cases where: (1) There has been an exceptionally lengthy delay by OPM in adjusting an annuity; (2) OPM failed to respond within a reasonable length of time to an annuitant's inquiries regarding an overpayment; (3) OPM failed to act expeditiously to adjust an annuity in the face of specific notice; and/or (4) where OPM is otherwise grossly negligent in handling the case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant has not presented any evidence of such circumstances in this case. Therefore, we find that the appellant has not shown by substantial evidence that OPM's collection of the overpayment through an offset of his monthly annuity payments would be unconscionable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we affirm OPM's reconsideration decision finding that the appellant's monthly survivor annuity payments were subject to an offset to collect the annuity overpayment debt incurred by his deceased spouse, and denying his request for a waiver of his deceased spouse's overpayment debt.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">One appeal involved continuation of payments to a survivor annuitant after her death. Some of those funds were then used by the appellant, who asserted her status was that of an heir. The Board questioned whether it had jurisdiction over the overpayment action commenced by OPM. The Board suggested that the appellant did not have an interest in the annuity, but received the funds through distribution from an estate or by the laws of intestate succession. Although there may have been a debt, the OPM overpayment notice was not the proper way to initiate recovery. The Board returned the appeal to the AJ for further analysis, with the observations in <span class="Italic">Rossini v. OPM</span>, 101 MSPR 289, 294-97 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-14, 2006 MSPB 45 (2006) (Chairman McPhie dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction with respect to retirement matters involving the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) is defined at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1). This subsection provides, "Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection [involving an OPM determination that an individual is entitled to disability retirement on the basis of the individual's mental condition made pursuant to an agency-filed application], an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United States under this subchapter [(i.e., Subchapter III of Chapter 83, Title 5, United States Code)] may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board." In this case, it is not entirely clear that the action at issue, i.e., OPM's attempt to collect a debt due to the CSRDF, affects the rights or interests that either party may have under Subchapter III of Chapter 83. First, if the appellant received funds that were deposited in her mother's bank account following her mother's death, it is likely that the appellant received these funds through the application of the relevant state's probate or intestacy laws, rather than through any right or interest the appellant may have had as her mother's survivor under the CSRS. The record does not indicate that the appellant was the annuitant or a designated survivor annuitant with obvious rights or interests under applicable provisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(9)-(11). In addition, the record does not indicate that the appellant received funds from the CSRDF either directly, as a representative of her mother's estate, or as a third party with rights under applicable provisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8341 (survivor annuities), 8345(e) (payments made to the guardian of either a minor or a mentally incompetent individual), 8345(j) (payments made pursuant to a court order). Thus, it appears, on the basis of the current record, that the appellant does not have a direct right or interest under Subchapter III of Chapter 83 that would allow her to appeal to the Board OPM's decision to collect a debt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, while Subchapter III of Chapter 83 includes a provision that allows for waiver of recovery of "payments under this subchapter" when the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b), it is not clear that this provision applies to the appellant. First, the entity that actually received the overpayment was the estate of the appellant's mother, not the appellant as an individual. We note that OPM regulations governing the standards for waiver of overpayments provide that waiver cannot be granted when the overpayment was made to an estate. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1406(a)(2). Second, these standards specifically mention only two categories of individuals who may be entitled to waiver, "annuitants" and "recipients of an overpayment." There have been two cases in which the Board has addressed waiver requests that resulted from overpayments OPM made from the CSRDF after an annuitant's death. However, neither case is dispositive with respect to the jurisdictional question presented by this case. <span class="Italic">See Carter v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 553, 554-55 (1987) (the Board addressed the waiver request of an appellant who derived his interest in the annuity by being named as the representative payee pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(e)); <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. 315, 316 (1985) (although the Board considered a widow's request for waiver of annuity overpayments that were made to her deceased husband's bank account, the Board did not identify any right or interest the widow may have had under Subchapter III of Chapter 83 with respect to the overpayments). Therefore, while it is clear that the appellant is attempting to request waiver of the collection of a debt she may owe to OPM, it is not clear that she is seeking waiver of the "recovery of payments" under Subchapter III of Chapter 83 nor that her request is sufficient to bring this case within the Board's jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1). <span class="Italic">Cf. Mitchell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 12 (2004) (the Board has jurisdiction to review OPM's final decisions on requests that recovery of annuity payments be waived and this jurisdiction extends beyond cases in which the Board has jurisdiction to consider the propriety of the overpayment determination itself).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By the same token, while the provisions of Subchapter III of Chapter 83 may establish that the payments OPM deposited in the bank account of the appellant's mother following her death constituted overpayments of Mrs. Howison's survivor annuity, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(b) (the annuity of a widow or widower terminates on the last day of the month before the widow or widower dies), OPM has offered no argument or evidence to support the proposition that its authority to collect this debt from this appellant, or to consider the appellant's request for a waiver, is derived from the rights or interests of the United States under Subchapter III. As described above, this case does not appear to be one in which OPM is attempting to collect an annuity overpayment from an annuitant or some other individual whose claim to the funds is arguably derived from the federal retirement statutes; rather, this case appears to be one in which OPM is attempting to collect a debt from an individual whose claim to the funds derived from state law upon her mother's death. While it is entirely possible that the appellant may have incurred a debt to OPM as a result of her receipt of funds from her mother's estate, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3713(b) ("[a] representative of a person or an estate...paying any part of the debt of the person or estate before paying a claim of the Government is liable to the extent of the payment for unpaid claims of the Government"), there are provisions of law other than the retirement statutes that grant the head of an executive agency the right to try to collect a claim of the United States for money or property arising out of the activities of the agency, <span class="Italic">see</span> 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3711(a) (the head of an executive agency shall try to collect a claim of the United States Government for money or property arising out of the activities of the agency and may suspend or end collection action on a claim of not more than $100,000 when it appears that no person liable on the claim has the present or prospective ability to pay a significant amount of the claim).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons set forth above, we find that a question exists as to whether OPM's decision to collect the alleged debt from this appellant constitutes "an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United States under" Subchapter III of Chapter 83.[10] Because OPM dismissed the appellant's request for reconsideration/waiver on the basis of timeliness, and the administrative judge affirmed OPM's decision, the parties have not had the opportunity to develop the record with respect to this issue. Accordingly, it is appropriate to remand this appeal to the regional office for further development of the record. For example, the record should be developed on the issues of whether the appellant was the annuitant or designated survivor annuitant with obvious rights or interests under the applicable statutory provisions, and whether the appellant acted as the executrix of her mother's estate or was otherwise a third-party recipient of retirement fund monies pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8341, 8345(e), or 8345(j).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;We note the dissent emphasizes that "[i]t is not at all clear that the appellant, as an adult child of a deceased survivor annuitant, has any rights or interests under the Civil Service Retirement System." Nevertheless, she has been charged by OPM with the repayment of a debt under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1304. By the terms of that regulation, she is entitled to proper notice. What is not at all clear is whether OPM had the authority to recover the disputed annuity overpayment under Subchapter III of Chapter 83 to begin with.</p>
