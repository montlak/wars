<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-52"><span class="space">m.</span> Mutual, Unilateral Mistake</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Discussion in the preceding section touched on the concept of mutual mistake--distinct from fraud--as a means of challenging a settlement. According to <span class="Italic">Burns v. Dept. of Interior</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3178):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a mutual mistake of fact, Burks must show that: (1) the parties to the contract were mistaken in their belief regarding a fact; (2) that mistaken belief constituted a basic assumption underlying the contract; (3) the mistake had a material effect on the bargain; and (4) the contract did not put the risk of the mistake on the party seeking reformation. <span class="Italic">See Atlas Corp. v. United</span> States, 895 F.2d 745, 750 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (citations omitted)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 68 Fed. Appx. 977, 978 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP) (defining a mutual mistake as a "mistake made by both sides about an important fact which, if correctly understood, might have led to a different result"); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 512, 516 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 10 (2001) ("When a settlement agreement is based on a mutual mistake about a material fact in existence at the time of the agreement, it must be set aside by the Board"; "Nullifying a settlement agreement on the basis of mutual mistake requires a showing that the mistake went to a basic assumption about a material fact in existence at the time of the agreement.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to set aside an agreement because of an alleged mutual error of not recognizing the significance of recent decisions, <span class="Italic">Park v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-14-0275-I-1 (NP 11/3/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In this case, the administrative judge thoroughly addressed the appellant's claim of mutual mistake and correctly found that the parties' lack of knowledge of case precedent does not meet the appellant's burden of establishing a mistake of fact as set forth in <span class="Italic">Atlas Corp. v. United States</span>, 895 F.2d 745, 750 (Fed. Cir. 1990). The administrative judge also correctly found that mutual mistake is not established if a settlement agreement is entered by the appellant on the basis of his incorrect understanding of Board law. <span class="Italic">See Gregory v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 691, 698, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 64 F.3d 677 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). Thus, while the appellant would like to revoke the settlement agreement because he was unaware of new case law that may have supported his case, his post-settlement remorse or change of heart cannot serve as a basis for setting aside a valid settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Hinton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6; 4 (2013). Accordingly, the appellant has provided no basis upon which to disturb the initial decision dismissing this appeal as settled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a party successfully challenges a settlement because of a material mutual mistake, the Board may invalidate the agreement and reinstates the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Farrell v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 86 MSPR 384, 387-88 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-13 (2000) (mutual error concerning the lawfulness of the pay rate set by agreement; the appeal was remanded for a hearing on the merits when the appellant was apparently unwilling to accept a settlement based on the remaining, valid terms of the agreement); <span class="Italic">Beaudin v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 597, 601 (1988) ("If such a mutual mistake occurred, grounds for invalidation of the settlement agreement and reinstatement of the appellant's RIF appeal would exist[.]").

Ordinarily, a finding that a settlement agreement must be set aside results in the reinstatement of the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 16. However, when a settlement agreement must be set aside because of the failure of an essential part of that agreement, but the appellant has obtained other benefits pursuant to that agreement, the Board has found it appropriate to offer the appellant a choice between reinstating his appeal or accepting the settlement agreement as is. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the settlement restored the appellant to agency employment and is then set aside, e.g., for mutual mistake, the agency has restored the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> by removing the appellant from the position obtained through the settlement.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board insists that parties make the proper choice between enforcement proceedings and a PFR from an initial decision adopting a settlement when mutual mistake is a possible basis for invalidating the settlement. An appellant made the wrong choice between those procedures, ultimately belatedly filed a PFR, and found himself without the benefit of the settlement he negotiated, <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 69 MSPR 21, 23-27 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">....The appellant's remaining claims of discrimination based on other unspecified disciplinary actions were, at the time in question, pending in an EEO complaint before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). He and the agency reached a settlement agreement before an EEOC administrative judge which provided, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant would withdraw his Board appeal with prejudice, and that the removal action would be joined with the other actions for a single hearing before EEOC. Based on this agreement, the appellant requested that his appeal before the Board be dismissed.... The initial decision advised the appellant that he could file a petition for review if he believed, among other things, that the settlement agreement was the result of mutual mistake. Neither party petitioned the Board for review of the initial decision, however, and it became a final decision of the Board on May 3, 1994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4829"></span>On June 16, 1994, the appellant filed a petition for enforcement with the Board's regional office. With his petition, he submitted a letter dated May 27, 1994, from an EEOC Deputy Director and Administrative Judge advising the parties to the appellant's EEO complaint that the agreement they had entered into, pursuant to which EEOC would consider the appellant's removal along with the other disciplinary actions properly before it, was ineffective "because the Commission does not have authority to conduct a hearing on a mixed case complaint; and neither the parties nor the MSPB can give the Commission that authority." In his initial decision denying the appellant's petition for enforcement, the administrative judge noted that, during a telephone conference held with the parties to discuss the issues raised by the appellant's petition, the appellant had confirmed that he was not seeking to void the agreement based on mutual mistake, but was asking the Board to enforce it. The administrative judge found that no law gave the agency the authority to direct EEOC to comply with the term in the agreement affording the appellant his requested hearing before EEOC, and that no law gave the Board the authority to direct EEOC to conduct that hearing. The administrative judge concluded that the appellant had failed to show that the agency violated the agreement. In the absence of a petition for review from either party, the initial decision became a final decision of the Board on September 23, 1994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 7, 1995, the appellant filed a second petition for enforcement with the Board's regional office. With his petition, he included an order from the EEOC administrative judge stating that the issue of the appellant's removal was not properly before her and that the settlement agreement previously entered into was ineffectual and unlawful because the parties could not confer jurisdiction upon the EEOC over a matter appealable only to the Board. In a subsequently filed submission, the appellant asked the Board to hear his case, arguing for the first time that the settlement agreement was void for mutual mistake....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On consideration of the appellant's second petition for enforcement, the administrative judge dismissed it for lack of regional office jurisdiction. He stated that the appellant's request that the settlement agreement be voided due to mutual mistake must be made by way of a petition for review of the regional office initial decision that incorporated the settlement agreement into the Board's case record (the initial decision of March 29, 1994). The administrative judge further stated that, if the appellant's petition were considered only a petition for enforcement, it would not be within the Board's jurisdiction because the same parties were involved, and because the issue raised was exactly the same as that addressed in the Board's August 19, 1994, initial decision on the appellant's first petition for enforcement.</p>

Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 62 MSPR 530, 532 (1994).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's attorney asserts in her affidavit that she and the appellant first learned that the EEOC would not honor its settlement agreement, that is, that it would not conduct a hearing on his removal, on May 27, 1994, when the EEOC Deputy Director/Administrative Judge remanded the complaint on that basis. Yet the record reflects that when the appellant brought that matter to the Board's attention on June 16, 1994, he specifically told the administrative judge that he was not seeking to void the settlement agreement for mutual mistake but was instead asking the Board to enforce the agreement.... It was not until almost a year later, when the administrative judge convened a conference call with the parties in connection with the appellant's second petition for enforcement on June 13, 1995, that he first argued that the agreement should be struck as void for mutual mistake. Even if the appellant had no basis upon which to argue that the agreement was void for mutual mistake during the time allowed to file a petition for review from the March 29, 1994, initial decision dismissing the appeal as settled, he should have filed within a reasonable time of his receipt of the EEOC Deputy Director/Administrative Judge's May 27, 1994, letter. In fact, in that letter, the EEOC Deputy Director/Administrative Judge specifically suggested that the appellant ask the Board to reinstate his appeal on the ground that, at the time he withdrew it, he was mistaken as to the consequences of that withdrawal. The appellant, however, has advanced no reason for not doing so. Presumably, he believed, at that time, that the Board could order EEOC to comply with the agreement. Nonetheless, the discovery of, or the decision to pursue, a new legal argument after the period for filing a petition for review has expired does not constitute good cause for waiving the time limits. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Gregory v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 66 MSPR 691, 699, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 64 F.3d 677 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). We find, therefore that the appellant has not shown good cause for the untimely filing of his petition for review because he did not exercise due diligence in properly raising his claim of mutual mistake before the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Brady v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 95 MSPR 619, 621 &#x00B6; 5 (2004) (when, during enforcement proceedings, AJ determined that there appeared to be a mutual mistake going to the validity of the agreement, AJ forwarded the case to the Board to consider as a PFR of the initial decision that dismissed the removal appeal as settled; Board set agreement aside because of mutual mistake);<span class="Italic"> cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Virgil v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 109, 112-13 (1997) (if, during compliance proceedings, appellant attacks the validity of settlement, Board will treat challenge as a PFR and determine whether PFR was timely filed).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Scant law exists on mutual mistake. Most cases define the concept by stating what mutual mistake is not. There is no mutual mistake if the settlement term in question is clear and if the appellant has signed the agreement and informed the AJ that she is in full agreement with the settlement. <span class="Italic">Murphy v. VA</span>, 41 MSPR 666, 669 (1989). Mutual mistake apparently does not encompass incomplete understanding of the ramifications of the language of a settlement agreement. Personnel law is so complex that a settlement agreement would fill many pages if each contingency was explained as to the processing of back pay and reinstatement. Parties assume that each will accomplish the settlement using the regulations and laws that are understood to govern the transactions between the parties. <span class="Italic">Morris v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 358, 360-61 (1987), commented:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant asserts that he understood that he would be awarded full back pay and all benefits, but that the agency has taken the position that he will receive back pay, less any interim income he received during the back-pay period. On this basis, appellant argues that fraud or mutual mistake was involved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Back pay for employees of the United States Postal Service is governed by the agency's regulations. <span class="Italic">See Frazier v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States Postal Service,</span> 26 MSPR 584, 585 (1985) (back pay for postal service employees is governed by Part 436 of the Employee and Labor Relations Manual). Thus, the computation of back pay was not a matter for negotiation between appellant and the agency official who executed the settlement agreement. Moreover, appellant has not presented any evidence which would indicate that the agency "fraudulently" obtained appellant's agreement by misrepresenting its regulations or its standard method of back-pay computation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, appellant has not presented evidence of mutual mistake. The agency agreed in the settlement agreement to award appellant full back pay and all benefits. It can be presumed that the agency intended that the agreement be implemented in accordance with its internal regulations. In general, "full back pay" and "all benefits" is understood to mean that these benefits will be awarded consistent with governing statutes or regulations. Thus, appellant has failed to establish that the agreement was premised on "mutual mistake."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another decision illustrates the point that incomplete understanding does not mutual mistake make. <span class="Italic">Piontkowski v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 176, 178 (1988), declined to set aside an agreement after the appellant alleged she learned (following settlement) that pension benefits she would be entitled to under her agreement would be less under the Federal Employee Retirement System than under the Civil Service Retirement System. The Board shrugged off the misunderstanding with the refrain that the appellant is responsible for the handling of her own appeal and for the actions or advice of her chosen representative. Of an appellant who challenged a settlement, under <span class="Italic">Hazlett v. DOJ</span>, 25 MSPR 623, 625 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One who attacks a settlement agreement must bear the burden of showing that the contract he had made is tainted with invalidity, either by fraud practiced upon him or by a mutual mistake under which both parties acted....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's petition for review fails to make the required showing. Appellant, accompanied by his representatives, was present during the meeting with the presiding official, during which time the parties stated the terms of the agreement to the presiding official, who entered these terms into the record. During the course of this meeting, the presiding official asked appellant if he agreed to the terms of the agreement and he informed the presiding official that he did, with the proviso that his privacy be protected at all times. This proviso was added to the agreement. Appellant is now merely arguing that he may not have been adequately informed of the exact terms of the agreement. However, he has produced no evidence to show that the agency practiced a fraud upon him or that a mutual mistake had occurred under which both parties acted.</p>

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 6, 11 (1996). The Board has defined "bad faith" as "the conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose of moral obliquity." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As described above, the parties' January 6, 2017 settlement agreement was premised on the basic assumption that the appellant's security clearance, and attendant access to information necessary to the performance of her duties, had been denied in 2012, and that the propriety of that agency action remained pending before the appropriate authority. The memorandum the appellant submitted to the Board with her petition for review indicates that, in fact, on the day before the parties signed the agreement, her security clearance was granted. Thus, the parties may have executed the agreement under a mutual mistake of fact, i.e., by virtue of the fact that her security clearance had been granted, the appellant now had access to the information she needed to perform her duties. <span class="Italic">Cf. Woodjones v. Department of the Army</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 196, &#x00B6; 12 (2001) (holding that a shared misunderstanding about whether a decision on the appellant's disability retirement application had been made, and the time to challenge it had passed, would be a mutual mistake of fact).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, if the individuals who negotiated the agreement on behalf of the agency knew or had reason to know that the appellant's security clearance had been granted, then, at the very least, the agency would have negotiated the agreement in bad faith, keeping to itself the knowledge that the impediment to the appellant's performing her duties had been lifted. However, there is nothing in the record to indicate whether, at the time the parties executed the settlement agreement, either one knew or had reason to know that the appellant's security clearance had been granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, either under the theory of mutual mistake or bad faith on the part of the agency in negotiating the settlement agreement, it must be set aside. <span class="Italic">Vance v. Department of the Interior</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16 (2010); <span class="Italic">Farrell v.

As a result, the underlying appeal must be reinstated. <span class="Italic">Vance</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an unusual decision the Board remanded for analysis of a possible mutual mistake in a settlement--whether the parties failed to contemplate the conditions necessary for reinstatement of an appellant to a medical position. According to <span class="Italic">Zagajac v. Dept. of Army</span>, CH-0752-13-0385-C-1 (NP 9/1/2016), involving a dispute whether termination of an appointment was, instead, an appealable removal or a RIF:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued a show cause order, directing the appellant to submit argument and evidence that his position was not a term appointment. In response, the appellant argued that, despite the tentative job offer and SF-50s indicating that the position was a term appointment, he understood the position to be permanent and would not have taken the position otherwise. He alleged that the position description provided to him, as well as the agency's firm offer letter, were both silent as to whether the job was term or permanent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant had not yet met his burden of proving jurisdiction, but that he had presented a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction, entitling him to a jurisdictional hearing. Before the administrative judge could hold that hearing, however, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. Among other things, the agreement indicated that the agency would place the appellant in a permanent position no later than July 28, 2013, and the agreement would be submitted to the Board for enforcement purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite not having held the scheduled jurisdictional hearing, the administrative judge dismissed the termination appeal as settled, summarily stating that the Board had jurisdiction over it and indicating that the settlement agreement had been made part of the record for enforcement purposes. Neither party filed a petition for review before that decision became final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In February 2014, the appellant filed a petition for enforcement. The agency responded, acknowledging that it had not placed the appellant in a position as agreed. The agency attributed this failure to its legal obligations under the Crime Control Act of 1990. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 4-5 (citing a section of the Act codified at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 13041, requiring that agencies involved in providing services to minors conduct criminal history background checks on new and existing employees). The agency submitted argument and evidence that the statutorily required criminal background check revealed that the appellant had been charged with a number of criminal offenses, years earlier, including possession of a controlled substance with the intent to sell. The agency requested additional time to determine whether the appellant could be hired, despite that criminal history.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After providing the agency additional time to no avail, the administrative judge granted the appellant's petition for enforcement and ordered the agency to place him in the position of Physician, retroactive to July 28, 2013. The agency has filed a petition for review. The appellant has filed a response. We find that remand is required to address a possible mutual mistake (or mistakes) in the formation of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract between the parties that may be set aside or voided only on the basis of certain limited grounds, including, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, fraud or a mutual mistake of material fact under which both parties acted. <span class="Italic">Vance v. Department of the Interior</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 12 (2010). A mutual mistake of fact is a shared, mistaken belief of the parties regarding a material assumption of fact underlying their agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

Selective Service System</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 376, &#x00B6; 6 &#x0026; n.3 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge properly noted below, the settlement agreement did not contain any provision conditioning the appellant's placement in the Physician position on completion of a criminal background check. Nevertheless, we find that the administrative judge on remand should further develop the record to determine whether the appellant's fitness for employment in terms of his criminal history amounted to a mutual mistake of fact. <span class="Italic">See generally Vance</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16 (finding that the parties may have executed their settlement agreement under a mutual factual mistake that it was possible to give the appellant a clean employment record when, in fact, a previously released report from the agency's Inspector General's Office contained information about the appellant's removal); <span class="Italic">Townsel v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 456, 458-59 (1987) (finding a mutual mistake of fact when both parties mistakenly believed that a settlement agreement stemming from a reduction in force would result in the appellant being placed in a position where he would have seniority over several individuals, making him less vulnerable to future reductions in force).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the above, we vacate the initial decision in the compliance appeal. <span class="Italic">See Adkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 88, &#x00B6; 7 (2002). On remand, the administrative judge should permit the parties to submit argument and evidence, as necessary, concerning the possibility of a mutual mistake of fact. If the administrative judge invalidates the settlement agreement <span id="Page_4832"></span>due to mutual mistake of fact, he shall inquire whether the appellant wishes to reinstate the underlying termination appeal or if the parties wish to negotiate a new settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Vance</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 17.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Zagajac</span> cited <span class="Italic">Evans v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant alleges that the settlement agreement was based on the parties' mistaken belief that the agreement would result in a document satisfying the eligibility requirements for discontinued service retirement. Accordingly, we will address the appellant's mutual mistake claim even though the issue of the Board's jurisdiction over the appellant's alleged involuntary resignation claim remains unresolved.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;A party may challenge the validity of a settlement agreement resulting in the withdrawal of an appeal, even when that agreement is not entered into the Board's record for enforcement, if the party believes that the agreement is unlawful, was involuntary, or was the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Wade v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 580, 582-83 (1994).

However, if, after conducting a jurisdictional hearing on remand, the administrative judge dismisses the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the Board will lack authority to further address the validity of the settlement agreement. The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">Maddox v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's mere allegation that the agency's counsel believed that the appellant was not a whistleblower, and may have persuaded the appellant to believe that he was not, is insufficient to establish a fraudulent misrepresentation. There is nothing in the petition which shows that this belief on the part of the agency's counsel was not a true expression of his opinion or that the agency's counsel advanced such an opinion only to deceive the appellant. Thus, there is no evidence of fraud.... Moreover, if the appellant's contention is actually that he entered into the settlement agreement because he mistakenly believed that he was not a whistleblower, there is still no basis upon which to set aside the agreement because there is no showing that there was any <span class="Italic">mutual</span> mistake.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition, appellant states that he signed the agreement, despite the fact that it contained language to which he had not agreed, because he wanted to let the administrative judge know that he "want[ed] to settle, based on nothing except what was agreed to." However, even though he now submits a copy of the agreement with portions crossed out to indicate the language to which he had not agreed, he did nothing at the time of his entering the agreement to show that he disagreed with the disputed language.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Deboever v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 182, 184-85 (1994), the dispute was over just one word, but that word was of significance, and the Board held the appellant to the agreement, despite the suggestion that the disputed word remained in the agreement by error:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant alleged below that one of the terms in the parties' settlement agreement had been materially altered. Specifically, he challenged the term:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;The appellant agrees to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;* * *</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;Submit a resignation from the United States Postal Service if his application for disability retirement is disapproved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claimed that the version he had agreed to provided that he would submit his resignation from the agency if his application for disability retirement was "approved," rather than "disapproved." The administrative judge found that, inasmuch as this challenge went to the validity of a settlement agreement that was incorporated in a final Board decision, he had no authority to address this issue. Therefore, he recommended that the appellant petition for review if he wished to challenge the validity of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This petition followed, wherein the appellant reiterates his claim that the settlement he had agreed to stated "approved," rather than "disapproved" in the statement at issue....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant has failed to demonstrate that the settlement agreement contains an erroneous term. As the agency asserted below, it is unlikely that it would have agreed to take the appellant back in the event that his disability retirement application was denied, since the settlement agreement also provides that the appellant was <span class="Italic">never</span> to seek employment with the agency again. Further, the agency provided below copies of both the February 16, 1994 draft settlement agreement, which the appellant claims contained the variant term, and a copy of the February 25, 1994 final version. Comparison shows that both versions state that the appellant would resign from the agency if his application for disability retirement was "disapproved."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's representative admits that he was "tired" and not careful in reading the settlement agreement, and that he signed the version stating the term, "disapproved." Moreover, the representative states that <span id="Page_4833"></span>neither he nor the appellant kept a copy of the settlement agreement purportedly containing the claimed term. We find, therefore, that the settlement agreement did at all times state that the appellant would resign if his disability retirement application was "disapproved." Although the appellant and his representative may not have comprehended that fact at the time that they signed the agreement, such failure to realize the full implications of a settlement agreement is insufficient to set the agreement aside<span class="Italic">. See Thompson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 52 MSPR 233, 237 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, additionally, that the settlement agreement provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The parties have read and fully understand this agreement, and it is executed by all parties willingly and freely, and without coercion. It is a full and final resolution of all matters described above, and there are no other terms and conditions not described herein.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant simply presents no valid basis for challenging the validity of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That silence does not create ambiguity in an agreement was concluded in <span class="Italic">Goldstine v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 602, 605-06 (1991). The appellant appealed and settled the denial of a step increase. The settlement included a provision requiring the agency to review the appellant's performance at a specified date. The appellant, disappointed with the results of the review, sought to set the agreement aside for fraud or mutual mistake: he believed that he would receive a "fully satisfactory" rating on the appointed date. Unilateral expectations did not void the agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party who attacks the validity of a settlement agreement has the burden of proving that the agreement was tainted with invalidity either by fraud practiced upon him by the other party, or by the mutual mistake of both parties. <span class="Italic">See Nulty v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Navy,</span> 43 MSPR 57, 59 (1989). The settlement agreement in this appeal specifically states that the parties entered into the agreement freely and without coercion. The appellant, nevertheless, asserts that, through either fraud or mistake, Ms. Bird, the agency's representative, and Lt. Roof, the official who was to review the appellant's performance, led him to believe, by their silence in the face of his stated expectation and desire for a favorable performance review, that he would indeed receive a "fully satisfactory" review. The appellant specifically states in his affidavit, however, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Brenda Bird asked me what I wanted. I told her that I simply wanted my within-grade increase.... Ms. Bird indicated that she could not guarantee how the new Officer in Charge, Lieutenant Roof, would rate me in a performance review if he were to give me one.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having reviewed the appellant's current argument and evidence regarding his subjective understanding of the intentions of Lt. Roof, we find no indication of fraud or mutual mistake. On the contrary, Ms. Bird specifically advised the appellant that she could not guarantee the result of the performance review that he would obtain under the settlement agreement.[*] We find no evidence that the appellant was precluded from negotiating more favorable settlement terms upon his receipt of Ms. Bird's clear advice. <span class="Italic">See Lang v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 35 MSPR 314, 315-16 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;In light of Ms. Bird's specific advice that she could not guarantee the result of the appellant's performance review in advance, we find the appellant's reliance upon <span class="Italic">Schultz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 667 (1988), to be misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Schultz,</span> the agency affirmatively told the appellant, in settlement negotiations, that there were no GS-12 positions available to which she could be assigned. New evidence revealed, however, that a GS-12 employee retired shortly after that appellant entered into the agreement, and, therefore, the Board remanded the appeal to the regional office for a determination of whether the settlement agreement had been tainted by fraud or mutual mistake<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 671-72. Here, by contrast, there is no new evidence indicating that the agency's statement regarding the possible results of the appellant's performance review was inaccurate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, a settlement agreement is a contract between the parties, the interpretation of which is a question of law. <span class="Italic">See Baughman v. Department of the Army</span>, 45 MSPR 580, 586 (1990). In construing a settlement agreement, the Board looks first to the terms of the agreement itself in order to determine the intent of the parties at the time they entered into the contract. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board will consider parol evidence only if the agreement is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Silence in a contract does not necessarily create an ambiguity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no ambiguity in the settlement agreement in this appeal. The parties agreed that the appellant would receive a review of his performance on October 18, 1990. The mere fact that the agreement is silent as to how favorable the review would reveal the appellant's performance to be, does not create an ambiguity requiring the Board to consider the appellant's proffered parol evidence regarding the parties' alleged, unstated expectations of the rating's results.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, as stated above, the appellant specifically agreed in term (6) of the agreement that there were <span class="Italic">no</span> other agreements between the parties, either express or implied, oral or written. The Board will not set aside a settlement agreement where the objections are based upon matters that were not included in the settlement agreement, and the Board has no authority to modify the material terms of a settlement agreement unilaterally. <span class="Italic">Nulty</span>, 43 MSPR at 60.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agreement will not automatically be set aside because future events may make fulfillment of a term either difficult or impossible. Should the event occur, the Board will then determine the meaning and enforceability of the provision. <span class="Italic">Thompson v. VA</span>, 52 MSPR 233, 237 (1992). The concept of mutual mistake should not be confused with a compliance problem. That an agency makes demands on an appellant not contemplated by the settlement agreement does not create mutual mistake as to its meaning. The error is unilateral. Rather than setting the agreement aside through the PFR procedure, the appropriate route is for the appellant to pursue the matter through enforcement proceedings with the Board regional office. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Raphel v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A party may challenge the validity of a settlement agreement, regardless of whether it has been entered into the record for enforcement, if the party believes that the agreement is unlawful, involuntary, or the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Wade v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 580, 583 (1994). The appellant asserts in his petition for review that "a mutual mistake has been made." He does not identify, however, what that mistake is; rather, he asserts that he would like the opportunity for his medication to possibly help him and states his belief that "at some point in time I may be able to find federal employment elsewhere." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This is insufficient to invalidate the agreement on the grounds of mutual mistake. To do so, the appellant must show that both parties were laboring under a mutual mistake of a material fact. <span class="Italic">See Brady v. Department of the Navy</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6; 8 (2004). The appellant has made no allegation that the agency was mistaken as to the meaning of any clause of the agreement. In fact, the appellant does not even allege that he was mistaken as to any clause in the agreement. He essentially asserts that he made a bad bargain. Absent any allegation or evidence of coercion or misinformation, there is no basis for voiding an agreement. <span class="Italic">See Soler-Minardo v. Department of Defense</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 9, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 53 Fed. Appx. 545 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mutual mistake is not established if a settlement is entered by the appellant on the basis of his incorrect understanding of Board law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gregory v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 691, 698 (1995). <span class="Italic">Heath, supra,</span> determined that mutual mistake had occurred as to one matter not litigated by the parties--the jurisdictional basis for the Board's acceptance of their settlement into the record for purposes of enforcement. The parties stipulated Board jurisdiction in the settlement to permit acceptance of the settlement by the Board. On PFR the Board found that a factual basis for jurisdiction was lacking and vacated the initial decision dismissing the appeal as settled. The Board noted in <span class="Italic">Heath,</span> at &#x00B6; 8: "If the parties wish to resuscitate and validate this settlement agreement, they must either forego a finding on jurisdiction and agree that the settlement is not enforceable by the Board or make factual stipulations sufficient to establish Board jurisdiction over the appeal."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, <span class="Italic">Adkins v. USPS</span>, 86 MSPR 671, 676 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2000), set aside a settlement that both parties (incorrectly) thought was within the Board's jurisdiction and enforceable:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A settlement agreement must be set aside if it is tainted with invalidity by a mutual mistake of law under which both parties acted<span class="Italic">. E.g., Stipp v. Department of the Army,</span> 61 MSPR 415, 418-19 (1994) (setting aside settlement agreement due to mutual mistake as to lawfulness of material provision). In this case, the parties settled under the erroneous impression that the settlement agreement would be entered into the record for enforcement by the Board, a mutual mistake of law that goes to the heart of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge may not accept a settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes unless he has first made a determination that the Board has jurisdiction over the underlying action. <span class="Italic">See Cimilluca v. Department of Defense,</span> 77 MSPR 256, 258 (1998). Because the administrative judge never made that determination, the settlement agreement could not properly be entered into the record for enforcement purposes. Nevertheless, entering the settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes was an express term of the oral settlement agreement. Allowing the parties to include this term in the settlement agreement was clear error, requiring the Board to SET ASIDE the settlement agreement and VACATE the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Stipp,</span> 61 MSPR at 418, 420.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Yuan v. Dept. of State</span>, DC-4324-12-0523-I-1 (NP 1/13/2014), vacated a settlement and remanded the case for adjudication when the settlement <span id="Page_4834"></span>contemplated that the AJ would issued an order directing a retroactive promotion in a USERRA appeal. The AJ could accept the agreement or not, but the AJ could not go beyond that authority to issue an order directly implementing the agreement. The parties' mutual error was the assumption that the AJ could order the relief contemplated by the agreement outside of enforcement proceedings. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-023.html#sec16-24">Settlement Requiring Specific Action by Judge,</a>" for <span class="Italic">Yuan</span>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no mutual mistake if an agreement omits a provision that the appellant believes should be there. Assuming the agency does not wish to have that provision in the agreement, the error is unilateral. <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 697, 699 (1990). Mutual mistake will not likely be found as a result of a future occurrence that the parties did not erroneously rely on when they entered into their agreement. In <span class="Italic">As'Salaam v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 417, 421-22 (1994), the appellant settled a case and then OWCP granted him compensation for a period of time that was earlier charged as AWOL and that led, in part, to his adverse action. The appellant argued that if the AWOL had not been charged, there might not have been adverse action taken against him and no settlement would have been required. The post-settlement determination of OWCP eligibility did not, however, establish a mutual mistake by the parties when they signed the agreement, for they contemplated then that the appellant might later obtain OWCP benefits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A settlement agreement may be avoided if it was based on a mutual mistake of material fact. <span class="Italic">Townsel v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 33 MSPR 456, 458 (1987). A material fact "is one in existence at the time of the agreement, one that involves a basic assumption of the [agreement], and one that materially affects...performance [of the agreement]." <span class="Italic">Hartle v. United States</span>, 22 Cl. Ct. 843, 847 (1991) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the appellant correctly argues, an adverse action based on a charge of AWOL cannot be sustained if OWCP determines that "the employee was entitled to compensation benefits as a result of a work-related injury for the entire time period charged as AWOL." <span class="Italic">Parkinson v. US Postal Service</span>, 55 MSPR 552, 554 (1992) (citations omitted). OWCP's decision to award benefits to the appellant for the period May 29, 1993 to August 5, 1993 covers the entire period of AWOL specified in charge one, AWOL, and the period charged as AWOL in the first of the ten specifications making up the second charge, unsatisfactory attendance. It is arguable that, if the parties had not settled the appeal, charge one and the first specification of charge two could not be sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant nevertheless has not shown that the parties were mistaken about a material fact in existence at the time of the settlement agreement. The agreement expressly contemplated that the appellant would pursue a claim for OWCP benefits. The parties, then, were not mistaken about the appellant's eligibility for OWCP benefits. Indeed, they tacitly recognized that the appellant might receive benefits; the parties plainly did not premise their agreement on the assumption that OWCP would deny the appellant's claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hartle</span>, 22 Cl. Ct. at 847 (a mutual mistake is material only if it goes to a basic assumption underlying an agreement). Further, the parties did not hold an erroneous belief about a fact in existence at the time of the settlement agreement, for when they executed the agreement, OWCP had neither decided to award benefits to the appellant nor decided to deny his claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> (a mutual mistake is material only if it relates to a fact in existence at the time of the agreement). We note that the appellant was represented by attorney when he entered into the agreement, and that the appellant and his attorney signed the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the above, we conclude that the appellant's new evidence does not establish that an outcome different from the one reached in the initial decision is warranted, i.e., it does not show that the settlement agreement is invalid....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Satterfield v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 132, 136-37 &#x00B6; 8 (1998) (declining to set aside a last chance agreement when the OWCP awarded benefits covering a period of absence included in AWOL charges; the appellant could have protected himself by securing the dismissal of his appeal without prejudice pending OWCP's resolution of his claim; when the appellant entered into the last chance agreement, the OWCP had not yet approved his claim and the agency did not know, nor should it have then known, that its action could not be sustained).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When a settlement contained language suggesting a broad release of claims through the date of a settlement but contained a latent ambiguity concerning a claim that the appellant erroneously believed ripened after the date of settlement, the release controlled since the error was unilateral; the claim's existence was unknown to the agency, <span class="Italic">Basso v. DHS,</span> AT-1221-10-0906-W-1 (NP 7/10/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant sought review of an initial decision dismissing this individual right of action (IRA) appeal (<span class="Italic">Basso</span> II) for lack of jurisdiction based on the appellant's waiver of appeal rights in the parties' settlement agreement in his first IRA appeal, <span class="Italic">Basso v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, MSPB Docket No. SF-1221-10-0146-W-1, Initial Decision (May 6, 2010) (<span class="Italic">Basso</span> I). In his petition for review, the appellant primarily reasserts his argument that the settlement agreement in <span class="Italic">Basso</span> I did not bar <span class="Italic">Basso</span> II.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge held that the release in the parties' April 29, 2010 settlement agreement, which applied to matters that could have been filed prior to the date of the settlement agreement, clearly included an IRA appeal and that the only remaining issue was whether the appellant could have filed this IRA appeal with the Board on or before April 29, 2010. It is undisputed that the appellant faxed and mailed his second Office of Special Counsel (OSC) complaint on December 29, 2009. The time limit for filing an IRA appeal with the Board, where an appellant has sought corrective action from OSC, and OSC has not notified the appellant that it will seek corrective action on the appellant's behalf within 120 days of the date of filing the request for corrective action, as in this case, is "any time after the expiration of 120 days." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(a)(2); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(B). In computing the number of days allowed to file a submission, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.23, "the first day counted is the day after the event from which the time period begins to run," subject to exceptions not applicable here. Applying the law to the instant case, the first day counted is Wednesday, December 30, 2009, and the 121th day is Thursday, April 29, 2010, which is the first date that the appellant could have filed this IRA appeal with the Board and the date of the last signature on the parties' settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After expiration of the extended deadline for prehearing submissions the appellant sought to admit evidence of an email from OSC that he claims supports his contention that the Board should use January 4, 2010, which is the alleged date that OSC docketed his complaint, as the date he filed his OSC complaint for the purposes of calculating the first available date he could have filed his IRA appeal with the Board, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a). The administrative judge properly rejected the appellant's request to submit this additional evidence and argument regarding the January 4, 2010 date, based on his failure to explain why he could not have submitted this evidence earlier and his previously submitted evidence that clearly reflected that he transmitted his complaint to OSC by facsimile and mail on December 29, 2009. Because the appellant has failed to establish any abuse of discretion by the administrative judge in rejecting his evidence and argument on the alleged January 4, 2010 filing date, the Board need not consider it. <span class="Italic">See Butler v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 313, 317 (1997). In any event, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1800.1(c)(3), an OSC complaint is considered to be filed on the date on which OSC receives the completed OSC-11 form, and the appellant admittedly filed his OSC complaint on December 29, 2009, by fax and mail. Further, the appellant does not claim that OSC failed to receive his complaint on the date he faxed it. Accordingly, we conclude the administrative judge properly used December 29, 2009, as the filing date of the appellant's OSC complaint, in reaching her decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also challenges the validity of the settlement agreement, contending that there was no meeting of the minds of the parties on the scope of the release. Specifically, the appellant argues that he never intended to settle <span class="Italic">Basso</span> II when he executed the settlement agreement in <span class="Italic">Basso</span> I, and that his attorney "expressly modified the release language in both paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Settlement Agreement to expressly limit their applicability to 'matters which were raised or which could have been raised in [the San Francisco appeal] .'" The appellant further argues that he inadvertently failed to revise the preamble language to be consistent with paragraphs 6 and 7, and he did not intend this omission "to override the express waiver provisions of paragraphs 6 and 7."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial paragraph of the parties' settlement agreement states, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This Agreement resolves all matters, issues, and claims which are, or could have been, the basis for a [Board] appeal against the Agency, up to and through the date of the last signature of this Agreement [April 29, 2010].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraph 6 of the settlement agreement states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Appellant hereby withdraws and dismisses with prejudice the aforementioned MSPB appeal, as well as any and all other complaints, grievances, or disputes he currently has or could potentially have, against the Agency <span class="Italic">that relate to matters which were raised or which could have been raised in this appeal or which are covered by this settlement agreement</span>. Furthermore, the Appellant understands, agrees, and covenants that he will not file, or re-file, any of the above, nor will he bring any additional suit on these matters. Additionally, the Appellant accepts these terms of settlement in full and complete release of any and all MSPB&#x00B7; appeals, EEO complaints, or any other claims and demands related to his employment that Appellant or his heirs, executors, administrators, or assignees may have against the Agency <span class="Italic">which were raised or which could have been raised in this appeal or which are covered by this settlement agreement</span>. This provision shall not limit the Appellant's right to seek review by the MSPB for the sole purpose of enforcing the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's attorney modified the original contract language and proposed the language in bold above, which was accepted by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4835"></span>Paragraph 7 of the parties' settlement agreement states, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Appellant further understands and agrees that by signing this agreement, he waives any right and/or claim under the [ADEA] or under [OWBPA]...and waives any other relief not stated in this agreement that is based on any actions attributed to any agency employees, which have been raised or are related to the matters raised in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The interpretation of a settlement agreement, as with all contracts, is a matter of law. <span class="Italic">Washington v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 139, &#x00B6; 12 (2002). In construing the words of a written settlement agreement, the Board must first ascertain whether the agreement clearly states the understanding between the parties. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1463, 1467 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Parol evidence will be considered only if the written agreement is ambiguous<span class="Italic">. Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where the parties hold reasonable but different views of an ambiguous term that goes to the heart of the contract, and neither party had reason to know of any different but reasonable meaning attached by the other, no contract is formed due to a lack of mutuality. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Interior</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 546, &#x00B6; 17 (2000). Whereas, if the agency's interpretation of an ambiguous term that goes to the heart of the contract was reasonable, and the appellant <span class="Italic">had reason to know</span> that the agency attached a materially different meaning to the agreement, the agreement should be interpreted in accordance with the agency's interpretation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 21 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may vacate a settlement agreement if it is unlawful, involuntary, or the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">See Wofford v. Department of Justice</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 6 (2010). Even if invalidity was not apparent at the time of settlement, the agreement must be set aside if it is subsequently shown by new evidence that the agreement was tainted with invalidity by fraud or misrepresentation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant offers no new evidence to support a finding of fraud or misrepresentation by the agency on review, and he has not shown that his new argument is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite his due diligence; thus the Board need not consider it. <span class="Italic">See Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the agency intended and believed that the settlement agreement resolved all of the appellant's employment-related claims against the agency as of the date of the last signature on the settlement agreement. It is also undisputed that the agency was unaware that the appellant had a second complaint pending before OSC during the parties' settlement negotiations. Whereas, the appellant argues that he clearly and expressly altered the waiver and release language in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the settlement agreement, "for the self-evident purpose of limiting the scope of the release so as to exclude the issues raised in the second OSC complaint."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The actions of the appellant's attorney, in modifying the language of the agreement intending to exclude the claims in the appellant's second OSC complaint from coverage, without disclosing the existence of his second OSC complaint to the agency, indicate that he had reason to know that the agency attached a materially different meaning to the agreement. Accordingly, we conclude that any ambiguity regarding the scope of the waiver provisions in the parties' settlement agreement should be interpreted in accordance with the agency's interpretation. Such an interpretation divests the Board of jurisdiction over this appeal. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 546, &#x00B6; 21.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The concept of mutual mistake through impossibility of performance was marginally developed in <span class="Italic">Rhoda v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 576, 578 (1987), implying that a mutual mistake could occur when both parties agreed on a course of action that was impossible at the time the agreement was reached. Appellant settled by agreeing that she would take a specific course of training by a specific date and the agency would then continue her employment. It turned out, however, that the course she was to take had already begun; the next would not begin until after the deadline passed. The agency declined to extend the deadline. The appellant turned to the Board to modify the deadline:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no authority that allows the Board to unilaterally modify a material term in a settlement agreement. However, the Board may set aside a settlement agreement where it finds it is tainted with invalidity, either by fraud or by a mutual mistake under which both parties acted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Asberry v. United States</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Hazlett v. Department of Justice</span>, 25 MSPR 623, 625 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...If the parties entered into the agreement on the mutual and mistaken assumption that it was possible to complete the EMT course by June 30, 1987, then there may be a basis for setting aside the agreement. If it was possible for the appellant to have completed the course by June 30, 1987, the appellant has not complied with the settlement agreement and any further action is at the discretion of the agency.... [W]e have insufficient evidence to determine whether compliance with the settlement agreement was impossible or whether the appellant failed to make diligent efforts to comply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we remand...for the taking of additional evidence and a determination of whether the settlement agreement should be set aside on the basis of mutual mistake.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. DOD</span>, 45 MSPR 263, 265 n.2 (1990) ("As an alternative to setting aside the agreement, the agency contends that the Board should modify it to remove the impediment. The Board, however, lacks authority to unilaterally modify a settlement agreement which is a contract between the parties. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. Department of the Navy</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 78, 82 (1989), and cases cited therein."); <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Byron v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 42 MSPR 665, 672 (1989) (settlement violation: "the Board may modify the terms of the order or agreement for which enforcement is sought where necessary to fashion a remedy for the harm to a party resulting from the other party's noncompliance").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a mutual mistake is to result in the setting aside of a settlement, the error must be material. If the parties found another way to deal with the error, the agreement remains in effect, <span class="Italic">Woodjones v. Dept. of Army</span>, 89 MSPR 196, 200, 202 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13, 17 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A central term of the brief settlement agreement was that the agency would assist the appellant in requesting reconsideration of OPM's denial of her application for disability retirement. A misunderstanding regarding whether a decision had already been issued and the time to challenge it had passed at the time of the settlement agreement would normally appear to constitute a material fact and, if that misunderstanding were shared by both parties, a mutual mistake as well. Under the circumstances of this appeal, however, we find that any mutual mistake of the parties would not be material and therefore would not warrant rescission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is uncontested that the appellant herself received a copy of OPM's decision before she entered into the settlement agreement. Her representative's claim that he was not served provides no basis for finding fault by OPM because his claim of entitlement to a copy is based on his representation of the appellant in this appeal, and he has not asserted that he notified OPM that he was also her representative in connection with her disability retirement application. Nonetheless, a mistaken party's fault in failing to know or discover the facts before contracting does not bar him from avoidance or reformation under most circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement, Second, Contracts, &#x00A7; 157 (1981); <span class="Italic">Bowen-McLaughlin-York Co. v. United States,</span> 813 F.2d 1221, 1223 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Hartle</span>, 22 Cl. Ct. at 849. We need not decide, however, whether the circumstances are such that the appellant should be barred in this instance from seeking to rescind the agreement based on fault because we conclude that, to the extent that the belief that she could file additional evidence with OPM was material in drafting it, she has now gotten what she bargained for by having filed her second application for a disability annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances, we determine that any mutual mistake that may have existed at the time of the agreement was not material because at all times, the appellant had the ability to remedy any such mistake, and did so by timely pursuing her second disability retirement appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the initial decision dismissing the instant appeal as settled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Townsel v. TVA</span>, 33 MSPR 456, 458-59 (1987), set aside a settlement and reinstated an appeal based on the parties' mutual mistake about the existence of a position that the parties expected the appellant to fill through a settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the appellant and the agency agree that, at the very least, the parties were operating under the mutually mistaken belief that there were hourly boilermaker craft employees at the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, the ranks of which the appellant could join. As both parties subsequently learned, there were no hourly boilermaker craft employees at the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant at the time the settlement agreement was read into the record before the administrative judge. Those employees who were thought to be in the hourly boilermaker craft were in fact classified officially as boilermaker-welder craft employees. There is also no dispute that the appellant relied upon the mutual mistake in deciding to accept the settlement offer and withdraw his appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only remaining question--whether the mistake was with regard to a material fact--must also be answered in the affirmative. The appellant asserts, and the agency does not deny, that both the appellant and the agency believed that the settlement agreement would result in the appellant's being placed in a position which was in a competitive level consisting of more than one position. The appellant asserts that that misunderstanding was material because he would not have accepted placement in a position so vulnerable in possible subsequent reductions in force. The appellant explains that he believed he had greater seniority than several of the individuals thought to be in the hourly boilermaker craft at the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant and would, therefore, not be the first to be reached in a reduction in force. The agency has not disputed the appellant's assertions. Under these circumstances, we find that the mutual mistake did involve a material fact upon which the parties relied in reaching the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4836"></span>Accordingly, the initial decision dismissing the appellant's petition for appeal, based upon the settlement agreement entered into the record, is VACATED, the appeal is REINSTATED, and this matter is REMANDED to the Atlanta Regional Office for a full adjudication.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Deason v. USPS</span>, 90 MSPR 319, 323 &#x00B6; 10 (2001), remanded a case for consideration of whether an agreement should be set aside for mutual mistake of the parties concerning the appellant's ability to perform a job assigned to him through the settlement or, alternately, for consideration of whether the agreement should be set aside "because the appellant either fraudulently, or by misrepresentation, failed to disclose before accepting the settlement offer, that he was medically unable to perform the duties of the temporary position."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming that the appellant can make out a case of mutual mistake, the appellant seeking to set aside a settlement for that reason will be required to do so through a PFR to the Board. He will have to either file a PFR within the regulatory time limit--35 days from the date of issuance of the initial decision--or explain why good cause exists for filing an otherwise untimely PFR, i.e., he should show that he timely filed after first learning of the mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Canoles v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 374, 375 (1991) (treating as PFR a "petition to vacate settlement agreement" filed with the regional office and forwarded by the region to the Board).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant (or agency) sets aside a settlement for mutual mistake, the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> is to be restored, that is, matters are returned to the conditions prevailing at the time of the appeal. An agency could, for example, remove the appellant from the position he obtained through a settlement, and that action could possibly lead to another, separate appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Townsel v. TVA</span>, 36 MSPR 356, 358 n.2 (1988). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-231.html#sec16-229">Unlawful Provision</a>."]</p>
