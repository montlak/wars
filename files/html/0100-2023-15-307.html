<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-309_1"><span class="space">5.</span> Performance-Based Actions Against VA Employees Under 38 USC 714</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Semenov v. VA</span>, 2023 MSPB 16, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12, 15-19 (2023), decided that performance-based actions against VA employees under 38 USC 714 are properly evaluated under Chapter 75 rather than Chapter 43 standards, and that, as in a Chapter 75 case, an appeal also requires evaluation of the penalty and affirmative defenses, including EEO, reprisal, and due process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...For the reasons set forth below, we find that the elements for proving a performance-based charge under chapter 43 do not apply to performance-based actions under the VA Accountability Act, and that the proper elements for such cases derive from the Board's application of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal agencies generally may rely on one of two statutory procedures in removing a tenured employee, 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, which covers both misconduct- and performance-based actions, or chapter 43, which covers only actions based on unacceptable performance. <span class="Italic">Brenner v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 990 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (citing <span class="Italic">Harris v. Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, 972 F.3d 1307, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2020); <span class="Italic">Sayers v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 954 F.3d 1370, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2020)). For matters that involve employee behavior occurring after the June 23, 2017 enactment of the VA Accountability Act, the Act provides the Department of Veterans Affairs with a third option when issuing a removal based on either performance or misconduct. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714; <span class="Italic">Brenner</span>, 990 F.3d at 1316-18, 1327-28; <span class="Italic">see</span> Pub. L. No. 115-41, 131 Stat. at 882 (reflecting the June 23, 2017 enactment date for the VA Accountability Act).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated above, the VA Accountability Act provides the agency with an alternative procedure for taking disciplinary actions. <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1374 (citations omitted). The Act provides expedited procedures under which the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs ("the Secretary") "may remove, demote, or suspend" a covered agency employee "if the Secretary determines the performance or misconduct of the covered individual warrants such removal, demotion, or suspension." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(a)(1), (c)(1)-(2); <span class="Italic">Brenner</span>, 990 F.3d at 1317-18. Chapter 43 procedures do not apply to performance-based actions taken under the Act. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(f)(4); 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(3). On appeal from a decision under the Act, the administrative judge and the Board "shall uphold the decision of the Secretary...if the decision is supported by substantial evidence." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(A), (3)(B). "[I]f the decision of the Secretary is supported by substantial evidence, the administrative judge [and the Board] shall not mitigate the penalty prescribed by the Secretary."[4] 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(B), (3)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Nonetheless, as discussed further below, the Board must review the agency's choice of penalty as part of its review of the removal decision. <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1375-79</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question before us here is what substantive standard the Board should apply to performance-based actions under the Act. The interpretation of a statute begins with the language of the statute itself. <span class="Italic">Graves v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 13 (2016). If the language provides a clear answer, the inquiry ends and the plain meaning of the statute is regarded as conclusive absent a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The language of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 plainly precludes the Board from applying the elements of chapter 43 to an action under the VA Accountability Act. In describing the procedures for taking an action under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714, the statute provides that "[t]he procedures under chapter 43 of title 5 shall not apply to a removal, demotion, or suspension under this section." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(3). The substantive standard for actions under chapter 43 is derived from the procedural requirements under that chapter. <span class="Italic">See Mahaffey v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 7 (2007) (setting forth the elements for a chapter 43 performance-based action by citing the portion of <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span>, 767 F.2d at 834 that explains chapter 43's procedural requirements); <span class="Italic">Graham v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 227, 235 (1990) (recognizing that the establishment of valid performance standards is an important substantive right of an employee under chapter 43). We therefore find that Congress did not intend that the Board apply the chapter 43 standard to performance-based actions under the Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In taking a chapter 75 performance-based action, an agency is not bound by any chapter 43 requirements, such as proving the validity of its performance standards, that it provided those standards in advance, or that it provided the employee with an opportunity to improve. <span class="Italic">See Shorey v. Department of the Army</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 239, 243-44 (1998) (finding that an administrative judge erred in applying chapter 43 standards to a chapter 75 case, including the requirement that an agency prove that its standards are valid); <span class="Italic">Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 40-45 (1987) (determining that an employee subject to a performance-based adverse action under chapter 75 has no right to an opportunity to improve (citing <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span>, 767 F.2d at 844 (declining to find that the agency was required to prove the appellant's performance deficiencies were in his critical elements because "the procedural prerequisites of a [c]hapter 43 action...are...inapplicable" to an action taken under chapter 75))), <span class="Italic">aff'd per curiam</span>, 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Graham</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 235-36 (explaining that in a performance-based chapter 75 action, an agency is not required to prove the validity of its standards and it is not required to establish and identify those standards in advance).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the context of actions taken under chapter 75, agencies have great discretion in setting goals, provided they do not charge an employee with failing to have performed better than was required under his chapter 43 critical elements. <span class="Italic">See Lovshin</span>, 767 F.2d at 842-43 (recognizing that agencies that have failed to properly define or evaluate performance standards under chapter 43 are nonetheless permitted to take an action under chapter 75 if they can meet the higher burden of proof). Agencies may even take an action under chapter 75 based on <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> goals, meaning those that were not established and identified in advance for the employee, but rather were required when the agency took the action. <span class="Italic">Graham</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 235. Under chapter 75, the agency must prove only that its performance standard was reasonable and provided for accurate measurement of the appellant's performance, and that the appellant's performance was unacceptable according to that measurement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 235-36. We find that this standard is consistent with the VA Accountability Act's requirement that an employee's performance "warrant[ ]" the Secretary's chosen disciplinary action. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(a)(1). Thus, we find that the chapter 75 standard is appropriately applied to performance-based actions under the Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of any clear indication in the VA Accountability Act or its legislative history addressing the appropriate standard for performance-based actions, we conclude that the chapter 75 standard should apply. We acknowledge that the Act was intended to make it easier to discipline employees under its provisions than under chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1376-77 (citation omitted). However, we find that the application of the lower substantial evidence standard and the Board's inability to mitigate the penalty in appeals under the Act achieves the statutory intent without requiring the creation of an entirely separate substantive standard. Because the administrative judge required the agency to prove the validity of its publication standard as required in an action under chapter 43, i.e., that its standard was reasonable, realistic, and attainable, we remand the appeal for further consideration under the appropriate standard. <span class="Italic">See Thomas</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 123, &#x00B6; 12. On remand, the agency must show by substantial evidence that its performance standard was reasonable, provided for accurate measurement of the appellant's performance, and that the appellant's performance was unacceptable according to that measurement. <span class="Italic">See Graham</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 235.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Semenov</span> determined that the Board's review of the performance-based case under 38 USC 714 is governed by substantial evidence presented to the Board, although the VA deciding official is supposed to evaluate the case under a preponderant evidence standard, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-22:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official sustained the appellant's removal based on her conclusion that substantial evidence supported the charge of failure in a critical performance element. After the initial decision in this case was issued, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) decided <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 8 F.4th 1290, 1296-1301 (Fed. Cir. 2021), in which it determined that the agency erred by applying a substantial evidence burden of proof to its internal review of a disciplinary action under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714. The court found that substantial evidence is the standard of review to be applied by the Board, not the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1298-1300. One of the bases for the court's conclusion was <span id="Page_2846"></span>that because 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 requires that an agency's deciding official "determine" whether "the performance or misconduct...warrants" the action at issue, the deciding official must use a preponderance of the evidence burden of proof. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1298-1301.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit's decision in Rodriguez applies to all pending cases, regardless of when the events at issue took place. <span class="Italic">See Lee v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2022 MSPB 11, &#x00B6; 16 (recognizing that a new precedential Federal Circuit decision applied to all cases pending with the Board). The administrative judge and the parties did not have the benefit of <span class="Italic">Rodriguez</span>, and therefore were unable to address its impact on this appeal. We therefore remand this case for adjudication of whether the agency's application of the substantial evidence standard of proof was harmful error.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Rodriguez</span>, as here, the deciding official appeared to have applied the substantial evidence standard in sustaining the charges. <span class="Italic">Rodriguez</span>, 8 F.4th at 1297. In remanding the case to the Board, the Federal Circuit stated that further proceedings would "[p]resumably...include requiring the [agency's] deciding official to determine whether the evidence as to each of the charges<span class="Italic">...</span>satisfied the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1301. We have considered whether it would be more appropriate to remand this matter to the agency for the deciding official to make this determination before the Board reviews the action. The Board has remanded some procedural error claims directly to agencies, but we find that the exceptional circumstances requiring such remands are not present here. For example, the Board has remanded a removal to an agency when it was based on the appellant's failure to maintain eligibility to obtain access to classified information, but the agency did not follow its own procedures in terminating that eligibility. <span class="Italic">Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4, 20, 29-33 (2012). Remand to the agency was necessary under those circumstances because eligibility for access to classified information is a matter within the agency's sole discretion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28-29, 32-33. Here, there is nothing similarly within the agency's sole discretion concerning the level of review the deciding official afforded in this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Semenov</span> also determined that the Board must evaluate affirmative defenses, e.g., harmful error, EEO, whistleblower reprisal, due process in the 38 USC 714 appeal, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-29, 35-37:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 does not contain any language regarding the adjudication of a claim of harmful agency error, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(c)(4)(A), (d)(1), an administrative judge adjudicates an action taken under the VA Accountability Act under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(1). An agency's action "may not be sustained under [&#x00A7; 7701(b)]" if the agency committed harmful error, based its decision on a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b), or "the decision was not in accordance with law." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2). Thus, we find it appropriate to apply to actions taken under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 the harmful error standard from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2). A harmful error is an error by the agency in the application of its procedures that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a different conclusion from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Ronso v. Department of the Navy</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 391, &#x00B6; 14 (2015); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(r). The appellant bears the burden of proving his affirmative defenses by preponderant evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge should provide the parties with an opportunity to present evidence and argument, including a supplemental hearing, addressing whether the agency's use of the substantial evidence standard in the removal decision constituted harmful error. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1), (b)(1). The administrative judge should then address this affirmative defense in his remand initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless of whether the appellant proves harmful error in the agency's application of the substantial evidence burden of proof in the removal decision, if any argument or evidence on remand affects the administrative judge's analysis of the appellant's affirmative defenses or the agency's penalty, he should address such argument or evidence in the remand initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980) (explaining that an initial decision must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, resolve issues of credibility, and include the administrative judge's conclusions of law and his legal reasoning, as well as the authorities on which that reasoning rests).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reiterates his argument that his FY 2018 performance standards and rating are invalid because the agency failed to comply with the performance appraisal procedures set forth in the agency's Handbook 5013, Performance Management Systems. He also argues on review, as he did below, that the agency violated other provisions of Handbook 5013, chapter 43, and the VA Accountability Act by, for example, failing to encourage his participation in the development of his standards or to obtain concurrence from an approval official for his Unacceptable FY 2018 rating. He further reasserts his claim that his removal may not be sustained because the GRECC Director lacked the authority to propose his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the administrative judge analyzed these allegations, he analyzed them as challenges to the validity of the appellant's FY 2018 performance standards. Although not entirely clear, he appears to have considered the validity of the appellant's standards as part of the agency's burden to prove the charge. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find that these claims are more properly analyzed as allegations of harmful error, rather than as part of the agency's case. On remand, the administrative judge should address the appellant's various claims of procedural error under the harmful error standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reiterates his argument from below that because the publication standard was "arbitrary," the agency violated the merit system principle at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(6), which provides that "[e]mployees should be retained based on the adequacy of their performance." Likewise, he restates his argument that the standard violated the merit system principle at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(8)(A), which provides, in part, that "[e]mployees should be protected against arbitrary action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, an agency's action may not be sustained if it was based on any personnel practice prohibited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b), which includes "violat[ing] any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(b)(12), 7701(c)(2)(B). These principles include the two identified by the appellant regarding employee retention and arbitrary actions. The administrative judge did not directly address the appellant's claims regarding the agency's violation of these merit system principles. Therefore, on remand, he must do so. <span class="Italic">See Lovshin</span>, 767 F.2d at 841-42 (recognizing that an alleged violation of the merit system principles is a defense to an action under chapter 75); <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 19 (2012) (finding that an appellant was entitled to a full opportunity to present evidence on remand regarding her claims that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12)). The administrative judge should allow the parties to present additional evidence and argument on these claims, if appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a chapter 43 or chapter 75 appeal, the Board adjudicates an appellant's claim of whistleblower reprisal as an affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">Pridgen</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6; 49; <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Department of the Army</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 674, &#x00B6; 11 (2016). In such instances, once the agency proves its adverse action case, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that he made a protected disclosure or engaged in protected activity and that the disclosure or activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action at issue. <span class="Italic">Pridgen</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6; 49; <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 674, &#x00B6; 11. If the appellant meets this burden, the agency must prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action absent the protected disclosure or activity. <span class="Italic">Pridgen</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6; 49; <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 674, &#x00B6; 12. In determining whether the agency has met this burden, the Board will consider all the relevant factors, including the following: (1) the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who did not engage in such protected activity, but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this analytical framework is appropriate for adjudicating a claim of whistleblower reprisal raised in an appeal of an action taken pursuant to the VA Accountability Act. We have previously observed that, under the Act, Congress generally intended to retain existing protections for agency employees. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2022 MSPB 7, &#x00B6; 22 (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1377 (concluding that Congress "intend[ed] to maintain" employees' due process rights in connection with actions taken under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 (citations omitted)). More specifically, Congress intended to preserve, and in fact expand, the preexisting protections for whistleblowers. <span class="Italic">E.g</span>., 163 Cong. Rec. H4867-07, H4868 (daily ed. June 13, 2017) (statement of Rep. Buck that the VA Accountability Act "bolsters protection for whistleblowers" by creating a new office within the agency to protect them and by holding supervisors accountable for how well they protect whistleblowers); 163 Cong. Rec. H4863-02, H4864 (daily ed. June 13, 2017) (statement of Rep. Roby that the VA Accountability Act "also increases protections for whistleblowers who put themselves at risk to improve the lives and care for veterans"); 163 Cong. Rec. S3261-01, S3276 (daily ed. June 6, 2017) (statement of Sen. Nelson that the VA Accountability Act would "create new protections for whistleblowers"). Title I of the VA Accountability Act establishes an Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection within the agency. Pub. L. No. 115-41, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101-103, 131 Stat. 862, 863-68 (codified at 38 U.S.C. <span id="Page_2847"></span>&#x00A7; 323). The presidentially appointed head of this office reports directly to the Secretary of the agency. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 323(b). The office is charged with various duties related to the protection of whistleblowers, such as recommending discipline for alleged retaliators, and is required to report to Congress annually. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;323(c), (f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, when an employee files a whistleblower reprisal complaint with the Office of Special Counsel or the agency's Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection, the agency's action against that employee generally is forestalled until the investigation is complete. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(f); 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(e)(2). In light of Title I of the VA Accountability Act, the enhanced protection for whistleblowers set forth in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714(e), and the stated intent of Congress to continue protections for whistleblowers, we find it appropriate to adjudicate whistleblower reprisal claims under the VA Accountability Act in the same manner as we have adjudicated them when raised in an appeal of an action taken under chapter 43 and chapter 75.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Continuing with a discussion of penalty determination and Board review in the performance case, <span class="Italic">Semenov</span> explained, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 44-49:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that because the agency proved the charge by substantial evidence, the removal penalty must be affirmed. Therefore, he found it was unnecessary to review the agency's penalty determination or address the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. At the time of the initial decision, the administrative judge did not have the benefit of the Federal Circuit's decisions in <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, <span class="Italic">Brenner</span>, and <span class="Italic">Connor v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 8 F.4th 1319 (Fed. Cir. 2021).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the VA Accountability Act, "if the decision of the Secretary is supported by substantial evidence, the...Board [and its administrative judges] shall not mitigate the penalty prescribed by the Secretary" in an action taken under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 714(d)(2)(B), (d)(3)(C). The Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Sayers</span> clarified that, while the Board may not "mitigate the penalty," nevertheless, "&#x00A7; 714 requires the Board to review for substantial evidence the entirety of the [agency's] removal decision--including the penalty--rather than merely confirming that the record contains substantial evidence that the alleged conduct leading to the adverse action actually occurred." 954 F.3d at 1379. In <span class="Italic">Brenner</span>, 990 F.3d at 1323-27, the court further held that the Board's review must include the agency's penalty determination whether the action is based on misconduct or performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other than the requirement that the decision of the Secretary be supported by substantial evidence, the VA Accountability Act does not provide guidance for reviewing the agency's penalty. Therefore, as with our analysis of the charge, we start by examining the standard of penalty review used by the Board in other performance-based actions. The Board does not review the agency's penalty in chapter 43 actions, <span class="Italic">Lisiecki v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 769 F.2d 1558, 1565 (Fed. Cir. 1985), and the Federal Circuit has rejected applying chapter 43's lack of penalty review to actions taken under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714, <span class="Italic">Brenner</span>, 990 F.3d at 1326-27; <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1378-79. Therefore, chapter 43 cannot provide any guidance on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board recognized in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> that it inherited from its predecessor, the Civil Service Commission, the authority to review the appropriateness of agency penalties. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 280 M.S.P.R. at 298-99. This review included consideration of a nonexhaustive list of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that are relevant to determining the propriety of a penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 303-06. Congress presumably was aware of this history of Board penalty review, including the application of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, when it enacted the VA Accountability Act. <span class="Italic">See Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1375.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the VA Accountability Act prohibits the Board from mitigating the agency's penalty, we find that the Board's framework for chapter 75 penalty analysis is otherwise consistent with the Act. The Board's penalty review is essentially to assure that the agency conscientiously considered the relevant factors and struck a responsible balance of the factors within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 306. If the Board sustains an agency's charge in a chapter 75 action, it will affirm the agency-imposed penalty under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> unless it finds that the agency failed to weigh the relevant factors or the penalty imposed clearly exceeded the bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Wiley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 535, &#x00B6; 14 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd per curiam</span>, 218 F. App'x 1001 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our determination is consistent with the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Connor</span>. In that case, the Federal Circuit determined that the Board must consider and apply the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors when reviewing penalties under the VA Accountability Act. <span class="Italic">Connor</span>, 8 F.4th at 1325-26. The court held that, although the VA Accountability Act precludes the Board from mitigating the agency's chosen penalty, "[i]t does not alter the penalty review with respect to the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1326. Because the Board cannot mitigate the penalty, "if the Board determines that the [agency] failed to consider the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors or that the chosen penalty is unreasonable, the Board must remand to the [agency] for a redetermination of the penalty." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1326-27 (citing <span class="Italic">Brenner</span>, 990 F.3d at 1325 (determining that "if the [Board] concludes that the [agency's] removal decision is unsupported by substantial evidence, the [Board] should remand to the [agency] for further proceedings")).</p>
