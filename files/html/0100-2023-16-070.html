<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-71"><span class="space">3.</span> Change in Employment Conditions</h4>
<p class="noindent">Before there is an obligation to bargain there must be an actual change in unit employees' working conditions. But the definition of a working condition can, like any other term, become the subject of controversy. FLRA attempted to provide guidance in <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP, El Paso and AFGE Local 1929</span>, 70 FLRA 501, 502-04 (2018) (recon. den., <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1929</span>, 71 FLRA 49 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting), <span class="Italic">post</span>; review granted, remanded, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1929 v. FLRA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200609172">961 F.3d 452</a> (D.C. Cir. 2020), following remand, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1929</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-2.html">72 FLRA 7</a> (2021) (Member DuBester dissenting in part) (discussed in "<a href="0100-2023-13-004.html#sec5-5">Employment Condition</a>"). Whether its decision helps or not is a question left to the reader. The FLRA majority decided to distinguish conditions of employment and working conditions in its review of exceptions to an arbitrator's award involving a grievance over changes in vehicle inspection procedures by Border Patrol agents:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our Statute requires that an agency must provide notice, and an opportunity to bargain, before it may change "conditions of employment."[24] "Conditions of employment" are defined, in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14), as "personnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, <span class="Italic">affecting working conditions</span>."[25] Through a convoluted evolution, however, the Authority came to the erroneous conclusion that "there is no substantive difference between [the terms] 'conditions of employment' and 'working conditions.'"[26] That notion, however, defies both judicial and commonsense rules of definition and is "support[ed] [by nothing more] than the Authority's own repetition of it."[27] It is imperative, therefore, that we take this opportunity to clarify that there is a distinction between those terms.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[24]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. DHS, U.S. Citizenship &#x0026; Immigration Servs</span>., 69 FLRA 512, 515 (2016).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, 355th MSG/CC, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz.</span>, 64 FLRA 85, 90 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[27]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">GSA, E. Distrib. Ctr., Burlington, N.J.</span>, 68 FLRA 70, 80 (2014) (<span class="Italic">GSA</span>) (Dissenting Opinion of Member Pizzella).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is a basic canon of statutory interpretation that "Congress acts intentionally" when it "inclu[des] or exclu[des]" particular words in a statute.[28] Congress defined the term "<span class="Italic">conditions of employment</span>" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) as those "personnel policies, practices, and matters" which "affect[&#8197;] <span class="Italic">working conditions</span>."[29] Under accepted rules of statutory interpretation, two different terms used in the same context cannot mean the same thing and therefore must mean something different. In the context of our Statute, the distinction between these two terms lies at the very foundation of differentiating between purported changes that are, and are not, subject to a duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[28]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., Russello v. United States</span>, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[29]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To assert that the terms "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" mean the same thing[30] is to engage in a type of circular reasoning that has been criticized by the United States Supreme Court.[31] It is little different than trying to define a <span class="Italic">rock</span> as a <span class="Italic">rock-like object or a cellular phone as a phone that is cellular</span>.

<p class="noindent-1">First, the Authority has previously held that mere increases or decreases in normal duties do not constitute changes over which an agency must bargain.[37]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[37]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA 577, 579-80 (2012) (finding that an increased workload did not constitute a bargainable change), <span class="Italic">pet. for review denied sub nom.

<p class="noindent-1">Second, the memorandum did not change the <span class="Italic">nature of</span> or the <span class="Italic">type of</span> duties the officers performed. In effect, the memorandum conveyed instructions from the division chief to his agents detailing how they were to perform inspections when it came to referring vehicles from the primary to secondary lane for additional scrutiny. Supervisors have the responsibility, and must have the prerogative, to direct, redirect, and even adjust how employees perform their jobs.[38] A supervisor does not have to negotiate with the union every time she adjusts or alters how employees will perform their duties.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Third, the directions contained in the memorandum did not change anything and they did not impact a condition of employment. Both before and after the memorandum, the agents continued to perform vehicular inspections at either the primary or secondary inspection areas using the same techniques.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Statute did not require CBP to bargain in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also found that CBP violated Article 3A.&#x2003;But Article 3A expressly states that the parties are not required to bargain over any matter that they are "not obligated to negotiate under applicable law." Because we have determined that the Statute does not require CBP to bargain with the Union under these circumstances, CBP also was not obligated to bargain under Article 3A. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's finding of a contractual violation also cannot stand.[42]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span> does not support the Authority's conclusion that the terms "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" have distinct meanings. However, as the Agency notes, that conclusion is based on the plain wording of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14)--not <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span>. Section 7103(a)(14) defines the term "<span class="Italic">conditions of employment</span>" as those "personnel policies, practices, and matters" which "<span class="Italic">affect[</span><span class="Italic">&#8197;</span><span class="Italic">] working conditions</span>." Applying a basic canon of statutory interpretation,[20] the Authority in <span class="Italic">DHS</span> found that those two <span class="Italic">different</span> terms--one of which Congress used <span class="Italic">to define</span> the other--cannot mean the same thing.[21] When referring to <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span>, the Authority found it persuasive that the Court had previously recognized that "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" are susceptible to <span class="Italic">distinct</span> interpretations.[22] Therefore, contrary to the Union's contention, that case <span class="Italic">does</span> support the conclusion that "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" are <span class="Italic">not</span> synonymous terms.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union next argues that the Authority in DHS erred in its conclusions of law because none of the cases that the Authority cited stand for the proposition that variations to the volume of employees' normal duties do not constitute changes over which an agency must bargain. This is simply untrue. The Authority cited <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, Border and Transportation Security Directorate, U.S. CBP, Border Patrol, Tucson Sector, Tucson, Arizona (CBP)</span>.[24] In that case, the agency was responsible for patrolling the United States border with Mexico and apprehending, and then processing, illegal aliens.[25] After the agency experienced a "sharp increase in illegal[-]alien activity,"[26] it began rerouting detained aliens to the Tucson Station for processing.[27] As a result, employees working at the Tucson Station saw a significant increase in their "processing" duties.[28]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the parties' agreement by refusing to bargain over non-lethal weapons. In finding a duty to bargain, the Arbitrator found that "[v]iolence in the prisons has increased substantially over the years with...more aggressive and more gang related activity"; "[l]ower level institutions," such as the Agency's facility, were "being assigned maximum custody inmates"; and "prisons are overcrowded with more inmates and fewer staff." The Arbitrator found that these factors "constitute[d] a change in working conditions [that] trigger[ed] the application of Article 3 of the [parties' agreement] calling for negotiations."<span class="Italic"> </span>However, the award contains no factual findings regarding whether these factors resulted from any change the Agency had made in its policies, practices, or procedures. As such, the record does <span id="Page_1296"></span>not contain sufficient factual findings to determine whether the Agency violated the Statute by failing to provide the Union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over changes to conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Reduced to its essentials, a change in working conditions may occur if the agency requires its employees to do something not previously required of them.

Bargaining obligations do not arise if the changes do not modify routine practice. No bargainable change in employment conditions occurred when the agency loaned out several of its own attorneys to the U.S. Attorney's Office to prosecute misdemeanors occurring on activity property. The U.S. Attorney prosecuted the cases in the past and the prosecutorial procedures remained the same. <span class="Italic">DLA, Alexandria and AFGE Local 1148</span>, 22 FLRA 327, 327-28 (1986). An established practice of shifting workload imbalances among offices, but not changing the type or risk of the work or the duties performed by employees, did not constitute a change in a condition of employment; the increase in the amount of work did not constitute a change in working conditions. <span class="Italic">DHS, Border Patrol Tucson Sector and AFGE Local 2544</span>, 60 FLRA 169, 173-74 (2004). A directive to concentrate on certain categories of cases, e.g., taxpayer delinquencies, was not a change in working conditions.

Because a change in working conditions, to have a negotiable impact, must affect employees of the unit, a decision (in accordance with FLRA decisions) to discontinue the practice of permitting union officials of one unit to have official time to bargain for the employees of another unit, did not require impact bargaining.

<p class="noindent-1">To find that an agency has violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) by failing to provide a union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over changes to conditions of employment, there must be a threshold determination that the agency made a change in a policy, practice, or procedure affecting unit employees' conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See VA Sheridan</span>, 59 FLRA at 94 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Labor, OSHA, Region 1, Bos., Mass.</span>, 58 FLRA 213, 215 (2002) (<span class="Italic">OSHA</span>) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring); <span class="Italic">U.S. Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv., N.Y.C., N.Y.</span>, 52 FLRA 582, 585-86 (1996); <span class="Italic">INS Houston</span>, 50 FLRA at 143-44).

In addition, where employees' "volume" of work or "number" of assignments increases, but those increases are not attributable to any change in the agency's policies, practices, or procedures affecting working conditions, the Authority has found that such increases "[s]tanding alone" do not trigger notice-and-bargaining obligations under &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5). <span class="Italic">See VA Sheridan</span>, 59 FLRA at 94-95.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Authority should establish a "bright line rule" that significantly increased workloads trigger an agency's notice-and-bargaining obligations under &#x00A7; 7116 regardless of whether the increase is "precipitated by the agency." But this argument ignores that the Authority has long held that agencies violate their &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5) notice-and-bargaining obligations only where, as relevant here, they make "unilateral changes" to conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv</span>., 66 FLRA 528, 528, 530 (2012) ("unilateral[&#8197;] reclassifi[cation]"); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy Naval Aviation Depot, Jacksonville, Fla</span>., 63 FLRA 365, 369-70 (2009) ("unilateral implementation" of new instruction); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Ill.</span>, 5 FLRA 9, 10-11 (1981); <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Serv., Wash., D.C.,</span> 4 FLRA 488 (1980). The Union has not explained how an agency could unilaterally change conditions of employment--and thereby violate &#x00A7; 7116--if it has not made any change to a policy, practice, or procedure affecting conditions of employment. Accordingly, we reject the Union's request to establish a new "bright line rule" that significantly increased workloads necessarily trigger statutory notice-and-bargaining obligations, regardless of whether the increase is "precipitated by the agency."</p>
<p class="noindent">Affirming FLRA on the issue of the bargaining obligation, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 745 F.3d 1219, 1224-25 (D.C. Cir. 2014), declared:</p>

Rather, the "notice-and-bargaining" obligations derive from the Authority's interpretation of the Statute's mandate in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) that agencies must bargain in good faith over working conditions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Space &#x0026; Missile Sys.

Under that precedent, these obligations arise only if the agency has "made a change in a policy, practice, or procedure affecting unit employees' conditions of employment." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. at 579. More particularly, "where employees' 'volume' of work or 'number' of assignments increases, but those increases are not attributable to any change in the agency's policies, practices, or procedures affecting working conditions,...[the] increases '[s]tanding alone' do not trigger notice-and-bargaining obligations under &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 579-80 (quoting <span class="Italic">Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 59 F.L.R.A. at 94-95).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not suggest that the Authority's interpretation requiring a unilateral change by an agency to trigger notice-and-midterm bargaining is contrary to the Statute, and we agree that the Authority's interpretation "is certainly consistent with the [Statute] and, to the extent the statute and congressional intent are unclear, we may rely on the Authority's reasonable judgment." <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, 527 U.S. at 234. Instead, the Union contends, as it had argued to the Authority in opposing the IRS's exceptions, that the Arbitrator, in emphasizing factors within the IRS's control, applied the correct legal standard for changes to working conditions in finding an unfair labor practice by the IRS. Responding, the Authority reasonably rejected, in light of its precedent, both the Arbitrator's approach and the Union's proposal for a "'bright-line rule' that significantly increased workloads trigger an agency's notice-and-bargaining obligations under &#x00A7; 7116 regardless of whether the increase is 'precipitated by the agency.'" <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. at 580 (quoting Union's Opposition to the Agency's Exceptions at 30). The Authority explained that "[t]he Union has not explained how an agency could <span class="Italic">unilaterally change</span> conditions of employment--and thereby violate &#x00A7; 7116--if it has not <span class="Italic">made any change</span> to a policy, practice, or procedure affecting conditions of employment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union no longer presses its bright-line rule, which the Authority viewed as seeking a change in its precedent. Instead the Union contends first that the Authority impermissibly ignored the Arbitrator's factual findings that there was a change in conditions of employment. The Union relies on the principle that in reviewing questions of law, the Authority is to defer to the Arbitrator's findings of fact. <span class="Italic">See United States DOC PTO</span>, 52 F.L.R.A. 358, 367 (1996); <span class="Italic">accord Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Emps., Local 1437</span>, 53 F.L.R.A. 1703, 1710 &#x0026; n.6 (1998). It points to the Arbitrator's findings that the IRS "has control" over factors that affect Case Advocates' workloads, including staffing and case processing procedures. In the Union's view, even under the Authority's narrow "policy, practice, and procedure" standard the Authority's application of it was erroneous because the IRS was an actor in creating a different and difficult work environment. But the Authority's determination that the IRS did not make any unilateral change was consistent with the Arbitrator's factual finding that the IRS "divide[d] up an ever-growing pool of cases among virtually the same number of existing Case Advocates without making other reasonable adjustments." Under Authority precedent, this was the critical finding: The IRS responded to outside factors, but initiated no change of its own to its policies, practices, or procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Union's second contention, that the Authority's narrow standard is inconsistent with the statutory definition of "conditions of employment," which includes "personnel policies, practices, and matters...affecting working conditions," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14), is unconvincing. Although the Case Advocates may have experienced a change in "practices" and "matters" affecting their working conditions between 2006 and 2009, the Arbitrator did not find that these changes had been initiated by the IRS. The reasonableness of the Authority's judgment in adopting a clear threshold principle for triggering an agency's "notice-and-bargaining" obligations is highlighted by the Arbitrator's implicit recognition that any other rule would leave an agency guessing about when its obligations are triggered by the gradual influence of external factors; in rejecting the Union's request for a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy, the Arbitrator observed that "it would be difficult if not impossible to determine exactly to what point in time the [IRS] must return." The Authority's determination, relying on its precedent, that the Arbitrator erred in finding an unfair labor practice was adequately explained and is neither arbitrary nor capricious. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 706(2)(A), 7123(c). And to the Union's assertion that under the Authority's narrow standard unions would be denied the ability to negotiate over changes in working conditions solely because the changes were not initiated by an agency, the Authority responds that its interpretation does not relieve an agency of its duty to respond to union-initiated proposals within the duty to bargain; it only limits an agency's obligation to provide advance notice and an opportunity to bargain to situations where the agency itself has initiated a unilateral change. <span class="Italic">See Library of Congress v. FLRA</span>, 699 F.2d 1280, 1289-90, 226 U.S. App. D.C. 128 (D.C. Cir. 1983).</p>
