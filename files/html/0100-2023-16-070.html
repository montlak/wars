<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-69"><span class="space">3.</span> Time Allowed for Improvement</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">No government-wide rule or regulation establishes the time permitted to demonstrate improvement. The length of a performance improvement period is within the discretion of the agency. Some agencies provide guidance in regulations or operating instructions or collective bargaining agreements; some do not. All that is required is notice of deficient performance and a reasonable opportunity to improve. <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3088) (citing <span class="Italic">Martin v. FAA</span>, 795 F.2d 995, 997 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); 5 CFR 432.104 (1987). Once the notice is given to the employee, and the agency provides the employee with a reasonable opportunity to improve, the agency may remove the employee for unacceptable performance during the PIP period. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 24 MSPR 583, 586 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Ray v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 289, 292 (1987) (45 days for an improvement period was sufficient when the appellant had also been issued letters of caution and reprimand). If the agency does not abide by a regulatory requirement defining the length of the PIP, the Board assesses the deviation under the harmful error rule. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wood v. Navy</span>, 27 MSPR 659, 663 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although no government-wide regulation or OPM rule establishes the minimum or maximum period of a PIP, on May 25, 2018, President Trump issued Executive Order 13,839, "Executive Order Promoting Accountability and Streamlining Removal Procedures Consistent with Merit System Principles," at <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11939/promoting-accountability-and-streamlining-removal-procedures-consistent-with-merit-system-principles">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11939/promoting-accountability-and-streamlining-removal-procedures-consistent-with-merit-system-principles</a>, including Section 4:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Managing the Federal Workforce: To promote good morale in the Federal workforce, employee accountability, and high performance, and to ensure the effective and efficient accomplishment of agency missions and the efficiency of the Federal service, to the extent consistent with law, no agency shall:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;generally afford any employee more than a 30-day period to demonstrate acceptable performance under section 4302(c)(6) of title 5, United States Code, except when the agency determines in its sole and exclusive discretion that a longer period is necessary to provide sufficient time to evaluate an employee's performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Litigation to enjoin the executive order resulted in a decision of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in <span class="Italic">AFGE v. Trump</span>, 318 F. Supp.3d 370 (D.D.C. 2018) [<a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2018cv1261-58">https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2018cv1261-58</a>], enjoining portions of the order. The operative section of the court's order was that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FURTHER ORDERED that sections 5(a), 5(e), and 6 of Executive Order 13,836 (also known as "The Collective Bargaining Procedures Order"); sections 3(a), 4(a), and 4(b) of Executive Order 13,837 (also known as "The Official Time Order"); and sections 3, 4(a), and 4(c) of Executive Order 13,839 (also known as "The Removal Procedures Order") are hereby declared INVALID. All other provisions of these Executive Orders REMAIN IN EFFECT.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The supporting memorandum opinion of District Judge Jackson provides a lengthy review of the history of federal sector labor relations. The decision was appealed to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That court vacated the district court's decision. The appellate court determined that sufficient means existed to challenge collective bargaining approaches by agencies under the Executive Order; no basis existed for the court to enjoin that order as a negation of statutory bargaining rights, <span class="Italic">AFGE v.

On November 25, 2019, OPM directed agencies to comply with the Executive Order, stating as to the period for a PIP ("Updated Guidance on Implementation of Executive Orders 13836, 13837, and 13839"):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Agencies generally should not afford employees more than a thirty (30) day period to demonstrate acceptable performance pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(c)(6), except when the agency determines that a longer period is necessary to provide sufficient time to evaluate an employee's performance; section 4(c).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Factors bearing on the reasonable length of the opportunity period were summarized, <span class="Italic">Bess v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DE-0752-14-0280-I-1 (NP 9/25/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In determining whether an agency has afforded an employee a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, relevant factors include the nature of the duties and responsibilities of the employee's position, the performance deficiencies involved, and the amount of time which is sufficient to enable the employee with an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. <span class="Italic">Lee v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 32 (2010)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When considering whether the employee received a reasonable opportunity period, the agency must consider time lost by the employee because of physical incapacitation. <span class="Italic">Gormley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 330, 332-35 (1990) (automobile injury); <span class="Italic">Green v.

Dept. of Interior</span>, 25 MSPR 190, 191 (1984) (action overturned; the appellant was present for duty only 44% of the time that her performance was being appraised, an amount of time insufficient to comply with the agency PIP; "[t]he agency's speculation that the appellant would not have performed satisfactorily even if she had been at work, and that the agency was justified in evaluating her performance on a <span class="Italic">pro rata</span> <span id="Page_2939"></span>basis is without merit and cannot excuse the agency's statutory obligation to accord appellant a reasonable opportunity period"). <span class="Italic">But see Jennings v. Dept. of Labor,</span> PH-0432-10-0139-I-1 (NP 5/9/2011) ("The appellant also disagrees with the administrative judge's finding that the agency provided him with a meaningful opportunity to improve because his PIP period was less than 90 days due to approved absences. The administrative judge considered this argument and correctly found that the PIP period, which was actually 98 days, was reasonable under the circumstances despite the appellant's 16 days of leave during that period.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board also expects an AJ to consider the appellant's contention that he could not timely complete PIP assignments because of his need to complete other work and because of staff shortages. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hober v. Dept. of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 129, 132 (1994). A variation on the theme is the employee who is given additional tasks during the performance improvement period, effectively shortening the original PIP. The Board finds this practice unobjectionable, as long as the period remaining to complete the tasks is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Nat'l Gallery of Art</span>, 36 MSPR 602, 605 n.* (1988) (noting that the employee voiced no objection to the change).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board approved of a PIP of 30 days, extended for a period of leave, that provided sufficient assistance to the appellant for tasks within the scope of her duties, <span class="Italic">Towne v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Before initiating an action for unacceptable performance under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303, an agency must give the employee a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. <span class="Italic">Greer v. Department of the Army</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 477, 480 (1998). OPM's regulations governing performance-based actions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303 state, "[a]s part of the employee's opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, the agency shall offer assistance to the employee in improving unacceptable performance." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 432.104; <span class="Italic">see Gjersvold v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 331, 336 (1995). The employee's right to a reasonable opportunity to improve is a substantive right and a necessary prerequisite to all chapter 43 actions. <span class="Italic">Lee</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 32; <span class="Italic">Sandland v. General Services Administration</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 583, 590 (1984). In determining whether the agency has afforded the appellant a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, relevant factors include the nature of the duties and responsibilities of the appellant's position, the performance deficiencies involved, and the amount of time which is sufficient to enable the employee to demonstrate acceptable performance. <span class="Italic">Lee</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 32; <span class="Italic">Satlin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 218, 225 (1993) (the administrative judge properly considered the appellant's length of service and experience in concluding that the appellant had received both adequate instruction and time in which to demonstrate improvement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, while the PIP was originally scheduled for 30 days, the agency extended the PIP to take into account the leave the appellant took over the winter holidays. <span class="Italic">See Gjersvold</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 336 (although the appellant complained that the agency improperly extended her PIP, the agency did so in order to afford the appellant additional time to demonstrate acceptable performance). The PIP was actually in place from December 15, 2010, to February 16, 2011. Excluding the approximately two weeks of leave that the appellant took during this period, the PIP was approximately seven weeks in length. Moreover, the Board has found that a 30-day PIP can satisfy an agency's obligation to provide an employee with a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. <span class="Italic">Lee</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 33; <span class="Italic">see Melnick v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 93, 101 (1989) (30-day PIP for a GS-5 Secretary), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 899 F.2d 1228 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table); <span class="Italic">Wood v. Department of the Navy</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 659, 662-63 (1985) (30-day PIP for a GS-4 Military Personnel Clerk).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency correctly argues that the administrative judge failed to consider the nature of the appellant's duties and responsibilities when she found that the PIP was too short. The appellant was the secretary to the Chief Nurse, Colonel Amy McDaniels. According to the appellant's position description and other evidence of record, her duties were typical secretarial duties: preparing correspondence and finalizing documents prepared by others; handling mail and maintaining files and updating copies of reference materials; handling visitors and telephone calls; maintaining her supervisor's calendar; doing other administrative and clerical tasks; and using office software to draft, format, and edit documents. The purpose of the appellant's position was to provide clerical and administrative support for the organization.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the administrative judge did not consider the nature of the appellant's performance deficiencies. We agree with the agency that many of the appellant's deficiencies were obvious rather than subtle. For example, in preparing meeting minutes, the appellant typically used the minutes from the prior meeting as a template but she did not always delete language pertaining to the earlier meeting from her drafts. Also, the appellant failed to include an item in the meeting minutes even after Col. McDaniels specifically instructed her by email to include the item. The appellant was also required to provide attachments to recipients of the meeting minutes, but on one occasion, she failed to provide 21 of 22 attachments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge described the PIP as "expansive," but did not explain the reasoning behind her conclusion and we see no support for it.[6] Likewise, the administrative judge found that the appellant had "myriad" tasks to perform, but we see no evidence that any of the assignments were not an ordinary responsibility of a secretary in general or the appellant's position in particular. In finding that the duties that the appellant was expected to perform during the PIP were "expansive" and thus unreasonable, the administrative judge appears to be encroaching on the agency's discretion to determine the duties that make up a position. <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 188, &#x00B6; 5 (2001) (an agency may exercise management discretion in establishing performance standards).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;To the extent that the administrative judge based her finding on the fact that the agency placed the appellant on a PIP for five critical elements, we are unaware of a reason why an agency cannot place an employee on a PIP for all of the critical elements in which the employee's performance is deficient.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge referred to two assignments that she characterized as outside the normal range of the appellant's duties. The first was inprocessing and outprocessing duties that the appellant had not been required to perform in some time. However, these duties were entirely routine clerical tasks consistent with the duties of the appellant's secretary position. For inprocessing incoming military officers, the appellant was required to schedule a meeting with Col. McDaniels or her deputy within 30 days of arrival, update group mailing lists, create an Officer Professional Development (OPD) folder, and add the new arrival to the OPD spreadsheet. Outprocessing involved essentially reversing the inprocessing tasks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second "new" assignment identified by the administrative judge was to finalize revisions to a Medical Group Instruction (MGDI). The record shows that on December 17, 2010, Col. McDaniels provided the appellant with an email with instructions and attached documents containing the various edits. The appellant was supposed to open the electronic copy of the master document and type in the changes contained in the attachments. Colonel McDaniels testified that this was a simple typing and cut-and-paste project that should have taken no more than half a day to complete, but the appellant was unable to complete it at all during the PIP. The appellant disputed the agency's evidence that she need only cut and paste by asserting that cutting and pasting sometimes disrupted the formatting of the master document. Since the appellant contended that she was competent at using the software she needed to perform her job duties, testimony of the appellant, it is not clear why the appellant would be unable to make any needed corrections to the formatting. In any event, if the formatting problem proved to be insurmountable, then the appellant could have typed in the changes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the MGDI assignment involved simple clerical tasks that were well within the duties of the appellant's position even if she had not worked on prior versions of the same document before. The appellant had difficulty completing the task because she deleted Col. McDaniels' original email containing the attachments, and she had difficulty overcoming her resentment at being assigned this task in the first place. However, we see no justification for the administrative judge's implied finding that this work assignment was inconsistent with the appellant's regular duties or that the appellant was so overburdened with work that she could not have completed this task within the period during which the PIP was in place. Even the appellant admitted at the hearing that the MGDI was merely a document in Microsoft Word and the assignment involved only typing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also found that the agency provided the appellant with "minimal to nonexistent assistance." The agency is required by regulation to offer the appellant assistance in improving her performance as part of her opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 432.104. However, there is no mechanical requirement regarding the form this assistance must take. <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 204, 208 (1997) (<span class="Italic">citing Gjersvold</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 336).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not explain why she found that the agency provided only "minimal to nonexistent assistance" and we see little support for her conclusion in the record. Colonel McDaniels provided the appellant with detailed written guidelines, including the PIP itself and numerous emails during the PIP about the appellant's performance on specific tasks. She met with the appellant and provided her written feedback at the beginning of the PIP and midway through the PIP. The appellant provided written comments responding to Col. McDaniels' feedback during the midpoint meeting. Colonel McDaniels met with the <span id="Page_2940"></span>appellant approximately every two weeks during the PIP to provide the appellant feedback and respond to the appellant's occasional questions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also offered the appellant internal training in the software that the agency used and gave her a course catalog for no-cost community college courses. The appellant refused all offers of training because, as she testified, "I knew what I was doing and didn't see the point of training." In fact, the appellant testified that she knew how to perform every duty identified in the PIP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that an agency may meet its obligation to offer assistance by means other than meeting personally during the PIP. <span class="Italic">See Gjersvold</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 336 ("the agency's detailed guidance regarding the appellant's performance during the PIP suffers no disqualification merely because it was delivered in written form, rather than orally"). Here, not only did the agency provide the appellant with detailed written feedback, it also had regular meetings with her during the PIP. This degree of assistance is greater than that which the Board has found sufficient to meet an agency's obligation to offer assistance. <span class="Italic">See Goodwin</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. at 208-09 (the agency afforded the appellant a reasonable opportunity to improve where it gave her a detailed PIP letter and abundant written feedback during the PIP, and her supervisor made herself available to provide assistance but the appellant did not request further assistance); <span class="Italic">Gjersvold</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 335-36 (the agency afforded the appellant a reasonable opportunity to improve where her supervisor provided her with 12 written evaluations during the PIP and solicited the appellant's questions and responses to the evaluations, which the appellant declined to provide). We find, therefore, that the agency has proffered substantial evidence showing that it afforded the appellant a reasonable opportunity to improve.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brady v. Dept. of Navy,</span> AT-0432-14-0389-I-1 (NP 7/25/2015) (34-day PIP sufficient for a GS-14 EEO manager); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Army,</span> 122 MSPR 372, 386 n.12, 2015 MSPB 31 (2015) ("[E]ven a 30-day improvement period can satisfy an agency's obligation to provide an employee with a reasonable opportunity to improve. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Melnick v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 93, 101 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 899 F.2d 1228 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When it assesses the reasonableness of an opportunity period, the Board may consider prior warnings of unacceptable performance, <span class="Italic">Mattes v. Dept. of Army</span>, 24 MSPR 477, 480 (1984) (setting the removal aside for other reasons):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official determined that appellant was only afforded thirty days for improvement, based on a finding that appellant could not be charged with notice of his deficiencies until after OPM approved the appraisal system. Thus, she found that appellant was initially informed of the deficiencies in an unsatisfactory performance letter dated November 10, 1981. We find, however, that as early as June, 1981, appellant was informed that his performance was unacceptable and that timely submission of reports was critical. Under these circumstances, the thirty days afforded by the November 10, 1981 unsatisfactory performance letter would have been sufficient if the appellant was given reasonable opportunity to demonstrate improvement during such period....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">How short an opportunity period will the Board permit? One case involving a lab technician passed muster with an assignment to complete all work in 17 days, although the employee spent an additional 31 days on the critical project. <span class="Italic">Bare v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 684, 687 (1986). Although there is no statutory period of time for performance to be improved under a notice, three workdays was insufficient. <span class="Italic">Hailey v. USDA</span>, 26 MSPR 114, 117 (1985); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">James v. VA</span>, 27 MSPR 124, 127 (1985) (questioning but not deciding the adequacy of an opportunity period of 19 days to measure performance of a particular type of work assigned to a medical technologist). We do not know how much time would have been considered sufficient. The Board does not find an improvement period unreasonable because the agency shortens it. One decision found immaterial that an appellant was deprived of 21 days during a PIP to show his improved performance. The appellant had more than five months to meet the requirements of the PIP. <span class="Italic">Luscri v. Dept. of Army</span>, 39 MSPR 482, 486-87 (1989) (citing <span class="Italic">Wood v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 27 MSPR 659, 662-63 (1985), for approval of a 30-day improvement period). Although the holding was not entirely clear, a reviewing court seemed to suggest that even if an appellant is given a promise that he will have a specific period of time to improve, e.g., 120 days, the petitioner cannot "estop" the government from its actions if he gets less time before he is removed. Estoppel requires the employee's reasonable reliance to his detriment, and it could not be reasonable to allow the employee to perform below minimum standards in reliance on a government promise not to evaluate him until after 120 days passed. <span class="Italic">Gillis v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 87-3423); <span class="italic">see</span> <span class="italic">Kaplan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DC-0432-17-0195-I-1 (NP 10/6/2022) ("However, even assuming that the agency committed error by effectively shortening the CIP period, we find that the appellant has not shown it likely that she would have demonstrated acceptable contribution even with more time allotted. <span class="italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681 (1991) (finding that, to show harmful error, an appellant must prove that any procedural errors by the agency prejudiced her substantive rights by possibly affecting the agency's decision; harmful error cannot be presumed"); <span class="italic">cf. Drake v. Dept. of Interior</span>, SF-0432-17-0272-I-1 (NP 10/21/2022) ("The Board has held that a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance can contain interim deadlines that expire before the end of a PIP period. <span class="italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="italic">Luscri v. Department of the Army</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 482, 487, <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 887 F.2d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table)."); <span class="Italic">Egleberry v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 27 MSPR 217, 218-19 (1985) ("We do not find that the agency's failure to remove appellant for unacceptable performance in the past gave her a reasonable basis to assume that the agency would not take action against her, or imposed an additional obligation on the agency to give her advance notice of any proposed action.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an employee has a substantive right to a performance improvement period prior to the institution of a performance-based action, an employee's performance during the requisite 30-day advance notice period following the proposal notice need not be considered by the agency in reaching its final decision on the proposed action. <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. DHHS</span>, 27 MSPR 152, 153 n.2 (1985); <span class="Italic">Gordon v. USDA</span>, 25 MSPR 438, 441 (1984).</p>
