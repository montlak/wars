<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-410"><span class="space">1.</span> Building, Installation Security</h4>
<p class="noindent">Employee safety at the workplace is a general condition of employment and FLRA finds negotiable proposals concerning building security. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">EPA and NFFE Local 2050</span>, 38 FLRA 1328, 1340 (1991) (ALJ Decision) (rejecting, in context of ULP case, argument that unilateral changes in practice of locking stairwell doors were nonnegotiable because changes concerned agency "internal security"). <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2050 and EPA</span>, 35 FLRA 706, 707, 713 (1990), considered the negotiability of several proposals designed to enhance the security of employees working in buildings plagued with incidents of criminal activity. Proposal 1 requested that items delivered by couriers to employees be checked at the front desk of the activity facility. Although the proposal interfered with management's right to determine internal security practices, it did not interfere with the right to determine technology or methods and means of performing work, direct supervisory actions, conflict with the right to contract out security management, or interfere with the right to determine skills needed to perform work. The proposal was a negotiable arrangement to protect employees against crime; management failed to offer evidence demonstrating excessive interference of the proposal with management rights. Proposal 2 in <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, also negotiable, required the agency to "provide to all bargaining unit employees secure areas in their immediate office areas for storing personal property." FLRA distinguished, as to the management right to determine security practices, management's interest in protecting employees' personal property and its interest in protecting its own property, personnel, or operations. Protection of employee property was considered by FLRA to be incidental to the accomplishment of the agency mission and principally related to employees' working conditions. FLRA concluded that the proposal did not interfere with the right of management to determine internal security practices. Also deemed negotiable in <span class="Italic">EPA</span> was Proposal 3, calling on the agency to provide copies of all security bulletins and alerts to union representatives prior to distribution to unit employees. The proposal's purpose was to permit the union to comment on the accuracy of the information in the bulletins. If the union could prove information inaccurate, the agency was required to correct the inaccuracies prior to distribution, provided the corrections did not cause undue publication delay. FLRA, although recognizing that advice to employees of risks may amount to a security practice, adhered to precedent determining that negotiable proposals include notice to employees of matters concerning their conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2050 and EPA</span>, 36 FLRA 618 (1990), considered another raft of security-related proposals. The FLRA opinion should be read for the detailed reasoning concerning each of the proposals. The following proposals were negotiable: Proposal 1 (agency to provide same level of protection for employees at headquarters as agency provides at another facility); Proposal 8 (agency to notify union in writing of incidents involving lost master keys, unsecured or inoperable doors, armed guards who have worked without certification, and lost weapons); Proposal 11 (agency to issue "security alerts" concerning serious incidents that have occurred near agency's headquarters); Proposal 12 (agency to take certain measures to protect against theft of employees' personal property); Proposal 18 (agency to test and repair fire alarm system after hours or during weekends); Proposal 19 (agency to test loudspeakers semi-annually and fire alarms as required by law, regulation or ordinance); Proposal 22 (agency to notify the union within 24 hours of any bomb threats); Proposal 24 (management to sign for courier packages for bargaining unit employees at main entrances of buildings to prevent entry of unauthorized or dangerous personnel into agency facilities). Nonnegotiable was Proposal 5, requiring the agency to protect the employees' workspace from projectiles or other dangerous objects (there was no claim that the proposal was an appropriate arrangement).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA determined to be nonnegotiable proposals calling on the agency to provide security for employees relocated to new locations security comparable to the facilities where they previously worked. Distinguishing <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2050</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, FLRA judged that the proposals excessively infringed management's right to determine internal security, <span class="Italic">NTEU and FCC</span>, 70 FLRA 691, 692-93 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the proposals are appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). When determining whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority initially determines whether the proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right.[17] If the proposal is an arrangement, the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management rights.[18] The Authority makes this determination by weighing "the competing practical needs of employees and managers" in order to ascertain whether the benefits to <span id="page_920"></span>employees flowing from the proposal outweigh the proposal's burdens on the exercise of the management right involved.[19] Even assuming that the proposals constitute arrangements, we find, for the following reasons, that they are not appropriate because they excessively interfere with the Agency's right to determine internal-security practices.[20]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The proposals' burden on management's right to determine internal security practices is significant. Specifically, the proposals' intent is to countermand the Agency's current internal security practice determinations and require the Agency to exercise its internal security right in a different manner. The proposals are absolute and give management no flexibility to determine that the levels of protection for employees at Powder Springs and at Livermore should vary from the level of security at Columbia--regardless of the individual circumstances of those facilities, the types of activities and employees involved there, and the surrounding areas. Proposals such as these--which involve employee safety and security--involve matters of Agency discretion, to which the Authority gives great deference.[22]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[22]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 70 FLRA 100, 103 (2016) (finding proposal that limits agency's discretion to determine internal security practices significantly burdens agency's right to determine internal security practices); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council of Prison Locals 33, Local 506</span>, 66 FLRA 929, 932-33 (2012) (<span class="Italic">Local 506</span>) (same); <span class="Italic">Local 1164</span>, 66 FLRA at 117 (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, any benefits that the proposals would afford employees are limited. Although the Union contends that the proposals would protect employees from harm by outside individuals, the Agency has already taken steps to mitigate any danger to employees[24] by planning "upgrades" to the facilities' security systems. Moreover, the Agency claims, without contradiction, that there have been no reported safety or security concerns involving outside individuals at the Powder Springs or Livermore facilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[24]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See NATCA</span>, 66 FLRA 658, 661 (2012) (Member DuBester dissenting in part) (finding that benefit of proposal was limited because agency had taken steps to mitigate adverse effect of agency's exercise of management right).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the proposals severely limit the Agency's discretion to determine internal security practices, and produce only "limited" benefits to employees, we find that they are not an "appropriate" way to ameliorate a right's adverse effects within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).[27] We find accordingly that the proposals' burden on management's rights outweighs any benefits that the proposals would afford employees. Consequently, we further find that the proposals excessively interfere with management's right to determine internal security practices and are not appropriate arrangements.[28]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[28]&#x2003;We distinguish the instant proposals from proposal 1 in <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2050</span>, 36 FLRA 618, 624-25 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Local 2050</span>). In <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2050</span>, the Authority found proposal 1 to be an appropriate arrangement after noting the agency there had offered no argument and had presented no evidence as to the burden the proposal would have placed on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 628-29.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is noteworthy here that neither the Agency, nor the Union, address whether or not these proposals constitute conditions of employment that are subject to bargaining. Accordingly, we do not base our decision on that question. We note, however, that question could have, and should have, been addressed as a threshold matter. As we held recently in <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, U.S. CBP, El Paso, Texas</span>, there is no obligation to bargain over "working conditions."[29] As we noted in that case, it is "imperative" that we "respect...and define the differences [between conditions of employment and working conditions] for the labor-management relations community" because that distinction is a central question as to what matters are, and are not, subject to bargaining under our Statute[30] and because the Authority itself had conflated the two terms for far too long.[31]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[31]&#x2003;Member Abbott adds that this is an important distinction because in his view any determination that concerns the internal-security of Agency facilities and property is a right that belongs solely to the Agency and by its very nature "[does] not impact a condition of employment."</p>
<p class="noindent">Approved as negotiable in <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 41 FLRA 795, 835, 838-40 (1991), was Provision 12, providing in part that "[l]ockable doors will be provided for either each individual office or work area":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he third sentence of the provision would require the Agency to maintain its past practice of providing lockable doors in employee work areas for the express purpose of protecting "both the persons and the property of employees."... Because this sentence would require the Agency to maintain a practice to safeguard its personnel, it comes within the ambit of management's right to determine its internal security practices.... By binding the Agency to maintain a particular internal security practice during the life of the parties' agreement, sentence 3 directly interferes with management's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's arguments raise the issue of whether sentence 3 of this provision constitutes an appropriate arrangement that is negotiable under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. In this regard, the Union claims that this sentence affords a benefit to employees who work in an area with an increasing crime rate. Thus, this sentence is clearly intended as an amelioration of the adverse effects on employees that flow from an office location in such an area and is, consequently, an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have noted in previous decisions, working in an area that has an appreciable crime rate has a significant negative impact on employees and is a matter over which employees have little control.... All that the third sentence of the provision seeks is that either each individual office or work area have a lockable door. The Union states, and the Agency does not dispute, that the vast majority of professionals in the bargaining unit currently have offices with locks to which both the employee and management have keys and that the sentence intends to maintain this practice. Thus, this sentence would not inhibit management's access to employee work areas. Moreover, the fact that this provision reflects an existing practice and the Agency has made no contention that practice has proven burdensome, indicates that the practice of providing lockable doors in employee work areas is not unduly burdensome. In our view, the significant benefits that providing lockable doors affords employees in terms of enhancing their security in their work areas outweigh the limited burden placed on the Agency in providing and maintaining the lockable doors. Consequently, we conclude that the third sentence of Provision 12 does not excessively interfere with management's right to determine its internal security practices and is an appropriate arrangement that is negotiable under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">The negotiability as appropriate arrangements of proposals involving building security depends on the ability of the union to establish a record demonstrating the need for the arrangement. If the record does not show actual or foreseeable adverse effects on employees that the proposal is designed to address, FLRA will not approve the security measure as negotiable, the result in <span class="Italic">NTEU and PTO</span>, 53 FLRA 539, 582-83 (1997), involving a proposal (Article 14) that a work space be secured by an electronic access system:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the first prong of the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> standard, we find that the Union has not established that the provision is an arrangement. The Union has not identified any adverse effects on employees, either actual or reasonably foreseeable, that flow from the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices. The only argument advanced by the Union to support its claim that the provision is intended as an arrangement is the contention that the provision is designed to provide security and safety to employees. However, the Union has not explained how management's choice of its internal security measures has failed to provide adequate security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Previously, in determining whether provisions were intended to ameliorate the adverse effects flowing from the exercise of an agency's right to determine its internal security practices, the Authority examined the existence or absence of security measures at the agency's facilities<span class="Italic">. E.g., American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 2782 and U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the</span> <span class="Italic">Census, Washington, D.C.</span>, 49 FLRA 470, 475 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Census);</span> <span class="Italic">SSA, Dunbar</span>, 37 FLRA at 360. The Authority also took into account actual or foreseeable effects on employees and agency property. <span class="Italic">E.g., POPA</span>, 41 FLRA at 839; <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 2050 and Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 36 FLRA 618, 620-22 (1990) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>). For example, in <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, the record showed that there had been numerous incidents involving employees, security in and around the agency's facilities, including one fatality caused by an individual who had improperly gained access to the building in which that employee worked. 36 FLRA at 621. There was also evidence of threats to the security of the agency's facilities, including thefts, vandalism, and bullet holes found in windows of employee offices. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Considering these factors, the Authority found that a proposal requiring that employees in two agency facilities receive the same level of protection provided to <span id="page_921"></span>employees in a third facility was an arrangement to address the adverse effects of the internal security practices that the agency had employed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, there is no evidence or assertion that the security measure currently provided by the Agency, which consists of an electronic key-controlled access system, fails to provide adequate security for employees and the Agency's property and operations. We reject the Union's claim that, as the impact of the proposal in <span class="Italic">SSA, Dunbar</span> is identical to the impact of the provision here, the Authority should find this provision to be an appropriate arrangement. In <span class="Italic">SSA, Dunbar</span>, the union proposed adoption of a practice in order to deal with irate or potentially dangerous claimants where no practice to deal with that situation existed. The Authority found that the proposal was intended to address the adverse effects of employee work assignments based on union arguments that specifically addressed the danger to employees. In contrast, the Union here has failed to demonstrate that management's choice of its internal security practices has resulted in actual or foreseeable adverse effects on employees that the provision is intended to ameliorate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union's contention that employee safety and security at the workplace are general conditions of employment that the Authority has found negotiable does not persuade us to reach a different result. The negotiability of each provision must be assessed based on the record presented to the Authority. Not all provisions relating to safety and security have been found negotiable. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Census</span>, 49 FLRA at 473-76; <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 36 FLRA at 629-32.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that the Union has failed to establish that the provision satisfies the first prong of the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> standard. Accordingly, we conclude that the provision does not constitute an appropriate arrangement and that the Agency head properly disapproved it.</p>
<p class="noindent">Disapproved for negotiation was a proposal that vehicle identification tags on a military base be removable rather than permanently affixed to the windshield of vehicles. The agency's concern was base security and prevention of terrorist attacks through control of traffic entering the facility. The union's concern was that employees venturing outside the base in their vehicles would be more readily identifiable to terrorists as government employees because of their decals. FLRA determined that the proposal infringed on the right of management to determine internal security. The proposal was nonnegotiable as an arrangement. The modestly increased risk to employees was outweighed by the need for security at the facility. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1904 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Monmouth</span>, 56 FLRA 787, 789-91 (2000). <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1712 and Dept. of Army, Alaska CPAC</span>, 62 FLRA 15, 15 (2007), determined to be nonnegotiable as an infringement on management's right to direct employees and control internal security a proposal the "door to the information technology office remain closed." <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 2145 and VAMC Richmond,</span> 64 FLRA 231, 234 (2009) (nonnegotiable: proposal that union control access to union offices unless permission was provided to management in emergency situations). Nonnegotiable as arrangements in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 506 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Coleman</span>, 66 FLRA 819, 824-34 (2012), were Proposals 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7, for management to create or modify structures at a prison that management successfully argued excessively burdened the agency's ability to control internal security involving both prisoners and employees and outweighed the benefits the modifications would have provided for employees' safety or convenience. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 56 FLRA 69, 104-106 (2000) (Proposal 31) (proposal unduly interfered with agency internal security when it required notice to union members, including scope of data and access of agency officials to data, of "all electronic monitoring which directly or indirectly identifies unit members"). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Nashville and AFGE Local 2400</span>, 50 FLRA 220, 221 (1995) (agency should have bargained over the installation of electronic surveillance equipment; a prospective bargaining order was issued).</p>
