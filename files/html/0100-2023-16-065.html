<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-64"><span class="space">c.</span> Assistance to Employee</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The OPM regulation that defines an opportunity period for improvement was revised in 2020 and again in 2022. The most recent (2022) version of the regulation provides, 5 CFR 432.104 (2022) (87 Fed. Reg. 67765 (Nov. 10, 2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="italic">Addressing unacceptable performance.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At any time during the performance appraisal cycle that an employee's performance is determined to be unacceptable in one or more critical elements, the agency shall notify the employee of the critical element(s) for which performance is unacceptable and inform the employee of the performance requirement(s) or standard(s) that must be attained in order to demonstrate acceptable performance in his or her position. The agency should also inform the employee that unless his or her performance in the critical element(s) improves to and is sustained at an acceptable level, the employee may be reduced in grade or removed. For each critical element in which the employee's performance is unacceptable, the agency shall afford the employee a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of the employee's position. As part of the employee's opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, the agency shall offer assistance to the employee in improving unacceptable performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 2020 version of 5 CFR 432.104, now superceded, was more restrictive as to the options available to management:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Addressing unacceptable performance</span>. At any time during the performance appraisal cycle that an employee's performance is determined to be unacceptable in one or more critical elements, the agency shall notify the employee of the critical element(s) for which performance is unacceptable and inform the employee of the performance requirement(s) or standard(s) that must be attained in order to demonstrate acceptable performance in his or her position. The agency should also inform the employee that unless his or her performance in the critical element(s) improves to and is sustained at an acceptable level, the employee may be reduced in grade or removed. For each critical element in which the employee's performance is unacceptable, the agency shall afford the employee a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of the employee's position. The requirement described in 5 U.S.C. 4302(c)(5) refers only to that formal assistance provided during the period wherein an employee is provided with an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, as referenced in 5 U.S.C. 4302(c)(6). The nature of assistance provided is in the sole and exclusive discretion of the agency. No additional performance assistance period or similar informal period shall be provided prior to or in addition to the opportunity period provided under this section.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 432.105 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Proposing and taking action based on unacceptable performance</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposing action based on unacceptable performance</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Once an employee has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance pursuant to &#x00A7; 432.104, an agency may propose a reduction-in-grade or removal action if the employee's performance during or following the opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance is unacceptable in one or more of the critical elements for which the employee was afforded an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[For comments on the history of the 2022 regulatory revisions, refer earlier in this chapter to "Opportunity to Improve."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency must prove that it provided a fair improvement period. On the appellant's challenge, the Board expects AJs to analyze the nature of assistance offered during the improvement period, <span class="Italic">Chrisawn v. SSA</span>, DC-0752-14-0550-I-1 (NP 7/28/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although there is no mechanical requirement regarding the form of this assistance, in determining whether an agency has afforded an employee a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, relevant factors include the nature of the duties and responsibilities of the employee's position, the performance deficiencies involved, and the amount of time which is sufficient to enable the employee to demonstrate acceptable performance. <span class="Italic">Lee v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 32 (2010); <span class="Italic">Gjersvold v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 331, 336 (1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Chrisawn</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...While we agree with the administrative judge that the record supports a finding that the appellant was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to improve during the PAP from December 3, 2012, to January 2, 2013, the administrative judge failed to consider the agency's evidence regarding training and other assistance it provided to the appellant during the OPS period from January 28, 2013, to May 28, 2013. Specifically, the administrative judge stated that the record is "devoid of sufficient evidence to determine whether the training given [to the appellant] was actually a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate adequate performance."<span class="Italic"></span> As discussed below, we believe this finding is not supported by the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPS plan states that, during the 120-day period, the agency would, among other things, reduce the appellant's interviewing schedule and assign her a new mentor who would meet with her every week at a regularly scheduled time to review her pending claims and action lists as well as provide weekly written reports to the appellant's supervisors regarding the claims that were reviewed. The record supports the conclusion that the agency provided this promised assistance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To allow time for training and to address the case backlog, during the OPS period both the appellant and her mentor were removed from telephone duties and walk-in duties during the week, were not required to take replacement claims, and the appellant was given only three appointments per day. In addition, Wednesdays were established as "quiet days." They also were permitted access to a private room where they could work together. The appellant's mentor submitted a final assessment of the appellant's performance in which he details the assistance provided to the appellant during the OPS period. This included, among other things, offering one-on-one training and daily or weekly discussions regarding workload, reviewing all cases assigned to the appellant and providing her with review sheets identifying and explaining errors, and creating tools to address her interviewing skills, including a checklist to help her identify needed information. The record includes copies of the numerous review sheets which detail mistakes the appellant made as well as other feedback provided by her mentor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that, during the 120-day OPS period, the agency assigned the appellant a mentor who reviewed her cases, provided her with detailed feedback, and held daily or weekly meetings with her to address her performance issues. The agency also reduced the appellant's and her mentor's workload to afford them sufficient time to address the appellant's performance deficiencies. This degree of assistance is greater than that which the Board has found sufficient to meet an agency's obligation. <span class="Italic">See Goodwin v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 204, 208-09 (1997) (finding that the agency afforded the appellant a reasonable opportunity to improve where it gave her a detailed performance improvement plan (PIP) letter and abundant written feedback during the PIP, and her supervisor made herself available to provide assistance but the appellant did not request further assistance). Accordingly, we find that the agency proffered substantial evidence that it afforded the appellant a reasonable opportunity to improve. <span class="Italic">See Towne v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 239, &#x00B6; 20 (2013) (finding that the agency afforded the appellant a reasonable opportunity to improve where it met with the appellant in person, as well as provided written and oral guidance).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board expects that the AJ will determine, on challenge by the appellant, whether promised assistance was passive or active, whether the appellant was instructed on how he might seek assistance, whether agency officials were specifically charged with providing assistance to the appellant, and whether the predisposition of agency officials impacted on the assistance provided (or not provided) to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Woytak v.

Assistance to the appellant may be through written evaluations and supervisors' responses to questions from employees. There is no statutorily-prescribed form of assistance, <span class="Italic">Gjersvold v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 331, 335-36 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a performance-based action under 5 USC 4303, the agency must prove by substantial evidence that it afforded the appellant a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. <span class="Italic">See Sandland v. General Services Administration</span>, 23 MSPR 583, 587 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the agency provided the appellant with a 19-page PIP letter prepared by her supervisor, Joanda M. Lee, which discussed in detail the nature of the appellant's past performance deficiencies, as well as how they could be remedied. The PIP letter also detailed the agency's expectations for her future performance, and the goals she needed to attain during the 90-day PIP in order to satisfy the minimum requirements of her position. The letter further advised the appellant that she would be authorized one hour of training time per week. Ms. Lee closed by stating, "[i]f you have any questions, feel free to contact me. I am available to answer your questions and to assist you in improving your performance during this period."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the PIP itself, Ms. Lee provided the appellant with at least 12 written evaluations of her work product, noting both where the appellant had satisfied performance standards and where performance deficiencies remained, and explaining how these last could be corrected. The first such evaluation concludes by advising the appellant to "[e]ither talk with me first, or rewrite your ACM."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although there is some dispute as to whether Ms. Lee ever personally met with the appellant to discuss her work, it is undisputed that the appellant never requested or initiated any such contact. Indeed, on cross-examination, the appellant explained that "[o]n the advi[c]e of my union rep, we felt it was better to steer clear of talking with Ms. Lee unless it was vital."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency had provided the appellant with a "procedural," as opposed to a "substantive," opportunity to improve, emphasizing that "at no time did Ms. Lee personally counsel the appellant as to her performance progress during the PIP." However, although regulations governing performance-based actions under 5 USC 4303 state that "[a]s part of the employee's opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, the agency shall offer assistance to the employee in improving unacceptable performance" (5 CFR 432.104), there is no mechanical requirement regarding the form of this assistance. Accordingly, the agency's detailed guidance regarding the appellant's performance during the PIP suffers no disqualification merely because it was delivered in written form, rather than orally.[*] Moreover, as previously noted, the agency repeatedly solicited the appellant's responses or questions to its evaluations, an invitation which, for her own reasons, the appellant apparently declined. Finally, although the appellant complains about the agency's extension of her original 90-day PIP for an additional 60 days, the evidence indicates that the extension was taken to give the appellant another chance to demonstrate acceptable performance, and thus further attests to the agency's good faith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;The administrative judge cited to <span class="Italic">Beasley v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 25 MSPR 213 (1984), as support for her finding. However, the Board in <span class="Italic">Beasley</span> found that the agency never even informed the appellant that her work was unacceptable prior to its notice of removal, and largely predetermined the appellant's failure. <span class="Italic">Beasley,</span> 25 MSPR at 215.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency has established by substantial evidence that it afforded the appellant a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance before taking its action.</p>

In determining whether the agency has afforded the appellant a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, relevant factors include the nature of the duties and responsibilities of the appellant's position, the performance deficiencies involved, and the amount of time that is sufficient to enable the employee to demonstrate acceptable performance. <span class="italic">Id</span>.; <span class="italic">Satlin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 218, 225 (1993) (determining that the administrative judge properly considered the appellant's length of service and experience in concluding that the appellant had received both adequate instruction and time in which to demonstrate improvement).");<span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ortegel v. NASA</span>, DC-0432-15-0715-I-1 (NP 1/3/2017) ("The record reflects that, during the PIP, the agency provided the appellant with detailed oral and written feedback during bimonthly meetings at which the appellant's supervisor and the appellant discussed his progress. Furthermore, the appellant testified that his team leader provided him reference materials and answered his questions as they arose. We therefore find that the agency met its obligation to offer assistance in improving his performance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 204, 208-09 (1997); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 432.104."); <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 75 MSPR 204, 209 (1997) ("As in <span class="Italic">Gjersvold</span>, the appellant testified that she did not request assistance or attempt to communicate with her supervisor during this [opportunity] period."). <span class="italic">But see</span> <span class="italic">Feesago v. DOD</span>, SF-0432-16-0458-I-1 (NP 8/10/2022) (management changed requirements of standards during the PIP in a manner that did not directly relate to deficiencies identified in the PIP; and "during the PIP, the appellant's supervisor focused on conducting 'walk throughs' of the produce department and meticulously documenting instances in which she found that the appellant's performance was deficient instead of offering her assistance or suggestions as to how to improve her performance").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In practice, agency PIP letters often establish periodic (usually weekly) meetings between the supervisor and the employee to discuss assignments and issues arising from completion of work. The supervisor may document the exchanges with the employee during those meetings, including critiques of the employee's work, and that documentation (often email) then serves as part of the evidence later relied on by the agency to initiate and sustain performance-based action against the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee was provided supervisory assistance during meetings with the supervisor in <span class="italic">McComb v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, AT-0432-17-0265-I-1 (NP 7/26/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To support the conclusion that the duration of the appellant's PIP was reasonable, we note that the Board previously has found a 60-day PIP sufficient to satisfy the agency's obligation to provide the employee with a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. <span class="italic">Lee</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 33. Further, the appellant has argued, both below and again on review, that the agency did not inform her of her specific <span id="Page_2935"></span>performance deficiencies or what specifically she was required to do to correct those deficiencies. However, the record directly contradicts this contention, as the PIP letter explicitly discusses the appellant's deficiencies and provides bullet points of actions the appellant could take to improve those deficiencies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless, even if the appellant genuinely believed that she was unaware of her performance deficiencies or how the agency expected her to improve those deficiencies, the record is clear that her supervisor attempted to meet with, and did meet with, the appellant approximately two times per week to review her understanding of the PIP and to discuss her progress. The supervisor testified during the hearing that the appellant avoided these meetings, refused to sign or acknowledge documentation produced as a result of the meetings, and occasionally chose not to engage in the assistance he offered. His notes regarding these meetings are contained in the record and confirm these assertions. Although the appellant argued to the contrary, claiming that she never received any substantive assistance, the administrative judge did not credit her testimony, and we defer to that finding; <span class="italic">see Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (stating that the Board must defer to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on observing the demeanor of witnesses testifying at the hearing and that the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the whole, the degree of assistance provided to the appellant was greater than that which the Board has found sufficient to meet the agency's obligation to provide a reasonable opportunity to improve. <span class="italic">See Goodwin v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 204, 208-09 (1997) (finding that the agency afforded the appellant a reasonable opportunity to improve by giving her a detailed PIP letter and written feedback during the PIP and that her supervisor made herself available to provide assistance but that the appellant did not request further assistance). Therefore, we find that the agency proved by substantial evidence that it provided the appellant with a reasonable opportunity to improve her performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee was denied a fair opportunity period in <span class="Italic">Zang v. Defense Investigative Serv.</span>, 26 MSPR 155, 157 (1985), when her supervisor predetermined the outcome:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...She found that the appellant's supervisor monitored her for more than six months before commencing the instant adverse action against her, and that such procedure would ordinarily satisfy the agency's duty to afford an employee a reasonable opportunity to improve. However, she concluded, on the basis of the supervisor's testimony, the frequency and tenor of his confidential memoranda to the personnel file regarding the appellant's performance, and the nature of his counselling sessions with her, that the appellant in this case was in fact not given a fair and meaningful opportunity to improve her performance before her demotion was instituted. From her assessment of testimonial credibility, the presiding official determined that the counselling sessions given the appellant by her supervisor were often disparaging in nature, did not produce guidance or advice on how to improve her work, and were not used to warn her of the possibility of impending or contemplated actions against her based on her performance. Further, she found that the appellant's supervisor, within three days of the beginning of his tenure in that capacity, had judged her incompetent, had begun to assemble a secret, negative record against her designed to support her pre-ordained ultimate demotion, and had thus effectively deprived her of a meaningful opportunity to improve.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency did not provide a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> opportunity period to the appellant in <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Farm Credit Admin.</span>, 51 MSPR 569, 579-80 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">In Beasley v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 25 MSPR 213, 215 (1984), the Board held that the agency did not meet its burden to prove that an employee was afforded a reasonable opportunity to improve before her removal for unsatisfactory performance, where the agency determined that the employee was going to fail and the employee could have done nothing to correct the performance that her supervisors criticized. In <span class="Italic">Adorador v. Department of the Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force,</span> 38 MSPR 461 (1988), the Board held that the employee did not receive a meaningful opportunity to improve because he did not receive the promised assistance of his supervisor during the early weeks of the performance improvement period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, although the agency afforded the appellant a procedural opportunity to improve, the Board finds that the opportunity was not substantive....&#8197;On one of the two Data Base element projects that the agency found unacceptable during the performance improvement period, the appellant did not receive the promised supervisory assistance. Further, the record as a whole establishes that the appellant's supervisors, by their actions before, during, and after the performance improvement period, revealed their predetermination that he was going to fail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the improvement period, when the new standards were implemented, the appellant's supervisors made the element Communication and Interpersonal Relationships critical for the appellant although it was not critical for others working under the same standards. Subsequently, the appellant's supervisors found his performance under that element unsatisfactory and placed him on a performance improvement plan with respect to it. During the improvement period, they defined the critical element Data Bases to apply to the appellant's drafts when there is no inference from the wording of the standard itself that it applied to drafts of others working under the same standards. After the improvement period, when the appellant was partially successful, performing acceptably with respect to the Communication element, they attempted to charge him with unacceptable performance of the element Special Studies based on his performance of that element during the opportunity period and did not afford him even a procedural opportunity to improve with respect to it. Finally, they did not recognize, as they could have under Standard I of the element Data Bases, the appellant's innovative use of new software to accomplish assignments, opting instead to denigrate his drafts.</p>
