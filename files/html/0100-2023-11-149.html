<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Delk v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 57 MSPR 528, 530-32 (1993), presented the Board with the opportunity to provide its most expansive statement concerning use of the exclusionary rule. The appeal involved a charge that the appellant converted government property to personal use. Evidence submitted to support the charge included materials found during a search of the appellant's residence. The evidence seized went beyond the terms of the warrant authorizing the search. The appellant sought to exclude the evidence improperly seized. The Board declined to exclude the evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the Supreme Court's decisions regarding the application of the exclusionary rule to proceedings other than criminal prosecutions do not provide a basis on which to extend the exclusionary rule to Board proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">INS v. Lopez-Mendoza</span>, 468 U.S. 1032, 104 S. Ct. 3479, 82 L. Ed.2d 778 (1984); <span class="Italic">United States v. Janis</span>, 428 U.S. 433, 96 S. Ct. 3021, 49 L. Ed.2d 1046 (1976); <span class="Italic">United States v. Calandra</span>, 414 U.S. 338, 94 S. Ct. 613, 38 L. Ed.2d 561 (1974); <span class="Italic">One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</span>, 380 U.S. 693, 85 S. Ct. 1246, 14 L. Ed.2d 170 (1965). In <span class="Italic">Janis</span>, the Court noted that "[I]n the complex and turbulent history of the [exclusionary] rule, the Court never has applied it to exclude evidence from a civil proceeding, federal or state." <span class="Italic">Janis</span>, 428 U.S. at 447, 96 S. Ct. at 3029. This statement continues to be valid, as the Court has failed to apply the exclusionary rule to any post-<span class="Italic">Janis</span> civil cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the exclusionary rule is inapplicable because, although the Court has found that the exclusionary rule is likely to be most effective when applied to "intrasovereign" violations of the Fourth Amendment, such as the violation in this case, the USPP officers who expanded the search beyond the terms of the search warrant, the "offending officers" who are the objects of deterrence, were engaged in a criminal investigation. USPP officers devote most of their attention to protecting U.S. park property from abuse by private citizen park users. Generally, their "zone of primary interest" is certainly not investigation of employee malfeasance. In fact, it was only after USPP began investigating the disappearance of a great deal of NPS property from its Brentwood maintenance facility that a determination was made that it was most probably NPS employees who were responsible for the disappearance. Even if a determination had been made that non-government employees were responsible for the theft of this property, the USPP would have continued its investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge concluded in the initial decision, the "zone of primary interest" of the USPP officers from the beginning of the investigation to the discovery of government property on the premises of the appellant remained a criminal investigation, the evidence was seized with the intention of proving criminal charges against the appellant, and the USPP in fact did attempt to use the evidence as support for a criminal charge against him. The United States Attorney, however, declined to prosecute a criminal charge against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, application of the exclusionary rule would not punish the USPP, nor significantly deter USPP officers from future unlawful conduct. It is the appellant's supervisors, and the NPS itself that would be punished. There would be no deterrence value, since the agency officials who initiated the removal action played no role in the unlawful conduct (there was nothing unlawful with regard to the investigation which led to the search).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As this case exemplifies, and the Supreme Court's failure to apply the rule beyond criminal cases demonstrates, the "marginal deterrence value" of suppressing the illegally seized evidence in administrative proceedings is significantly less than is the case with respect to criminal cases, and the exclusionary rule therefore should not be applied in Board proceedings. In fact, it is in cases which involve government employees, where the primary purpose of the exclusionary rule, the deterrence of police misconduct, is not well served, that "society's interest in maintaining levels of integrity and fitness of its public servants far outweigh any possible interest protected." <span class="Italic">Turner v. City of Lawton</span>, 733 P.2d 375, 383 (Okla. 1986) (Simms, C.J., dissenting).</p>

The Board first determined that the appellant did not consent to the search, but the Board then concluded that the warden of the institution had a reasonable suspicion justifying the search. The Board sustained the discharge of the employee who declined to allow the search. As to the constitutional basis for the search, and the appellant's argument that the results of the search (evidence of his refusal to permit the search) could not be used against him, the Board compared standards for searches of vehicles and employees' office spaces:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Searches by government employers of the private property of their employees are subject to the restraints of the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches. <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Ortega,</span> 480 U.S. 709, 715, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed.2d 714 (1987).

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee may have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to personal property he keeps at his workplace. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ortega,</span> 480 U.S. at 716, 107 S. Ct. 1492. Items in a person's vehicle that are not visible to passers-by would appear to fall easily into the category of items society is prepared to regard as private, even if the vehicle is parked on agency property. Moreover, while the expectation of privacy in property kept at the workplace may be reduced or even eliminated by workplace practices, procedures, and regulations, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 717-18, 107 S. Ct. 1492, the record does not establish that the expectation of privacy that the appellant in this case had in the contents of his vehicle was eliminated in this manner, or that it was reduced to an insignificant level. On the contrary, a "Program Statement" issued by the Bureau of Prisons states clearly that that organization does not have a policy of routinely searching employees' property. Program Statement 3420.08 (Mar. 7, 1996) &#x00B6; 13b. In addition, although agency instructions and regulations provide for searches of an employee's property, they limit those searches to occasions when the prison warden "has reasonable grounds to suspect that the employee is in possession of contraband items which, if introduced, could endanger the safety of staff or inmates or the security of the institution....<span class="Italic">" Id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6a, 13b.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we find that the search of the appellant's vehicle was subject to Fourth Amendment restrictions, and that the agency therefore is required to establish that it was not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge indicated at the hearing, and indirectly in her initial decision, that, if the agency was required to show that the search order was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, the appropriate standard for this purpose would be whether the agency had a "reasonable suspicion," and not whether it had "probable cause." In his petition for review, the appellant appears to challenge this position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ortega</span>, 480 U.S. 709, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 94 L. Ed.2d 714, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed issues related to a state government employer's search of personal property an employee kept in his office. After noting the general rule that, with limited exceptions, a search would be considered unreasonable if not authorized by a valid search warrant, it indicated that requiring a warrant for a government employer's work-related <span id="Page_1586"></span>search of its employee's property in the work place would be unduly burdensome<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 720-22, 107 S. Ct. 1492. It then held that requiring that the government employer have probable cause before conducting such a search would impose "intolerable burdens" on the employer, that it would be impracticable, and that the search instead "should be judged by the standard of reasonableness under all the circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 724-26, 107 S. Ct. 1492. The Court noted further that determining the reasonableness of a search required consideration of whether the search was justified at its inception<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 726, 107 S. Ct. 1492. A search would be justified at its inception, according to the Court, when there were "reasonable grounds for suspecting that the search [would] turn up evidence that the employee [was] guilty of work-related misconduct, or that the search [was] necessary for a noninvestigatory work-related purpose such as to retrieve a needed file." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that <span class="Italic">Ortega</span> involved a search of an employee's office space, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 713, 107 S. Ct. 1492, and that it could be argued that a different standard would be applicable to the search of a vehicle the employee had parked outside. The Court in that case defined "the boundaries of the workplace context," however, for purposes of its Fourth Amendment analysis, as "includ[ing] those areas...that are related to work and are generally within the employer's control." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 715, 107 S. Ct. 1492. The vehicle at issue in this case was parked on agency property, in a lot that was adjacent to a correctional institution and that presumably was made available to accommodate employees and visitors who had a need to be present at the institution. The agency's need to maintain control over the lot is reflected in the notice posted at the entrance--a notice that, as indicated above, advised all entering the lot that they were subject to searches of their vehicles under some circumstances. Moreover, the notice included information about federal statutory provisions restricting items that could be brought "upon the institution grounds," specifically referring to the prohibition on "any firearm, destructive device, ammunition, [or] other object designed to be used as a weapon...without the knowledge and consent of the warden." Under these circumstances, we find that the lot was part of the "workplace context," for purposes of our Fourth Amendment analysis, and that the "reasonable suspicion" standard to which the administrative judge referred is the appropriate standard for determining whether the weapon search that was ordered in this case violated the appellant's rights under the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Wiley</span> that the warden of the institution had a reasonable suspicion justifying the search of the appellant's car, the Board went on to hold that justification was not necessary. The nature of the institution justified the search, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 550:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, even if we were to find that the agency has not shown that it had reasonable grounds for suspecting that a search would turn up evidence of misconduct, we would find that it had reasonable grounds for suspecting that a search was necessary for noninvestigative work-related purposes. <span class="Italic">See Ortega,</span> 480 U.S. at 726, 107 S. Ct. 1492. In light of the parking lot's proximity to the correctional institution, and in light of the agency's responsibility for protecting those present at its facility from unnecessary danger, the agency had a legitimate interest in ensuring that no unauthorized weapons were being stored in vehicles parked on the lot. <span class="Italic">See Ortega,</span> 480 U.S. at 719-20 107 S. Ct. 1492 (determination of reasonableness of search by public employer requires "balanc[ing] the invasion of the employees' legitimate expectations of privacy against the government's need for supervision, control, and the efficient operation of the workplace").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's reasoning and result were reversed in <span class="Italic">Wiley v. DOJ</span>, 328 F.3d 1346, 1350-57 (Fed. Cir. 2003), weighing the quality and reliability of information derived from an anonymous tip with the Fourth Amendment reasonable suspicion test:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Fourth Amendment Standard</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with Wiley that the Warden was required to have probable cause to conduct a lawful search of Wiley's vehicle. Wiley was employed as a teacher at the Institution while his car was parked in a restricted area within the confines of the Institution. This case falls squarely under the Ortega decision and thus should be analyzed under the reasonable suspicion standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Fourth Amendment prohibits the government from undertaking "unreasonable searches and seizures" of individuals and their property. U.S. Const. amend. IV. Ordinarily, a Fourth Amendment search must be supported by probable cause. <span class="Italic">See New Jersey v. TLO</span>, 469 U.S. 325, 340, 105 S. Ct. 733, 83 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1985). The fundamental precept of the Fourth Amendment, however, is that a search must be reasonable, and although "both the concept of probable cause and the requirement of a warrant bear on the reasonableness of a search,...in certain limited circumstances neither is required." <span class="Italic">id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Almeida-Sanchez v. United States</span>, 413 U.S. 266, 277, 93 S. Ct. 2535, 37 L. Ed. 2d 596 (1973) (Powell, J., concurring)). Ultimately, the determination of the standard of reasonableness governing any specific class of searches requires balancing the "individual's legitimate expectations of privacy and personal security" with the "government's need for effective methods to deal with breaches of public order." <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 337, 105 S. Ct. 733. Indeed, the Supreme Court has stated that where "a careful balancing of governmental and private interests suggests that the public interest is best served by a Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of probable cause, we have not hesitated to adopt such a standard." <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 341, 105 S. Ct. 733.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Ortega</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ortega</span>, the Supreme Court defined such a category of searches. There, the Court addressed the appropriate Fourth Amendment standard for a search of a public employee's office by a public employer in areas in which the employee had a reasonable expectation of privacy. <span class="Italic">Ortega</span>, 480 U.S. 709, 107 S. Ct. 1492. The Court recognized that public employees have legitimate privacy interests in the private objects they bring to the workplace. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 721, 107 S. Ct. 1492. However, requiring a government employer in these instances to obtain a warrant would impede the "efficient and proper operation of the workplace." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 723, 107 S. Ct. 1492. The government's interest in the "efficient and proper operation of the workplace," <span class="Italic">id</span>., persuaded the court that on balance, despite the intrusion on individuals' privacy, a probable cause requirement "would impose intolerable burdens on public employers." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 724, 107 S. Ct. 1492. The Court therefore held that, at least with regard to workplace searches by a public employer of a government employee where the search is either for "noninvestigatory, work-related purposes" or "investigations of work-related misconduct," the government need only demonstrate "reasonableness under all the circumstances" to justify the constitutionality of the search. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 725-26, 107 S. Ct. 1492. This reasonableness inquiry in turn encompasses two inquiries: (1) whether the "action was justified at its inception," i.e., whether there were "<span class="Italic">reasonable grounds for suspecting</span> that the search will turn up evidence that the employee is guilty of work-related misconduct," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 726, 107 S. Ct. 1492 (emphasis added) (quoting <span class="Italic">Terry v. Ohio</span>, 392 U.S. 1, 20, 88 (1968)); and (2) whether the search as actually conducted was "reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 726, 107 S. Ct. 1492 (quoting <span class="Italic">TLO</span>, 469 U.S. at 341, 105 S. Ct. 733).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">"Workplace"</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In holding that workplace searches undertaken either for noninvestigatory work-related purposes or to investigate work-related misconduct may be predicated on reasonable suspicion rather than probable cause, the Court in <span class="Italic">Ortega</span> defined the "workplace" as "those areas...that are related to work and are generally within the employer's control." 480 U.S. at 715, 107 S. Ct. 1492. As an example, at a hospital, the hallways, cafeteria, offices, desks, and file cabinets, among other areas, are part of the workplace. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 715-16, 107 S. Ct. 1492. However, personal possessions on workplace territory, such as closed personal luggage or a handbag, would not necessarily be considered part of the workplace context. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 716, 107 S. Ct. 1492.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Wiley contends that <span class="Italic">Ortega</span> is inapplicable to this case because his car was like a closed briefcase or suitcase that under <span class="Italic">Ortega</span> might not be in the workplace. We disagree. Wiley's car was parked in the Institution's parking lot, which was on agency property, adjacent to the Institution, and available to accommodate employees and visitors of the Institution. The agency maintained control over the parking lot, as evidenced by the notice posted at the entrance of the parking lot advising visitors and employees that "[a]ll persons entering upon these premises are subject to routine searches of their person, property (<span class="Italic">including vehicles</span>), and packages" (emphasis added). Unlike a situation in which a public employee brings a closed suitcase to work without any expectation that it would be searched, Wiley was on notice that his car could be searched. Therefore, Wiley's car, as situated in the Institution's parking lot, was within the "workplace" as set forth in <span class="Italic">Ortega</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Work-Related Misconduct</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Ortega</span> Court also limited its holding to searches undertaken (1) for noninvestigatory work-related purposes or (2) to investigate work-related misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 725-26, 107 S. Ct. 1492. The Court distinguished these sorts of searches from those searches <span class="Italic">seek</span>ing to find evidence of criminal misconduct, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 721, 107 S. Ct. 1492, reasoning that public employers "are hardly in the business of investigating the violation of criminal laws." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 722, 107 S. Ct. 1492. The Court expressly declined to address the appropriate Fourth Amendment standard "when an employee is being investigated for criminal misconduct or breaches of other nonwork-related statutory or regulatory standards." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 729 n.*, 107 S. Ct. 1492 (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also Cerrone v. Brown</span>, 246 F.3d 194, 201 (2d Cir. 2001) ("[<span class="Italic">Ortega</span>] did not disturb the well-settled rule that probable cause is required for criminal investigations.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Wiley argues that, in contrast to the search in <span class="Italic">Ortega</span>, the search conducted by the Warden in this case was not an investigation simply to unearth evidence of work-related misconduct, but one with possible criminal implications requiring the existence of probable cause to <span id="Page_1587"></span>sustain the search's legality. Wiley alleges that the correctional officers who conducted the search could have arrested him. However, in looking to ascertain whether the investigation is criminal in nature, the proper focus is not on the positions or capabilities of the persons conducting the search, but rather the reason for the search itself. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Fernandes</span>, 272 F.3d 938, 943 n.3 (7th Cir. 2001) (analyzing the case pursuant to <span class="Italic">Ortega</span> because, while the prosecutor ordering the search of Fernandes's office was "in the business of investigating the violation of...criminal laws," the search itself was not a criminal investigation, but rather undertaken to "ensure that the work of the agency [was] conducted in a proper and efficient manner" (quoting <span class="Italic">Ortega</span>, 480 U.S. at 723, 724, 107 S. Ct. 1492)). Wiley argues that he could have been arrested pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1791, which provides for fines or imprisonment for providing or attempting to provide prohibited objects, including firearms, to a prison inmate. However, Wiley does not provide any evidence to indicate that the Warden ordered the search in view of &#x00A7; 1791.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, the facts of this case indicate that the search of Wiley's car was an internal investigation for purposes of maintaining security and order in the Institution. The Bureau of Prison's "Standards of Employee Conduct," Program Statement 3420.08, prohibits employees at the Institution from introducing "contraband into or upon the grounds of any federal penal or correctional institution, or taking or attempting to take therefrom, anything whatsoever without the Warden's knowledge and consent...." The initial impetus for the search was the OIA memorandum, which requested that the Warden investigate the matter locally and forward a report of his findings to the OIA in Denver. The memorandum also informed the Warden that upon receipt of his report, the matter would be "considered closed" unless the Warden was requested to provide additional information. The memorandum thus signals that the purpose of the search of Wiley's car was not to ferret out possible criminal activity but to uncover work-related misconduct in an internal investigation by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In conclusion, because the search of Wiley's car was a workplace search undertaken to investigate possible work-related misconduct, we agree with the Board that the search should be analyzed pursuant to the reasonable suspicion standard articulated in the <span class="Italic">Ortega</span> decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Balancing Test</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the prison context in this case raises special considerations that persuade us that the search only need be supported by reasonable suspicion. The core requirement of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness under all the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Skinner v. Ry. Labor Executives' Ass'n</span>, 489 U.S. 602, 619, 109 S. Ct. 1402, 103 L. Ed. 2d 639 (1989). Determining reasonableness of a particular search "is judged by balancing its intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate governmental interests." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Delaware v. Prouse</span>, 440 U.S. 648, 654, 99 S. Ct. 1391, 59 L. Ed. 2d 660 (1979)). First, we examine Wiley's personal privacy interests as well as the nature of the intrusion on his privacy interests. The Board determined, and it is not disputed, that Wiley had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his car. However, Wiley's expectation of privacy was mitigated by the conspicuous sign posted at the entrance of the Institution parking lot indicating that his vehicle was subject to search. Additionally, the nature of the search of Wiley's vehicle was not as intrusive as other types of searches, such as body cavity searches, that have been upheld as reasonable in light of recognized government interests. <span class="Italic">See Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton</span>, 515 U.S. 646, 115 S. Ct. 2386, 132 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1995). Next, we consider the "nature and immediacy of the governmental concern at issue." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 660, 115 S. Ct. 2386. Here, the government's interest in controlling the entry of guns and other dangerous weapons into the Institution is readily appreciated. <span class="Italic">See Griffin v. Wisconsin</span>, 483 U.S. 868, 873, 107 S. Ct. 3164, 97 L. Ed. 2d 709 (1987) (A state's operation of a prison "presents 'special needs' beyond normal law enforcement that may justify departures from the usual warrant and probable-cause requirements."). Upon balancing the intrusion on Wiley's Fourth Amendment interests against the agency's substantial interest in maintaining the security of the Institution, we conclude that the agency needed only to demonstrate that the Warden had reasonable grounds to suspect that Wiley kept a gun in his vehicle parked in the Institution's lot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Sufficiency of the Evidence</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the question of whether the Warden, at the time he ordered the search on November 29, 1999, had reasonable grounds to suspect that Wiley kept a gun in his car, based on the informant's letter that was forwarded from the OIA and which alleged that Wiley was keeping a 9 mm gun in his vehicle in the Institution parking lot ("the tip"). For the reasons below, we conclude that, as in <span class="Italic">Florida v. JL</span>, 529 U.S. 266, 120 S. Ct. 1375, 146 L. Ed. 2d 254 (2000), the tip in this case, standing alone, lacked the necessary indicia of reliability to serve as the basis for the search.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Probable cause and reasonable suspicion are "fluid concept[s] turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules." <span class="Italic">Illinois v. Gates</span>, 462 U.S. 213, 232, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983). That said, the Supreme Court has defined probable cause as "a fair probability" that the government action, e.g., search, will yield the evidence sought after. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 238, 103 S. Ct. 2317. Reasonable suspicion, "a less demanding standard" than probable cause, may be established with information different in quantity and content and less reliable than that necessary for probable cause. <span class="Italic">Alabama v. White</span>, 496 U.S. 325, 330, 110 S. Ct. 2413, 110 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1990). Where an informant's tip provides the basis for a search implicating the Fourth Amendment, we look to the totality of the circumstances, including the informant's veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge, to determine the constitutionality of the search. <span class="Italic">See Gates</span>, 462 U.S. at 230, 103 S. Ct. 2317 (modifying the two-pronged approach established by <span class="Italic">Aguilar v. Texas</span>, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964), and <span class="Italic">Spinelli v. United States</span>, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969)). Although first articulated in a probable cause context, these factors are equally relevant to determining the value of the tip in a reasonable suspicion inquiry, although "allowance must be made in applying them for the lesser showing required to meet that standard." <span class="Italic">White</span>, 496 U.S. at 328-29, 110 S. Ct. 2412. In determining whether a Fourth Amendment search was supported by reasonable suspicion, we examine what information was available to the party ordering the search at the time the search was ordered. <span class="Italic">Garrison v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 72 F.3d 1566, 1569 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An anonymous tip in particular raises special concerns as to how to establish the veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge of the hearsay information alleged in the tip. Unlike a known informant, who can be held accountable if he or she provides inaccurate information and whose reputation can be assessed, <span class="Italic">JL</span>, 529 U.S. at 270, 120 S. Ct. 1375, an anonymous tip "seldom demonstrates the informant's basis of knowledge or veracity inasmuch as...the veracity of persons supplying anonymous tips is 'by hypothesis largely unknown, and unknowable.'" <span class="Italic">White</span>, 496 U.S. at 329, 110 S. Ct. 2412 (quoting <span class="Italic">Gates</span>, 462 U.S. at 237, 103 S. Ct. 2412). Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has acknowledged that there are "situations in which an anonymous tip, <span class="Italic">suitably corroborated</span>, exhibits 'sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion'" to support the government investigation. <span class="Italic">JL</span>, 529 U.S. at 270, 120 S. Ct. 1375 (emphasis added) (quoting <span class="Italic">White</span>, 496 U.S. at 327, 110 S. Ct. 2412).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">White</span>, the Court held that there was such sufficient corroboration of an anonymous tip to establish the necessary indicia of reliability to support a stop on reasonable suspicion. 496 U.S. 325, 110 S. Ct. 2412, 110 L. Ed. 301. In <span class="Italic">White</span>, the police received an anonymous tip that a woman named Vanessa White would be leaving a particular apartment at a particular time in a brown Plymouth station wagon with the right taillight lens broken, that she would be going to Dobey's Motel, and that she would be in possession of an ounce of cocaine housed inside a brown leather attach&#x00E9; case. 496 U.S. at 327, 110 S. Ct. 2412. The police subsequently observed the events pass as predicted by the tipster. At the point that the Plymouth pulled into the street where Dobey's Motel was located, the police stopped the car and searched it, finding cocaine in a brown attach&#x00E9; case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Court noted that the tip, standing alone, would be insufficient to establish reasonable suspicion of the alleged criminal activity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 329, 110 S. Ct. 2412. However, the tipster disclosed "future actions of third parties ordinarily not easily predicted." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 332 (quoting <span class="Italic">Gates</span>, 462 U.S. at 245, 103 S. Ct. 2317). The fact that "significant aspects" of the tipster's predictions were corroborated by independent police investigation persuaded the Court that there existed sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the stop. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, the Court acknowledged that this was a "close case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">JL</span>, the Court noted that it had regarded the <span class="Italic">White</span> case as "borderline." <span class="Italic">JL</span>, 529 U.S. at 271, 120 S.

In contrast, the <span class="Italic">JL</span> Court characterized the instant case as "surely fall[ing] on the other side of the line," <span class="Italic">id</span>., holding that an anonymous tip lacked the indicia of reliability to establish reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 274, 120 S.

The police arrived at the bus stop and saw a black male wearing a plaid shirt. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The police had no other reason apart from the tip for suspecting him of involvement in criminal activity. The police stopped and frisked the man, seizing a gun. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Court concluded that the tip did not exhibit sufficient "indicia of reliability" to support a reasonable suspicion that the man at the bus stop had a gun. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 271, 120 S. Ct. 1375. The Court noted that whereas the tipster in <span class="Italic">White</span> had accurately predicted the suspect's movements, the anonymous call in <span class="Italic">JL</span> provided no predictive information. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In contrast to <span class="Italic">White</span>, the anonymous informant in <span class="Italic">JL</span> gave only a "bare report of an unknown, unaccountable informant who neither explained how he knew about the gun nor supplied any basis for believing he had inside information about [the suspect]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given this framework, we now examine the nature and sufficiency of the information before the Warden on November 29, 1999, when he ordered <span id="Page_1588"></span>the search of Wiley's car. As in <span class="Italic">White</span> and <span class="Italic">JL</span>, we are dealing with an anonymous tip situation. The Warden admitted that he did not know and did not attempt to ascertain the identity of the tipster, the said Mr. Martin St. Jones, at the time he ordered the search. The Warden also testified that he was not aware whether the tipster previously was known to the OIA or had supplied reliable information in the past.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Warden also was aware of the 1997 investigation regarding allegations that Wiley was carrying a gun into the Institution. However, the government at oral argument was unable to substantiate that the Warden had actual knowledge that Wiley previously had brought a gun onto Institution grounds. An FBI agent who interviewed Wiley during the 1997 investigation testified before the AJ that Wiley confessed to her that he may have carried a gun into the Institution by accident. The FBI agent further testified that through SIA Longley she informed the Warden of the results of her interview with Wiley. In particular, she gave SIA Longley a copy of her report of the interview. The record does not indicate, however, that SIA Longley gave the report itself to the Warden or that the report itself included details as to Wiley's confession to the FBI agent. The Warden himself admitted that he was not privy to all the details of the prior investigation. On the facts before us, therefore, we can only assume that while the Warden knew of the 1997 investigation, the Warden did not have actual knowledge that Wiley previously ever had a gun on Institution grounds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, when the Warden ordered the search on November 29, 1999, all he had before him was a tip provided by an anonymous informant who gave Wiley's name and place of employment, and alleged that Wiley kept a 9 mm gun in his car and that several unidentified employees had <span class="Italic">seen</span> the gun. As in <span class="Italic">JL</span>, here we have a tip containing bare allegations that were not corroborated by anything outside the four corners of the tip itself. The informant here furnished no explanation as to how he knew about the gun allegedly in Wiley's car or how he had any basis for believing the tipster had inside information. <span class="Italic">See JL</span>, 529 U.S. at 271, 120 S. Ct. 1375. In this sense, this case is different from <span class="Italic">White</span>, where the police independently corroborated, via direct observation, many significant details of the tip before stopping the suspect. <span class="Italic">See White</span>, 496 U.S. at 332110 S. Ct. 2412. Furthermore, the fact that the Warden was able to independently corroborate Wiley's name and place of employment does not establish the reliability of the tip as to the allegation that Wiley kept a gun in his car. Indeed, the Supreme Court specifically rejected this argument in <span class="Italic">JL</span>, where the police were able to corroborate only the tip's assertion that there would a young black male wearing a plaid shirt at the bus stop, but did not substantiate the heart of the tip--that this male would be carrying a gun--before conducting a stop and frisk of a male of that physical description and location. Florida contended that the tip was reliable because police were able to corroborate the tip's description of the male's physical appearance, dress, and location. The Court disagreed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An accurate description of a subject's readily observable location and appearance is of course reliable in this limited sense: It will help the police correctly identify the person whom the tipster means to accuse. Such a tip, however, does not show that the tipster has knowledge of the concealed criminal activity. The reasonable suspicion here requires that a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality, not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">529 U.S. at 272, 120 S. Ct. 1375. As in <span class="Italic">JL</span>, the fact that here the Warden was able to corroborate "readily observable" allegations of the tip, i.e., Wiley's name and place of employment, does not establish the tip's reliability as to the allegation that Wiley carried a 9 mm gun. Moreover, the age of the tip calls into question its reliability. The informant's letter was dated January 7, 1999, and therefore almost eleven months old when relied upon by the Warden at the end of November 1999. The informant's letter gives no reason to believe that Wiley would continue to keep a gun in his car on a long-term basis. For these reasons, we hold that the tip in this case lacked sufficient indicia of reliability to establish reasonable suspicion upon which to base the search of Wiley's car.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such a tip lacking indicia of reliability could not itself provide the basis for an investigatory action without further investigation bolstering the constitutionality of the search. <span class="Italic">See White</span>, 496 U.S. at 329, 110 S. Ct. 2412. Here, no such action was taken. Rather, the Warden admitted that the first step he took to investigate the reliability of the tip was to order the search of the car. Before the AJ, the Warden was asked whether he would "determine reliability before ordering a search...." The Warden replied:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I think that was the purpose of the search, to determine the reliability. In this particular case we discussed a variety of ways how we could investigate or set up this investigation. It <span class="Italic">seem</span>ed like [the search] was the quickest and easiest way to determine whether this was a reliable charge, or whether [it was] a reliable comment, or whether it was not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the Warden's logic. The search may have been the "quickest and easiest way" of determining the reliability of the tip. However, the Warden's ordering of the search to determine the reliability of the tip essentially sidesteps the very issue presented in this case, i.e., whether the tip gave the Warden constitutional grounds to proceed with the search. Contrary to the Warden, we do not feel that convenience should trump constitutionality.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, despite the unique concerns presented by the prison context in this case, this is not the sort of situation contemplated by the dicta in <span class="Italic">JL</span>, where the Court suggested that the usual showing of sufficient indicia of reliability might be relaxed in certain emergency situations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The facts of this case do not require us to speculate about the circumstances under which the danger alleged in an anonymous tip might be so great as to justify a search even without a showing of reliability. We do not say, for example, that a report of a person carrying a bomb need bear the indicia of reliability we demand for a report of a person carrying a firearm before the police can constitutionally conduct a frisk.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">JL</span>, 529 U.S. at 273-74, 120 S. Ct. 1375. We are not persuaded that there was such an urgent situation here, given that it took over ten months for the OIA to act on the informant's letter and forward it to the Institution for investigation. We note that our analysis, which applies the reasonable suspicion rather than probable cause standard, <span class="Italic">supra</span> Part II.A, has accounted for any special considerations present in the prison context, and, unlike our colleague in dissent, we decline to further diminish the level of constitutional protection afforded to Wiley in this case by using the prison context a second time to diminish the established tests of reliability for anonymous tips.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the Board's sustaining of Wiley's removal for failure to submit to a search when initially requested because we conclude that the search violated the Fourth Amendment's requirement of reasonableness. We therefore do not reach the other issues raised on appeal, including Wiley's reprisal claim and procedural issues relating to the AJ's refusal to compel discovery and consider certain testimony. REVERSED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If <span class="Italic">Delk</span> and <span class="Italic">Wiley</span> can be harmonized, it appears that the Board will not block admission of evidence illegally seized by law enforcement officers conducting a search as part of a criminal investigation, but the same type of evidence is subject to exclusion if the employing agency unlawfully conducts the search. As to the search involved in the criminal process, application of the exclusionary rule does not advance the criminal process by application to an administrative proceeding. But application of the same rule furthers the laws forbidding unreasonable searches if administrative agencies are precluded from using in their own proceedings evidence that is unlawfully seized.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Delk,</span> the Board first embraced, then rejected the exclusionary rule used in criminal proceedings. In <span class="Italic">Youraine v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 2 MSPR 500, 502, 3 MSPB 23 (1980), an appellant charged with wrongful removal of government property challenged evidence obtained by agency investigators through a search of his residence. The evidence was admissible because the employee consented to the search; further, appellant's counsel failed to object to the evidence during the hearing. In <span class="Italic">dictum</span> the Board noted that in general a search conducted without a warrant or probable cause is improper, but consent to a search negated a Fourth Amendment challenge. <span class="Italic">McClain v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 20 MSPR 464, 465 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An early decision, <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 342, 345, 7 MSPB 227 (1981), considered whether the AJ erred by admitting testimony and an exhibit concerning appellant's possession of an alcoholic beverage on a government installation. The appellant contended the evidence resulted both from an unlawful search by an agency police officer of his private vehicle in violation of the Fourth Amendment and from the agency's failure to advise him of his right to remain silent. At issue was whether the appellant consented to the search. The police officer who escorted the appellant to a hospital for an alcohol test testified that the appellant told him there was alcohol in his car, that the appellant voluntarily unlocked his car, and that the appellant then pointed to the bottle. The appellant said he had already been charged by the base police when he made the disclosure concerning the bottle and that the search of the car was refused until the officer said he would get a search warrant. The Board credited the AJ's determination that the appellant voluntarily allowed the search, but noting that the appellant was determined to be under the influence of alcohol, the Board considered whether the appellant intentionally relinquished or abandoned his Fourth Amendment protections, i.e., whether appellant's consent to the search was the product of rational intellect and free will. Concluding that the appellant was not so intoxicated that his consent was irrational, the Board decided the evidence was properly admitted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gladden v. Unsworth,</span> 396 F.2d 373, 380-81 (9th Cir. 1968), the court stated with regard to a confession that if by reason of extreme intoxication, the confession in fact could not be said to be the product of a "rational intellect and a free will," the confession was not voluntarily given.[2] The standard for determining when voluntary consent to a police action will be impossible because of intoxication is equally applicable to consent to a search. <span class="Italic">United States v. Leland,</span> 376 F. Supp. 1193, 1199 (D. Del. 1974). The issue then is whether appellant was so intoxicated that his consent to the <span id="Page_1589"></span>search was not the product of a rational intellect and a free will<span class="Italic">. United States v. Johnson,</span> 563 F.2d 936, 939 (8th Cir. 1977). The evidence in the record here fails to establish that appellant was so intoxicated that the consent was invalid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Townsend v. Sain</span>, 372 U.S. 293, 307, 83 S. Ct. 745, 754, 9 L. Ed.2d 770 (1963), where the Supreme Court enunciated this general test for the voluntariness of a confession.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to substantiate its charge that appellant was under the influence of an intoxicant while on duty, the agency submitted the results of an analysis of the alcohol content of appellant's blood administered following appellant's accident. The report states that appellant was under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant had stipulated at the hearing that he was under the influence of an intoxicant on the date in question, but challenged the accuracy of the blood analysis test without providing any substantiation. Appellant apparently was attempting to argue that he was not as severely intoxicated as indicated by the blood analysis. In fact, appellant has never contended that his consent was not the product of a rational intellect. None of the witnesses testified that appellant appeared to be severely intoxicated on the morning of the accident. Moreover, appellant apparently was able to have coherent conversations with both a coworker and the police officer, and was able to recall most of the events of the day of the accident. Therefore, we find that while appellant was under the influence of alcohol on the date of the accident, he was not so intoxicated to render his consent to the search to be invalid.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Middleton v. DOJ</span>, 23 MSPR 223, 226-27 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1060 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table), determined that the exclusionary rule did not bar the use, in administrative proceedings, of evidence seized by law enforcement officers in a criminal case; administrative suppression of the evidence would not deter improper conduct by the law enforcement officers, an approach the Board decided was consistent with the purpose of the exclusionary rule developed by the Supreme Court. <span class="Italic">Scheurman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 29 MSPR 313, 314 n.* (1985), implied that search and seizure problems needed some additional consideration. The issue was whether the appellant's car was improperly searched; again the issue was decided by a determination that there was implied consent for the search. However, the Board stated that "[W]e do not reach the issue of whether the search and seizure clause of the Fourth Amendment can be applied to exclude evidence from Board proceedings," <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">Youraine v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The Board again avoided the Fourth Amendment issue in <span class="Italic">Sternberg v. DODDS</span>, 41 MSPR 46, 51 (1989): even if the objection applied, the "plain view" exception permitted the AJ to receive the evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some court decisions predating the line of authority cited in <span class="Italic">Delk</span> applied an exclusionary rule. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Saylor v. United States</span>, 374 F.2d 894, 898 (Ct. Cl. 1967) ("In a wholly civilian case within the United States, the fruits of such a[n unreasonable] search and seizure could certainly not be used as the foundation for the discharge of a federal employee entitled to veterans' preference. For when &#x00A7; 14 of the Veterans Preference Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 863, refers to 'evidence submitted' in employee discharge proceedings, it means evidence submitted without violating the Constitution of the United States." (citing <span class="Italic">Powell v. Zuckert, supra</span>)); <span class="Italic">Mendez v. Macy</span>, 292 F. Supp. 802 (S.D.N.Y. 1968) (assuming that the exclusion rule would apply in a civil service case, but finding an exception for a warrantless but reasonable narcotics search conducted on board a ship); <span class="Italic">Powell v. Zuckert</span>, 366 F.2d 634, 640 (D.C. Cir. 1966) ("It would <span class="Italic">seem</span> wholly at odds with our traditions to allow the admission of evidence illegally seized by Government agents in discharge proceedings.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to search of a vehicle, the Federal Circuit reviewed some constitutional law, <span class="Italic">Depte v. United States</span>, 715 F.2d 1481, 1483-84 (Fed. Cir. 1983):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An important issue petitioner raises is whether Officer Mango had probable cause for arresting her. We agree with the MSPB that he did. The initial circumstances that aroused the officer's suspicion were not sufficient, in themselves, to amount to full probable cause. But his viewing (through the car window) of the vinyl bag containing what appeared to be several white institutional-size agency aprons did provide the crucial information. He then had, and could objectively have, a reasonable belief that petitioner had stolen those Veterans Administration goods. That was enough under the "plain view" doctrine to warrant his arresting her lawfully before she departed in her car. <span class="Italic">See Michigan v. Tyler</span>, 436 U.S. 499, 509, 98 S. Ct. 1942, 1949-50, 56 L. Ed.2d 486 (1978); <span class="Italic">Coolidge v. New Hampshire</span>, 403 U.S. 443, 465-66, 91 S. Ct. 2022, 2037-38, 29 L. Ed.2d 564 (1971); <span class="Italic">Ker v. California</span>, 374 U.S. 23, 43, 83 S. Ct. 1623, 1635, 10 L. Ed.2d 726 (1963); <span class="Italic">United States v. Finnegan</span>, 568 F.2d 637, 640 (9th Cir. 1977). Because Mango's good faith position was reasonable at that time and place, it makes no difference that it turned out later (contrary to Mango's belief at the time of the arrest) that the agency apparently allowed such aprons to be taken from work and therefore that in fact petitioner had committed no offense. <span class="Italic">See Michigan v. DeFillippo</span>, 443 U.S. 31, 36, 37, 40, 99 S. Ct. 2627, 2631, 2632, 2633, 61 L. Ed.2d 343 (1979); <span class="Italic">United States v. Saunders</span>, 476 F.2d 5, 7 (5th Cir. 1973); <span class="Italic">United States v. 1964 Ford Thunderbird</span>, 445 F.2d 1064, 1068-69 (3rd Cir. 1971), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 405 U.S. 964, 92 S. Ct. 1181, 31 L. Ed.2d 239 (1973); <span class="Italic">Robbins v. MacKenzie</span>, 364 F.2d 45, 47 (1st Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 385 U.S. 913, 87 S. Ct. 215, 17 L. Ed.2d 140 (1966).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though petitioner may well have subjectively believed that Mango had no cause to arrest her, and that she could resist him, she had no right to resist an arrest that was in fact lawful when made. <span class="Italic">Cf. John Bad Elk v. United States</span>, 177 U.S. 529, 534, 535, 537-38, 20 S. Ct. 729, 731-732, 44 L. Ed. 874 (1900); <span class="Italic">Finn v. United States</span>, 219 F.2d 894, 899-901 (9th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 349 U.S. 906, 75 S. Ct. 583, 99 L. Ed. 1242 (1955). It follows that her resistance and her assault on Officer Mango were legally unjustified.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The constitutional restrictions against unreasonable searches are not the only protections available to employees. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 681, 687 (1985), considered the impact of a provision in a collective bargaining agreement restricting the agency's right to search employees' lockers. Although the agency violated the contract, the error was harmless because the search would have yielded the evidence used in the adverse action had the contract procedures been followed. [Refer to Chapter 11, "<a href="0100-2023-18-014.html#sec11-15">Collective Bargaining Contract Violation</a>."]</p>
