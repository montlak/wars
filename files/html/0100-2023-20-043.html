<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-43"><span class="space">g.</span> Specificity of Disclosure</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">There are two types of disclosures that the Board analyzes in a whistleblowing case. First, the Board considers whether, in an affirmative defense or IRA appeal, the whistleblower's disclosure to agency personnel, to the press, to Congress, an IG, or other recipient is sufficiently specific so that it can be determined whether the nature of the complaint falls within the general categories of 5 USC 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lang v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> DA-1221-10-0235-W-1 (NP 4/6/2011) ("The statements contained in the April 19, 2007 email to Felix constitute nothing more than an unprotected, generalized, vague laundry list of alleged violations by unnamed individuals at some unknown time and place. Disclosures must be specific and detailed, not vague allegations of wrongdoing regarding broad or imprecise matters. <span class="Italic">Boechler v. Department of the Interior</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 542, &#x00B6; 12 (2008); <span class="Italic">Keefer v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 687, &#x00B6; 11 (1999)."). Second, if the matter is pursued through an IRA case, then OSC must be made aware of the specific nature of the underlying disclosure that allegedly led to reprisal against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At least until <span class="Italic">Hessami v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20201109079">979 F.3d 1962</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020) (discussed in "<a href="0100-2023-20-089.html#sec13-81"><span class="Italic">Rusin</span> Model: Nonfrivolous Allegations Establish Jurisdiction; <span class="Italic">Hessami</span></a>"), in an IRA appeal, evaluation of the specificity of disclosures could take the form, if not the title, of summary judgment, <span class="Italic">Twardowski v. MSPB</span>, 634 Fed. Appx. 302, 304-05 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the WPA, an employee who believes he was retaliated against for making a protected disclosure may seek corrective action from the OSC, and if such action is denied, appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), 1221(a). The Board has jurisdiction over such an appeal if the appellant has exhausted his remedies before the OSC and makes a non-frivolous allegation that (1) he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a "protected disclosure," and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Section 2302(b)(8) defines a "protected disclosure" as any disclosure by an employee that the employee reasonably believes evidences: (1) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation; (2) gross mismanagement; (3) a gross waste of funds; (4) an abuse of authority; or (5) a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The standard for determining whether non-frivolous disclosures exist is analogous to that for summary judgment." <span class="Italic">Kahn v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 528 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). The petitioner must show the existence of a material fact issue, which cannot be supported by only unsubstantiated speculation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board may only review those disclosures and personnel actions that an appellant specifically raised before the OSC, and it may not consider any subsequent re-characterization of those charges on appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 7 F.3d 1031, 1037 (Fed. Cir. 1993).<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Durr v. MSPB</span>, 297 Fed. Appx. 966, 969 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP), explained that to qualify for WPA protection, a disclosure to the agency should be specific:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court requires that "substantive details establishing jurisdiction...be alleged in the complaint." <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, 7 F.3d at 1036. Here, appellant failed to disclose sufficient information to support a reasonable inference of wrongdoing. The Board found that appellant failed to identify any funded research that Dr. Durr had not been provided time to conduct and how the money was otherwise used. The AJ concluded that "[b]ecause the appellant has not been provided time to conduct research does not necessarily mean that there has been any 'funded research' that the appellant was eligible to conduct." Similarly, that appellant "was not granted...[research] funds does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the funds were misused." Because Dr. Durr has failed to identify what funded research he was eligible to conduct or how funds were misused, he has not made a non-frivolous allegation.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Our thorough review of the record confirms the administrative judge's finding that "the appellant's assertion of unspecified and outlandish conduct by unidentified agency officials does not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of whistleblowing activity, i.e., the making of a protected disclosure."

<p class="Body-Text">Broadly-stated allegations were insufficient to establish an IRA case in <span class="Italic">Benton-Flores v. DOD</span>, DC-1221-13-0522-B-2 (NP 1/23/2023), involving asserted mistreatment of a child in a dependents' school:</p>

Nor has she identified any evidence that her disclosure included similar details. In other words, while the appellant may have reasonably believed that she was disclosing wrongdoing, she failed to prove that she reasonably believed that she was disclosing wrongdoing that rose to the level of a violation of law, rule, regulation, or other protected category. <span class="Italic">See Benton-Flores</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 428, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">see also Keefer v.

<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, under <span class="Italic">Eoff v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DE-0752-17-0015-I-1 (1/30/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant provides a chart describing her alleged disclosures in her April 14-15, 2015 emails. She explains that she disclosed the following information: (1) her confusion about her former supervisor's request for a meeting to discuss her performance and conduct, which she describes as unfair and an unexpected assault; (2) her decision to contest the performance and conduct issues identified by her former supervisor; and (3) her reasons for disregarding her former supervisor's instruction to limit the recipients of their email exchange about her performance issues. <span class="Italic">Id</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's emails contesting the description of her performance and conduct issues and expressing disagreement with her former supervisor's management decisions did not convey specific and detailed information that a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the appellant could reasonably conclude evidenced a protected disclosure of any wrongdoing listed in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). <span class="Italic">See Francis v.

<p class="Body-Text">The degree of specificity of the disclosure seems to be measured by the hypothetical disinterested, informed observer, and that perspective may include the perspective of agency officials who receive the disclosures. That the AJ does not fully appreciate the exact implications of the disclosures when those disclosures involve complex matters administered by experts does not deflect from the adequacy an otherwise specific disclosure, <span class="Italic">Pridgen v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although grant law and policy are highly complex, the test of whether a disclosure is protected is not whether the administrative judge understands every nuance of the law. Here, given the appellant's particular responsibilities as well as GAO's ongoing work on this specific law, it seems quite clear that those involved in making and receiving the disclosure well understood the law's requirements....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">General assertions of improper hiring practices did not meet the bar of specificity, <span class="Italic">Stevens v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge determined that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that he made a protected disclosure. We agree. In his OSC complaint, the appellant alleged he disclosed that four senior agency executives "placed" approximately 700 information technology employees in positions "without completing the necessary and proper job documentation, and without open and fair competition." As the administrative judge correctly explained, the appellant's allegation does not contain information that he reasonably believed evidenced gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). As for whether the appellant alleged a violation of law, rule, or regulation, a protected disclosure must be specific and detailed, and not a vague allegation of wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">Salerno v. Department of the Interior</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6; 6 (2016). The appellant did not and still does not allege any <span class="Italic">specific</span> violation of a law, rule, or regulation. Instead, he continues to allege <span class="Italic">generally</span> that the agency's noncompetitive reassignment of personnel during the reorganization violated merit systems principles. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b); <span class="Italic">cf.

Further, there was no way for the appellant to know or reasonably conclude that the only applicant qualified for the position as advertised was the officer selected. Thus, we find that the appellant failed to show that he had a reasonable belief that this disclosure evidenced any of the types of wrongdoing set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 2012 WPEA did not alter the requirement of reasonably specific allegations of wrongdoing, <span class="Italic">Roll v. VA,</span> AT-1221-14-0613-W-1 (NP 4/15/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The test for establishing a protected disclosure under section 2302(b)(8) is not onerous. Both the Board and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have found that an appellant is not required to identify the particular statutory or regulatory provision by title or number that the agency allegedly violated when his statements and the circumstances of those statements clearly implicate an identifiable law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Langer v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 265 F.3d 1259, 1266 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Mason v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 135, &#x00B6; 17 (2011).

Department of the Interior,</span> 122 M.S.P.R. 248, &#x00B6; 6 (2015). Despite this modest pleading standard, an employee must make more than a vague, conclusory, or unsupported allegation of wrongdoing under section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Phillip v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> No. 2016-1002, 2016 WL 929856, at *2 (Fed. Cir.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered whether the statutory amendments of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA), Pub. L. No. 112199, 126 Stat. 1465 (WPEA), have altered the law regarding vague and conclusory allegations and find that they have not. In enacting the WPEA, Congress amended several provisions within title 5 of the U.S. Code, including the definition and scope of a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Day v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 119 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 18 (2013) (citing WPEA, &#x00A7; 101). Among these amendments are (1) a change in the language of section 2302(b)(8) from a <span class="Italic">violation</span> of any law, rule, or regulation, to <span class="Italic">any violation</span> of any law, rule, or regulation, and (2) the addition of several new subsections in section 2302(f) that clarify the definition of a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> WPEA, &#x00A7; 101(a), (b)(2)(C); <span class="Italic">Mudd v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 120 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 5 n.3 (2013); <span class="Italic">Day,</span> 119 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-26. Additionally, under the WPEA, Congress expanded the grounds upon which an appellant can file an IRA appeal with the Board to include certain classes of protected activity under sections 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a); <span class="Italic">Hooker v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 9 (2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Absent from the WPEA's various amendments, however, is any change to the Board's decisional authority finding that vague and conclusory allegations fail to meet this standard. Congress's silence on these topics in the WPEA is germane, especially in light of the substantial amendments it made to existing Federal whistleblower protections. <span class="Italic">See Butterbaugh v. Department of Justice</span>, 336 F.3d 1332, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("Congress may be presumed to know of long-standing administrative or judicial constructions, and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change."); <span class="Italic">Haywood v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 603, 609-10 (1994) (stating that, when Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law without change, Congress is presumed to have been aware of the administrative or judicial interpretation of the incorporated sections and to have adopted that interpretation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon the statements contained within the appellant's submissions to the Director, we find that he has failed to prove that he disclosed a violation of any law, rule, or regulation under section 2302(b)(8). Rather, the appellant's statements about the human resources specialist's conduct are similar to other general assertions of alleged wrongdoing that the Board has found do not constitute protected disclosures of any law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Boechler v. Department of the Interior,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 542, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2008) (finding that a statement that an employee violated the law by participating in the cancellation of a contract was too vague to even qualify as a nonfrivolous allegation of a protected disclosure), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 328 F.

Department of Agriculture,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 363, &#x00B6; 21 (2005) (determining that general allegations of harassment and discrimination were too vague to constitute nonfrivolous allegations of protected disclosures). The Board, moreover, has found that an individual's allegation that another employee lied, without more, does not constitute a protected disclosure under section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Rzucidlo v. Department of the Army,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 17 (2006). Similarly, the appellant's allegation that the human resources specialist broke "the federal law and the federal code of conduct" by purportedly lying to him does not clearly implicate an identifiable law, rule, or regulation for the purpose of proving that he made a protected disclosure under section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Chavez,</span> 120 M.S.P.R. 285, &#x00B6; 19 (finding that an allegation that medical carts were not cleaned and stocked at a shift change, supposedly pursuant to agency regulations, which the appellant failed to provide, did not clearly implicate a specific law, rule, or regulation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Cobb v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0752-21-0258-I-1, n.3 (NP 7/7/2022) ("Regarding <span id="Page_3698"></span>his disclosure that the agency hired an officer who had been accused of theft, although the appellant need not accurately label the sort of wrongdoing at issue, a disclosure must still be specific and detailed, and not a vague allegation of wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">Linder v. Department of Justice</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 14 (2014). Here, the appellant did not state that the hiring constituted any sort of wrongdoing or identify a law, rule, or regulation that was purportedly violated, nor did he provide any details of the alleged theft incident, such as when it occurred or what or how much was stolen.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However, an appellant need not specify a particular law or regulation that was violated to obtain protection, <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. VA</span>, 113 MSPR 469, 475 &#x00B6; 12, 2010 MSPB 62 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Protected whistleblowing takes place where an appellant made disclosures that he reasonably believed evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); <span class="Italic">Groseclose,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 194, &#x00B6; 22 (citing <span class="Italic">Grubb,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 11). Under the WPA, the employee is not required to identify the particular statutory or regulatory provision that the agency allegedly violated where his statements and circumstances of those statements clearly implicate an identifiable law, rule or regulation; he is only burdened with making a nonfrivolous allegation that he reasonably believed that his disclosure evidenced one of the circumstances described at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Schneider v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 13 (2005). The question is whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee could reasonably conclude that the actions evidenced a violation of a law, rule, or regulation, or one of the other conditions set out in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Groseclose,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 194, &#x00B6; 22 (citing <span class="Italic">Lachance v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ellison v. MSPB</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1036 (Fed. Cir. 1993), considered whether the appellant's complaint to the Special Counsel was sufficiently specific as to the nature of the disclosure to the agency alleged to be the basis of the resulting reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ellison argues, as he did before the Board, that he complied with the procedural requirements for corrective action and that his complaint alleged that his third nonselection for promotion was in reprisal for a whistleblowing disclosure made to the agency IG, separate and apart from his disclosure made in the course of the agency grievance process. The law, however, is well settled that the mere recitation of a basis for jurisdiction by a party is not sufficient. Rather, substantive details establishing jurisdiction must be alleged in the complaint. <span class="Italic">See Livingston v. Derwinski</span>, 959 F.2d 224, 225 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Moreover, the test of the sufficiency of an employee's charges of whistleblowing to the OSC is the statement that the employee makes in the complaint requesting corrective action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214, not the employee's <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> characterization of those statements. <span class="Italic">Ward v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd</span>., 981 F.2d 521, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ellison's November 29, 1990 OSC complaint asserted that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[o]n May 8, 1990, Phillip Foster, an employee at Crane and the job recommending official for the referenced position, held a planning meeting with his staff to discuss the upcoming job announcement for this position. During the meeting Mr. Foster stated there were only two people he would like to see in the position, Don Ellison or Rex Williams. He then stated that he would be unable to choose Mr. Ellison.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The reason Mr. Foster would not and did not select Mr. Ellison is because of a continuing reprisal directed against Mr. Ellison by Foster and Foster's supervisor William Gillenwater. <span class="Italic">Mr. Ellison is a victim of reprisal because of protest he made to Foster and Gillenwater in 1989 concerning an earlier competitive announcement for this same position</span>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Mr. Ellison recently learned that he was again not selected, although he ranked first on the promotion register.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OSC construed that statement as alleging that "[Ellison's] most recent non-selection for promotion to a supervisory position [was] in continued reprisal for information [he] disclosed in the course of previous grievances [he] filed in April 1989." Thus, the OSC essentially interpreted the complaint as being tantamount to further pursuit of the claim that Ellison raised during his unsuccessful grievance, not an assertion of reprisal for disclosing illegality or mismanagement at the agency. In light of the language of the complaint and the record before the OSC, we find no error in the OSC's interpretation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ellison failed to provide a factual foundation sufficient to support his charge that his nonselection by the agency was in reprisal for a protected disclosure in violation of his rights under the WPA. Ellison's November 29, 1990 complaint to the OSC did not mention his disclosures to the IG alleging government illegality, waste, or mismanagement. In fact, the statements in his complaint suggest that he was seeking collateral review of the claim denied by the agency in the grievance proceeding. That, of course, does not justify an IRA appeal to the Board under the WPA.</p>
