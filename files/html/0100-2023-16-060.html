<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-61"><span class="space">5.</span> Illegal Provisions; Management Rights</h4>
<p class="noindent">The general rule is that the agency's failure to follow an illegal agreement provision does not constitute a repudiation of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Office of the Adjutant Gen., Missouri NG and ACT Show-Me Air #93 and Army #94 Chapters</span>, 58 FLRA 418, 421 (2003). The employer may negotiate and sign an agreement and then claim that it cannot be honored because it violates some law or regulation or that nonnegotiable management rights have been bargained away. FLRA initially suggested that the validity of the provisions may still be raised in grievance arbitration and through a ULP case; if the provisions violate law, they are unenforceable, void. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1862 and DHEW, Pub. Health Serv., Indian Health Serv., Phoenix</span>, 3 FLRA 182, 183 (1980); <span class="Italic">see NTEU and EPA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-105.html">72 FLRA 537</a>, 539 (2021) (Chairman DuBester concurring) (provision of a contract that conflicts with a federal statute was unenforceable; failure to abide by it did not constitute a repudiation (citing <span class="Italic">GSA, Washington and NFFE</span>, 50 FLRA 136, 139 (1995)). </p>
<p class="noindent">As to the analysis applied if management repudiates a contract provision (permitting official time for lobbying activities) that is contrary to a statutory provision (prohibiting the use of appropriate funds for lobbying activities), <span class="Italic">Office of Adjutant Gen. and Ga. State Chap., ACT</span>, 54 FLRA 654, 661 (1998), determined that management commits no ULP:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>, 51 FLRA 858, the Authority clarified the analytical framework it will follow for determining whether a party's failure or refusal to honor an agreement constitutes a repudiation of a collective bargaining agreement. Consistent with its previous decision in <span class="Italic">Warner Robins</span>, 40 FLRA at 1218-19, the Authority held that it will examine two elements in analyzing an allegation of repudiation: (1) the nature and scope of the alleged breach of an agreement (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, was the breach clear and patent?); and (2) the nature of the agreement provision allegedly breached (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, did the provision go to the heart of the parties' agreement?). The examination of either element may require an inquiry into the meaning of the agreement provision allegedly breached.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also has held that collective bargaining agreement provisions that are contrary to law are not enforceable under the Statute.&#x2003;Therefore, a respondent's refusal to comply with such a provision it [sic] is not an unlawful repudiation of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">General Services Administration, Washington, D.C.</span>, 50 FLRA 136 (1995) (respondent's refusal to honor portion of agreement that authorized combination of work schedules held not to constitute an unlawful repudiation because agreement portion was contrary to Work Schedules Act); <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, United States Marine Corps</span>, 34 FLRA 635 (1990) (respondent's repudiation of memorandum of understanding that required it to pay for reflective safety vests that were not used in the performance of work held not unlawful as payment for vests was inconsistent with law). The Authority dismisses the unfair labor practice complaints in such cases without regard to whether the law was in existence at the time the agreement was entered into or was enacted subsequent to the agreement's effective date.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VA Outpatient Pharmacy Leavenworth and AFGE Local 85</span>, 60 FLRA 844, 850-52 (2005), involving a change in the workweek to include Saturday work, also pointed out that an agency does not improperly repudiate an agreement if the provision it declines to follow violates law or government-wide regulation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the standard set forth above, we note that in order to constitute a repudiation of a collective bargaining agreement provision, the provision at issue must be a lawful one. An agency's failure to follow an illegal agreement provision does not constitute a repudiation of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Office of the Adjutant Gen., Ga. Dep't of Defense, Atlanta, Ga.</span>, 54 FLRA 654 (1998) (respondent's refusal to honor portion of agreement that authorized the use of official time in order to lobby Congress in a support or opposition to pending or desired legislation held not to be unlawful because the use of such time for such purposes was inconsistent with section 8015 of the 1996 DOD Appropriations Act); <span class="Italic">Gen. Servs. Admin., Wash., D.C.</span>, 50 FLRA 136 (1995) (respondent's refusal to honor portion of agreement that authorized combination of work schedules held not to constitute an unlawful repudiation because agreement portion was contrary to the Work Schedules Act); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, United States Marine Corps</span>, 34 FLRA 635 (1990) (respondent's repudiation of memorandum of understanding that required it to pay for reflective safety vests that were not used in the performance of work held not unlawful as payment for vests was inconsistent with law).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to be lawful, the MOUs in this case must be read in a manner that allows the Respondent to act in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121. The Authority has found previously that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121 is a Government-wide regulation. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1815</span>, 53 FLRA 606, 619 (1997). As set forth therein, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(b)(1) requires that agencies: (1) schedule employees' work so as to accomplish the agency's mission, and (2) schedule administrative workweeks to correspond with actual work requirements. The Authority has held that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(b) is qualified by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a). <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Navy, Phila. Naval Shipyard</span>, 39 FLRA 590, 604 (1991); <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R7-23</span>, 23 FLRA 753, 755-56 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a) explicitly permits an agency to change employees' work schedules without limitation "when the head of an agency determines that the agency would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a). 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a) also provides that the basic workweek should be scheduled on Monday through Friday, when possible. However, it is well established that agencies have discretion to deviate from the basic workweek, as the Respondent sought to do by reinstating Saturday as part of the workweek. <span class="Italic">See Acuna v. United States</span>, 479 F.2d 1356 (Cl. Ct. 1973), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 416 U.S. 905 (1974). Furthermore, as we stated in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Commerce, NOAA, Nat'l Weather Serv</span>., 49 FLRA 1563, 1565 (1994) (<span class="Italic">NOAA</span>), 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;_610.102 provides that the authority to establish employee work schedules may be delegated by agency heads to lower-level officials. We find here, as the Authority did in <span class="Italic">NOAA</span>, that it is reasonable to conclude that agency officials who have been delegated authority to establish work schedules for a particular organizational segment also have authority to make changes in those schedules based on consideration of the effects of schedules on that segment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proposal or provision that does not allow an agency to change employees' work schedules without limitation pursuant to the situations set forth in &#x00A7; 610.121 is contrary to that regulation. <span class="Italic">See IAM &#x0026; AW</span>, 59 FLRA 830, 831-32 (2004) (proposal nonnegotiable that required the agency to schedule, without exception, the third shift basic workweek for five consecutive eight-hour work days, Sunday-Thursday); <span class="Italic">Haw. Fed. Employees Metal Trades Council</span>, 57 FLRA 450, 452 (2001) (proposal nonnegotiable that required the agency to schedule, without exception, certain employees on the fourth day of a five-day process in which it occasionally drydocked nuclear submarines to either begin work at their normal start times or work fourteen hours); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1815</span>, 53 FLRA at 619-20 (provision contrary to law that permitted agency to change work schedules with less than seven days notice only when "there is an emergency that would hamper accomplishment of the mission" because <span id="Page_1284"></span>it precluded changes when costs would be substantially increased).<span class="Italic"> </span>Thus, to the extent the MOUs were interpreted as not allowing the exercise of this authority, the MOUs would be contrary to the regulation and unenforceable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Respondent's actions were consistent with and satisfied the standards of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121, it did not repudiate the MOUs. Consequently, the Respondent did not commit an unfair labor practice, as alleged in the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">An earlier example of appropriate partial repudiation by management of a contract involving a clause that violated a statute is <span class="Italic">GSA and NFFE</span>, 50 FLRA 136, 139 (1995), involving a provision mixing compressed and flexible working schedules, an arrangement that FLRA determined violated a statute:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first sentence of Article 34, Section 6B is contrary to law because it authorizes the combination of work schedules in violation of the Work Schedules Act. As such, it is not enforceable under the Statute and the Respondent's refusal to honor the sentence does not constitute unlawful repudiation<span class="Italic">. See U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, D.C. and Western</span> <span class="Italic">Area Power Administration, Golden, Colorado</span>, 34 FLRA 361, 366 (1990) (as provision allegedly violated by the respondent was inconsistent with law, the respondent did not violate the Statute by failing to adhere to it).</p>
<p class="noindent">In the unusual situation presented by <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, SUPSHIP Newport News and NAIL Local 2</span>, 65 FLRA 1052, 1052-56 (2011) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">NAIL v. FLRA</span>, 680 F.3d 839 (D.C. Cir. 2012), <span class="Italic">post</span>), FLRA concluded there was no ULP when management abrogated an agreement with its union that allocated parking spaces in a manner that improperly infringed on the bargaining rights of another union representing employees of a tenant activity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's employees work at a facility that the Respondent operates (Respondent's facility). The employees of several other components of the Department of the Navy (Agency) also work at the Respondent's facility, and the employees of those other Agency components are referred to as "tenant command" personnel. The Charging Parties--NAIL and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 1 (IFPTE)--are the exclusive representatives of some of the Respondent's employees.<span class="Italic"> </span>The American Federation of Government Employees, Local 53 (AFGE) is the exclusive representative of some of the tenant command personnel who work at the Respondent's facility (AFGE-represented personnel).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent assigns parking privileges to its employees, as well as tenant command personnel, in accordance with procedures in a written instruction. The Respondent invited the Charging Parties to negotiate a revision to the instruction, and the Charging Parties proposed revisions that would, among other things, change the parking privileges of AFGE-represented personnel.<span class="Italic"> </span>After receiving those proposals, the Respondent contacted the Agency component that employs the AFGE-represented personnel--the Fleet Industrial Supply Center, Norfolk (FISC)--to suggest that FISC inform AFGE of the proposed revisions. The Respondent then continued bargaining without further involvement by either FISC or AFGE, and, eventually, the Respondent and the Charging Parties negotiated and signed a revised instruction (Revision J). Under Revision J, the Respondent would first designate eligible parking applicants as members of one of five prioritized "assignment groups," and applicants would then receive parking assignments in the order dictated by their assignment group's priority status. In keeping with the Charging Parties' proposals, Revision J's lowest priority assignment group consisted entirely of tenant command personnel, including AFGE-represented personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Respondent began reallocating spaces under Revision J, it realized that some FISC employees would lose their parking spaces as the result of an unanticipated parking shortage. The Respondent was unsuccessful in obtaining additional spaces, and it informed FISC of the effect that the shortage would have on FISC employees. Thereafter, AFGE sent the Respondent a demand to cease changes to parking at the Respondent's facility in order to afford AFGE an opportunity to bargain with FISC on the matter. The Respondent then notified the Charging Parties that it was not implementing Revision J. The Charging Parties filed ULP charges, and the GC issued a complaint, alleging that the Respondent unlawfully repudiated Revision J.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Judge stated, although unlawfully repudiating a negotiated agreement is contrary to &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute, the "Authority will not find an unlawful repudiation where the agreement allegedly repudiated is contrary to law." <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 60 FLRA at 986 (citing <span class="Italic">Gen. Servs. Admin., Wash., D.C.</span>, 50 FLRA 136, 139 n.7 (1995)) (agency did not unlawfully repudiate agreement if it was contrary to Back Pay Act). Under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1), once a union is certified as the exclusive representative of an appropriate unit of employees, that union has the exclusive right to bargain with respect to the conditions of employment of employees in that certified unit. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2879, AFL-CIO,</span> 49 FLRA 1074, 1087-89 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Local 2879</span>). An agency may not negotiate with one exclusive representative to regulate the conditions of employment for a unit represented by another union because such negotiations would run afoul of the principle of exclusive representation. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 32 v. FLRA,</span> 110 F.3d 810, 815 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (<span class="Italic">Local 32</span>) (unions may not negotiate agreements that "<span class="Italic">govern</span>" the working conditions of employees in other bargaining units or that "b[i]nd" an agency with respect to the rights of those employees). <span class="Italic">Cf. Local R1-109</span>, 61 FLRA at 597 (applying <span class="Italic">Cherry Point </span>to find proposals that "directly determine" conditions of employment for employees in another bargaining unit outside duty to bargain); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 32</span>, 51 FLRA 491, 507-08 (1995) (applying <span class="Italic">Cherry Point </span>to find proposals "directly implicating" employees in other bargaining units outside duty to bargain); <span class="Italic">Local 2879</span>, 49 FLRA at 1088-89 (applying <span class="Italic">Cherry Point </span>to find proposals that "seek to regulate" conditions of employment of employees in another bargaining unit outside duty to bargain).[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;We note that private-sector precedent under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) holds that it is a ULP for parties to apply the terms of a collective bargaining agreement negotiated by one union to employees represented by a different union. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sperry Sys. Mgmt. Div., Sperry Rand Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 492 F.2d 63, 67 n.4 (2d Cir. 1974) ("Demands by a union to represent employees outside the certified uni[t] are unfair labor practices[.]"); <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 69 ("[A]n employer commits [an] unfair labor practice...when it imposes on employees of one unit the contract and bargaining agent of another unit."); <span class="Italic">Local 7-210, Oil, Chemical, &#x0026; Atomic Workers, Int'l Union, AFL-CIO v. Union Tank Car Co.</span>, 475 F.2d 194, 197 (7th Cir. 1973) (under NLRA, employer properly refused to apply union's contract to workers certified as members of another unit with a different bargaining representative).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the GC and Nail, Revision J merely "affects" the conditions of employment of AFGE-represented personnel but does not run afoul of the principle of exclusive recognition. However, the wording of Revision J establishes that it does more than merely affect the conditions of employment of AFGE-represented personnel. In particular, Revision J expressly determines the access of "tenant command" personnel to parking, even though AFGE--the exclusive representative of some of the tenant command personnel--had no part in negotiating the revised instruction. Thus, the above-cited precedent supports a conclusion that Revision J is contrary to &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, Revision J is unlike the proposals discussed in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point, Local 2139, SSA</span>, and <span class="Italic">AFSCME</span>, which the GC cites in support of its exceptions. The GC contends that Revision J is comparable to a hypothetical proposal discussed in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, which would have called for "all parking at [the agency's facility] [to] be reserved for employees" represented by the union making the proposal. <span class="Italic">See Local 32</span>, 110 F.3d at 815 (internal quotation marks omitted) (discussing the hypothetical proposal in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>). As the D.C. Circuit explained in <span class="Italic">Local 32</span>, although the hypothetical proposal in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point </span>would have "severely limited" the parking options available to employees not represented by the proposing union, the proposal would have been lawful because it did not "define [the] parking privileges...for members of other bargaining units[.]" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In a similar manner, the lawful proposal in <span class="Italic">Local 2139 </span>was limited to address only the parking privileges of "bargaining unit employees" represented by that union. 61 FLRA at 654. Revision J, on the other hand, is <span class="Italic">not limited </span>to bargaining unit employees represented by the Charging Parties, and it directly <span class="Italic">defines </span>the parking privileges of AFGE bargaining unit members by expressly identifying "tenant command individuals" as a particular parking "assignment group." As a result, Revision J is not comparable to the hypothetical proposal discussed in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point </span>or the proposal found negotiable in <span class="Italic">Local 2139</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the other decisions cited by the GC, in <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, a proposed ULP remedy required an agency to restore the <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>(<span class="Italic">SQA</span>) with regard to the parking privileges of one group of employees at its facility. <span class="Italic">See </span>58 FLRA at 727. The Authority held that "the fact that the [r]espondent had bargaining obligations with more than one labor organization regarding parking privileges d[id] not justify not imposing an <span class="Italic">SQA</span> order." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>However, the Authority did not authorize the charging party in <span class="Italic">SSA </span>to negotiate an agreement that would directly determine the conditions of employment of other bargaining units, and, thus, <span class="Italic">SSA </span>does not support the GC's exceptions. In <span class="Italic">AFSCME</span>, the Authority applied <span class="Italic">Cherry Point </span>to find that "nothing on the face of th[e] proposal [under consideration] indicates a direct effect on non-unit employees." 53 FLRA at 1338. By contrast, Revision J on its face directly affects employees in a unit other than those represented by the Charging Parties because it expressly identifies them as "tenant command individuals" and then precisely regulates their parking privileges by placing them in a certain parking "assignment group." <span class="Italic">See supra </span>note 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to NAIL's argument that the Judge's decision violates NAIL's &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) rights "to represent employees of [the] Respondent[,]...to negotiate and reach agreement with [the] Respondent, and to have those agreements implemented[,]" the Judge's decision does not prevent <span id="Page_1285"></span>NAIL from reaching lawful agreements with the Respondent regarding the working conditions of employees represented by NAIL. Rather, the decision prevents NAIL from attempting to negotiate or enforce agreements that govern the conditions of employment of a bargaining unit represented by a different exclusive representative. As NAIL does not have &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) rights to negotiate or enforce agreements on behalf of AFGE-represented personnel, <span class="Italic">see Local R1-109</span>, 61 FLRA at 597, the Judge's decision on that point is not inconsistent with &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAIL argues further that the Judge's decision will render meaningless its ability to negotiate agreements on behalf of its members because the Respondent could always refuse to implement them based on the effects they have on other bargaining units. However, the Judge did not find that the Respondent could refuse to implement agreements simply because they "affect" other bargaining units. He found that the Respondent could not lawfully implement agreements negotiated with the Charging Parties that "directly determine, or regulate, the conditions of employment of employees" in other bargaining units. Thus, NAIL's argument is based on a misinterpretation of the Judge's decision and does not provide a basis for finding the decision deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that Revision J directly determines the parking privileges of AFGE-represented personnel, and, consequently, it is inconsistent with the principle of exclusive recognition. <span class="Italic">See Local 32</span>, 110 F.3d at 815; <span class="Italic">Local R1-109</span>, 61 FLRA at 597. Therefore, we deny the exceptions to the Judge's findings that Revision J is contrary to &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) and that, as a result, the Respondent did not unlawfully repudiate Revision J by refusing to implement it.</p>
<p class="noindent">On appeal the D.C. Circuit affirmed the result and reasoning of FLRA, <span class="Italic">NAIL v. FLRA</span>, 680 F.3d 839, 839-40 (D.C. Cir. 2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A Navy Supervisor of Shipbuilding negotiated an agreement with two unions regarding the allocation of parking spaces at a shipyard in Newport News.&#x2003;The agreement governed the parking privileges not only of the employees represented by those two unions, but also of employees represented by a third union that was not a party to the agreement. Under the agreement, employees represented by the two unions that were parties to the agreement received priority in parking over employees represented by the third union. After the Supervisor discovered that employees represented by the third union would be left without any on-site parking, the Supervisor decided not to implement the agreement. The two unions that had negotiated the original agreement objected and filed unfair labor practice charges with the Federal Labor Relations Authority. The FLRA upheld the Supervisor's decision. The case is now before us on petition for review of the FLRA's decision. We deny the petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, an agency generally may not repudiate an agreement negotiated with a union representing agency employees. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (5); <span class="Italic">see also American Federation of Gov't Employees, Local 2924 v. FLRA</span>, 470 F.3d 375, 376-78 (D.C. Cir. 2006). But the FLRA "will not find an unlawful repudiation where the agreement allegedly repudiated is contrary to law." <span class="Italic">National Air Traffic Controllers Ass'n</span>, 60 F.L.R.A. 985, 986 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question here, therefore, is whether the original agreement was contrary to law. Under the relevant precedents, the original agreement was indeed contrary to law because it governed the working conditions of employees in another bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Gov't Employees, Local 32 v. FLRA </span>(<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>), 110 F.3d 810, 815-16 (D.C. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point, North Carolina v. FLRA </span>(<span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>), 952 F.2d 1434, 1441-43 (D.C. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">see also </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1). In <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, which is the precedent most on point, we specifically held that it "would be counter to basic principles of labor law" for a labor agreement to "define[&#8197;] parking privileges not just for members of the union's bargaining unit, but also for members of other bargaining units." <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 110 F.3d at 815 (summarizing <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, 952 F.2d 1434). Here, too, the original agreement between the two unions and the Supervisor defined the parking privileges of members of another bargaining unit. The agreement was thus contrary to law. Therefore, the Supervisor properly refused to implement it, and the FLRA properly upheld the Supervisor's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">DOD, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 40 FLRA 1211, 1220-22 (1991), FLRA announced it would no longer follow its past practice of allowing management to defend a ULP case based on breach of a contract by raising the defense that the provision breached violated management rights. The case arose in the context of management's failure to adhere to a ground rules agreement calling on management to reassign a union official from the night shift to the day shift so he could participate in negotiations. Management defended its actions by contending that the agreement requiring the reassignment violated its right to assign work. Not so, held FLRA, as long as the negotiated arrangement does not abrogate management rights:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Respondent takes the position that the parties' agreement requiring that management place employees chosen as negotiators on the dayshift unlawfully contravenes management's right under section 7106 of the Statute to assign work and to determine the personnel who will carry out the agency's operations. We find no merit in this position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that require management to assign union officials to a specific shift do not violate management's right to assign employees or assign work under section 7106(a)(A) and (B) of the statute....&#8197;However, management has a right, under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute, to determine that it needs a particular individual on a given shift where it can demonstrate that it needs the specific skills of that individual on that shift....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find nothing in the record to support the Respondent's claim that McInvale could not be replaced on the nightshift. On the contrary, the record shows that when shift responsible operators such as McInvale are absent or on vacation, their shift responsibilities can be and have been performed by lesser-graded employees....&#8197;[T]herefore,...the parties' ground rules agreement does not directly interfere with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In any event, even assuming that the requirement that Union representatives be transferred to the dayshift directly interfered with management's right to assign work, we would find the provision enforceable because it would not abrogate management's right. In <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 37 FLRA 309, 313-14 (1990) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span>), we stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">when an agency contends that an arbitrator's award enforcing a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement is contrary to section 7106(a), we will examine the provision enforced by the arbitrator to determine (1) if it constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights, and (2) if, as interpreted by the arbitrator, it abrogates the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also stated in <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span> that we expect that the parties in reaching their agreement will have assessed the effect of the provision on management's rights and the benefits to employees, and that the provision should, therefore, be enforced unless it abrogates a management right. 37 FLRA at 314-15. Although <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span> involved the enforcement of a negotiated agreement by an arbitrator, we find that the same rationale also applies to unfair labor practice cases in which a claim is made that a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement is contrary to section 7106(a). In both types of cases, the question concerns the enforceability of the contractual provision agreed to by the parties. Accordingly, we will apply the test set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span> in unfair labor practice cases where, as here, a claim is made that a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement is contrary to section 7106(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying that test here, we find that the provision at issue is an arrangement for employee Union representatives who are adversely affected when management exercises its right to assign work by assigning those employees duties on particular shifts, thereby limiting their right to serve as negotiators. In particular, the provision mitigates this adverse effect by assuring that employee Union negotiators will be on the dayshift for the duration of negotiations. In our view, the provision does not abrogate the exercise of management's right to assign work. The provision applies only to employees chosen to be Union negotiators and only for the duration of negotiations. The provision does not preclude the assignment of particular duties to employees on various shifts. We also note that the provision does not alter the number of employees who are involved in negotiations or preclude the assignment of other employees to various shifts. In our view, therefore, the provision would be enforceable because it does not abrogate management's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent">An example of management negotiating a contract and experiencing management-rights remorse involved a reporting system for air traffic controllers who were granted immunity from discipline if they promptly reported certain types of operational errors. The reporting system and the immunity it conferred were incorporated into a negotiated agreement. Management decided to rescind the program, over the union's objections. The union filed a grievance that was sustained by an arbitrator who directed the agency to reinstate the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>. On exceptions, FLRA set aside the award. Because 5 USC 7106(a)(2) provided that nothing in the Statute shall affect the authority of an agency to take discipline, no arbitration award may interpret or enforce a provision of a contract so as to deny an agency the authority to exercise its rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute. FLRA concluded that the agency could not waive its right to take disciplinary action because of the exceptions in the immunity program that it decided to rescind. <span class="Italic">PATCO and FAA</span>, 5 FLRA 763, 768-69 (1981). Matters changed with<span class="Italic"> DOD, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 40 FLRA 1211 (1991), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, sustaining awards applying contract provisions negotiated as appropriate arrangements that interfere with but do not abrogate the exercise of management rights.
