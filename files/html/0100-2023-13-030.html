<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-31"><span class="space">h.</span> Discrimination; Intolerable Working Conditions</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the theme was not extensively developed in the court's opinion, it is possible that a downgrade resulting from illegal discrimination could be considered a constructive adverse action even though it was voluntarily accepted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ingram v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 86-1614). The assertions of discrimination must be specific to support jurisdiction over an appeal from an allegedly involuntary downgrading, <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 61, 64-65 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although a reduction in grade can be an adverse action appealable to the Board, the Board is without jurisdiction to review a downgrade that the employee accepted voluntarily. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(1) and (2), 752.401(b)(9); <span class="Italic">Gaudette v. Department of Transportation</span>, 832 F.2d 1256, 1258 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The appellant bears the burden of establishing that the reduction in grade was involuntary and thus within the Board's jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)]. Only if an appellant makes a nonfrivolous allegation that she was coerced into a downgrade, which therefore was involuntary, does she establish entitlement to a jurisdictional hearing. The allegation of involuntariness must be supported by factual assertions indicating that it is not a mere <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> pleading<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hartman v. United States Postal Service</span>, 53 MSPR 565, 567 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, in her petition for appeal, the appellant generally alleged that the agency's management wanted "to get rid of about 60 blacks" and specifically wanted "to get rid of [her]" because of her "medical handicap" and because she was "considered now a troublemaker." She also stated, however, that her union representative told her that she would be terminated if she did not accept a downgrade; she further stated that the union representative dictated the content of her demotion request. With her appeal, she enclosed copies of the routing slip containing her acceptance of the demotion in order to maintain a permanent position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not alleged, however, and the submissions do not establish, that she had no alternative to accepting the demotion. We find that the appellant's allegations of discrimination, especially when considered with record evidence showing that she was having performance difficulties and requested a downgrade in order to avoid possible removal, are too general to establish that she had no alternative but to request the downgrade. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Collins v. Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Logistics Agency,</span> 55 MSPR 185, 190 (1992) (where employee did not make allegations specifying particular acts of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation directed toward her, she failed to allege sufficient specific facts which, if true, would have shown that she had no alternative to resignation; thus she did not make a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness and was not entitled to a jurisdictional hearing), <span class="Italic">modified in part by</span> <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. United States Postal Service,</span> 60 MSPR 325 (1994). The fact that the appellant faced the unpleasant alternative of possible removal does not rebut the presumed voluntariness of her choice. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Schultz v. U.S. Navy,</span> 810 F.2d 1133, 1136-37 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant does no more than generally reiterate her contention that she was the victim of discrimination. Her generalized allegations, however, are insufficient to show that the agency coerced her or otherwise obtained her acceptance of the demotion through duress or misinformation. Since the appellant has not presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of voluntariness, we have no jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Collins,</span> 55 MSPR at 190.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kelly v. MSPB</span>, 602 Fed. Appx. 831, 833-834 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP) (reduction in grade or pay: "[d]iscrimination can be found without evidence that the discriminatory conduct related to Mr. Kelly's decision to accept reassignment, or that the discriminatory conduct was so serious as to compel him to take <span id="Page_1931"></span>reassignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Conforto v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we find unpersuasive the appellant's assertion that the real basis for her demotion was religious discrimination. When an appellant raises an allegation of discrimination in connection with a claim of involuntariness, the allegation may be addressed only insofar as it relates to the issue of voluntariness. <span class="Italic">Markon v. Department of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 578 (1996). Thus, evidence of discrimination goes to the ultimate question of coercion, i.e., whether under all of the circumstances, working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to request a demotion. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on review that she was subjected to religious slurs and that her manager subjected her to religious counseling sessions. In the initial decision, the administrative judge found that the preponderance of the evidence established that the appellant's second-line supervisor, Steve Bonnemort, made an inappropriate religious comment during a spring 2010 staff meeting. However, the administrative judge found that, contrary to the appellant's allegations, the record did not establish that Bonnemort made a similar remark in September 2010. The appellant does not provide a basis to disturb this finding on review. Further, the appellant does not present evidence or argument in support of her claim that her manager subjected her to religious counseling sessions other than to state that she was counseled on relating to people of different religions. While the appellant's work environment may have caused her stress, she has not presented sufficient evidence that would establish that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to accept the demotion under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Cf. Miller v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 32 (2000) (difficult or unpleasant working conditions are generally not so intolerable as to compel a reasonable person to resign).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant raises allegations of discrimination in connection with an involuntariness claim, evidence of discrimination may be considered only in terms of the standard for voluntariness in a particular situation, not whether such evidence meets the test for proof of discrimination established under Title VII. <span class="italic">Markon v. Department of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 578 (1996). In other words, even if the agency's actions are discriminatory, the appellant still must show how those actions coerced the action at issue. <span class="italic">Tripp v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 458, 461 (1993). The appellant has not presented evidence in support of her claim that her nonselection for the positions she applied for prior to accepting the Air Traffic Assistant position was as a result of discrimination, nor has she presented evidence to establish that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to accept the Air Traffic Assistant position following the nonselections. <span class="italic">See Loredo v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 118 M.S.P.R. 686, &#x00B6; 8 (2012) (concluding that the appellant had not presented sufficient evidence of religious discrimination that would establish that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to accept the demotion under the circumstances).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">After his compensable injury on September 5, 1991, the appellant served in part-time flexible PS-5 Distribution Clerk positions at the agency's Middleboro and Plymouth, Massachusetts facilities performing limited duties. It is unclear whether the agency formally reassigned him to these positions. The record indicates that he was moved from the Middleboro facility to the Plymouth facility because of a lack of suitable work. On June 1, 1993, the appellant wrote to Injury Compensation Specialist Jimmy Ulicnik to request a "more productive position working full time with the Postal Service." The appellant suggested one of the five vacant positions operating an MPLSM machine at the agency's Buzzard Bay Post Office. He also expressed an interest in positions as a Window Clerk or Junior Entrance Level Supervisor and included his doctor's current orders. On June 15, 1993, the agency informed him that his limited duty position was being changed to a limited duty Custodian position at the Mansfield Post Office for thirty days and then on July 29, 1993, the agency offered him the part-time flexible PS-4 Custodian position in Mansfield. On August 20, 1993, the appellant accepted the position. The record contains no indication that the appellant initiated the demotion. <span class="Italic">See Smitka v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 MSPR 680, 686-90 (1995) (the demotions that the appellants requested and accepted to avoid possible reassignment requiring geographic relocation as a result of the agency's nationwide restructuring were voluntary); <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 61, 64-65 (1994) (a demotion that the appellant requested to avoid a possible removal was voluntary).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, a reduction in grade that an employee accepts voluntarily is also not within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Hartman v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 53 MSPR 565, 567 (1992). If the appellant can establish that he accepted the demotion to avoid a threatened removal and if he can further show that the agency knew or should have known that the removal could not be substantiated, then the demotion may be considered coerced and therefore involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant challenges on petition for review the administrative judge's finding that the appellant made no such showing of involuntariness. The appellant contended below that the agency threatened to remove him. The agency determined that the appellant was physically unable to perform the essential duties of his PS-5 Distribution Clerk position. It could have taken a removal action against him on that basis. In any such action, however, the appellant could have asserted an affirmative defense of disability discrimination. A <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination includes, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, an articulation of a "reasonable accommodation." <span class="Italic">Casillas v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 64 MSPR 627, 631 (1994). An agency's obligation to accommodate an employee with a disability includes reassignment to a vacant position at the same grade or level the essential functions of which the appellant can perform. If a position at the same grade or level is not vacant, an offer of reassignment to the highest available grade or level below the employee's current or level is required. 29 CFR 1614.203(g); <span class="Italic">Phillips v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 67 MSPR 74, 77 (1995). The appellant was already serving in a PS-5 level position, although we are unable to determine the nature of his appointment to that position. The record contains no indication that he could not perform the essential duties of that position. The record also contains no explanation for the agency's failure to permit the appellant to remain in that limited duty position. In that regard, we note that an agency is not obligated to accommodate a disabled employee by permanently assigning him to light-duty tasks when those tasks do not comprise a complete and separate position. <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 60 MSPR 97, 100 (1993). Nevertheless, based on the claims by the appellant and the documentary evidence before the administrative judge, we find that these circumstances constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency coerced the appellant to accept a demotion to the PS-4 Custodian position. If the appellant is able to prove 1) that the agency threatened to remove him, 2) that he is a qualified disabled employee entitled to a reasonable accommodation, and 3) that the agency would not accommodate his disability, then he will have proven that his demotion was coerced. <span class="Italic">See generally Tripp v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 59 MSPR 458, 461 (1993). Thus, since the appellant's allegations are plausible and are not frivolous given the evidence of record, he is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we find that the appellant's argument below, that his change to the PS-4 Custodian position was an involuntary demotion appealable to the Board based on the agency's misrepresentations regarding his continued receipt of Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) benefits, is without merit. According to the appellant, the agency incorrectly informed him that his OWCP benefits would be terminated if he refused the PS-4 Custodian position. The administrative judge found that the agency did not misrepresent the facts that, under 5 USC 8106(c)(2), as a partially recovered employee, the appellant's compensation for a work-related injury could be terminated if he refused the position and that the agency stated that his benefits would be "jeopardized." On petition for review, the appellant challenges the administrative judge's finding that the agency told him that his benefits would be "jeopardized." According to the appellant's sworn statement, the agency told him that his OWCP benefits would be "terminated," a more definite statement, and that that statement was misleading because the agency has no authority to terminate OWCP benefits. We find that whether the agency used the term "jeopardized" or "terminated" is not material to the issue of the involuntariness of the appellant's acceptance of the PS-4 Custodian position. The appellant had been dealing with OWCP for 2 years by <span id="Page_1932"></span>this time. He knew or should have known that only OWCP and not his agency had authority to grant, deny, or terminate his OWCP benefits. Moreover, the appellant signed an August 20, 1993 Rehabilitation Interview Checklist which included the statement, "I understand that refusal of a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> position offer may result in termination or reduction of compensation benefits by the OWCP." Therefore, he should have understood the agency's statement to mean that OWCP might terminate his benefits. That statement was not misleading, as the administrative judge found.</p>

The appellant objected to the demotion, but finally accepted the position while alleging "duress and threat of disciplinary action."

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was clearly faced with two unpleasant alternatives; she could reject the position offered by the agency and face possible removal, or she could accept the demotion. However, this choice between unpleasant alternatives did not render the appellant's decision involuntary. <span class="Italic">Lee</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. at 406.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McAlexander v. DOD</span>, 105 MSPR 384, 385-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-16, 2007 MSPB 103 (2007), involved what the Board appeared to characterize as an allegation of a constructive downgrading. The appellant sought review from an arbitrator's award. The determinative issue was whether the agency discriminated against the appellant when it reassigned him to an administrative job in a different pay system, with retained pay, because the agency concluded that the appellant's hearing loss prevented him from properly filling the position as a police officer. The Board concluded that the agency properly assessed the impact of the hearing loss on the job; the reassignment was not the product of disability discrimination and the reassignment was not constructively adverse:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is employed by the Pentagon Force Protection Agency, Department of Defense. He was originally hired as a Police Officer in January 2002 by the Defense Protective Service, which was subsequently absorbed by the Pentagon Force Protection Agency. In January 2004, the agency issued a new Medical Standards Manual, which established new medical standards for all Police Officers. In particular, the new Medical Standards Manual set forth a new, more stringent hearing requirement for Police Officers. After medical examinations revealed that the appellant's hearing did not meet the new standards, the agency initially proposed his removal for failure to meet the required medical standards for his position as an AD-07 Police Officer. However, effective July 9, 2005, the agency reassigned him to a non-law enforcement position as a GS-07 Office Support Assistant, with retained pay, and rescinded the notice of proposed removal. The appellant, through his union, grieved the agency's decision to "remove" him from his former position. After the agency denied the grievance, the appellant challenged the agency's action before an arbitrator and alleged that he was wrongfully "removed." After a hearing, the arbitrator denied the appellant's grievance, finding that the agency acted lawfully when it declined to waive its hearing requirement for the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant then sought Board review of the arbitration award under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). He argued that he has performed, and in the future could perform, all of his Police Officer duties successfully. According to the appellant, the agency violated an Office of Personnel Management regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.204, by not waiving its hearing standard for him. He also argued that the agency committed disability discrimination by deciding to remove him from his Police Officer position without <span id="Page_1933"></span>conducting an "individualized assessment," as described in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC's) regulations at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r), to determine whether he posed a "direct threat" to the safety of himself or others in the Police Officer position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's request for review characterized the agency's action as a removal from his Police Officer position. However, based on documents that the appellant submitted with his request for review, it appeared that the appellant was reassigned, not removed. The Board therefore issued a show-cause order informing the parties that the Board may not have jurisdiction over the request for review and directing the parties to address whether: (1) The appellant's reassignment was voluntary; and (2) the appellant's reassignment resulted in an appealable reduction in grade or pay. Both parties responded to the show-cause order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction to review an arbitrator's award under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) where the subject matter of the grievance is one over which the Board has jurisdiction, the appellant has alleged discrimination as stated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) in connection with the underlying action, and a final decision has been issued. <span class="Italic">De Bow v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 5, &#x00B6; 4 (2004). The appellant has the burden of establishing by preponderant evidence that the Board has jurisdiction over his request for review. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)]; <span class="Italic">see McClain v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 93, 95 (1993). A claim of discrimination may be raised for the first time in a request for review of an arbitrator's decision; it need not have been raised before the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Navy</span>, 898 F.2d 133, 135 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has alleged discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) and the arbitrator has issued a final decision, satisfying prongs two and three of the jurisdictional test. However, despite the characterization by the appellant and the arbitrator of the underlying action as a "removal," the appellant clearly has not been removed. Instead, he has been reassigned to the position of Office Support Assistant with retained pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board generally does not have jurisdiction over reassignments. <span class="Italic">See Marcheggiani v. Department of Defense</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 212, &#x00B6; 7 (2001) (ordinarily, the Board lacks jurisdiction over reassignments that do not result in a loss of grade or pay). The Board does have jurisdiction over agency actions that result in a reduction in pay, however. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(4). And when an employee is reassigned from a position under one pay system to a position with a lower rate of basic pay under a different pay system and given retained pay but not retained grade, he has suffered a reduction in pay. <span class="Italic">Goldberg v. Department of Transportation</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6; 7 (2004). Such an action must be involuntary, however, to be appealable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A reduction in pay or grade that an employee accepts voluntarily is not within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; <span class="Italic">O'Connell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 438, 443 (1996). But if the appellant can establish that he accepted a reduction in pay or grade to avoid a threatened removal, and if he can further show that the agency knew or should have known that the removal could not be substantiated, then the decision to accept the reassignment in lieu of removal may be considered coerced and therefore involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Goldberg</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">O'Connell</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 443. If, as the appellant claims, the agency's decision to propose his removal was the product of disability discrimination, then his reassignment in lieu of removal could be deemed involuntary, thereby providing a basis for exercising jurisdiction. Thus, this case, although technically dealing with the Board's "jurisdiction" over a request for review of an arbitration award, is like many constructive removal cases in which the substantive issue at the "jurisdictional" stage is whether the agency committed unlawful discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (discrimination issues may be considered in determining jurisdiction in mixed constructive adverse action cases insofar as they illuminate involuntariness).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's determination that the appellant was no longer qualified to occupy the Police Officer position was based on his failure to satisfy a qualification standard of that position. An employer may lawfully exclude an individual from a job on the basis of a qualification standard that tends to screen out individuals with disabilities as long as the standard is job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12113(a). The agency describes its mission as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In response to the terrorist attack against the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, the Department of Defense established the Pentagon Force Protection Agency (PFPA). The new agency absorbed the Pentagon's police force, formerly known as the Defense Protective Service (DPS), and its role of providing basic law enforcement and security for Pentagon and DoD interests in the National Capitol Region (NCR).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">PFPA expanded that mission to provide force protection against the full spectrum of potential threats through robust prevention, preparedness, detection, and response measures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> <a href="http://www.pfpa.mil/about.html">http://www.pfpa.mil/about.html</a>. The position description for the appellant's former Police Officer position states, "The incumbent must be in a constant state of physical readiness and must be capable of demonstrating maximum physical exertion without warning. Any hesitancy, reluctance, or inability to fully engage in a critical situation that requires full-unrestricted physical capabilities could have tragic, if not fatal, consequences." At the arbitration hearing, the agency provided the following unrebutted testimony of Woodrow Kusse, the Deputy Chief of the Pentagon Police Department, to explain why the agency's minimum hearing level requirement for its Police Officers is job-related and necessary:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The operation of police vehicles under hazardous conditions would require the operator to have the ability, not just under normal traffic situations, to discriminate whether a sound or a warning was coming from the right or the left, but specifically under emergency conditions, where you're operating with the siren and the radio or the public address system, that could be compounded [sic] by a hearing deficit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Identifying, safeguarding, and preserving evidence could include spoken words if an utterance or a statement made by a subject or a witness. That might be compromised by a hearing problem.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]dentifying objects from great distances....specifically at night when sounds are amplified, where you need to be more attuned to those sounds and where they're coming from, I believe that would be compromised by a hearing deficit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">And then...performing safety-related duties and providing emergency services. You would have to be able to clearly hear instructions as well as orders that are given or utterances that may come from a victim or a witness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the agency's mission and the specific functions of a Police Officer, we find that the agency's auditory acuity qualification standard is manifestly job-related and consistent with business necessity. This, however, does not dispose of the appellant's discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing the EEOC's regulation at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r), the appellant argues that the agency could not lawfully remove him from his Police Officer position without first conducting an "individualized assessment" of whether he would pose a "direct threat" to the safety of himself or others if he remained in the position. The EEOC's "direct threat" analysis was at issue in <span class="Italic">Boots v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6; 8 (2005). In <span class="Italic">Boots</span>, the Board held that the Postal Service acted lawfully when it excluded an individual who took anti-seizure medication from driving a tractor-trailer, based on the agency's adoption of the Department of Transportation's qualification standards for truck drivers. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-18. The Board disagreed with the EEOC's view that the Postal Service could exclude Mr. Boots from the truck driver job only if it showed that he posed a "direct threat." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Boots</span> case went to a Special Panel to resolve the split between the EEOC and the Board. The Special Panel deferred to the EEOC's decision. <span class="Italic">See Boots v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 513, &#x00B6; 26 (2005) (Special Panel). The Special Panel adopted the EEOC's decision, holding that an employer may not rely on a "safety-based" qualification standard to exclude an individual from a job without conducting an "individualized assessment" demonstrating that the individual would pose a "direct threat" to the safety of himself or others. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11, 26-27. The Special Panel found that the EEOC's decision was exclusively based on discrimination law, namely, regulations implementing Title I of the ADA, including 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r) (defining the term "direct threat"), section 1630.15(b) and (c) (the "business necessity" and "direct threat" defenses) and section 1630.15(e) (the "conflict with Federal laws" defense), and the Interpretive Guidance accompanying those regulations, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, 29 C.F.R. pt. 1630, app. &#x00A7; 1630.15(b), (c) and (e). <span class="Italic">Boots</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 513, &#x00B6; 19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the Special Panel in <span class="Italic">Boots</span>, the Board must defer to the EEOC's interpretation of the ADA's "direct threat" defense. The next question, then, is whether the agency in this case has performed an "individualized assessment" establishing that the appellant would pose a "direct threat" to the safety of himself or others if he remained in a Police Officer position. As detailed below, we find that it has.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator credited the testimony of the agency's occupational audiologist, Dr. Lynn Cook, who specializes in the "acoustical environment" of law enforcement work and "the hearing abilities that are required" to perform such work. According to Dr. Cook, the appellant is "at risk for failure to recognize, discriminate, localize, and react appropriately to a variety of auditory stimuli." Dr. Cook also found that the appellant would have "significant difficulty recognizing and discriminating speech as well as other auditory signals, particularly in the presence of background noise." As the arbitrator found, Dr. Cook opined that the appellant would be at a "greater than normal risk of being injured or of injuring others because of background noises he had missed or misunderstood in critical situations," and that there were no hearing aids that could satisfactorily correct his hearing deficit. Dr. Cook concluded that the appellant could not safely perform the full range of duties of a Police Officer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1934"></span>Although Dr. Cook did not examine the appellant herself, her opinion is based on reports from two audiologists who did examine him. Thus, her assessment is "individualized"; it was not a summary determination that he should be excluded from the Police Officer job merely because he failed the hearing test. The Board's review of an arbitration decision is limited and deferential, and the arbitrator's determination to credit Dr. Cook's testimony was "within the discretion of the arbitrator." <span class="Italic">See De Bow</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 5, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6. Dr. Cook's opinion that the appellant cannot "safely perform" the duties of a Police Officer, when considered alongside the agency's mission and the responsibilities that it places on Police Officers, is equivalent to a finding that the appellant would pose a "direct threat" to the safety of himself or others if allowed to remain in a Police Officer position. Accordingly, the appellant's acceptance of a clerical position cannot be considered a legally involuntary result of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argued that the agency should have waived its hearing requirement pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.204. RRF, Tab 1 at 19-21. That regulation, promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management, provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Agencies must waive a medical standard or physical requirement established under this part when there is sufficient evidence that an applicant or employee, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential duties of the position without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.204. The arbitrator expressly found that the agency acted properly in denying a waiver under section 339.204. The appellant has presented no persuasive argument for disturbing the arbitrator's conclusion, which is entitled to deference. Thus, again, the appellant's acceptance of a clerical position after being told that he could not remain as a Police Officer cannot be deemed legally involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In conclusion, assuming for purposes of analysis that the appellant is disabled, we conclude that he has failed to show that his reassignment was involuntary. We therefore find that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the instant request for review and DISMISS it for lack for jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What the Board described as allegations of unpleasant working conditions that the appellant feared might lead to job action against him did not qualify as nonfrivolous allegations of involuntariness sufficient to warrant a hearing in a constructive demotion appeal, <span class="Italic">Silva v. DOJ,</span> AT-0752-15-0028-I-1 (NP 6/5/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's initial pleading implicated coercion, alleging that his demotion was involuntary due to the agency's "constant harassment and berating" of him over the 4 months leading up to his request for a reduction in grade because he is not an African American. With the allegation, the appellant included the final agency decision on his complaint of discrimination finding that the record did not support his claim that he was subjected to a hostile work environment or constructively demoted because of his race.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, although the appellant alleged that his demotion was involuntary, the information he provided merely describes a stressful and unpleasant situation, in which he felt unfairly criticized and worried that he might be subjected to future discipline. We agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that those claims, even if true, are not the type that would cause a reasonable employee in the same circumstances to feel forced into requesting a demotion. <span class="Italic">See generally Miller v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 32 (2000) (an employee is not guaranteed a working environment free of stress, unfair criticism, or unpleasant working conditions). Therefore, the appellant's claims do not amount to nonfrivolous allegations of involuntariness. <span class="Italic">Compare Baldwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 392, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-20 (2008) (appellant's allegations that the agency unjustifiably threatened him with discipline and conducted unwarranted investigations targeting him did not amount to nonfrivolous allegations that he was coerced into resigning), <span class="Italic">with Harris</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 239, &#x00B6; 11 (appellant was entitled to a jurisdictional hearing based upon an allegation that she accepted a reduction in grade under the threat of a removal action that the agency knew or should have known could not be substantiated); <span class="Italic">Swinford v. Department of Transportation</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 433, &#x00B6; 15 (2007) (appellant was entitled to a jurisdictional hearing based upon an allegation that he retired only after his supervisor threatened to abolish his job, threatened to make things difficult if he did not retire, placed him on a performance improvement plan 2 weeks after becoming eligible for retirement, and denied his requested sick leave).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant asserts a successful case of an involuntary downgrading, the AJ must adjudicate the merits of any discrimination claims properly included in the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rivas v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 489, 495 (1993). [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-19-001.html#sec12-1">Chapter 12</a> for decisions involving discrimination and reasonable accommodation.]</p>
