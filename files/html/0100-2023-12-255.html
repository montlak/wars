<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 1201.155 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Requests for review of arbitrators' decisions</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Source and applicability</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Under paragraph (d) of 5 U.S.C. 7121, an employee who believes he or she has been subjected to discrimination within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1), and who may raise the matter under either a statutory procedure such as 5 U.S.C. 7701 or under a negotiated grievance procedure, must make an election between the two procedures. The election of the negotiated grievance procedure "in no manner prejudices" the employee's right to request Board review of the final decision pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7702. Subsection (a)(1) of section 7702 provides that, "[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law," when an employee who has been subjected to an action that is appealable to the Board and who alleges that the action was the result of discrimination within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1), the Board will decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures under section 7701.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;This section does not apply to employees of the Postal Service or to other employees excluded from the coverage of the Federal labor management laws at chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">When filed</span>. The appellant's request for Board review must be filed within 35 days after the date of issuance of the decision or, if the appellant shows that he or she received the decision more than 5 days after the date of issuance, within 30 days after the date the appellant received the decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The review petition should be filed by the employee. The union, to have standing to pursue review with the Board, should be designated by the employee as his or her representative for that purpose. If the union seeks review without a designation, the Board notifies the union of the necessity for a designation. The designation, even if received by the Board after the time allowed for filing the review petition, validates an otherwise timely review petition. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. ITC</span>, 74 MSPR 349, 353-54 (1997). Previously, Board regulations allowed 25 days to file a request for review of an arbitrator's decision with Board headquarters. The regulatory period for Board review of regional decisions is inapplicable. <span class="Italic">Henderson v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 101, 104 n.2 (1989); 5 CFR 1201.155 (2022). The Board may grant extensions of time to file requests for review of an arbitration award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Benson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 548, 552 (1994). If the review request is filed with a Board field or regional office, instead of with the Clerk of the Board, the request is deemed filed when it is filed with the field or regional office. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Keller v. Dept. of Army</span>, 113 MSPR 557, 558-59 &#x00B6; 4, 2010 MSPB 81 (2010).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Review is initiated of a final arbitration award (decision), not a subsidiary <span id="Page_1838"></span>ruling--a ruling on one issue through summary judgment--<span class="Italic">Avent v. Dept. of Labor</span>, CB-7121-14-0008-V-1 (NP 9/10/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the agency's argument to the contrary, our precedent does not support a requirement that an appellant request review within 35 days of an arbitrator's denial of summary judgment. In making its argument, the agency relies on <span class="Italic">Brookens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 678, &#x00B6; 12 n.*. However, in <span class="Italic">Brookens</span> the Board determined that the arbitrator had issued two separate and final award decisions, with different case numbers, relating to different grievances. <span class="Italic">Brookens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 678, &#x00B6; 5. Accordingly, the Board required that the employee separately establish jurisdiction over and timeliness of each request for review. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 12 n.*. In contrast, the arbitrator here merely denied the appellant's motion for summary judgment on August 5, 2013. He did not issue a final arbitration decision until February 11, 2014. Until the arbitrator issued a final decision, the Board lacked jurisdiction over any aspect of the case, including the appellant's due process argument. <span class="Italic">See Brookens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 678, &#x00B6; 4 (listing this requirement among the jurisdictional elements).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant shows she received an arbitration award more than five days after the date of issuance, she may file a request for review with the Board within 30 days after the date she received the decision. 5 CFR 1201.155(b) (2022). The appellant must, however, supply evidence concerning the timing of the receipt of the award through an affidavit either from herself or from her representative. Representatives' statements in pleadings as to the date an arbitration award was received do not constitute evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hutchinson v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 91 MSPR 31, 33-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7 (2001) (discounting as bases for an excused delay the appellant's unfamiliarity with Board procedures, the illness of a former representative, and acquisition of a new representative).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an employee receives an initial decision from an MSPB AJ, that decision will have a notice of the right to file a petition for review and the time for that petition to be filed. An arbitrator's award ordinarily would not include a notice of appeal rights. (Arbitrators may be charged with knowledge, constructive or otherwise, of MSPB law, but they are not required by any regulation or statute to provide particular procedural information in their awards.) The employee (or the employee's representative) is responsible for determining how and when and where to challenge an objectionable arbitration award.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">An example of the Board's treatment of what it found to be an untimely request for review of an award is <span class="Italic">Spann v. SSA</span>, CB-7121-11-0002-V-1 (NP 5/23/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 27, 2010, the arbitrator dismissed the appellant's grievance of her demotion as untimely. That same date, the arbitrator mailed his decision to the agency and the appellant's union representatives. The Clerk of the Board issued an acknowledgment order stating that the appellant's request for review appeared untimely and directing the appellant to show good cause for her delay (and provided the Board's form "Motion to Accept Filing as Timely or to Waive the Time Limit"). The appellant, represented by counsel, filed a response, as did the agency. The appellant's sole explanation for her filing delay is her claim that she did not receive a copy of the arbitrator's decision until June 28, 2010. The appellant maintains that she repeatedly called the arbitrator's office, but she only got the voice mail system. She further maintains that she repeatedly called the union seeking a copy of the decision, but the union did not provide her with a copy until June 28, 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A request for review must be filed within 35 days after the date of issuance of the arbitrator's decision, or, if the appellant received the arbitrator's decision more than 5 days after it was issued, within 30 days after the date that she received the arbitrator's decision. <span class="Italic">See Fain v. Department of Education</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 5 (2005); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(d). The appellant bears the burden of proof regarding the timeliness of her filing. <span class="Italic">Jacks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 355, &#x00B6; 5 (2010). The Board will waive a filing deadline only upon a showing of good cause for the delay. <span class="Italic">Treacy v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 46, &#x00B6; 9 (2010). To establish good cause for an untimely filing, a party must show that she exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See Wright v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6; 6 (2010); <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's contentions are ultimately unpersuasive. At the outset, the Board presumes that documents placed in the mail will be received in 5 days. <span class="Italic">See Lagreca v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 6 (2010). The appellant has presented nothing to undermine this presumption, which suggests that her union representative received a copy of the decision by May 2, 2010, or no later than May 3, 2010. <span class="Italic">See also Fain</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 5 (the appellant constructively received the decision when her representative did). Thus, the period for filing an appeal began to run no later than May 3, 2010, and this period was not extended by any further delay in the appellant receiving a copy of the decision. <span class="Italic">See Lagreca</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 6. That the union representative may have failed to send the appellant a copy in a timely manner does not change this result. <span class="Italic">See Mauldin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 513, &#x00B6; 13 (2011) (an appellant is responsible for his representative's errors and such errors do not provide good cause to justify a delay); <span class="Italic">Lambright v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 507, &#x00B6; 7 (2010) (same). The appellant did not file her appeal until approximately 48 days after the deadline for a request for review. <span class="Italic">See generally Lambright</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 507, &#x00B6; 7 (a 7-week delay is not minimal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, even if we accepted the appellant's explanation, she would still have failed to show due diligence. The appellant concedes that she received the arbitrator's decision on June 28, 2010, yet she delayed nearly a month in filing her appeal. <span class="Italic">See Walker v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 261, &#x00B6; 8 (2009) (the appellant failed to show due diligence by delaying 30 days in contacting the Board after he learned the initial decision had issued and the time to file a petition for review had passed).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Review was denied in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. SSA</span>, CB-7121-22-0006-V-1 (NP 5/4/2023) for lack of timely resort to the Board. Considered in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> was whether the appellant was on notice of the time limits for seeking review:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, an agency's failure to notify an employee of her Board appeal rights when such notification is required generally constitutes good cause for late filing. <span class="Italic">Kirkland</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 74, &#x00B6; 6. The Board has also made clear that the agency's notice must be explicit and must, among other things, inform the employee "[w]hether there is any right to request Board review of a final decision on a grievance in accordance with" the provisions governing requests for Board review of arbitrators' decisions. <span class="Italic">McCurn v. Department of Defense</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 226, &#x00B6; 11 (2013); <span class="Italic">Kirkland</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 74, &#x00B6; 8.[3] Thus, when an agency provides inadequate notice of Board appeal rights, the appellant is not required to show that she exercised due diligence in attempting to discover her appeal rights but rather must show diligence in filing the appeal after learning that she could. McCurn, 119 M.S.P.R. 226, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13; Kirkland, 119 M.S.P.R. 74, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;As noted in <span class="Italic">McCurn</span>, the Board revised its regulations after <span class="Italic">Kirkland</span> was issued, but the revision did not change an agency's obligation to explicitly inform an appellant of her right to request Board review of an arbitration decision within 35 days of issuance. <span class="Italic">McCurn</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 226, &#x00B6; 11 n.5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike in <span class="Italic">McCurn</span> and <span class="Italic">Kirkland</span>, the agency explicitly advised the <span id="Page_1839"></span>appellant in its removal decision of her right to request review of the final arbitration decision on her grievance to the Board. Specifically, the removal decision provides a roadmap for pursuing a grievance raising a claim of illegal discrimination from the pre-arbitration stage through a request for Board review. Thus, the appellant cannot establish that good cause exists for her untimeliness based on the agency's failure to notify her of her right to request review of the arbitration decision with the Board.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">McCurn</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 226, &#x00B6; 11 n.6, the Board made clear that its regulations do not impose on arbitrators an obligation to notify appellants of their right to further appeal in matters subject to Board review. Consequently, the arbitrator's failure to provide such notice here also does not establish good cause for the appellant's untimely filing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, to whatever extent the appellant appears to allege that her union representative's failure to notify her of her right to request review of the arbitration decision with the Board is the cause of her untimeliness, it is well settled that an appellant is responsible for the errors of her chosen representative. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Miller v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 258, &#x00B6; 11 (2008); <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1981); <span class="Italic">cf. McCurn</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 226, &#x00B6; 13 (acknowledging the well-settled principle that an appellant is responsible for the errors of his representative and clarifying that the critical issue in that case was not the appellant's attorney's failure to inform the appellant of his Board appeal rights but the agency's failure to give the appellant proper notice of his right to request review of the arbitration decision before the Board). Aside from her bare assertion that she was misled regarding the next steps after the arbitration decision, the appellant has not provided any additional evidence or argument suggesting that her untimeliness was the product of deception, negligence, or malfeasance by her representative. <span class="Italic">See Hamilton v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 384, &#x00B6; 13 (2012) (finding that the appellant's claim of receiving misguided advice from his attorney was unpersuasive because he is responsible for the errors of his chosen representative); <span class="Italic">cf. Pacilli v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 526, &#x00B6; 13 (explaining that, although an appellant generally is responsible for the errors of his chosen representative, an exception may lie when the appellant establishes that her diligent efforts to prosecute an appeal were thwarted without her knowledge by her attorney's deceptions, negligence, or malfeasance), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 404 F. App'x 466 (Fed. Cir. 2010).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 7702(f) the Board waives the regulatory filing period if, regardless of his reasons, an appellant mistakenly files with the wrong agency, e.g., EEOC, rather than with the Board. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Army</span>, 57 MSPR 203, 208 (1993) (relying on <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Army</span>, 987 F.2d 1552 (Fed.

When the agency advised the appellant in writing that he could appeal an arbitration decision to the EEOC, to court, or to the MSPB, and when the appellant acted to bring the case to the Board soon after EEOC notified him of his right to seek Board review, the appellant could not be said to have consciously elected the EEOC as a forum. The agency later corrected its advice, but by then the appellant was awaiting a decision from EEOC and he was justified in awaiting that decision rather than abandoning his case at EEOC and seeking immediate Board review. <span class="Italic">Moore v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 55 MSPR 451, 455-57 (1992). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-12-198.html#sec5-197">Filing PFR With Wrong Agency or MSPB Office</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Access to Board regulations does not mean that a petition to review an arbitration award is untimely when the filing period is missed but there are other circumstances causing confusion as to the correct filing date, <span class="Italic">Cosio v. MSPB</span>, 36 F.3d 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board dismissed Cosio's appeal as untimely, concluding that she had failed to exercise due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of her case<span class="Italic">. See Alonzo v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force</span>, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980). The board found that the agency properly notified Cosio of her appeal rights because it provided a copy of the board's regulations with her notice of removal. The board's regulations prescribed the deadline for filing a request for review of an arbitrator's decision. Further, the board found that the erroneous belief of Cosio's representative that the appeal should be filed at the FLRA within thirty-five days did not excuse the lateness in filing. In this regard, the board noted that a petitioner is responsible for the inactions of her representative....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review is limited to whether the board's decision not to waive the regulatory time limit was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law. <span class="Italic">Rowe</span> <span class="Italic">v. MSPB</span>, 802 F.2d 434, 437 (Fed. Cir. 1986). "[W]hether the regulatory time limit for an appeal should be waived based upon a showing of good cause is a matter committed to the board's discretion and this court will not substitute its own judgment for that of the Board." <span class="Italic">Mendoza v.

Here, the record indicates that the board considered each of Cosio's assertions and found no excuse adequate to show good cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, a relevant document, <span class="Italic">viz</span>., the Master Agreement between the union and the agency, did provide, albeit erroneously, that review could be had by filing within thirty-five days at the FLRA. Cosio did file her petition within that thirty-five day period at the proper tribunal, the board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We fail to see why a timely filing made in reasonable reliance on and in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement, albeit not within the board's regulations, does not satisfy the good cause standard. Why the collective bargaining agreement contained erroneous information is not clear, but it can hardly imply lack of diligence or inattentiveness for Cosio to have acted in accordance with its provisions. We are not here faced with a statute presenting a fixed time for appeal, but a regulation which permits late filing for good cause. Such a standard seems tailormade for petitioners acting in reasonable reliance on relevant documents who file just after the required date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the board abused its discretion by failing to find good cause for Cosio's five-day tardiness and remand for further appropriate proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's ruling before circuit review was that the appellant received notice of the filing time in a packet of regulations given to her by the agency with her removal notice; the appellant did not allege that she inquired as to Board review or that anyone misled her; and she was represented. <span class="Italic">Cosio v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has established good cause for the untimely filing of the request for review.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A request for review of an arbitrator's decision must be filed within 35 days after the date of issuance of the decision, or, if the appellant shows that the decision was received more than 5 days after the date of issuance, within 30 days after the appellant received the decision. <span class="Italic">Crawford-Graham v.

Since the appellant does not claim that she received the arbitration decision more than 5 days after the September 29, 2009 date the decision was issued, she should have filed a review request with the Board by November 3, 2009; thus, her request for review was untimely by more than 2 years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant bears the burden of proving through preponderant evidence that her appeal has been timely filed with the Board. <span class="Italic">Mauldin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 513, &#x00B6; 5 (2011); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(B)]. The Board will dismiss an untimely appeal unless the appellant establishes good cause for the delayed filing. <span class="Italic">Mauldin</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 513, &#x00B6; 5. In order to establish good cause for the untimely filing of an appeal, a party must show that she exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). The <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> standard also governs the late filing of a request for review of an arbitration decision. <span class="Italic">Hutchinson v. Department of Labor</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6; 7 (2001); <span class="Italic">Simpson v. Department of Defense</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 518, 520-21 (1992). To determine whether an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of the excuse and the showing of due diligence, whether the appellant is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether she has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond her control that affected her ability to timely file her request for review. <span class="Italic">Mauldin</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 513, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Moorman v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">However, an agency's failure to notify an employee of his or her Board appeal rights when such notification is required generally constitutes good cause for late filing. <span class="Italic">See Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 669, 673 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">McClendon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 250, 254 (2002). Nor is such dereliction cured by attaching a copy of the Board regulations to the agency decision letter. <span class="Italic">See McClendon</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. at 254; <span class="Italic">see also Walls v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1583-84 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Thus, when an agency provides inadequate notice of Board appeal rights, the appellant is not required to show that she exercised due diligence in attempting to discover her appeal rights, but rather must show diligence in filing the appeal after learning that she could. <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 583, 588 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant contends that the Board should excuse her delay in filing the request for review because neither the agency's removal decision nor the arbitrator's decision informed her of the right to file a request for review within 35 days from the date of the arbitrator's decision <span id="Page_1840"></span>in accordance with the Board's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(d). She also asserts that she exercised due diligence in filing her request for review within 30 days of the date that she became aware of her right to file a request with the Board. The agency contends that we should not waive the appellant's deadline for filing the request for review because the decision letter informed the appellant that she could have appealed her removal to the Board in lieu of filing a grievance with the agency and included a copy of the Board's regulations, and because the appellant was represented by union counsel throughout the arbitration process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's removal decision did contain information regarding the appellant's immediate options to file a grievance, a Board appeal, or a discrimination claim in the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) process. However, it did not inform the appellant, as explicitly required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(a)(4)(iii) (2008),[2] of her right to request Board review of an arbitral decision within 35 days from the date of issuance. The fact that the agency attached a copy of Board regulations to the decision letter is not sufficient to find that the appellant received clear information about her Board appeal rights as required by our regulations. <span class="Italic">McClendon</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. at 254. Accordingly, this case comes squarely within the rule that an agency's failure to provide requisite notice of appeal rights constitutes good cause for excusing an untimely appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues that the appellant has not established good cause for her delay because she was represented by a union attorney in pursuing her grievance. It is, of course, axiomatic that, when an appellant is represented by counsel, a failure by the appellant's attorney to timely file a request for review does not constitute good cause for waiving a filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 258 (2008); <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1981). However, in <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit specifically rejected the agency's argument that the appellant should be held responsible for the omissions of duty by her union representative because the critical omission was not that the representative failed to inform the appellant of her appeal rights, but that the agency failed to give the appellant notice of her appeal rights as required by law.[4] 839 F.2d at 673-74. The critical and controlling fact in this case is not the failure of the appellant's union attorney to inform her of her Board appeal rights, but the agency's violation in failing to give the appellant notice of her appeal rights as prescribed by the regulations. <span class="Italic">See Shiflett</span>, 839 F.2d at 673-74. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has shown good cause for her untimely filing of the request for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003; The principle that union representatives cannot be held personally liable to employees for acts performed on behalf of the union in the collective bargaining process is deeply embedded in labor jurisprudence and includes the actions of attorneys who represent a union. <span class="Italic">Montplaisir v. Leighton</span>, 875 F.2d 1, 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An otherwise timely appeal to the EEOC rather than to the Board was excused for an appellant who was challenging an arbitration decision and who made an error in the filing rather than a conscious election of a different forum. There was no evidence of a conscious election of EEOC: actual notice that the appeal should be filed with the Board was not given to the appellant by the arbitrator, the record did not reflect that the appellant knew that the appeal had to be filed with the Board. <span class="Italic">Marenus v. DHHS</span>, 39 MSPR 498, 502-04 (1989); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Mizoguchi v. GSA</span>, CB-7121-13-0183-V-1 (NP 2/3/2014) ("Because the agency's removal decision failed to notify the appellant of his right to request Board review of an arbitration decision within 35 days of its issuance, as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.21(d)(3), .155(b), and because the appellant exercised due diligence in filing his request for review after learning that he could do so, we find that he has shown good cause for the untimely filing of his request for review. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kirkland v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 74, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-9 (201[3])."); <span class="Italic">Grasty v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 438, 441 (1986) (agency removal decision letter explained the right to file a grievance (but apparently not referencing the right to request Board review of an arbitration award); unfamiliarity of appellant's counsel with the procedures for appealing from an arbitration award did not excuse an untimely review request: "Applying the <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> criteria to this case, the Board finds that appellant has not alleged that he did not timely receive the arbitrator's decision or that he was unaware of his right of appeal to the Board. Such assertion would be contradicted by the agency's specific notice in the removal decision that appellant could have appealed to the Board originally in lieu of filing a grievance with the agency, and by his counsel's apparent familiarity with Board procedures as demonstrated by her submissions.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board reviews final decisions of arbitrators within its subject matter jurisdiction. If exceptions to an award are filed with the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the award is not final until the FLRA decides those exceptions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fierro v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 35 MSPR 618, 621 (1987) (however, it does not appear from the Board's regulations or case law how, without a jurisdictional dispute, a case could arise that would allow for Board review of an arbitration award first reviewed by the FLRA).</p>
