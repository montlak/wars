<p class="Body-Text">Military service may affect civil service retirement benefits. Under <span class="Italic">Libertiny v. OPM</span>, DA-0841-16-0520-I-1 (NP 2/21/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, an annuitant who performed military service after December 31, 1956, must meet the following requirements before his separation from civilian service to receive credit for his military service in his FERS annuity: (1) waive his military retired pay; and (2) make a deposit for each period of military service performed after December 31, 1956. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8411(c), 8422(e); <span class="Italic">see Barth v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 123, &#x00B6; 11 (2011); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.306. However, there is a limited exception to the waiver requirement if an annuitant's retired pay is "<span class="Italic">based on</span> a service-connected disability" that was "incurred in combat with an enemy of the United States," or "caused by an instrumentality of war and incurred in line of duty during a period of war[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(c)(2)(A) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see Barth</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 123, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 11.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sparks v. OPM, AT-0831-16-0677-I-1 (NP 6/15/2022), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An annuitant who retires after September 7, 1982, is entitled to receive credit for active military service performed after 1956 under both CSRS and the Social Security system if he deposits an amount equal to 7% of his total post-1956 military pay, plus interest, with the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. <span class="Italic">Hooten v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 205, &#x00B6; 6 (2010); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(j). If the annuitant fails to make such a deposit, OPM must recalculate the annuity payments when he first becomes eligible for Social Security benefits to exclude credit for the post-1956 military service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(j); <span class="Italic">Hooten</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 205, &#x00B6; 6. Those employees who retire on or after October 1, 1983, must make such a deposit before their separation from service upon which entitlement to an annuity is based. <span class="Italic">Hooten</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 205, &#x00B6; 6; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2104. However, the Board will order OPM to permit a post-separation deposit if there was administrative error by the individual's employing agency or OPM and the failure to make the deposit prior to retirement was the product of that administrative error. <span class="Italic">Hooten</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 205, &#x00B6; 6; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2107(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chupko v. OPM</span>, PH-0841-17-0099-I-1 (NP 2/28/2023) ("However, there is no requirement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(j) that an individual actually receive or apply for Social Security benefits before OPM recomputes his CSRS annuity to exclude credit for his post-1956 military service. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. at 343.

<p class="Body-Text">Some of the complexities of the deposit for military service were elaborated on in <span class="Italic">Clark v. OPM</span>, PH-0831-16-0234-I-1 (NP 2/3/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under CSRS, the creditable service of an individual like the appellant, i.e., one who first became an employee before October 1, 1982, includes credit for each period of military service performed before the date on which the entitlement to an annuity is based, subject to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(j).[3] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(c)(1)(A). Subsection 8332(j)(1) provides that military service is <span class="Italic">not included</span> in calculating the service credit on which a CSRS annuity is based if the individual is entitled, or would on proper application be entitled, to monthly OASI benefits under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 402. However, subsection 8332(j)(2)(A) provides that subsection 8332(j)(1) <span class="Italic">does not apply</span> to any period of military service to which the individual has made a deposit with interest under section 8334(j).

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;As noted above, the appellant receives a FERS annuity with a CSRS component. Because he performed his period of military service before he elected FERS coverage, his military service is part of the CSRS component of his annuity and is treated under CSRS rules.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as noted above, OPM recalculated the appellant's annuity to eliminate credit for his post-1956 military service after he became eligible for OASI benefits in 2015 because he did not make the post-1956 military service deposit. In his Board appeal, he does not challenge OPM's finding that he did not make a military service deposit but argues that section 307 of Pub. L. No. 97-253 exempts him from the limitations of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(j) and the deposit provisions of section 8334(j) and entitles him to a smaller reduction of his monthly annuity. An appellant bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is entitled to the benefits he seeks under the CSRS. <span class="Italic">See Cheeseman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 791 F.2d 138, 140-41 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 307 of Pub. L. No. 97-253 is codified as amended in a statutory note titled "Recomputation at Age 62 of Credit for Military Service of Current Annuitants." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332 note. Section 307(a) reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The provisions of section 8332(j)...relating to credit for military service, shall not apply with respect to any individual who is entitled to an annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, on or before the date of enactment of this Act [Sept. 8, 1982] or who is entitled to an annuity based on a separation from service occurring on or before such date of enactment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that section 307 did not apply to the appellant because he was not "entitled" to an annuity on or before the date of its enactment and because the laws that are applicable to his annuity rights are those that were in effect at the time of his July 1, 2009 retirement. The appellant argues on review that section 307(a) applies to him because he was "entitled" to a CSRS annuity as of September 8, 1982, seemingly by virtue of the fact that he began his Federal employment in 1981.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As the title of the statutory note indicates, section 307 applies to individuals who were "current annuitants," i.e., entitled to a CSRS annuity, as of September 8, 1982. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332 note (Recomputation at Age 62 of Credit for Military Service of Current Annuitants); <span class="Italic">see Jackson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, No. 97-3331, 1997 WL 758780, at *2 (Fed. Cir. Dec. 10, 1997). Under CSRS, an "annuitant" is defined as a former employee "who, on the basis of his service, meets all requirements of this subchapter for title to annuity and files claim therefor." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(9). To be eligible for a CSRS annuity, an individual must have at least 5 years of creditable service and must serve at least 1 of the last 2 years of Federal service in a position covered by the Civil Service Retirement Act of 1954. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(a)-(b). Here, the appellant, who became a Federal employee in 1981, was not a "current annuitant," or even eligible to apply for a CSRS annuity, on or by September 8, 1982. Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge's determination that section 307(a) does not apply to the appellant. The appellant's assertion on review that he was "entitled" to an annuity on or before September 8, 1982, because he was already a Federal employee is unpersuasive and provides no basis to disturb this finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that, even if section 307(a) does not apply to him, his annuity should be reduced pursuant to the alternative method described in section 307(b). We disagree. Section 307(b) established an alternate method of determining any reduction in a CSRS annuity due to an annuitant's eligibility for OASI. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332 note; <span class="Italic">Kerr v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 284, 286 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 802 F.2d 469 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Table). However, it only applies to individuals described in section 307(a), i.e., annuitants who retired on or before September 8, 1982. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332 note; <span class="Italic">Burdick v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 216, 218 (1991); <span class="Italic">Hartness v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 360, 362 (1986). Here, because the appellant retired after September 8, 1982, he is not eligible for the alternate method of reducing his annuity described in section 307(b). <span class="Italic">See Burdick</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. at 218.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the foregoing, we agree with the administrative judge's determination that OPM correctly reduced the appellant's annuity upon <span id="Page_4093"></span>his becoming eligible for OASI benefits in 2015 because he did not timely make a military service deposit. We further find no merit to the appellant's contention that he is entitled to an alternate reduction amount because he indisputably retired after September 8, 1982. We have considered the appellant's remaining arguments regarding his belief that he is covered by section 307 of Pub. L. No. 97-253, but find that they are contrary to the clear and controlling language of the statute....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;"Catch 62"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before September 8, 1982, Civil Service annuitants who were eligible for Social Security at age 62 could not receive credit for military service performed after 1956 even if it had previously been credited in the computation of their annuity benefits. When an annuitant retired before age 62 and post-1956 military service was included in the annuity computation, it had to be deleted at the end of the month before his or her 62nd birthday, if he or she was eligible for Social Security at that time. The rule was commonly referred to as "catch 62" since it affected retirees at age 62.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Military Deposit</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRS law was changed in 1982 with respect to the crediting of military service for annuity computation purposes. 
The law now provides that any individual first employed in a position subject to CSRS on or after October 1, 1982, receives credit for title and annuity computation purposes for post-1956 military service only if he or she deposits with the employing agency a sum equal to 7 percent of the military basic pay he or she earned during the period of military service, plus interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Individuals who were first employed under CSRS before October 1, 1982, can receive, under certain circumstances, credit for post-1956 military service without making the deposit, potentially undergoing an annuity reduction for the post-1956 military service at age 62, or making the deposit and avoiding a possible reduction.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Military service cannot fulfill basic retirement eligibility requirements, <span class="Italic">Tirado v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 757 F.2d 263, 264-65 (Fed. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner's major claim is that he did have the five years service necessary for disability retirement because, though he admittedly did not have five years of civilian service, the total of his civilian and military service exceeded five years. He directly challenges the holding of the full Board that military service cannot be counted in measuring an employee's initial eligibility for disability retirement. His argument is that the word "service," in the legislation relating to federal civil service retirement (Chapter 83 of Title 5 of the United States Code, Subchapter III), is generally defined (5 U.S.C. Sec. 8331(12)) as "employment creditable under section 8332," and in turn Sec. 8332 ("Creditable service") expressly allows credit for military service (Sec. 8332(c) and (d)). It follows, Tirado says, that the five years service required in Sec. 8337(a) for eligibility for disability retirement includes military as well as civilian service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The difficulty with this position is that Sec. 8337(a) very specifically requires five years of "civilian service" for eligibility for disability retirement. The same is true of the eligibility provision for a non-disability retirement based on time-in-service. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8333(a). Similarly, deferred retirement is available at age 62 to an employee who becomes ineligible for civil service retirement "after completing 5 years of civilian service." 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8338(a). These coordinated and express provisions demonstrate that Congress wanted to restrict eligibility for civil service retirement--both disability and longevity retirement--to persons who have had at least five years of civilian federal employment. That is the minimum eligibility requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once that threshold standard of eligibility has been met, military service can be counted (in defined circumstances) in computing the amount of the proper retirement annuity to which the applicant is entitled. That is the special function of the statutory provisions, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, on which petitioner relies--Secs. 8331(12) (defining "service" in terms of Sec. 8332) and 8332(c) and (d) (crediting military service in appropriate circumstances). Those sections have nothing to do with the minimum eligibility requirement of five years of civilian service. Indeed, it would be most extraordinary if Congress, in adopting those particular provisions, silently and impliedly meant to delete or override "civilian" from the specific eligibility provisions (which have long been in the law). The opposite is true--Congress obviously wanted only those individuals with a minimum of federal civilian service to be entitled to a federal civil service annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The necessity for a basic minimum of civilian service, without augmentation or credit for military service, was restated by <span class="Italic">Reid v. OPM</span>, 708 Fed. Appx. 677, 678-79 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Carmen P. Reid ("Reid") appeals from a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board"), holding that her military service was not creditable towards the satisfaction of the general eligibility requirement for a retirement annuity under the Federal Employees' Retirement System ("FERS"). <span class="Italic">Reid v. Office of Personnel Mgmt</span>., No. SF-0842-17-0039-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Jan. 10, 2017). Because the Board did not err in reaching its decision, we affirm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5, section 8410 governs the general eligibility requirements for FERS. That section states: "Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an employee or Member must complete at least 5 years of civilian service creditable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411 in order to be eligible for an annuity under this subchapter." Section 8411, titled "Creditable service," includes both certain civilian and certain military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reid argues that the five year eligibility requirement may be met by summing her approximately four years and seven months of civilian service pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(b) and one year and two months of military service according to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(c)(1)(B). The Government argues that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8410 explicitly provides a baseline requirement of five years of exclusively "<span class="Italic">civilian service</span> creditable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411" (emphasis added), and that the military service may only be creditable to determine the amount of the award once the baseline requirements are met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Government. The plain language of &#x00A7; 8410 requires five years of <span class="Italic">civilian</span> service. To allow the non-civilian, i.e. military, service to count towards the eligibility criteria in &#x00A7; 8410 would render superfluous the word "civilian." "It is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that a statute ought, upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be prevented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous, void, or insignificant." <span class="Italic">TRW Inc. v. Andrews</span>, 534 U.S. 19, 31 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). The latter part of &#x00A7; 8410, "creditable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411," does not expand the meaning of "at least 5 years of civilian service," but <span class="Italic">narrows</span> the types of civilian service that may give rise to eligibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our holding is also governed by <span class="Italic">Brown v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 872 F.2d 401 (Fed. Cir. 1989). There, interpreting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b)(1) (setting forth the eligibility criteria for FERS benefits to widows and widowers), we held that the phrase "after completing at least 18 months of civilian service creditable under section 8411" did not allow using military service to establish eligibility. This was because the latter half of that phrase ("creditable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411") "does not change the basic requirement of section 8442 that creditable service must be civilian service to establish eligibility," 872 F.2d at 402, and the military service of the type contained in Section 8411 could only be used to compute the amount of an annuity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reid argues that the basis for our decision in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> was "not relevant law" because we cited a case dealing with Civilian Service Retirement Systems ("CSRS") and not FERS. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (citing as <span class="Italic">cf. Tirado v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 757 F.2d 263, 264-65 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). We disagree. The basis for our decision in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> was the text of the statute in &#x00A7; 8442, which is in relevant part identical to the text at issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reid cites as authority <span class="Italic">Cieslinski v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 610 F. App'x 979 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (nonprecedential) ("By statute, a federal employee 'must complete at least 5 years of civilian service,' to include military service if the employee has made the required deposit...in order to be qualified to receive a FERS annuity payment."). <span class="Italic">Cieslinski</span> does not control the disposition of this case. First, the statement Reid relies upon is not controlling because it was not necessary to the court's decision. Cieslinski could not meet the eligibility requirements even if military experience could be included because he failed to make the payments to FERS necessary to claim such entitlement. 610 F. App'x at 981. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Orr</span>, <span id="Page_4094"></span>855 F.2d 1544, 1550 (Fed. Cir. 1988) ("[A] general expression in an opinion, which expression is not essential to the disposition of the case, does not control a judgment in a subsequent proceeding."). Second, <span class="Italic">Cieslinski</span> is a non-precedential opinion, and thus has no binding force. Fed. Circ. R. 32.1(d). We also agree with the Board that the confusing language cited by Reid from the Office of Personnel Management's CSRS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices cannot overrule the clear language of the statute.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The analysis in <span class="Italic">Reid,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> was affirmed in a precedential circuit decision, <span class="Italic">Montelongo v. OPM</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-2095.Opinion.10-2-2019.pdf">939 F.3d 1351</a>, 1352-54 (Fed. Cir. 2019), determining that time spent as a cadet in a military academy could not serve as basic FERS qualifying service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Michael Montelongo applied for a civil service retirement annuity for which applicants must meet a threshold requirement of having at least five years of "civilian service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8410. It is undisputed that Mr. Montelongo could not meet that requirement unless his time as a cadet student at the United States Military Academy at West Point counted as such service. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) ruled that the cadet time did not qualify and therefore denied him the annuity. The Merit Systems Protection Board rejected Mr. Montelongo's challenge to OPM's ruling. We affirm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Montelongo was a student cadet at West Point from July 1973 to June or July 1977--roughly four years. He then served in the United States Army from June 8, 1977, until December 31, 1996, when he retired. Later, from June 21, 2001, to March 28, 2005--about three and three-quarters years--Mr. Montelongo served as a civilian presidential appointee in the Department of the Air Force. While he was serving in that civilian position, an Air Force human resources officer advised Mr. Montelongo that his time as a cadet at West Point could be "bought back" and credited toward an eventual civil service annuity under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8401-8479. Mr. Montelongo made the small payment to "buy back" his four years as a cadet at West Point.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 15, 2017, Mr. Montelongo applied to OPM for a FERS annuity. OPM concluded that only his time as a presidential appointee (just under four years) counted as a creditable civilian service. In reaching that conclusion, OPM necessarily deemed Mr. Montelongo's active military service as well as his cadet time as not creditable civilian service. With less than four years of creditable civilian service, OPM ruled, Mr. Montelongo did not satisfy the threshold requirement for a FERS annuity, i.e., five years of creditable civilian service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Montelongo appealed to the Board. He did not argue for counting his post-Academy career in the military; the only issue was whether his cadet time should be counted in meeting &#x00A7; 8410's five-year threshold. It was, as it still is, undisputed that Mr. Montelongo's cadet time was "military service" that was creditable service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(c)(1). But the administrative judge assigned to the matter concluded that being "creditable service" under &#x00A7; 8411 does not make the cadet time into the "civilian service" for which &#x00A7; 8410 sets a five-year minimum for annuity qualification. On that basis, the administrative judge agreed with OPM's denial of the annuity application. The denial became the final Board decision when the time for full Board review passed and Mr. Montelongo had not sought such review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be eligible for a FERS annuity, an employee "must complete at least 5 years of civilian service creditable under section 8411...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8410. Under the plain language of that provision, for service to count in meeting the five-year minimum, it must be <span class="Italic">both</span> "civilian service" <span class="Italic">and</span> "creditable under section 8411." It is not enough for the applicant's service to satisfy the second half of this dual requirement, i.e., that it be creditable under &#x00A7; 8411--which means that it is "service" used for certain FERS purposes such as calculating the amount of an annuity to which the applicant is otherwise entitled. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00A7; 8401(26) (defining "service" as "service which is creditable under section 8411"); <span class="Italic">id</span>., &#x00A7; 8415(a) ("the annuity of an employee retiring under this subchapter is 1 percent of that individual's average pay multiplied by such individual's total service"). The service that qualifies under &#x00A7; 8410 also must satisfy the first half of that section's dual requirement: it must be "civilian service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that Mr. Montelongo's cadet service was not "civilian service." The statute, in its definitional section, expressly specifies that West Point cadet time is "military service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00A7; 8401(31). That definition is key to resolution of the legal issue because the relevant FERS statutory provisions make clear that, at least as relevant here, "military service" and "civilian service" are distinct categories.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, &#x00A7; 8411 includes both military and civilian service as creditable "service," but it recognizes the distinction: it provides "credit for," among other things, certain periods of "military service," &#x00A7; 8411(c)(1), while separately allowing credit for and referring to certain "civilian service," &#x00A7; 8411(b)(3), (i)(1). The definitional section of the statute, &#x00A7; 8401, also separately refers to "military service," &#x00A7; 8401(31), and to "civilian service," &#x00A7; 8401(11)(C), (12)(A), 31, 37(A), 38(A). Indeed, the specific subsection that defines "military service" to include cadet time itself refers to "civilian service" as something distinct. &#x00A7; 8401(31). In this statutory context, which contains no other provision that overrides the separation of the two categories for present purposes, the qualification of cadet time as "military service" means that it is not "civilian service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 872 F.2d 401, 402 (Fed. Cir. 1989), we insisted on the military-civilian distinction in a very similar context involving the FERS program. The question there was whether certain military service creditable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411 counts for meeting a "civilian service" eligibility requirement for FERS benefits to widows stated in &#x00A7; 8442. We held that it does not. We explained: "That section 8442(b)(1) says 'civilian service creditable under section 8411' and section 8411(c)(1)(A) allows credit for military service prior to 1957 does not change the basic requirement of section 8842 that creditable service must be civilian service to establish eligibility." <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 872 F.2d at 402. That reasoning carries over to the &#x00A7; 8410 issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It also is consistent with precedent under the counter-part of the FERS provision at issue here for the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) that predated the 1986 enactment of the FERS regime. Specifically, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(a), since its enactment in 1948, has used language similar to &#x00A7; 8410, requiring five years of "civilian service" for eligibility for an annuity. Both before and after the enactment of the FERS provisions, we have held that only civilian service counts under the CSRS eligibility provision, so that, while military service may count in calculating the amount of an annuity if eligibility is established, the five-year minimum for eligibility may not be met by combining civilian and military service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Villanueva v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 980 F.2d 1431, 1432-33 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Tirado v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 757 F.2d 263, 264 (Fed. Cir. 1985).

<p class="Block-Quote1">In our non-precedential decision in <span class="Italic">Reid v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 708 Fed. Appx. 677 (Fed. Cir. 2017), we drew the same conclusion about &#x00A7; 8410 that we draw here. We explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The plain language of &#x00A7; 8410 requires five years of <span class="Italic">civilian</span> service.

Indeed, the appellant admits that he had only 9 days of service.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4095"></span>Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8410, an employee must have completed at least 5 years of creditable civilian service to be eligible for an annuity. Section 8413 sets forth the requirements for a deferred annuity. An employee who separates from Federal service with at least 5 years of service is entitled to an annuity when he reaches age 62. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8413(a). Read together, it is clear that, to be eligible for a deferred annuity under FERS, an employee must have 5 years of civilian service. There is no dispute that the appellant has 5 years of civilian service under FERS. The statute further provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee...who is separated from the service...after completing 10 years of service but before attaining the applicable minimum retirement age under section 8412(h) is entitled to an annuity beginning on the date designated by the employee...in a written election under this subsection. The date designated under this subsection may not precede the date on which the employee...attains such minimum retirement age and must precede the date on which the employee...becomes 62 years of age.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8413(b). The minimum retirement age (MRA) for employees born before January 1, 1948, like the appellant, is 55 years of age. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8412(h). The appellant became 55 on December 4, 2001, and would be eligible for a deferred annuity at that time if he had completed 10 years of service. OPM denied his application for a deferred annuity because it found that he had 9 years, 8 months, and 2 days of creditable service when he resigned from his position with the Department of the Army effective March 15, 1990.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued below that he should receive credit for his three years of military service. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(c), an employee is entitled to credit for</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">military service performed after December 31, 1956, and before the separation on which title to annuity is based, if a deposit (including <span id="Page_4096"></span>interest, if any) is made with respect to such [service] in accordance with section 8422(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its reconsideration decision, OPM based its finding that no deposit was made on the Department of the Army's certification to that effect, and the appellant does not dispute this finding. He asserted below, however, that he was willing to make the deposit if that would make him eligible for an annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ did not consider the appellant's claim regarding the deposit. Rather, relying on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8413(b), the AJ found that, because the appellant is not yet 62, he was not eligible for a deferred annuity unless he had "10 years of creditable <span class="Italic">civilian</span> service," prior to his reaching the applicable minimum retirement age.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In requiring the appellant to have 10 years of creditable civilian service, the AJ misstated the requirements of the statute. As noted, subsection (b)(1) of section 8413 requires that the employee have "10 years of service." OPM has never asserted in this appeal, let alone cited any authority for the proposition, that the appellant could not receive a deferred annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8412(b) as long as he had 5 years of creditable civilian service and makes a deposit for his post-1956 military service. In fact, in its reconsideration decision, OPM stated that the appellant's military service could not be used to compute his annuity, not because all of the required service had to be civilian service, but because he did not make a deposit for it. Moreover, Chapter 42, section 42A1.1-2E of OPM's CSRS [Civil Service Retirement System] and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices (1998) (Handbook) states that to receive a deferred annuity of the kind for which the appellant has applied, the "employee must have at least 10 years of creditable (civilian and military) service...." Section 45B1.1-2E further provides that "...former FERS employees are eligible for a deferred annuity as early as their MRA if they have 10 or more years of creditable service, including 5 years of civilian service." Thus, the 10-year requirement can be met by using post-1956 military service if the required deposit is made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under OPM's implementing regulation,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a]n employee's...deposit for military service must be completed before separation from service....A person who was eligible to make a deposit for military service but failed to complete the deposit within the time limits provided in this paragraph, may complete the deposit in a lump sum within the time limit set by OPM when it rules that an administrative error has been made.</p>

Office of Personnel Management</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 352, &#x00B6; 9 (2002) (if a separated employee failed to make or complete a deposit for military service prior to his separation due to an administrative error, he may complete the deposit in a lump sum within a time period set by OPM).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employing agency's failure to inform an employee of the need to make a deposit for his military service, when the agency is obligated to provide this information, constitutes an "administrative error" within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.307(a)(3). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nunez v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 326, 329-34 (1996). It therefore may warrant waiver of the requirement that the deposit be made before separation. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Accordingly, if the Department of the Army was obligated to provide this information, and it failed to do so, then the appellant may be entitled to another opportunity to make the deposit. <span class="Italic">See Gilliam</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 352, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the Department of the Army may have been required to tell the appellant, before it separated him, of the consequences of his failure to make a deposit covering his military service. Chapter 45 of OPM's Handbook describes advice that should be provided to an employee who is separating and who is not entitled to an immediate annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> Handbook, Chapter 45, section 45B2.1-2; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>., section 45A1.1-1B.[2] That advice includes information about the requirement that an employee make a deposit for military service performed after 1956, if he is to receive credit for that service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., sections 45A2.1-2B; 45B2.1-2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Although the latter section expressly applies to employees under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), later provisions of the chapter indicate that it and other provisions applicable to CSRS employees also apply to FERS employees such as the appellant in this case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> Handbook, Chapter 45, section 45B2.1-2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ made no finding in regard to whether an administrative error was made and if so, whether that error caused the appellant's failure to make the deposit prior to his separation. OPM has not submitted evidence and argument on the issue. Nor are the appellant's assertions sufficient evidence upon which to make a finding. Although he states on petition for review that he was never told of the necessity for making a deposit before he separated from the Department of the Army, that statement is unsworn. We find that remanding this appeal to the AJ is necessary so that the parties may have an opportunity to develop the record more fully.</p>

As the administrative judge observed, the Handbook indicates that a deposit may be required depending on the employee's eligibility for Social Security benefits. Handbook, &#x00A7; 22A6.1-2(A)(1).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that these circumstances fell within an exception, entitling the appellant to civilian service credit. In doing so, he relied on section 22A6.1-4(B) of the Handbook, which provides for CSRS service credit when a court awards a former service member retroactive military reinstatement "with back pay and allowances."

Although section 22A6.1-4(B) of the Handbook suggests that a "court" judgment could result in an individual's entitlement to both civilian and military retirement pay for the same period, it is unclear whether that includes a decision by the AFBCMR. In any event, the provision directs agencies to consult OPM for an advisory opinion when such a court judgment exists--it does not appear to provide a definitive entitlement.

(Emphasis added.) In our view, by its plain terms, the bar of &#x00A7; 8332(c)(2) is directed to the situation in which a retired federal employee seeks to have his or her creditable civilian service "include credit for [a] period of military service" for purposes of the calculation of his or her civil service retirement annuity. In other words, the bar comes into play when a civil service annuitant seeks to increase his or her annuity by adding to his or her creditable civilian service military service time for which the annuitant is receiving military retirement pay. The bar does not come into play when a civil service annuitant does not seek to "include credit for [a] period of military service" but, rather, only seeks credit for a period of civilian service for purposes of his or her annuity.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's final decision reflects a different view of &#x00A7; 8332(c)(2). Addressing Period Two, the Board stated, "Section 8332(c)(2) precludes the award of double credit for overlapping periods of civilian and military service," except when the provisions of &#x00A7; 8332(c)(2)(A)-(B) apply. In addition, in rejecting the AJ's reliance on the <span class="Italic">Handbook</span> in connection with Period Two, the Board stated that "the <span class="Italic">Handbook</span> does not explain why the general prohibition against an individual receiving both civilian and military service credit for the same period, delineated in...the statute[,]...would not apply in a situation like this." As seen, however, we have concluded that the statute does not contain a "general prohibition against an individual receiving both civilian and military service credit for the same period," at least not in the situation where a person seeks civilian service credit for purposes of calculating his or her civil service annuity based only on his or her civil service during that period. We thus hold that the Board approached Mr. Miller's appeal with an incorrect and overly broad view of the prohibition set forth in &#x00A7; 8332(c)(2)....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant was not an "employee" while performing his military service. He therefore was not an LEO while serving in the military, and his <span id="Page_4098"></span>military service was not creditable LEO service for the purposes of FERS LEO retirement, even though his later service as a FAM was creditable and regardless of whether he paid his military deposit in full. <span class="Italic">See Bell v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, the appellant's military service is not relevant for determining his entitlement to LEO retirement benefits.

<p class="Body-Text">There has been much litigation over appeals of individuals who did not get service credit for periods of military service because they did not make proper annuity deposits to OPM to cover their service time. The appeals arose because employees missed the time limits for making the deposits and then asserted, sometimes successfully, that they failed to make the deposit because of incorrect advice from their employing agencies or OPM as to the necessity for the deposits.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appears to argue that his employing agency committed an administrative error by incorrectly informing him that his annuity would not be reduced after he became eligible for Social Security benefits if he did not collect Social Security benefits and that his failure to make a deposit prior to retirement was the product of that administrative error. He further contends that he should be allowed to make a post-separation deposit, with interest, to receive an unreduced annuity due to his reliance on this misinformation. OPM argued below that, even if the appellant received erroneous information from his employing agency, no administrative error occurred because the appellant received and signed Standard Form (SF) 2801, Application for Immediate Retirement, and OPM Form 1515, Military Service Deposit Election, which correctly notified him of his opportunity to make a deposit prior to his separation and of the consequences of failing to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that the 1990 version of the SF-2801 provides sufficient notice of the opportunity to make a deposit and of the consequences of not doing so. <span class="Italic">Drury v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (1998). Here, the record reflects that the agency provided the appellant the 2007 version of the SF-2801. Although the Board has not addressed previously whether the 2007 version of the SF-2801 provides an applicant sufficient notice, the 1990 and 2007 versions contain essentially identical relevant language.[2] <span class="Italic">See Drury</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6; 12. The appellant does not dispute that he received and completed the 2007 version of the SF-2801, and the record reflects that he listed his dates of military service on the application form and checked "No" in response to the question about whether he paid a deposit to his agency for this service. Thus, we find that the 2007 version of the SF-2801 afforded the appellant sufficient notice of his opportunity to make a deposit for his post-1956 military service prior to his separation and of the consequences of not doing so. <span class="Italic">See Drury</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Both the 2007 and 1990 versions of the SF-2801 explain that employees who performed military service after January 1, 1957, "may pay a deposit...to cover that service" and that it "<span class="Italic">must be paid to your agency while you are still employed</span>." <span class="Italic">See Drury</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6; 12. Both versions further state that, if an employee does not pay the military service deposit and becomes eligible for Social Security benefits at age 62, his "annuity will be recomputed (at age 62) to eliminate credit for the post-1956 military service." <span class="Italic">See Drury</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6; 12. In the application section, both the 1990 and 2007 versions ask the applicant to list the nature and dates of all military service performed and, if any of the service occurred on or after January 1, 1957, to indicate whether he paid a deposit to the agency for this service. <span class="Italic">See Drury</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6; 12.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the agency provided the appellant with the 2000 version of OPM Form 1515, which explained that an individual will receive CSRS credit for post-1956 military service after becoming eligible for Social Security benefits only if he makes a deposit for that service before separation from Federal service, and that failure to pay the deposit will result in a reduction in his CSRS annuity when he becomes eligible for Social Security benefits. The form requires the individual to complete and sign an "Employee Election" in which he is given the choice between making and not making a deposit. The appellant placed an "X" in the box corresponding to "I do not want to pay (or complete) this deposit" and signed the form. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

OPM's regulations provide that a separated employee who, through administrative error, did not make or complete a deposit to his employing agency prior to his or her separation must complete the deposit to the employing agency within the time limit set by OPM.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A civil service annuitant who retires after September 7, 1982, is entitled to credit for post-1956 active duty military service under both the CSRS and the Social Security system only if he or she deposits with the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund an amount equal to seven percent of his or her total post-1956 military pay. <span class="Italic">See Clements v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has promulgated regulations implementing the above provisions. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2104, and for purposes of this appeal, there are two categories of individuals who may make a deposit for service performed before the separation on which title to a civil service annuity is based: (a) An employee currently occupying a position subject to subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, including a person who was eligible to make a deposit under section 831.2104(a) but who failed to make the deposit before separation due to administrative error; and (b) a former employee who was separated with title to an annuity or who retired from a position subject to subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, after September 8, 1982, and before October 1, 1983. The rest of 5 C.F.R. part 831, subpart U, sets forth a regulatory scheme that describes the procedures used by individuals under these two categories.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may find administrative error and waive the deposit deadline when: (1) the employee can show that he relied on misinformation in electing not to make the deposit; (2) an application package contains obvious errors or internal inconsistencies in which OPM or the employing agency has an obligation to investigate and resolve the problem before processing the application; or (3) an employee elected to make the deposit and the paperwork is in order, but neither the employing agency nor OPM followed through to ensure the deposit was made. <span class="Italic">King,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 307, &#x00B6; 12 n.2.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the appellant asserts that he questioned Ms. Melton as to whether, based on the Estimated Earnings Instructions he had received, his service in the National Guard was subject to the "Buy Back" program. Contrary to the administrative judge's finding, ID at 7, the appellant did claim below that he also presented his DD-214 to Ms. Melton. And, he clearly asserted that she told him his service was not subject to the deposit and that no one at his agency ever corrected that misstatement. OPM has not disputed the appellant's factual assertions pertaining to his conversation with Ms. Melton. The appellant further asserts that he relied on the information he was provided in not paying a deposit for that military service, and that, if he had received correct information, he "could have avoided this appeal."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's unrebutted allegations establish that the government committed administrative error by assuring him, when he asked, that his military service was not subject to the deposit. This is so even though the appellant received information about making a deposit in order to continue receiving credit for his military service if and when he became eligible to receive Social Security benefits,(OPM Form 1515, Military Service Deposit election), and even though similar information was provided in his retirement application, SF-2801, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 4-10; <span class="Italic">see Hendricks v.

Also, the time limit will be extended if the failure to make the deposit is the result of administrative error. <span class="Italic">Gates</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 400.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant's employing agency provided him with documentation expressly identifying the deadline for making the deposit and the consequences of not making the deposit. Nevertheless, the administrative judge found that the circumstances surrounding the appellant's retirement in February 1993 made him incapable of making the deposit, i.e., he was incapable of understanding the need to make the deposit or the consequences of his failure to make the deposit. On petition for review, OPM argues that the administrative judge's decision represents an expansion of the bases for waiver of a time limit. We find that it is unnecessary to address this argument because OPM's administrative error entitles the appellant to another opportunity to make the deposit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's application for retirement benefits indicates that he had post-1956 military service and that he had not made a deposit for it. The record also contains a copy of the appellant's SF-2801, Schedule D, Agency Checklist of Immediate Retirement Procedures (Employing Office Checklist). The form asks whether OPM Form 1515 was attached, "[i]f post-1956 military service is involved and applicant has not made application to make a military service deposit." The box "not applicable" was checked. The record does not contain a completed form 1515. In <span class="Italic">Nunez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 326, 332-33 (1996), and <span class="Italic">Cox v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 320, 322-24 (1996), the Board found that OPM required agencies to complete the checklist and enclose the appropriate documents. An OPM Form 1515 was required when the retiring employee had post-1956 military service and had not made application to make the deposit. Furthermore, FPM Letter 831-83, which was in effect when the appellant in this appeal retired, required agencies to inform retiring employees of the 7% deposit requirement and of the effect of not making such a deposit, and to obtain a certification from the retiring employee stating, "I have read the information about the effect of not making a deposit for my post-1956 military service and I do NOT want to make the deposit. I understand that I can't change my decision after I retire." The Board found that OPM's processing of the application without the required certification was administrative error justifying waiver of the time limit. <span class="Italic">Nunez</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 332-33; <span class="Italic">Cox</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 323-24. Here, the record contains no form 1515 or the certification required by FPM Letter 831-83, and the agency checklist indicates that a form 1515 was not completed. Thus, OPM's processing the retirement application without the required documents constitutes administrative error. <span class="Italic">Gates</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 400-01.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor did subsequent communications cure the defect. The record contains an undated RI 20-49, apparently sent by OPM to the appellant sometime after his application for retirement was accepted, which explained certain circumstances which might have affected his annuity benefit. The document informed the appellant that he would receive credit for his military service, but, since he did not make the required deposit, his annuity would be reduced when he became eligible for social security benefits. The appellant testified that he did not receive this document or others in the record because they were apparently sent to his former address, even though he had notified OPM of his address change. The administrative judge credited this testimony and found that the appellant had not been aware of the need to make the deposit until he received OPM's April 11, 1997 letter informing him about the possibility of a reduction in his annuity. We agree that, under the circumstances, the appellant acted diligently in pursuing the matter once he learned of his failure to make the deposit and the need to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also found that it was highly plausible that the appellant would have made the deposit, if he had been aware of the need to do so. We agree. The record shows that the appellant had approximately 11 years and six months of military service. Elimination of that many years of service would have a substantial effect on the amount of his annuity. In fact, according to OPM's calculations, his annuity was reduced approximately $800 a month. Thus, based on OPM's administrative error in processing the appellant's retirement application without the required form 1515 and certification, we find that the appellant is entitled to another opportunity to make the deposit to receive credit for his post-1956 military service.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The process for making a deposit for military service after 1956, with particular regard to administrative errors in the process, and the question of assessment of interest on belated deposits for the FERS annuity, were considered in <span class="Italic">Kehl v. OPM</span>, 78 MSPR 600, 601-05 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective June 3, 1995, the appellant was separated from his GS-7 Tax Examiner position with the IRS after completing a four-year term appointment. The appellant did not make a deposit before he was separated in order to get credit toward a deferred annuity for his two years of post-1956 military service. After OPM denied the appellant's initial request to make a belated deposit, he filed a request for reconsideration, in which he asserted that he had attempted to make the deposit while he was employed by the IRS, but had been unable to do so because the personnel office did not know the proper procedures. OPM again found that he was not entitled to make the deposit. The appellant filed a timely Board appeal of OPM's reconsideration decision. During the course of the appeal, the appellant notified the administrative judge that lie had been reemployed in the federal service, and was now eligible to make a timely deposit. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal without prejudice as possibly moot, subject to refiling within sixty days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to receive credit toward an annuity for a period of military service performed after December 31, 1956, an employee subject to FERS must make a deposit equal to 3% of his basic military pay to his employing agency. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 9411(c)(1)(B), 8422(e); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.307(a)(2). The deposit must be made before separation from the service, unless the individual was prevented from making a deposit before separation due to administrative error. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 942.307(a)(3). OPM based its <span id="Page_4101"></span>reconsideration decision denying the appellant the right to make a belated deposit for his post-1956 military service on the ground that the appellant was not an "employee," as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.307(a)(1), when he made his request to make the deposit. The administrative judge affirmed the reconsideration decision on the ground that the appellant had been reemployed in the federal service since the reconsideration decision, and therefore did not have the right to make a <span class="Italic">belated</span> deposit. Neither OPM nor the administrative judge considered whether the appellant had been prevented by administrative error from making a deposit before his first period of service ended in 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reiterates his argument made below that his inability to complete the military deposit while still an employee was the fault of his employing agency. He further asserts that his current employment status has no bearing on the appeal, and that even though he can currently make the military deposit, he has still been harmed by the administrative error that prevented him from making the deposit during his previous appointment because he might be required to pay additional interest on the amount of the deposit until the date the deposit is actually made. The appellant requested below that he be allowed to make the deposit, and that it be deemed paid as of the last day of his prior appointment. We agree that the administrative judge erred in not addressing this argument in the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge was correct that the appellant has the right to make the deposit because he is currently employed at the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department of Justice. If, however, the appellant was prevented from making a deposit before separation from the IRS due to administrative error, and if he suffered any pecuniary loss because of this error, then he should be permitted to make a belated deposit. We are unable to determine from the record, however, whether the appellant incurred any loss, in the form of additional interest, even if there was administrative error by the IRS. Section 842.307(a)(4), 5 C.F.R., states that "[i]nterest is charged to the date of deposit." Further, the CSRS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices (Handbook) (formerly Federal Personnel Manual Supplement, 830-1), indicates that, generally, there is no provision in law for the waiver of interest charged on military deposit accounts. <span class="Italic">See</span> Chapter 23, Section 23A3.1-5K (made applicable to FERS employees by Chapter 23, Section 23B3.1-2D). The Handbook also states, however, that under certain circumstances, if an agency error caused an employee to be liable for additional interest, the agency may pay interest on behalf of its employee. Chapter 23, Section 23A3.1-5K. There is no indication in other appeals, in which the Board has found administrative error and ordered OPM to allow an appellant to make a belated deposit for military service, whether interest on the deposit was assessed up to the date of actual payment, or through some earlier date. <span class="Italic">Cf., e.g., Julian v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 364, 369 (1996); <span class="Italic">Nunez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 326, 332-34 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we are unable to determine whether OPM is required to assess interest up until the date the deposit is made, we must remand this case to the administrative judge in order that the parties may submit evidence and argument on this issue. If the appellant is currently eligible to make the military deposit and if the administrative judge finds that interest must be assessed until the date of the deposit, and further finds that neither the Board nor OPM has the authority to set an earlier date through which interest will run in the event of administrative error, then the administrative judge must dismiss the appellant's appeal as moot. <span class="Italic">See Dellera v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 636, 642 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 82 F.3d 434 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). If the administrative judge finds that interest on a belated deposit would only be assessed up to the date of a finding of administrative error, or any other date prior to the actual making of the deposit, then she must adjudicate the issue of whether there was administrative error by the IRS under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.307(a)(3). In addition, even if the appellant cannot show harm, if he shows that he is not currently employed in a position in the federal service, or that he is not currently entitled to make the military deposit for another reason, because OPM did not make an administrative error determination in its reconsideration decision, the administrative judge must address that issue. If the administrative judge determines that the appellant was prevented from making the deposit by an administrative error, she shall set a date by which the appellant is allowed take a belated deposit for his post-1956 military service. <span class="Italic">Cf. Nunez</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 334<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also challenges OPM's statement in the reconsideration decision that his military service cannot be used to attain the five-year creditable service requirement for eligibility for an annuity. It is unclear whether OPM intended that statement to constitute another ground on which to deny the appellant's request to make a late deposit for his post-1956 military service. Because the appellant was reemployed in the federal service on July 16, 1996, and there is no indication that his service has since been interrupted, it appears that he has met the five-year creditable civilian service requirement. Accordingly, we need not decide this issue here. If the appellant alleges on remand that he has not yet met the five-year requirement, the administrative judge must address the appellant's contention that his two years of military service should count toward eligibility for an annuity.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In its decision, the Board found that, in concluding that the appellant was required to make a deposit for his military service while on LWOP in order to receive credit for his service between June 12, 2007, and January 5, 2008, OPM relied on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(c)(1)(B), which provides that an employee shall be allowed credit for each period of military service performed after December 31, 1956, and before the separation on which title to annuity is based, if a deposit is made with respect to such period. <span class="Italic">Whittacre</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 33, &#x00B6; 8. The Board pointed out, however, that &#x00A7; 8411(d), which provides that credit shall be allowed for leaves of absence without pay granted an employee while performing military service, does not itself require payment of a deposit to obtain service credit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board noted that OPM's regulations make no mention of a deposit requirement to obtain service credit for periods of service while in a military LWOP status, and that, while the regulations generally limit service credit for leaves of absence in excess of 6 months, they specifically provide that the 6-month limit does not apply while an individual is performing military service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM acknowledges in its petition for reconsideration that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8411(c)(1)(B) and 8411(d) are "seemingly incongruent," but urges that, under established rules of statutory construction, both provisions should be given effect. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Borden Co.</span>, 308 U.S. 188, 198 (1939). Specifically, OPM argues that there is a general rule against interpreting a statutory provision in derogation of another provision and courts have a "duty to construe statutes harmoniously" whenever possible. N. Singer, <span class="Italic">Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction</span> &#x00A7; 53.1 (6th ed. 2000). Where statutes are incongruent, "[t]he correct rule of interpretation is, that if diverse statutes relate to the same thing, they ought all to be taken into consi[d]eration in construing any one of them, and it is an established rule of law, that all acts <span class="Italic">in pari materia</span> are to be taken together, as if they were one law." <span class="Italic">United States v. Freeman</span>, 44 U.S. 556, 564 (1845). OPM argues that the two provisions in question in this case can both be given effect when they are considered along with other statutory provisions that the Board failed to consider.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Among the provisions that OPM asserts that the Board failed to consider are parts of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment <span id="Page_4102"></span>Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA). Pub. L. No 103-353, 108 Stat. 3149 (1994). Specifically, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4316(b)(3) and (4) provide that a person deemed to be on furlough or leave of absence while serving in the uniformed services shall not be entitled to any benefits to which he would not otherwise be entitled if he had remained continuously employed, and that he may be required to pay the employee cost, if any, of any funded benefit continued to the extent other employees on furlough or leave of absence are so required. Section 4318 of Title 38, which addresses pension benefits, provides in subsection (a) that, upon reemployment, individuals who were on LWOP for military service are considered not to have incurred a break in service for purposes of accruing benefits and for determining nonforfeitability of pension benefits. Subsection (b)(2) provides, however, that a person so reemployed shall be entitled to accrued benefits that are contingent on the making of, or derived from, employee contributions only to the extent the person makes payment to the plan with respect to such contributions, but that no such payment may exceed the amount the person would have been permitted or required to contribute had he remained continuously employed throughout the period of leave of absence. And, as pertains to the matter at issue in this case, another statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8422(e)(1)(B), provides that, where military service interrupts creditable civilian service and reemployment occurs on or after August 1, 1990, the deposit payable may not exceed the amount that would have been deducted and withheld from basic pay during civilian service if the employee had not performed the period of military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reading all of these statutory provisions together, we agree with OPM that where, as here, military service interrupts civilian service, a deposit not exceeding the amount that would have been deducted and withheld from his basic pay had he remained in civilian service during the period in question is required. <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984) (where Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, a reviewing forum should not simply impose its own construction of a statute, particularly where the administration of a congressionally created program necessarily requires an administrative agency to formulate policy and make rules to fill implicit and explicit gaps). Further, we note the Board's statement in the <span class="Italic">Whittacre</span> decision regarding the lack of a specific OPM regulation mentioning a deposit requirement to obtain credit for periods of service while in a military LWOP status. <span class="Italic">Whittacre</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 33, &#x00B6; 8. A regulation does provide that any period of time for which service credit under chapter 84 of title 5, U.S. Code, is specifically allowed by a provision of law is creditable subject to any applicable deposit requirements. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.303(c). As we have found, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(d) provides that creditable service shall be allowed for leaves of absence without pay granted an employee while performing military service, &#x00A7; 8411(c)(1)(B) provides that military service performed after December 31, 1956, and before an employee's separation is creditable if a deposit is made, and &#x00A7; 8422(e)(1)(B) provides for the way in which the amount of deposit is calculated where military service interrupts creditable civilian service and where reemployment occurs on or after August 1, 1990. We therefore find that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.303(c) implements these statutes to require the payment of a deposit under these circumstances. The appellant's argument that the fact that the 6-month limit generally applicable to service credit for leaves of absence unrelated to military service does not apply to an individual who is performing military service, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.304(a)(4), does not cause us to reach a contrary conclusion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reasoning in <span class="Italic">Whittacre, supra,</span> was confirmed in <span class="Italic">Faris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP), determining that the requirement for a military deposit did not contravene USERRA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Faris argues that the FERS statutory scheme, by requiring him to pay a deposit to receive FERS credit for periods of military service while he was on LWOP from his civilian job, denies him the USERRA-protected benefit of receiving FERS credit <span class="Italic">without</span> paying a deposit. Mr. Faris' contentions are defeated by the clear language of the applicable statutory provisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FERS statute provides that "an employee or Member shall be allowed credit for...<span class="Italic">each period of military service</span> performed after December 31, 1956...<span class="Italic">if a deposit</span> (including interest, if any) <span class="Italic">is made</span> with respect to such period in accordance with section 8422(e)." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(c)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Plainly, &#x00A7; 8411(c)(1)(B) requires that an employee seeking credit for a period of military service must make a deposit in order to have such a credit allowed. This unambiguous statutory language compels us to conclude that Mr. Faris is not entitled to credit without paying the deposit. <span class="Italic">See Consumer Prods. Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc</span>., 447 U.S. 102, 108 (1980) ("[T]he starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself. Absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In attempting to evade this straightforward analysis, Mr. Faris points to &#x00A7; 8411(d), which provides that "[c]redit under this chapter shall be allowed for leaves of absence without pay granted an employee while performing military service...." Mr. Faris argues he should be able to "claim rights to benefits" under this provision. However, reading the statute as a whole, as we must, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Corley v. United States</span>, 556 U.S. 303, 314 (2009) ("A statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions...."), &#x00A7; 8411(d) merely clarifies that an employee on LWOP status to perform military service is <span class="Italic">eligible</span> to receive FERS credit for his service. It does not absolve him of the obligation to comply with the conditions for obtaining such a credit, including making the deposit required by &#x00A7; 8411(c)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA does not support a different conclusion. To the contrary, the statute explicitly contemplates that "a person who is absent from a position of employment by reason of service in the uniformed services...<span class="Italic">may be required to pay the employee cost, if any, of any funded benefit continued</span>...." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4316(b)(1) &#x0026; (4) (emphasis added). Another provision of USERRA, &#x00A7; 4316(b)(6), further provides that "[t]he entitlement of a person to a right or benefit under an employee pension benefit plan is provided for under section 4318"; and &#x00A7; 4318 explains that "[a] person reemployed under this chapter shall be entitled to accrued benefits...that are contingent on the making of...employee contributions...<span class="Italic">only to the extent the person makes payment to the plan</span> with respect to such contributions...." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4318(b)(2) (emphasis added). Hence, USERRA is entirely consistent with the military deposit requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As Mr. Faris points out, and the USAF does not dispute, a civilian employee in LWOP status who is not serving in the military can receive FERS credit for up to six months in any calendar year without making a deposit. <span class="Italic">See Bain v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 978 F.2d 1227, 1230 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("Taken as a whole, the statutory scheme[ ] of FERS...allow[s] federal employees up to six months per year of retirement credit for leaves of absence...."). This does not make for a USERRA violation, however. As the USAF correctly responds, USERRA expressly provides that a person serving in the military while on LWOP status from their civil-service job may "be required to pay the employee cost, if any, of any funded benefit continued pursuant to paragraph (1) <span class="Italic">to the extent other employees on furlough or leave of absence are so required</span>." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4316(b)(1) &#x0026; (4) (emphasis added). For his USERRA claim, the pertinent comparison is between Mr. Faris' LWOP and employees "having similar seniority, status, and pay" who are on similar "furlough or leave of absence...." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4316(b)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">see also Tully v. Dep't of Just</span>., 481 F.3d 1367, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that "leave of absence" that "triggers a right to equivalent treatment" is one that is "comparable to the leave provided to the service member for military service," and rejecting petitioner's argument that he was entitled to "the best benefits available to any employee for any leave of absence"). Mr. Faris has not shown how such a comparison disfavors him. Moreover, as the USAF states, "employees on LWOP for reasons besides military service cannot receive more than six months of service credit in a calendar year, whereas employees on LWOP for military service do not face this limitation--a distinction favoring members of the military."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusions are consistent with <span class="Italic">Whittacre v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 114 (2013), on which the MSPB relied in declining to adopt Mr. Faris' interpretation of the relevant statutes. In <span class="Italic">Whittacre</span>, the MSPB considered the same statutes we have discussed here and held that when "military service interrupts civilian service, a [FERS] deposit not exceeding the amount that would have been deducted and withheld from his basic pay had he remained in civilian service during the period in question is required." 120 M.S.P.R. at 120.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the statutes required Mr. Faris to pay a deposit if he wished to receive FERS credit for his military service time, he was not entitled to receive FERS credit without making a deposit, and therefore Mr. Faris was not denied an employment benefit to which he was entitled. Accordingly, his USERRA claim fails, and the MSPB did not err in denying his request for corrective action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Faris</span> also determined that the appellant was not entitled to pay a deposit for FERS credit for service while he was on LWOP to participate in inactive duty National Guard training, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at ____:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5, &#x00A7; 8411(c)(1) allows for the accrual of FERS credit for military service. "Military service" is expressly defined as "active service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(31) ("[T]he term 'military service' means honorable active service...."). Therefore, Mr. Faris' inactive duty training is not eligible for FERS credit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer to the discussion of USERRA in Chapter 1, "Retirement Benefits."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There were appeals involving deposits that individuals sought to make for post-1956 military service that were blocked because they did not make timely elections. The appellants received negative reconsideration decisions from OPM and they appealed to the Board. The Board issued a lot of decisions stating that the deposits could be belatedly made because one or another of the forms used in the retirement process did not adequately explain the requirements of the deposit process and the deficiencies in the forms were equated to administrative error excusing the delay in making the deposits. Then, in <span class="Italic">King v. OPM</span>, 97 MSPR 307, 311-18 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-18 (2004), the Board revisited the issue and rewrote the law to avoid errors in retirement forms as administrative error:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4103"></span><span class="Italic">The history of post-1956 military service deposit cases</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1982, Congress provided employees who had post-1956 military service a chance to avoid a reduction in their CSRS benefits when they reached age 62 and began drawing SSA benefits if they had previously made a deposit to the CSRS fund for their post-1956 military service equal to seven percent of their total post-1956 military pay. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8332(j) and 8334(j). OPM's initial implementing regulations did not allow an annuitant to make a deposit for his post-1956 military service after he left federal employment. 47 Fed. Reg. 43,634 (1982) (interim regulations); 48 Fed. Reg. 38,781 (1983) (final regulations). Later, OPM amended its regulations to allow for postseparation deposits when the annuitant's failure to make the deposit before leaving federal employment was due to administrative error. 49 Fed. Reg. 20,631 (1984) (interim regulations); 57 Fed. Reg. 32,153 (1992) (final regulations). OPM has never defined the meaning of the term due to administrative error. It thus has been up to the Board to define what is meant by that term.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Several retirement forms relate to an employee's allegation that he failed to make a deposit for post-1956 military service due to administrative error, and the Board has considered those forms in adjudicating appeals that raise such a claim. Prior to the abolishment of the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) at the end of 1993, FPM Letter 831-83 required agencies to provide employees with a certification form stating: "I have read the information about the effect of not making a deposit for my post-1956 military service and I do NOT want to make the deposit. I understand that I can't change my decision after I retire." For example, in <span class="Italic">Cox v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 320, 323-24 (1996), <span class="Italic">Nunez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 326, 333 (1996), and <span class="Italic">Mopps v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 314, 319 (1996), the Board found that the failure to provide this certification constituted administrative error, regardless of any other notice the employee may have received concerning the deposit.<span class="Italic"> See also Perley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2001); <span class="Italic">Priano v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 35, &#x00B6; 9 (1999); <span class="Italic">Jacob v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 340, 344 (1996). The Board held in <span class="Italic">Drury v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 493 (1998), that this requirement applies only to retirements that took place on or before December 31, 1993. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Early versions of Standard Form (SF)-2801, the retirement application itself, provided no information about the deposit option. Thus, the Board held that OPM's processing of the early versions of the SF-2801 contained inadequate information about the election requirement and constituted administrative error. <span class="Italic">Owens v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. 543, 548 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM revised the SF-2801 in 1990 to include more information concerning the deposit for post-1956 military service. On the first page of the 1990 version, the SF-2801 requires prospective annuitants to indicate whether they have performed military service, and, if they have, to complete Schedule A. Schedule A contains the following question and explanation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If any of your military service occurred on or after January 1, 1957, have you paid a deposit to your agency for this service? (You must pay this deposit to your agency before separation. You cannot pay OPM after you retire.)<span class="Italic"> See</span> Section B of the instructions for the effect on your annuity if the deposition is not paid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section B of the instructions to the 1990 version of SF-2801 explains that prospective annuitants may pay a deposit to cover their post-1956 military service. The instructions state, in bold-face type: "The military service deposit must be paid to your agency while you are still employed." The instructions explain that if a deposit is not made to the CSRS fund prior to retirement and if the employee is eligible for SSA benefits, the appellant's CSRS annuity will be recomputed at age 62 to eliminate credit for the post-1956 military service. In <span class="Italic">Drury,</span> the Board found that the 1990 version of SF-2801 provides employees with sufficient notice of the opportunity to make a deposit and of the consequences for not making the deposit. <span class="Italic">Drury,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The revised OPM Form SF-2801 also contains Schedule D, entitled Agency Checklist. This portion of the retirement application, completed by the employing agency, is a means for it to ensure that the application is complete before it sends the application to OPM for processing. Section 8 of the Agency Checklist contains 18 questions (a through r) identifying documents attached or actions taken in connection with the application. The agency may answer each question by placing an "X" in the appropriate box for either "Yes" or "Not Applicable." Question 8.i. asks: "If post-1956 military service is involved and applicant has not made application to make a military service deposit, [is] OPM Form 1515 [attached?] " Question 8.j. asks: "If post 1956 military service deposit is not made, was applicant counseled about the effects of not paying the deposit?" The Agency Checklist does not require any signature, review or verification from or by the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's CSRS and FERS [Federal Employees' Retirement System] Handbook (OPM Handbook) provides that the Agency Checklist is "REQUIRED in all cases." Handbook, &#x00A7; 40B1.1-1. The Board held in<span class="Italic"> Cox</span> that an employing agency's failure to adhere to the mandatory requirements of a prior version of the Checklist constitutes administrative error justifying waiver of the deadline for making a deposit for post-1956 military service. <span class="Italic">Cox,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. at 323.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM Form 1515, "Service Credit Payments for Post-1956 Military Service," is a part of OPM's retirement application package and explains to the applicant that you must either make a deposit for the military service or have your annuity benefits reduced at age 62, repeating this information in its instructions. Form 1515 directs employees to SSA if they have questions about whether they might be eligible for SSA benefits, and to their employing agency if they have questions about making the deposit. The form also requires employees to choose between the following two elections: "I want to make (or complete) this deposit. I will make the necessary payment to my employing agency, or, I do not want to make (or complete) this deposit." The OPM Handbook states that Form 1515 is REQUIRED when a retiring employee had military service after 1956 and has not paid a military service deposit. Handbook, &#x00A7; 40B1.1-1. Form 1515 has been revised several times. The August 15, 1995 version contains the above-noted language. The current version, which appears to have come into use in April 1998, reads as follows: "I do not want to make (or complete) this deposit. I understand this decision is irrevocable." [Bold in original.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's case law may not have been clear regarding the effect of omitting Form 1515 from the application package. Early cases such as <span class="Italic">Cox</span> and <span class="Italic">Mopps</span> held that Form 1515 is required. <span class="Italic">Cox,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. at 322-23; <span class="Italic">Mopps,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. at 318. However, <span class="Italic">Cox</span> and <span class="Italic">Mopps</span> also involved the failure to provide the required FPM certification, which alone would have been enough to warrant a belated opportunity to make a deposit under <span class="Italic">Nunez,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. at 332-33, aside from any issue regarding any inaccuracies in or absence of the Agency Checklist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a more recent case, <span class="Italic">Davis v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 436, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2001), the Board found that the absence of Form 1515, coupled with the agency's certification on the Agency Checklist that Form 1515 was inapplicable, constituted administrative error warranting a belated opportunity to make a deposit. The Board made this holding even though the appellant was apprised of the deposit election by the current version of SF-2801. <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 436, &#x00B6; 3. The Board reached a similar conclusion in<span class="Italic"> Sutcliff v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6; 10 (2000), although that case involved the element of misinformation in addition to the omission of Form 1515. On the other hand, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Clarke v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 435 (1997), that Form 1515 was insufficient to adequately apprise the appellant of the consequences of failing to make a deposit for his post-1956 military service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 439.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The above history of the case law on what constitutes "administrative error" and what forms are adequate to apprise an appellant of the opportunity to make a deposit for post-1956 military service prompted the Board to request an advisory opinion from the Director of OPM pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(e)(1)(A) in <span class="Italic">King</span> and in<span class="Italic"> Grant.</span> The Board solicited OPM's and the parties' views about the meaning of the phrase "due to administrative error." In requesting the advisory opinion, the Board pointed out that its decision in <span class="Italic">Drury</span> held that the 1990 version of the SF-2801 is by itself sufficient to advise an individual of the military deposit requirement and the consequences of failing to make a deposit before separation. The Board also indicated that other decisions, such as <span class="Italic">Davis</span> and<span class="Italic"> Fromme,</span> found that the omission of Form 1515 or a Certification pursuant to FPM Letter 831-83 constitutes administrative error. The Board pointed out that some cases, for example <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> stated that administrative error automatically entitles the appellant to make a post-separation deposit, whereas other decisions like<span class="Italic"> Owens</span> concluded that the appellant must show his failure to make the deposit before separation was "due to" this error. The Board asked OPM to explain why it requires Form 1515 in addition to Form SF-2801, but does not find that the omission of Form 1515 is administrative error warranting the opportunity to make a post-separation deposit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM submitted an advisory opinion, which we have carefully considered. Although afforded the opportunity to respond to OPM's advisory opinion, the appellants in <span class="Italic">King</span> and in<span class="Italic"> Grant</span> did not do so. Upon consideration of OPM's advisory opinion and a review of the Board's case law, we reach the following conclusions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board will order OPM to allow an individual to make a post-separation deposit for post-1956 military service only if he shows that OPM or the employing agency committed administrative error in the processing of his application and that his failure to make the deposit prior to his separation was "due to," that is, caused by, that administrative error.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulation permits a postseparation deposit only when the failure to make the deposit before separation was "due to" an administrative error. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2104(a). Apart from its plain language, the history of this regulatory provision indicates that the administrative error exception should not be given an expansive scope. Public Law No. 97-253, enacted <span id="Page_4104"></span>in 1982, created the opportunity for individuals to receive credit for post-1956 military service under both CSRS and SSA by making a deposit for such service. As described above, OPM soon thereafter issued regulations to implement the deposit law. The initial regulations did not provide for post-separation deposits. Later, OPM amended its regulations to allow for post-separation deposits under very limited circumstances, that is, when failure to make the deposit before separation was due to administrative error. In announcing this change, OPM stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It was and remains OPM's intent to require employees to pay the deposit prior to separation, but it has come to our attention that certain individuals would be unfairly treated if there were no exception to this rule. In some cases, employees have been mistakenly advised by their employing agency that there would be an opportunity to pay [the] military deposit after retirement. In other cases, employees have not been able to collect the information they need to complete the application for military deposit prior to retirement. Also, during a transitional period following enactment of Pub. L. [No.] 97-253, military service deposits could be made by employees separating prior to October 1, 1983, directly to OPM and this was perhaps a source of confusion. While the law and regulations, if strictly applied, would prohibit these individuals from making a deposit after separation, such strict enforcement would work a hardship on many blameless persons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">49 Fed. Reg. at 20,631. OPM was thus trying to eliminate unfair[&#8197;] treat[ment] of blameless persons who were prevented from making a deposit before separation. Clearly OPM did not intend that anyone who could identify an irregularity in the processing of his retirement application would be allowed to make a post-separation deposit, but rather that the individual prove that his failure to make the deposit before separation was due to administrative error a very limited concept. Therefore, cases such as <span class="Italic">Davis, Perley, Fromme, Johnson, Priano,</span> and <span class="Italic">Horton v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 53 (1999), which permitted a postseparation deposit upon a showing of administrative error, without requiring that the failure to make the deposit prior to retirement was "caused by" or "due to" administrative error, will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">There is no administrative error when the employee is provided with and completes the 1990 version of OPM Form 2801 electing to either make or not make a deposit for his post-1956 military service</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, Schedule D, the Agency Checklist, is completed solely by the employing agency. It is intended as a means for helping the employing agency to complete a retirement application before it sends the application to OPM for processing. The agency, not the appellant, answers the questions on the Checklist by placing an "X" in the appropriate box for either "Yes" or "Not Applicable." The appellant does not sign or affirm to anything on the Checklist. Thus, we find that, while inaccuracies on the Checklist may be agency mistakes, they cannot amount to administrative error since the appellant has the opportunity through the other forms in his part of the application to decide and affirm whether or not he wants to make a deposit for his post-1956 military service. Thus, to the extent prior Board decisions such as <span class="Italic">Cox,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. at 323, may have suggested that errors on the Agency Checklist constitute administrative error warranting a belated opportunity to make a deposit for post-1956 military service, those decisions will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have described it, Form 1515 explains that an individual will receive CSRS credit for post-1956 military service after becoming eligible for SSA benefits only if he makes a deposit for that service before separation from federal service, and that failure to pay the deposit will result in a reduction in his CSRS annuity when he becomes eligible for SSA benefits. The form requires the individual to complete and sign an Employee Election in which he is given the choice between making a deposit and not making a deposit. The employing agency's failure to provide the appellant with this form was considered administrative error because the form states, in the Instructions to Employing Office, that [t]his form must be completed when an employee retires and agency records show that the employee has not made or completed a deposit for post-1956 military service.<span class="Italic"> See Owens,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. at 549 (an employing agency commits administrative error when it does not provide Form 1515 to a retiring employee who performed post-1956 military service). Moreover, OPM's Handbook requires an employing agency to have a retiring employee complete Form 1515 when the employee has post-1956 military service and the deposit has not already been completed. OPM Handbook, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1A1-1.1(A), 23A3.1-1(C)(2). Nonetheless, OPM's processing of a retirement application without Form 1515 will not in every case necessarily lead to administrative error which would allow the annuitant to make a deposit for his post-1956 military service after he has separated from federal service. If an employee is provided with full and complete information in the 1990 version of the retirement application, Form 2801, the failure to provide him with Form 1515, which is neither required by statute nor regulation, may not, depending on the circumstances, constitute administrative error which would allow him to make a post-separation deposit for his post-1956 military service which he expressly declined to make in his retirement application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In enacting the military deposit law, Congress stated that CSRS credit for post-1956 military service would automatically be lost when an annuitant became eligible for SSA benefits at age 62 unless the annuitant had previously made a deposit for that military service. We acknowledge this feature of the law, in combination with the OPM regulation requiring that the deposit be made before separation from federal service, may lead to unfortunate outcomes in some cases. However, it is not our place to rewrite the statute or OPM's regulations.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that the plain language and regulatory history of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2104(a) indicate that the administrative error exception should not be given expansive scope. 97 M.S.P.R. 307, &#x00B6; 15. OPM amended its regulations to allow for post-separation deposits under very limited circumstances where the failure to make the deposit was due to administrative error. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In amending its regulations to allow for post-separation deposits, OPM noted that certain individuals would be unfairly treated if there were no exception to the rule. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting Notice of Interim Military Service Deposit Regulations, 49 Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote2">OPM was thus trying to eliminate "unfair[&#8197;] treat[ment] " of "blameless" persons who were prevented from making a deposit before separation. Clearly OPM did not intend that anyone who could identify an irregularity in the processing of his retirement application would be allowed to make a post-separation deposit, but rather that the individual prove that his failure to make the deposit before separation was "due to" administrative error--a very limited concept.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">97 M.S.P.R. 307, &#x00B6; 15.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that the 1990 version of SF-2801 and its instructions are reasonably designed to inform an applicant of his opportunity to make a post-1956 military service deposit prior to his separation and of the consequences of failing to do so. <span class="Italic">King,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 307, &#x00B6; 7. The appellant completed and signed the 1990 version of SF-2801, checking "No" in response to the question on Schedule A asking whether he had paid his military deposit. On OPM Form 1515, he checked the option to decline the deposit and signed the form, indicating that he had read the information regarding his rights to make the military deposit. It is uncontested that the appellant did not receive the instructions for the SF-2801 and the record contains only two of the three pages of OPM Form 1515, without the complete instructions for that form. Nevertheless, even if we were to assume that the employing agency's failure to provide the instructions for these two forms constitutes administrative error, the appellant's failure to make the deposit was not due to any such error, as he admits that he failed to read the forms he was provided which adequately explained the consequences of failing to make the deposit before his June 30, 1999 separation. We agree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's decision not to request the instructions was the result of his failure to read the explanatory paragraphs on the forms. The appellant testified both that he could not remember whether he asked Ms. Bara for instructions and that he did not ask her for instructions because she could not give him instructions. We cannot find administrative error based upon these inconsistent statements. Had the appellant read the SF-2801, he would have known that Ms. Bara could have provided him with written instructions and that he need not rely upon her oral explanation. We further note that the agency's error in checking "Not applicable" in response to Question 8.j. of the Agency Checklist, Schedule D of the SF-2801, cannot amount to administrative error where the appellant was given the opportunity through other forms in his part of the application to decide and affirm whether or not he wanted to make a deposit. <span class="Italic">See King,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 307, &#x00B6; 16 (while inaccuracies on Schedule D of SF-2801, the Agency Checklist, may be agency mistakes, they cannot amount to administrative error since the appellant has the opportunity through other forms in his part of the application to decide and affirm whether he wishes to make the deposit).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an annuitant receives full and fair notice of the requirement to make a deposit, the government is not required to inform an annuitant about the dollar consequences of electing not to make the deposit. <span class="Italic">Collins v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]hen an employee, at the time of an election, asks for information regarding the amount of the military deposit or the consequences of failing to make the deposit, the government commits administrative error...if its response either misrepresents the dollar amounts in question or is so indirect, inaccurate, or incomplete as to confuse or mislead the employee as to the amount of the deposit or the effect of any failure to make the deposit on the annuity recalculation. The government will best avoid administrative error by giving the individual a direct answer and providing the exact amount needed for the deposit as well as at least a reasonably accurate estimate of the annuity adjustment likely to result from a decision not to make a deposit. These numbers should be readily available to the government and normally will impose no unreasonable burden upon it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1349.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has failed to show that his employing agency is responsible for his professed belief that his Social Security benefits, rather than his CSRS annuity, would be reduced at age 62 if he did not make the deposit. <span class="Italic">Cf. McCrary,</span> 459 F.3d at 1349 (agency retirement counselor affirmatively misled the appellant in response to a direct inquiry about the dollar consequences of the deposit requirement). The appellant and his wife provided competing explanations as to how he came to believe that his Social Security benefit would be reduced if he did not pay the deposit. According to the appellant and his wife, he was so informed by an unknown individual in civilian personnel in 1988, by other people at McChord AFB, by someone named Barbara in McChord AFB's civilian personnel office at the time of his retirement, and by Ms. Bara. In addition, he testified that he "presumed" it would come out of his Social Security check. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This vague and conflicting testimony is not sufficient to support a finding of administrative error, particularly where the SF-2801 and OPM Form 1515 correctly informed the appellant of the consequences of his failure to make a deposit prior to his separation. <span class="Italic">Cf. McCrary,</span> 459 F.3d at 1348-49. The explanatory paragraph on Schedule A of the form itself referred to "the effect <span class="Italic">on your annuity</span> if the deposit is not paid." The explanatory paragraph on OPM Form 1515 informed the appellant that he must either make the deposit "or have [his] <span class="Italic">annuity</span> benefits reduced at age 62."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's employing agency nonetheless did commit administrative error when Ms. Bara, in response to the appellant's direct inquiry, failed to inform the appellant of the amount of his deposit. <span class="Italic">See McCrary,</span> 459 F.3d at 1349 (when an employee asks for information regarding the amount of the military deposit, "[t]he government will best avoid administrative error by giving the individual a direct answer and providing the exact amount needed for the deposit"). Specifically, the appellant testified that he asked Ms. Bara the amount he needed to pay back and that Ms. Bara did not provide him with any figures, did not know how to calculate the deposit amount, and referred him to the "military side." This administrative error does not justify a waiver of the deadline for making the deposit, however, because the appellant did not show that his failure to make the deposit was "due to" the lack of specific information about the amount of the deposit. <span class="Italic">See Owens,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. at 548 (appellant was not entitled to waiver of deposit deadline where he did not establish that his failure to make the deposit was "due to" the employing agency's administrative error). The appellant testified that his military pay was less than $1,200 per year, and he conceded that he knew the deposit would have been a small amount. He also had page 2 of OPM Form 1515, which explicitly informed him that the deposit was 7 percent of his military basic pay. He further testified that he figured he could work more hours after he retired and make up the difference in his Social Security benefit. Had the appellant read the relevant portions of the SF-2801 and OPM Form 1515, he would have been alerted to the fact that his annuity would be affected by his failure to make the deposit. Thus, the appellant's own testimony shows that, although he knew that the deposit was only a small amount, he decided not to make the deposit based upon his mistaken belief that he could make up the reduction in his Social Security benefit. The appellant's "mistake" was caused by his failure to read the forms he executed rather than any error by OPM or his employing agency. Under these facts, we cannot find that the appellant's failure to make the deposit was "due to" administrative error. <span class="Italic">See Owens,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. at 548.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM regulations originally required the employee to both file the application for deposit and make the payment to the employing agency before separation from the service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 47 Fed. Reg. 43,634 (1982). OPM amended its regulations, retroactive to October 1, 1983, however, to allow individuals who had not made the deposit before separation because of administrative error to make the deposit during a "grace period" that would terminate when OPM takes final action on the retirement claim. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.2104(a), 831.2107(a)(1). When OPM rules that an employee has not been given proper notice or opportunity to make the deposit before separation, it will set a time limit within which the individual may make the deposit. If the Board determines that OPM failed to recognize an administrative error, the Board will, in effect, extend the "grace period" by ordering OPM to set a time limit within which the employee may make the deposit. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cox v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 320, 325 (1996); <span class="Italic">Jacob</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 345; <span class="Italic">Julian v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nunez, supra,</span> and related decisions involved "administrative error" based on failure of employing agencies to obtain the certification described in FPM Letter 831-83 to the effect that a retiring employee would affirmatively certify that he did not want to make a deposit for post-1956 military service. The FPM was abolished in December of 1993. After that, there was no mandatory certification or checklist requirement in effect, and therefore, no related certification requirement that the employing agency was required to follow. There was still an obligation of OPM or the employing agency to inform the employee of the opportunity to make a deposit and the consequences for not doing so. That requirement was met, however, by Schedule A of the OPM 1990 version of the retirement application that asks the employee if he has made a deposit for military service after January 1, 1957, informs the employee that he must make the payment to the employing agency before separation, and states that the payment cannot be made to OPM after retirement. The information on the form is stated in the form of blocks of information with areas for check marks. The Board determined that the provisions in the retirement form and attached instructions were reasonably designed to inform an applicant of the opportunity to make the deposit and the results of not doing so. Despite the clarity, if the answers provided by the appellant would have made apparent to an OPM review that clarification was necessary, the appellant would be entitled to correct the application within a time period set by OPM. <span class="Italic">Drury v. OPM</span>, 79 MSPR 493, 497-500 (1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Service credit toward retirement for military service is statutory, and it accrues only before civil service, <span class="Italic">Huskey v. OPM</span>, 27 MSPR 363, 364-65 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official found that the appellant's service with PHS from July 1, 1960, through March 3, 1963, constituted military service under the Public Health Service Commission Corps Personnel Act of 1960 (hereinafter "Act"). That Act provided that the term "uniformed service" included the Public Health Service. The presiding official found further that, under civil service retirement law, military service is creditable for civil service retirement only if it was performed before the date of separation on which the annuity was based. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(c). Because the appellant had no civilian service performed after June 30, 1960, the presiding official concluded that OPM was correct in not crediting her for the service from July 1, 1960, through March 3, 1963.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that the presiding official erroneously interpreted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(c) in holding that military service following separation from the civil service is not creditable for purposes of determining civil service retirement benefits. That section of the statute states, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an employee or member shall be allowed credit for periods of military service <span class="Italic">before</span> the date of the separation on which title to annuity is based....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[Emphasis added.] Thus, on its face, the statute provides that military service will be credited only when that service occurred before the date of separation from the civil service. It does not provide credit for post-separation military service. The appellant has not provided support for her contrary interpretation that her service with the PHS between July 1, 1960, and March 3, 1963, should be credited in a manner which is inconsistent with a plain reading of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(c). Nor can we discern any basis for doing so. Therefore, we find the presiding official did not err in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant finally contends that her service for the time in question falls within the exception provided by section 6(b) of the Act which allows credit for service with the PHS prior to July 1, 1960, to be subject to the Civil Service Retirement Act. This argument is misplaced. The period for which the appellant seeks credit for her civil service benefits occurred <span class="Italic">after</span> June 30, 1960. Thus, the exception for service <span class="Italic">prior</span> to July 1, 1960, would not apply to her PHS service. Furthermore, the exception explicitly states that, in order to credit service with PHS prior to July 1, 1960, to civil service retirement, the employee must waive her rights to have such service included for purposes of computing the amount of her retired pay from the PHS. The record does not contain mention of any such waiver by the appellant. We therefore find she does not qualify for the statutory exception, as claimed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Military service that interrupts civil service employment during a time of war is creditable, but the position held prior to military service must be in a covered civil service position, <span class="Italic">McGrath v. OPM</span>, 32 MSPR 235, 238-39 (1987):</p>

The appellant entered active duty in the Army on November 28, 1942. Although the Office of Personnel Management found that the appellant's service with the Department of Agriculture was creditable, it held that the appellant was not entitled to treat his wartime military service as a military furlough because the appellant's position with the Department of Agriculture was not a "covered" position, one from which deductions were made from his salary and paid into the Civil Service Retirement System. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Supplement 831-1, Subchapter S3-1, which defines "creditable service" as, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, Federal civilian service performed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a). "Covered service" is service performed by all employees except those specifically excluded by law or OPM regulation on the basis of the nature of their appointment.

<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no evidence that the appellant's position with the Department of Agriculture was covered under the Civil Service Retirement System <span id="Page_4107"></span>or that retirement deductions were taken from the appellant's pay.

Thus, although the appellant's service with the Department of Agriculture met the Office of Personnel Management's standards for being creditable toward retirement, the appellant has not presented preponderant evidence that his position was a covered position which would invoke the provisions allowing military service to be considered as a military furlough.</p>

OPM</span>, 21 MSPR 287, 288-89 (1984), sketched the determinants for service credit for a period of military service following civil service when the employee cannot return to the civilian position by reason of injuries suffered in military service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant began his Federal service with the Department of Commerce on January 2, 1941, transferred to the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 27, 1941, was employed the following day by the Department of the Navy as a Machinist, entered military service (Army) about May 19, 1942, and was honorably discharged from the Army on October 5, 1945. He was separated by the Navy on March 26, 1946, without having been restored to his former Machinist position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the presiding official found that, because the appellant's restoration to his civilian position was prevented because of his injuries incurred while in the military service, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> through no fault of his own, his military service time (May 19, 1942, to October 5, 1945) was creditable service under <span class="Italic">Nordstrom v. United States,</span> 342 F.2d 55, 61-62 (Ct. Cl. 1965). However, he found that under Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Supplement 831-1, subchapter S3-6d, since the appellant failed to return to his former civilian position following his discharge from the Army, his separation date was considered to be October 5, 1945, the date of his military discharge, which gave him less than the requisite five years of creditable service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant states that, upon his release from the Army, he sent a letter to the Navy explaining that, because of his combat injuries, he was unable to perform the Machinist duties of his former position. He thereafter signed a resignation form and returned it to the Navy. He argues that his situation is not unlike that involved in <span class="Italic">Nordstrom, supra,</span> where the court held that an employee-soldier need not be restored to his former civilian position in order to obtain eligibility for retirement benefits, so long as the failure to be restored is through no fault of the employee-soldier. The petition for review is hereby GRANTED under 5 U.S.C. Section 7701(e)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to Minute 2 (January 28, 1959) of the former U.S. Civil Service Commission (now OPM), service credit following military service was recognized, but only where the employee was entitled to restoration to his civilian position by law and was actually restored. FPM Supplement 831-1, subchapter S3-6d, provides that an employee who, following discharge from the military service, fails to return to his civilian position, "is considered for retirement purposes to have been voluntarily separated from the civilian service at the expiration of five years of military furlough or as of the date of release from active duty, whichever occurs first...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the presiding official found that the appellant's inability to be reinstated to his Machinist position was through no fault of his own. Further, as we recently held in a similar case, "(s)ince appellant could not reasonably avoid the impediment to his reinstatement, the actual restoration requirement (under FPM Supplement 831-1, subch. S3-6d) is inapplicable and the period from his release from service to his resignation is creditable for retirement purposes." <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 19 MSPR 43 at 45 (1984). <span class="Italic">See Bailey v. United States,</span> 511 F.2d 540, 548 (Ct. Cl. 1975); and <span class="Italic">Nordstrom, supra.</span> Therefore, since the appellant's Federal service from January 2, 1941, until the effective date of his resignation on March 26, 1946, exceeded the five-year eligibility requirement under 5 U.S.C. Section 8333(a), we find that he is entitled to a retirement annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the Servicemen's and Veterans' Survivor Benefits Act (SVSBA), Pub.L. No. 84-881 (1956), a statute that included uniformed military personnel in the contributory Social Security System for the first time, supplementing military retirement and survivors benefits, required that for employees who are hired after October 1, 1982, military service credits earned after 1956 must be applied toward social security benefits, not civil service retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Karpen v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 422, 425 (1989). When an employee made a discretionary deposit for military service that was not necessary to secure his social security benefits, the Board required OPM to provide a refund to him when he relied on incorrect information from his agency and from OPM in first making the deposit. <span class="Italic">Froom v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(c), creditable service for purposes of computing a retirement annuity includes, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "each period of military service performed after December 31, 1956, and before the separation on which title to annuity is based, if a deposit (including interest, if any) is made with respect to such period in accordance with section 8422(e)."[4] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(c)(1)(B). Section 8411(c) further provides that "[i]f an employee or Member is awarded retired pay based on any period of military service, the service of the employee or Member may not include credit for such period of military service unless the retired pay is awarded...[b]ased on a service-connected disability...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(c)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Section 8422(e) of Title 5 of the U.S. Code pertains to deposits made for military service under FERS, the system under which the appellant retired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 30, 1999, the appellant paid the requisite deposit of $697.32 for military service he performed after December 31, 1956, specifically for the period from October 14, 1966, through February 26, 1971. The appellant's Certified Summary of Federal Service states that the appellant "receive[s] military retired pay[.] "The appellant appears to be operating under the belief that he waived his military retired pay in order to increase his FERS annuity. However, his Certified Summary of Federal Service states that the appellant has not "waived military retired pay to credit military service for FERS retirement. Moreover, in his Application for Immediate Retirement, signed by the appellant on January 19, 1999, he checked the box for "Yes (Complete Schedule B and attach to this form)" in response to whether he was receiving or had applied for military retired pay. On Schedule B of his Application for Immediate Retirement, the appellant checked the boxes for "Yes" in response to whether he was receiving or had applied for military retired pay and to whether his military retired pay was awarded for a disability incurred in combat. He checked the box for "No" in response to whether he was "waiving [his] military retired pay...in order to receive credit for military service for FERS retirement benefits."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, while 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(c)(2) provides that a member who is awarded military retired pay may not include credit for such period of military service, it also provides an exception when the retired pay is awarded based on a service-connected disability. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(c)(2)(A). It is undisputed that the appellant has a service-connected disability. Accordingly, because the appellant's military retired pay was awarded based on a service-connected disability, he was not required to waive, nor is there any evidence that he waived, his military retired pay in order to include credit for his period of military service in his FERS annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CRSC was established effective May 31, 2003, to provide special compensation to members of the uniformed services who have military retired pay reduced by reason of receiving Department of Veterans Administration (VA) disability compensation where a portion of such VA compensation is the result of disabilities that are combat-related. DOD Financial Management Regulations (DODFMR), Volume (Vol.) 7B, Chapter (Ch.) 63 "Combat-Related Special Compensation," &#x00B6; 630101.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the appellant and the administrative judge were mistaken in assuming that the above-quoted excerpt from Shift Colors applied to the appellant and that the appellant was required to separate his military time from his civil service retirement in order to be eligible for CRSC benefits. As noted above, CRSC was established to provide special compensation to members of the uniformed services who have retired pay reduced by reason of receiving VA disability compensation where a portion of such VA compensation is the result of disabilities that are combat-related. While the appellant's military retired pay may have been reduced or offset due to his receipt of VA disability compensation, there is no evidence in the record that suggests that the appellant waived his military retired pay in order to credit military service for the purposes of a civil service retirement, which is the type of waiver to which paragraph 630503(B) applies. <span class="Italic">See</span> DODFMR, Vol. 7B, Ch. 63, &#x00B6; 630503(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, the appellant paid a deposit of $697.32 in order to receive credit for the military service he performed after December 31, 1956, and he was not required to waive his military retired pay in order to credit military service for the purposes of computing his FERS retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8411(c)(1)(B), (c)(2)(A). Because the appellant never waived his military retired pay in order to credit his military service, as such a waiver was unnecessary under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(c)(2)(A) as fully discussed above, paragraph 630503(B) is inapplicable to the instant circumstances. Therefore, because the appellant never waived his military retired pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(c)(2)(A) and paragraph 630503(B), there is no waiver to be revoked by the appellant or approved by OPM nor must the appellant request OPM to separate his military time from his civil service retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> DODFMR, Vol. 7B, Ch. 63, &#x00B6; 630503(B)(2).</p>

OPM credited him with three years, ten months, and twenty-two days of civilian service at the Watervliet Arsenal in New York between 1942 and 1948, but found that he was not eligible for an annuity because he failed to meet the maximum five years of civilian service eligibility requirement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333.[3] OPM found that the appellant's military service between June 5, 1943, and February 22, 1946, could not be credited as civilian service.

The record indicates that the appellant left his civilian position in June 1943, during World War II, to enter military service and returned to his civilian position at the Watervliet Arsenal immediately upon being discharged from the military. The record further shows that his civilian position was covered under the civil service retirement system, and that the appellant did not apply for and receive a lump-sum credit for his retirement contributions. Therefore, we find that the appellant was entitled under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(g) to have his military service considered as civilian service, and thus, he has satisfied the five years minimum civilian service requirement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8338(a).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was employed with the Department of Army from May 1966, through October 1966. During this time, he was covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). The appellant then served as an enlisted member of the United States Army from October 1966, through October 1968 and from September 1972, through March 1983. Finally, the appellant began working for the Department of Commerce in February 1984, where he remained until January 2003. While employed with the Department of Commerce, the appellant was covered by the Federal Employee's Retirement System (FERS), and he made the necessary deposit for his military service to be counted towards that FERS annuity computation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.306(a)(2) (indicating that post-1956 military service is creditable subject to the employee making a qualifying deposit).</p>

Following retirement, OPM notified the appellant that he would receive an annuity supplement as part of his FERS retirement benefit to bridge the gap until he became eligible for Social Security benefits.

OPM responded with an explanation, including the fact that the appellant's military service was not counted towards his annuity supplement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submitted a request that OPM include his military service in the calculation of his annuity supplement, but OPM denied that request in February 2011. The appellant requested reconsideration, but in February 2013, OPM affirmed its initial decision.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8421, a retiree who is entitled to an annuity may be eligible for an annuity supplement prior to age 62. In part, the calculation of that annuity supplement is based on an annuitant's total years of service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8421(b)(3)(A). However, the relevant statutory provision specifies that "the term 'service' does not include military service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8421(b)(4)(C). OPM's regulations implementing FERS similarly provide that the annuity supplement calculation includes "total creditable service under FERS, excluding military service not performed during an absence of leave without pay from civilian service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.504(a)(1). "Military service" includes honorable active service in the armed forces. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(31). The appellant's military service qualifies under this definition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant facts of this case are indistinguishable from those in <span class="Italic">James v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 239 (1999).

The Board rejected Mr. James' argument, finding that an annuity supplement is based in part on the annuitant's "total years of service," but that the term "service" excludes military service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8421(b)(C)(4).

<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial appeal, and on petition for review, the appellant asserts that his military service should be counted in the calculation of his annuity supplement. However, in making this argument, the appellant has failed to recognize the distinction between the statutory and regulatory provisions for a basic annuity and those for an annuity supplement. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(c)(1)(B), <span class="Italic">and</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.306(a)(2) (providing that, for the purposes of a basic annuity, creditable service includes post-1956 military service if an appropriate deposit is made), <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8421(b)(4)(C), <span class="Italic">and</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.504(a)(1) (providing that, for the purposes of an annuity supplement, military service is excluded from the calculation unless it was performed during an absence of leave without pay from civilian service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the record suggests that the appellant submitted a deposit for his post-1956 military service, that deposit does not affect the calculation of his annuity supplement. The law requires that his military service be excluded from that calculation....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Service credit under CSRS for military service is not allowed if the employee is receiving a military retirement based on the same service, according to <span class="Italic">Jeffrey v. OPM</span>, 28 MSPR 81, 84-85 (1985), involving time spent by the appellant as a midshipman at the Naval Academy:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Judicial interpretations of the relevant pre-1956 statutory language have consistently concluded that Congress only sought to bar double retirement credit for periods of military service. The courts found that Congress only sought to bar civil service retirement credit for periods of military service actually credited toward military retirement. The change in the applicable statutory language made by Congress in 1956 and its legislative history is insufficient to impute to Congress an intent to change the pre-existing judicial interpretations under which OPM admits appellant would be entitled to retirement service credit. Indeed, as appellant has pointed out, what legislative history of the 1956 change does exist indicates that Congress did not intend to change the then existing law with regard to the crediting of military service for retirement purposes. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1956 <span class="Italic">U.S. Code Cong. and Ad. News,</span> 3825, 3728.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We, therefore, conclude that the presiding official correctly determined that appellant is entitled to service credit for the period in question. As the courts have stated, Congress intended to prevent dual retirement credit for time spent in the military service and therefore precluded, except under circumstances not relevant here, an individual from receiving retirement service credit for civil service retirement purposes if he or she was receiving a military retirement based upon the same service. <span class="Italic">Bailey v. U.S.,</span> 511 F.2d 540 (Ct. Cl. 1975); <span class="Italic">Hobson v. U.S.,</span> 151 Ct. Cl. 201 (1960); <span class="Italic">Bond vs. U.S.,</span> 135 F. Supp. 433 (Ct. Cl. 1955). There is no indication that Congress sought to preclude civilian retirement service credit for periods of military service which are not the basis of an individual's military retirement annuity. Since 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 971 specifically excludes service at a military academy from inclusion in calculating military retirement, it is clear that appellant would not receive double credit for his service as a midshipman.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an individual is receiving military retirement pay, it appears that service credit is not allowed for the underlying military service unless the military retirement was awarded for a disability incurred in combat "or as a result of an instrumentality of war." In an overpayment case, <span class="Italic">Dickson v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 465, 467 (1988), the Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying for immediate retirement, appellant had indicated on his retirement application that his military-retirement pay was not for "a disability incurred in combat or caused by an instrumentality of war."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> OPM nevertheless credited his military service in computing his civil-service-retirement (CSR) annuity payments, despite the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(c) prohibiting the inclusion of such military service, unless the military-retired pay is based on that type of disability.[2] <span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;It has been held that the purpose of this provision is to eliminate dual credit for military service for which retirement pay has been awarded, except if the pay was awarded for a disability incurred in combat or as the result of an instrumentality of war. <span class="Italic">See generally Bailey v. United States,</span> 511 F.2d 540 (Ct. Cl. 1975); <span class="Italic">Jeffrey v. Office of Personnel Management</span> 21 M.S.P.R. 81, 84 (1985), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Horner v. Jeffrey,</span> 823 F.2d 1521 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Analogous language is found elsewhere in Title 5. Specifically, such language is found at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3501(a)(3)(A)(i)-(ii) (definition of preference eligible); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5532(d)(1)(A)-(B) (exception from dual salary payment prohibitions); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6303(a)(3)(A)(i)-(ii) (exemption from limitations on dual service credit for annual leave purposes). For a discussion of the legislative origins and general purpose of these provisions, <span class="Italic">see</span> 50 Comp. Gen. 480 (1971); 48 Comp. Gen. 219 (1968).</p>

OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 470, 474 (1991) (additional discussion of general statutory preclusion of dual credit for military service covered by military retired pay and civil service under 5 USC 8332(c)); <span class="Italic">Black v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 544, 546-47 (1988) ("OPM's action was proper because OPM lacked the authority to revoke the appellant's waiver of military retired pay. Absent a final decision from OPM, the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.110. Accordingly, the appellant's recourse is to seek revocation of his waiver of military retired pay from the Department of the Air Force."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. OPM</span>, 102 MSPR 589, 596 &#x00B6; 15, 2006 MSPB 212 (2006) ("In summary, at the time the appellant retired, he waived his military retired pay in order to qualify for immediate retirement and that waiver remains in effect. By operation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(c)(4), his waiver acts as consent to OPM's deducting, in favor of his former spouse, the same dollar amount she had previously been receiving from his military retired pay. As the statute requires, this was calculated without regard for the appellant's civilian service. At the time of his retirement, the appellant elected not to make a deposit into CSRS for his 20 years of military service, so that his CSRS annuity was reduced, once he reached age 62 and became eligible for Social Security benefits, to eliminate credit for that military service. This elimination of credit for his military service and reduction of his CSRS annuity do not affect the operation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(c)(4) as consent for the continued payments to his former spouse.")</p>
