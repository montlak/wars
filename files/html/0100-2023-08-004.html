<h2 class="h2" id="sec1-5"><span class="space">II.</span> MSPB ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATIVE OPERATION</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">The 1978 Civil Service Reform Act created a group of administrative agencies: the MSPB, the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the Office of Special Counsel, and the Office of Personnel Management. An associated presidential reorganization plan transferred to EEOC from the Civil Service Commission (replaced by the Office of Personnel Management) responsibility for regulating and adjudicating federal sector EEO complaints. The MSPB--the focus of this <span class="Italic">Guide</span>--is an independent federal agency in the Executive Branch. It is not a court. Its decisions may be reviewable in courts established under Article III of the federal constitution. <span class="Italic">Parker v. DLA</span>, 1 MSPR 505, 518, 1 MSPB 489 (1980), described the Board's adjudicatory functions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the Board is not a Court of Appeals but rather is itself an administrative establishment within the Executive Branch, albeit one exercising independent quasi-judicial functions. It is the Board's decision, not the agency's, that constitutes an "adjudication," 5 USC 1205(a)(1), which must be articulated in a reasoned opinion providing an adequate basis for review by a Court of Appeals.... The mere fact that the agency's decision is appealable to the Board does not limit the Board's scope of review to that of an appellate court, nor does it transform the agency's decision into one that must meet adjudicatory standards which will facilitate appellate review. In enacting the Civil Service Reform Act, Congress found it already difficult to take and sustain adverse personnel decisions in the federal bureaucracy; requiring agency managers to write judicial opinions justifying each such decision would make them well nigh impossible.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cases, often referred to as appeals, come to the Board in several ways. Most cases originate as appeals from actions taken against employees or directly affecting their interests, e.g., removals, long-term suspensions, demotions, personnel actions resulting from reductions in force, and determinations by the Office of Personnel Management concerning annuity entitlements. Some appeals come to the Board after first traversing another adjudication system, examples being actions that are otherwise within the Board's jurisdiction but are first considered through the agency EEO process or through a collectively bargained grievance and arbitration process. Other cases start out as complaints rather than as appeals from agency actions: disciplinary or corrective action complaints by OSC; complaints against administrative law judges by their employing agencies; Individual Right of Action cases brought by whistleblowers who assert the retaliatory loss of employment or its benefits; allegations by individuals with military service who complain of discrimination because of their past or present military service or as to denial of proper restoration rights following military service; and claims by veterans protesting the loss or denial of an employment benefit or preference earned through past military service and conferred by statute.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board summarizes its operations in its FY 2022 <span class="Italic">Congressional Budget Justification</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority of cases brought to the Board are appeals of adverse actions--that is, removals, suspensions of more than 14 days, reductions in grade or pay, and furloughs of 30 days or less. The next largest number of cases involves appeals of OPM and some agency determinations in retirement matters. Congress has given the Board jurisdiction to hear cases and complaints filed under a variety of other laws, including the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>; the Veterans Employment Opportunity Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>; the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), Pub. L. No. 101-12; the WPEA, Pub. L.No. 112-199; the VA Accountability and the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, Pub. L. No. 115-41; the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017, Pub. L. No. 115-73; and additional authorities listed in the regulation set out at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other types of actions that may be appealed to the Board include: performance-based removals or reductions in grade; denials of within-grade salary increases; RIF actions; suitability determinations; OPM employment practices (the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments); denials of restoration or reemployment rights; and certain terminations of probationary employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant files an appeal with the appropriate MSPB regional or field office having geographical jurisdiction. An AJ in the office ensures that the parties receive the procedures called for in the law and MSPB's regulations and, after providing a full opportunity to develop the record on all relevant matters, issues an initial decision. Since March 2020, the regional and field offices have adjusted their processes and procedures to the virtual environment and have continued to adjudicate appeals without interruption. Unless a party files a PFR with the Board, the initial decision becomes final 35 days after issuance. Any party, OPM, or OSC may petition the full Board in Washington, D.C. to review the initial decision. When a PFR is filed, the Board's decision on a the PFR constitutes the final administrative decision on the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's final decision, whether it is an initial decision of an AJ that has become final or the Board's decision on a PFR, may be appealed to the Federal Circuit; or, in cases involving allegations of discrimination, to a U.S. district court or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). In addition, certain cases involving allegations of reprisal for whistleblowing may be appealed to any of the U.S. circuit courts of appeals with competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If a party believes that the other party is not complying with an MSPB order or a settlement agreement entered into the record for MSPB enforcement, the party can file a petition for enforcement with the regional or field office that issued the initial decision. Once the AJ issues an initial decision, which may find compliance, non-compliance, or partial compliance, depending on the number of issues raised, either party may file a PFR with the full Board. Additionally, even if neither party file a PFR of an initial decision finding non-compliance, MSPB's regulations require that the case be referred to the full Board to ensure that the non-complying party has reached compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to adjudicating cases on the merits, MSPB also provides several ADR services to assist parties in resolving their cases. Use of these services is voluntary, provides the parties more control of the process, and can result in effective resolution of a case. In addition, resolving a case through ADR procedures can save time and reduce costs to the appellant, agency, MSPB, and Government-wide as compared to the more formal regulations and procedures involved with adjudication on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_6"></span>Throughout the <span class="Italic">Guide</span>, reference is made to "appeals" brought by individuals. But other terminology creeps into our text because other terms were applied in years past that distinguished appeals (challenges to adverse actions or reductions in force) and petitions for remedial action (Individual Right of Action cases brought by protected whistleblowers, and VEOA or USERRA cases brought to protect individuals against discrimination or loss of employment benefits based on their military status or veterans preference entitlements), a distinction discussed in <span class="Italic">Bodus v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 82 MSPR 508, 516 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16 (1999). Now, unless the Board is considering a complaint by the Office of Special Counsel seeking disciplinary or corrective action, an agency complaint seeking disciplinary action against an administrative law judge, a request for review of an arbitrator's award, or a specialized proceeding involving review of employment practices, we will speak of appeals in this <span class="Italic">Guide</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most, but not all, of the Board's cases are appeals initially considered and heard by administrative judges (AJs) in regional and field offices throughout the nation. When the Board was first established, the Board's regional adjudicators, who are classified as attorney examiners, were called presiding officials. Times changed. Now the attorney examiners are titled administrative judges, and we will refer to them as AJs or judges in this <span class="Italic">Guide</span>. The AJ's decision, known as an "initial decision," may be appealed through a "petition for review" (PFR) to the Board's headquarters, a process described in <a href="0100-2023-12-001.html#sec5-1">Chapter 5</a>. The PFR triggers a record review by attorneys at the Board's headquarters offices in Washington. That review unit is known as the Office of Appeals Counsel (OAC). OAC recommendations are forwarded to the three Board members, each of whom has a small staff of attorneys who may review those recommendations and who advise the Board member concerning disposition of the case. Supplied with the recommendations of OAC and his or her own staff, each Board member votes on the disposition of a petition for review. The majority disposition of the Board members results in a decision by the Board constituting, in most cases, the final administrative determination of the Board. The Board may, however, decide that further work on the case is required by the AJ and, when that occurs, the Board remands the appeal to the regional or field office with instructions for the AJ to follow in the subsequent remand adjudication. Some cases, generally complaints by OSC, complaints against administrative law judges, and requests for review of arbitration awards (a process described in <a href="0100-2023-12-001.html#sec5-1">Chapter 5</a>), originate at the Board headquarters establishment rather than at the regional or field office level. OSC complaints and agency complaints against ALJs are referred by the Board to an administrative law judge (ALJ), whose decision is subject to review by the Board in the same manner as an initial decision by an AJ. Board final decisions may be reviewed, depending on the nature of the case and the nature of the claims or defenses asserted, by EEOC, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in U.S. district courts, or on appeal from a district court or in whistleblowing cases in either the Federal Circuit or in a regional circuit court of appeals. To describe the judicial review scheme as complex is no overstatement. It is discussed in <a href="0100-2023-24-001.html#sec17-1">Chapters 17</a>. A graphical overview of the MSPB and judicial review process is provided by the Board. <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/files/Review_Process.pdf">https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/files/Review_Process.pdf.</a></p>
<p class="Body-Text">By the numbers, in FY 2020, 5,265 cases were decided by AJs in the regional and field offices; for FY 2019, 5,134 cases were decided by AJs. In FY 2013, 6,340 cases were decided in the regional and field offices, compared with 6,523 cases in FY 2012. During FY 2016, the Board decided 1,154 petitions for review. During FY 2014, 876 petitions for review were decided by the Board. 952 cases were decided through petitions for review or other mechanisms at Board headquarters in FY 2013, compared with 1,024 cases decided in FY 2012. Comprising a politically appointed and senatorially confirmed chair, vice chair, and a member, the Board lost its quorum in January 2017. The quorum was restored in March 2022. In the interim, there were no petitions for review decided (or other decisions) at the Board headquarters level.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For FY 2020, about 42% of appeals at the regions involved adverse actions, 3% were performance cases or step-increase denials, and 11% of the docket involved Individual Right of Action (whistleblower) appeals. For FY 2013, 47% of the Board's appeals were adverse actions, followed by about 18% retirement-related matters, 8% VEOA and USERRA cases, 6% probationary terminations, and 2% performance cases. Of the regional docket, for FY 2020 the Board reported 48% of the appeals settled that were not dismissed. We are informed that in FY 2020, 937 appeals were adjudicated on the merits in the regions. With 60 or so AJs, that is about a couple appeals a month per AJ that survive to the point of hearing and adjudication. AJs spend a lot of time considering timeliness or jurisdictional issues that may lead to dismissals, along with discovery disputes or other procedural issues, and many AJs are active in settlement efforts.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of the 1,022 petitions for review decided in FY 2016, 154 were dismissed, 11 settled, 702 were denied, 131 were granted, and 24 were denied with further analysis. About 67% of those petitions were denied, 2% settled, and the rest were either granted, dismissed for procedural reasons, or the petitions were denied but the Board reopened the cases to modify the case analysis but not the result. When petitions were granted or cases reopened, the most common modification in the outcome of the case was a remand to the AJ for further consideration. As a result of the loss of a quorum, in early 2017 the Board stopped issued final decisions from its central office (based on petitions for review from initial decisions of AJs). The absence of a quorum persisted through March 2022. At the beginning of 2022, with PFRs arriving at the Board at a clip of 50-60 per month, there were about 3,500 PFRs pending--four years of accumulated petitions for review. (The regions have continued issuing initial decisions at their usual rate on their usual sources of appeals.)</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reviews MSPB decisions in all cases other than those involving discrimination allegations (except for a few whistleblower reprisal cases that are taken to regional circuit appellate courts). For FY 2013, the court had 1,259 appeals. Of those about 213 were from the MSPB--about 17% of the docket. The percentage of the Circuit's cases involving MSPB appeals decreases over time. For FY 2020, 130 MSPB cases were taken to the Circuit, less than 10% of that court's total new cases--but that number is below what would be expected because of the backlog of PFRs undecided at the Board resulting from the lack of a quorum in 2017 and continuing through March 2022. Of the docketed cases, for FY 2012, but 7% resulted in remands or reversals. That is an affirmation rate of more than 90%.
