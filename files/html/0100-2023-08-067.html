<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-68"><span class="space">c.</span> Derivative Preference Eligible Status</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Preference eligibility is granted to employees with a specified relationship to a veteran. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Theard v. U.S.</span> Army, 653 F. Supp. 536, 546 (M.D. N.C. 1987) ("Preference eligibility, as a general rule, is given to army veterans or employees having a specified relation to a veteran. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3). Plaintiff did not receive her KP position on account of any relation to a veteran; she was employed because of her marital relation to a soldier on active duty."). "Preference eligible" is a term applied to widows or widowers of qualifying veterans, the wife or husband of a disabled veteran, and other defined family members. Executive Orders can extend preference status to other groups. If a claim for derivative status is to establish Board jurisdiction, the initial submissions from the appellant should satisfy each element of the statutory provision creating derivative status. Otherwise the Board will dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Viescas v. USPS</span>, 16 MSPR 413, 416 (1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Derivative preference eligibility status is determined by the appellant's status at the time the action leading to the Board appeal is taken, as <span class="Italic">Epps v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 188, 190-91 (1996), noted as to an appellant divorced before the death of her former spouse:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant contends that she is a preference eligible as a result of her marriage to a now-deceased veteran.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 USC 2108(3)(D), a preference eligible includes "the unmarried widow or widower of a veteran as defined by paragraph (1)(A) of this section." The latter paragraph includes only those persons who served on active duty during a war or certain campaigns, or during specified other periods of time, and whose separation was under honorable conditions. In filing her appeal, the appellant stated in this regard:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I was married to a 5-points [sic] Preference Eligible Navy Veteran who was on active duty 1954-1957. Our marriage was from 1958-1973. His deceased status was effective July, 1990. The marriage to him was the one and only marriage; I am still unmarried. I entered the Postal Service May, 1966.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although this evidence and argument support certain aspects of her claim, the Board finds that it also refutes the possibility that she may be entitled to derivative preference eligibility. Specifically, the appellant was married at the time she was hired by the agency, but her marriage apparently ended in divorce in 1973, some 18 years before her former husband died. Preference eligible status is not permanently determined by the state of events at the time an employee is hired; rather, the relevant facts at the time the action at issue in the appeal is effected are dispositive of the appeal right. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Kaul v. USPS</span>, 16 MSPR 108 (1983) (because the appellant's marriage to a veteran ended during her tenure at the agency, she was not his wife at the time of her separation, and so was not entitled to benefits under 5 USC 2108(3)(E), granting status to "the wife or husband" of certain service-connected disabled veterans).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, here, although the statute does not define the term "widow" and we find no case law directly on point, we hold that the appellant was not entitled to the derivative status of preference eligible based on her marriage to a veteran because the marriage had ended well before his death and her demotion, so that she was not his widow when he died. <span class="Italic">See Black's Law Dictionary</span> 741, 1598 (6th ed. 1990), defining "widow" as "a woman whose husband is dead and who has not remarried"; "husband" as "one who has a lawful wife living"; and "wife" as "a woman who has a husband living and undivorced." These definitions are consistent with the common usage of the term widow as "a woman who has outlived the man to whom she was married at the time of his death." <span class="Italic">Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language</span> 1625 (2d College ed. 1972).... <span class="Italic">See Mitchell v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gray v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 295, 297 (1991), describes how derivative preference status is obtained through marriage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish entitlement to preference-eligible status, the appellant must show that: (1) Her husband's military service fits within the definition of veteran set forth at 5 USC 2108(1)(A) or (B); (2) her husband was honorably discharged from the service; (3) her husband is deceased; (4) her husband did not retire from the service; and (5) she has not remarried. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2108....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee seeks appellate status on the basis of marriage to an individual with a service-connected disability under 5 USC 2108(3)(E), that derivative status is lost upon divorce; the fact that the status was enjoyed when employment commenced does not allow for its continuation after the basis for the derivative status is lost. <span class="Italic">Kaul v. USPS</span>, 16 MSPR 108, <span id="Page_84"></span>110 (1983). Under <span class="Italic">Anderson v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 455, 457-58 (1995), if the appellant claims derivative status to appeal based on marriage and the veteran spouse is not deceased on the date of the action being appealed, jurisdiction is not conferred upon the spouse's subsequent demise.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Redus v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 193, 197-98 &#x00B6; 10-12 (2001), described how derivative preference status is obtained through the disability of a veteran-spouse:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he definition of "preference eligible" includes "the wife or husband of a service-connected disabled veteran if the veteran has been unable to qualify for any appointment in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(E). Although the administrative judge acknowledged the appellant's documentation regarding her husband's disability, and conceded that "an individual who has been adjudged mentally incompetent and rated 100% disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs is unable to qualify for any position in the government," he found that the use of the present-perfect tense in the plain words of the statute (i.e., "has been unable to qualify") required the veteran to have "actually attempted to qualify for an appointment and been unable to do so." The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction based on his finding that "the appellant ha[d] presented no evidence whatsoever to show her husband has been unable to qualify for any appointment in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our further review of the evidence of record, we now disagree with the administrative judge's statutory interpretation. The Veterans' Preference Act should be construed, whenever possible, in favor of the veteran, especially when the right to defend against charges of wrong doing is involved. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Flanagan v. Young,</span> 228 F.2d 466, 472 (D.C. Cir. 1955). Therefore, we find that the plain language of the statute indicates that Congress intended to confer preference eligible status on spouses of disabled veterans who are unable to support their families through employment with the government because they suffer from service-connected disabilities. Based on our review of the record, we find that the appellant presented documentary evidence showing that her husband, due to his service-connected disability (mental incompetence), would not have qualified for any position in the civil service or in the District of Columbia government prior to her removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, we note both the substance and the timing of the Certificate of Incompetency and the Department of Veterans Affairs letters, regarding the appellant's husband's service-connected disability. The certificate, dated January 20, 1998, states, in pertinent part, that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]his will certify that Leon Redus is a beneficiary of the Department of Veterans Affairs; that said beneficiary has been rated incompetent by the Department of Veterans Affairs in accordance with the laws and regulations governing said Department and that the appointment of a guardian of his estate is a condition precedent to the payment of monies due said beneficiary by the Department.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the March 16, 1999 Department of Veterans Affairs letter certifies that "Leon C. Redus is an honorably discharged veteran of the United States Army and has service-connected disabilities evaluated at 100 percent," and the February 16, 1999 letter states that "[Department of Veterans Affairs] records show that Leon C. Redus has a service-connected disability rating of 100% and received an honorable discharge." Read together, these documents show that, at least as early as January 20, 1998, the Department of Veterans Affairs rated the appellant's husband as a service-connected disabled veteran. <span class="Italic">Cf. Carey v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 50 MSPR 359, 361-62 (1991) (finding that a letter from the Veterans Administration, regarding the employee's receipt of disability compensation because of a service-connected disability, and evidence showing that she was honorably discharged were sufficient to establish preference eligible status). Thus, we find that the appellant established that, at the time of her removal, and for at least 5 months prior to it, she was entitled to preference eligible status based on her husband's service-connected disability in accordance with section 2108(3)(E) of the statute. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(E). Based on our findings regarding her preference eligibility, we further find that the Board has jurisdiction over her removal appeal. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 MSPR 455, 457 (1995) (generally, absent statutory exception, the Board's jurisdiction over an appeal is controlled by the employee's status on the effective date of the action being appealed).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Redus</span> was applied by <span class="Italic">MacIntyre v. DOD</span>, DC-0752-13-4818-I-1 (NP 9/12/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(E), the term "preference eligible" means "the wife or husband of a service-connected disabled veteran if the veteran has been unable to qualify for any appointment in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia." The plain language of the statute indicates that Congress intended to confer preference-eligible status on spouses of disabled veterans who are unable to support their families through employment with the government because they suffer from service-connected disabilities. <span class="Italic">Redus v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 193, &#x00B6; 11, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 25 F. App'x 904 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Assuming that the appellant's husband is a service-connected disabled veteran, his statement that he has "never qualified for appointment" in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia does not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that he has been "unable to qualify for any" such appointment. In <span class="Italic">Redus</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 193, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11, for example, the Board found that the appellant presented documentary evidence showing that her husband, due to his service-connected 100% disability rating for mental incompetence, would not have qualified for any position in the civil service or in the District of Columbia government. Thus, the Board held that the appellant was entitled to preference-eligible status. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12. Here, by contrast, the appellant has not identified the nature and extent of her husband's service-connected disability, let alone alleged or shown that he was unable to qualify for any appointment described at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(E).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. MSPB</span>, 62 Fed. Appx. 945 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP) (Board lacked jurisdiction because the evidence did not demonstrate that the veteran, upon whose status the wife's ability to appeal depended, was "unable to qualify for any appointment in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board relied on guidance in the OPM VetGuide for documentation required to support a claim for spousal derivative veterans preference, <span class="Italic">Dosh v. Dept. of Army</span>, DE-3330-10-0180-I-1 (NP 9/9/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The statute does not address the requirements for establishing one's entitlement to a spouse derived preference. The Office of Personnel Management administers entitlement to veterans' preference in employment under title 5 of the United States Code, <span class="Italic">Durand v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 14 (2007), and published a VetGuide to provide guidance on preference eligibility determinations. The Board has stated that, although the VetGuide is not entitled to the deference accorded to regulations, it is a formal document published on the Office of Personnel Management's web site "with the apparent expectation that it would be relied upon by agencies, employees, prospective employees, and other interested members of the public." <span class="Italic">Brandt v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (2006). We are unaware of any issuance in which the Office of Personnel Management has taken a contrary position to the statutory interpretation set forth in the VetGuide. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span>, &#x00B6; 14 (the amount of weight to be accorded depends in part on factors such as the consistency of the agency's position, its formality, and its persuasiveness). Thus, we discern no error in the administrative judge's decision to look to and give weight to the VetGuide.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record supports the administrative judge's findings that the appellant failed to submit documentation required under the VetGuide to support a presumption that she is the spouse of a veteran whose disability disqualifies him for a Federal position along the general lines of his or her usual occupation because of a service-connected disability, or alternatively, to support an independent finding under a "more careful analysis," that she is entitled to a spouse derived preference. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that she failed to prove that she is entitled to a spouse derived preference.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Derivative status based on marriage to a disabled veteran is not extinguished by incarceration of the veteran if the disability rating arose before the incarceration, <span class="Italic">Cox-Vaughn v. USPS</span>, 100 MSPR 246, 249-51 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim of preference eligibility is based on her husband's service-connected disability. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(E), the definition of "preference eligible" includes "the wife...of a service-connected disabled veteran if the veteran has been unable to qualify for any appointment in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia." The Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) has rated the appellant's husband's service-connected disability at 100 percent, a rating that indicates that he is "100 percent disabled and unemployable." The Board has indicated that a 100 percent disability rating such as this is sufficient to establish that the veteran "has been unable to qualify for any appointment in the civil service...." <span class="Italic">See Redus v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 193 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-12, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 25 Fed. Appx. 904 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 13, 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued below, however, that the appellant nevertheless was not a preference eligible. In support of that argument, it relied on 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5313(c), which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Secretary shall not assign to any veteran a rating of total disability based on the individual unemployability of the veteran resulting from a service-connected disability during any period during which the veteran is incarcerated in a Federal, State, or local penal institution for conviction of a felony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency noted that the appellant's husband had been incarcerated for several years for a felony, i.e., murder. It argued that he therefore should not be regarded as having a 100 percent disability rating and that the appellant accordingly was not a preference eligible under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(E).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge concluded that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5313(c) did not preclude a finding that the appellant was a preference eligible. This <span id="Page_85"></span>conclusion was based in part on his interpretation of that provision as addressing only those disability ratings that were made while the veteran was incarcerated and as not precluding the continuation of a 100 percent disability rating that was assigned before the incarceration began. It also was based in part on evidence that the appellant's husband retained his 100 percent disability rating despite DVA's awareness of his felony incarceration, and on the administrative judge's finding that the Board "lack[ed] the authority to set aside the independent determinations of the Department of Veterans Affairs..., the agency with enforcement authority under title 38, that the appellant's husband retain[ed] " his rating despite the incarceration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not determine the extent to which the Board is bound by DVA disability ratings such as that assigned to the appellant's husband. Even if we are not bound by such ratings, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5313(c) would provide no basis for finding that the appellant's husband is not entitled to the 100 percent disability rating assigned by DVA. While the agency argues on petition for review that the language of that provision could be interpreted as indicating that such a rating could not be held during a period of incarceration for a felony even if it was assigned before that period began, both the legislative history of the provision and the regulations interpreting the provision are inconsistent with this view. The "Explanatory Statement" accompanying the legislation by which 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5313 was enacted includes an assertion that, under that provision, "[n]o <span class="Italic">adjudications</span> of total disability based on individual unemployability would be permissible <span class="Italic">during the period of the veteran's incarceration</span>." 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3307, 3323, 3327 (emphasis added). Moreover, DVA, the agency responsible for administering this provision, has promulgated regulations that make the limited effect of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5313(c) even more clear. Those regulations provide as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Incarcerated veterans. A total rating for compensation purposes based on individual unemployability which would first become effective while a veteran is incarcerated in a Federal, State or local penal institution for conviction of a felony, shall not be assigned during such period of incarceration. However, where a rating for individual unemployability exists prior to incarceration for a felony and routine review is required, the case will be reconsidered to determine if continued eligibility for such rating exists.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 3.341(b); <span class="Italic">see Chevron, U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984) (the Supreme Court has "long recognized that considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department's construction of a statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in the record indicates that DVA has reduced the disability rating it assigned to the appellant below the level of 100 percent. On the contrary, as the administrative judge noted, that agency confirmed on November 25, 2003, after corresponding with the appellant regarding her husband's incarceration, that the appellant's husband was "currently rated at 100 percent service-connected disabled." Accordingly, we find that the appellant is a preference eligible who, at the time of her suspension and removal, had completed 1 year of current continuous service in her position. We therefore find that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B).</p>
