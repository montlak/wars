<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-234"><span class="space">F.</span> TIME TO APPLY FOR RESTORATION</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 353.301 (2022), sets the time for an employee's application for restoration when the employee has fully recovered after one year from the onset of eligibility for workers compensation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Fully recovered after 1 year.</span> An employee who separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the individual on the agency's reemployment priority list for the competitive service or reemployment list for the excepted service. If the individual cannot be placed in the former commuting area, he or she is entitled to priority consideration for an equivalent position elsewhere in the agency. (See parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for more information on how this may be accomplished for the excepted and competitive services, respectively.) This subpart also applies when an injured employee accepts a lower-graded position in lieu of separation and subsequently fully recovers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee who is entitled to priority consideration but who fails to make timely application may still be able to secure Board review if the agency failed to provide notice to the employee of the time limit for the request, <span class="Italic">Huff v. USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 626, 627-28 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her decision on appellant's appeal, the presiding official noted that under Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations, a person can request restoration to his or her agency position only within thirty days of the cessation of compensation, and found that since appellant had not requested restoration until more than four months after compensation ceased, the Board lacked jurisdiction, citing <span class="Italic">Elios v. Veterans Administration,</span> 6 MSPB 526 (1981), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded on other grounds,</span> July 1, 1981. She therefore dismissed appellant's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant, in her petition for review, contends, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that her case should not have been decided on the basis of the OPM regulation requiring the filing of a restoration request within thirty days, because she was neither informed nor otherwise aware of the regulation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]t is clear from the record before the presiding official that the agency was not in compliance with the notification requirement of the regulations, which provides that "[a]n agency shall notify an employee who is separated, furloughed, or given leave of absence because of military duty or injury, of his rights, obligations, and benefits relating to his Government employment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.106. In its separation notice, the agency notified appellant of her right to priority consideration under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151, but it did not advise her that under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353,307 she was required to apply for such consideration within thirty days of the cessation of compensation, nor did it refer her to the pertinent regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Thompson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 5 MSPB 274, 277 (1981), we stated that "it would be unjust to deprive the appellant of priority consideration simply because he did not meet a regulatory deadline about which the agency failed to notify him." Thus, we find that the presiding official erred in dismissing the appeal without determining whether the agency gave appellant priority consideration as required by law. <span class="Italic">See Thompson, supra,</span> at 278-81.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The question of adequate notice of restoration rights, with a consequential waiver of the time limit for requesting those rights, resulted in remand in <span class="Italic">Bolden-Pruitt v. USPS</span>, CH-0353-16-0431-I-1 (NP 8/1/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who separated because of a compensable injury, and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began, may establish jurisdiction in a restoration appeal if she nonfrivolously alleges the following: (1) she was separated, absent, or placed in a lower grade job because of a compensable injury; (2) she fully recovered after 1 year; (3) she requested restoration within 30 days after the cessation of OWCP benefits; and (4) the agency violated her reemployment priority rights. <span class="Italic">See Nixon</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.301(b), 1201.57(a)(4), (b)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the third jurisdictional element, we find that remand is necessary to further develop the issue of whether the appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that the 30-day deadline for requesting restoration may be waived based upon her exercise of due diligence. An employee who recovers from a compensable injury more than 1 year after she was found eligible for OWCP benefits must typically apply for restoration within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b). Nevertheless, pursuant to regulation, when an agency separates an employee because of a compensable injury, it has the responsibility to "notify the employee of his or her rights, obligations, and benefits relating to Government employment, including any appeal and grievance rights." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104. Thus, if the agency failed to notify the appellant of the deadline for requesting restoration, the Board may excuse the delay. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ward v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 425, 429-32 (1995) (finding, in a military restoration appeal, that the agency's failure to notify the appellant of his restoration rights excused the untimeliness of his request for restoration by approximately 3 months); <span class="Italic">McKoy v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 636, 639-40 (1984) (finding, when the appellant sought full restoration approximately 17 months after her recovery and the cessation of benefits, that the request could not be dismissed as untimely because the agency failed to notify the appellant of the 30-day regulatory deadline for applying for restoration and because it did not object to the delay on appeal).[4] However, regardless of the agency's obligation, pursuant to current regulations, "an employee is still required to exercise due diligence in ascertaining his or her rights, and to seek reemployment...as soon as he or she is able after a compensable injury." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104; <span class="Italic">see Dunklebarger v. Department of the Army</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 607, 612 (1995) (quoting 53 Fed. Reg. 857, 859 (Jan. 14, 1988) (stating that the amended regulations requiring an employee to exercise due diligence were added to inform the employee that he or she "has an obligation to use due diligence in ascertaining his or her rights, and to return to duty as soon as he or she is able"). Thus, even if the agency did not notify the appellant of the 30-day deadline for requesting restoration, she still must demonstrate that she acted diligently in determining her rights to restoration and after she discovered the deadline. <span class="Italic">See generally Cranston v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 290, &#x00B6; 13 (2007) (explaining that, regardless of agency notification, an employee is required to exercise due diligence regarding her restoration to duty rights but is not required to demonstrate due diligence in discovering Board appeal rights).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Ward</span> and <span class="Italic">McKoy</span>, the Board applied 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.106 (1986), a previous version of the regulations that did not require an appellant to exercise due diligence in ascertaining his or her rights. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 430 n.3; <span class="Italic">McKoy</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. at 638.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted both below and on review that the agency did not notify her of the deadline for requesting restoration. The agency has not submitted evidence or argument to contradict her contention. However, she was not provided notice of her burden to nonfrivolously allege that she acted diligently in requesting restoration, despite the delay, and she did not do so. Accordingly, we find it necessary to remand the appeal to afford her this opportunity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge shall inform the appellant of her burden to nonfrivolously allege that she acted diligently in ascertaining her rights and requesting restoration to duty. If the administrative judge finds that the appellant has made such a nonfrivolous allegation, then she has established jurisdiction, and the administrative judge should afford the appellant her requested hearing on the merits.</p>

Dept. of Army</span>, 67 MSPR 607, 610-12 (1995) (time for seeking restoration may be extended if the agency has not provided notice of the time limit to employee, citing <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 839 F.2d 669, 674 (Fed. Cir. 1988), and <span class="Italic">Ward v. VA</span>, 67 MSPR 425 (1995); 5 CFR 353.106)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kinler v. GSA</span>, 43 MSPR 197, 202-03 (1990), explained that the time period for a restoration request must be rationally applied:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish restoration rights to the vacant GM-13 position, the <span id="Page_4512"></span>appellant must also show that he had fully recovered at the time of the vacancy on April 1984. Otherwise, restoration rights would not have accrued. <span class="Italic">See Watson v. Department of the Army,</span> 21 M.S.P.R. 435, 437 (1984); <span class="Italic">Oswald v. United States Postal Service</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 385, 387 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant must further show that he timely exercised his restoration rights within 30 days of the date that he became fully recovered.[5] The applicable statutory provision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2), requires that agencies "make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing," employees whose recovery takes longer than one year after the commencement of OWCP compensation.[6] The implementing regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.303,[7] entitles such an employee to "priority consideration for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one <span class="Italic">provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of cessation of compensation.</span>" (Emphasis supplied.) 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8101(12) defines "compensation" to include all OWCP benefits, but excludes disability retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Whether a former employee asserts restoration rights within the 30-day time limit of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.303 goes to the merits of a restoration claim, not to the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Huff v. United States Postal Service,</span> 10 M.S.P.R. 626, 628 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The appellant is clearly not entitled to immediate reinstatement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1) because he did not recover from his work-related injury within one year of the commencement of his OWCP compensation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Section 353.303 was formerly codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.307.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 30-day time limit set forth in section 353.303 is apparently unambiguous on its face, and its application is straight-forward in the usual case where full recovery and the cessation of OWCP compensation occur concurrently. We find, however, that an ambiguity is created where OWCP compensation is terminated for a reason other than full recovery from his work-related injury, before the former employee can be deemed to have become fully recovered, and disability retirement benefits continue. Section 353.303 as a whole applies only to former employees who are already fully recovered. We thus find it illogical to interpret this section as requiring an individual to apply for restoration before he recovers and has any meaningful restoration rights to assert.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To construe section 353.303 to cut off a restoration claim before it accrues would defeat congressional intent to provide reemployment priority rights to those employees who have sustained on-the-job injuries and who have fully recovered, though some time later. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 812 F.2d 705, 709 (Fed. Cir. 1987), citing 1974 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 5341, 5344; <span class="Italic">Raicovich v. United States Postal Service,</span> 675 F.2d 417, 424 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (Congress sought to accord injured workers treatment equal to that which they would have received but for their injury). We therefore find that the only reasonable interpretation of the regulation which is consistent with the statutory purpose as set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2), namely, that agencies make all reasonable efforts to place such employees, is that the 30-day period commences when the employee has fully recovered, where OWCP compensation was terminated for a reason other than his full recovery under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102.<span class="Italic"> See Horner v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 815 F.2d 668, 673 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (ambiguity of facially clear statutory provision can arise from analysis of statute as a whole, and ambiguity should be resolved to effect legislative purpose).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The time period for applying for restoration is 30 days after the cessation of compensation, even if the employee has not fully recovered, <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. USPS</span>, 16 MSPR 578, 580-81 (1983):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2) mandates that, "[u]nder regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management," the agency must make all reasonable efforts to place the employee in his former or equivalent agency position, and accord priority to such placing, where "the injury or disability is overcome within a period of more than one year after the date of commencement of compensation." Since this section expressly gives OPM the authority to prescribe regulations to effectuate the statutory intent, the Board has found that OPM regulations implementing the statute have the force of law. <span class="Italic">Dickinson v. Department of Energy,</span> 3 MSPB 335, 337 (1980). OPM's regulation implementing the statute, namely, 5 C.F.R. 353.307, gives a right to priority consideration to employees "separated because of a compensable injury and whose recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date compensation began...provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of cessation of compensation." Although "recovery" is not defined by the regulation, it is clear from a reading of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.307 that it contemplates that the employee has recovered to the extent that compensation benefits have ceased and he is able to assume his former position or an equivalent position, since the employee must apply for reappointment within 30 days from cessation of benefits. Furthermore, reading this provision together with Section 353.306 which distinguishes the right of a partially recovered employee to be considered for a light duty position and Section 353.102(e) which defines "fully recovered" to mean that compensation payments have been terminated based on a finding that the employee is able to assume his prior position or an equivalent one, we conclude that an employee whose benefits have been terminated has a right to priority consideration, despite the fact that he alleges that he had not fully recovered. Accordingly, we find that the presiding official erred in finding, in essence, that appellant had failed to state a claim for priority consideration and dismissing the appeal.</p>
