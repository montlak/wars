<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-40"><span class="space">f.</span> Withdrawal of Request to Resign</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An OPM regulation, 5 CFR 715.202 (2022), "Resignation," provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">General</span>. An employee is free to resign at any time, to set the effective date of his resignation, and to have his reasons for resigning entered in his official records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Withdrawal of resignation</span>. An agency may permit an employee to withdraw his resignation at any time before it has become effective. An agency may decline a request to withdraw a resignation before its effective date only when the agency has a valid reason and explains that reason to the employee. A valid reason includes, but is not limited to, administrative disruption or the hiring or commitment to hire a replacement. Avoidance of adverse action proceedings is not a valid reason.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Haine v. Googe</span>, 248 F. Supp. 349, 351-52 (S.D.N.Y. 1965), explained the rule that generally permits an individual to withdraw a resignation before its effective date:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...At common law the rule was that a public officer could withdraw his resignation at any time prior to its acceptance or other action indicating acceptance. This rule was a corollary of the rule that a public officer whose resignation had been submitted but not yet acted upon remained under a duty to perform the functions of his office. "This was required in order that the public interests might suffer no inconvenience for the want of public servants to execute the laws."[10]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10] <span class="Italic">Edwards v. United States</span>, 103 U.S. 471, 474 (1880).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, as appears, the underlying rationale of the common law cases is that the public interest requires that an officeholder cannot shed his duties without acceptance, then it follows as a matter of simple fairness that the officeholder, prior to acceptance of a tendered resignation, should have the correlative right to change his mind and retain his office. And such a policy is not contrary to the public interest. If plaintiff's services were unsatisfactory, there were available to the agency statutory procedures for her separation from service consistent with such rights to which she was entitled as a veteran. On the other hand, if her services were satisfactory, the public interest is not advanced nor efficiency of service necessarily achieved by requiring the consent of the agency in order to permit her to withdraw her unacted-upon resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the circumstances which give rise to the resignation and its cancellation are without relevance to the basic legal issue here presented, they are not without interest. Plaintiff's explanation is that she had been ordered to take into custody a female alien convicted of a narcotics law violation; that she protested that this was contrary to the Service security regulations which required that in such a case a female detention officer be accompanied by a male officer; that despite her protest she was directed to carry out the assignment, which she did, and in protest against the procedure thereafter submitted her resignation, followed by her change of mind after weekend reflection. Of course we do not pass upon the verity of her explanation. But the fact is that those in government service are subject to the same whims, caprices, emotions and foibles as other humans. They act under the same impulses. The plaintiff's resignation, which was promptly withdrawn and which had been tendered under emotional stress, whether brought on by pressure of duty or resentment toward a superior, or whatever the cause, should not be held to constitute an irrevocable act or one of which she can be relieved only by the consent of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court concludes, upon the facts here presented, that the plaintiff, as a matter of law, had the right to withdraw her resignation before it was accepted, and that her request for its destruction rendered it ineffective; that the refusal to give effect to her right to withdraw the resignation constituted agency action which separated her from the Service contrary to her rights under the Veterans' Preference Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency improperly denies an employee's request to withdraw his resignation before it becomes effective, the resulting separation constitutes a removal action within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 433, 437 (1991) ("Once a resignation becomes effective, however, an agency has no obligation to allow withdrawal or to give any reason for refusing to do so."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Glenn v. Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 76 MSPR 572, 577 (1997) ("There is no provision for waiving the requirement that the request for rescission be made prior to the time the resignation or retirement becomes effective."); <span class="Italic">Chapman v. VA</span>, 19 MSPR 633 (1984) (Table); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. United States</span>, 423 F.2d 1379 (Ct.

<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 715.202(b) (2022) and the (late) Federal Personnel Manual advise agencies that an employee should be permitted to withdraw his resignation prior to its effective date if the agency has not changed the position (e.g., by appointing another individual to the position) prior to retraction of the resignation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goodwin v.

Regarding the appellant's contention that the agency hired a third full-time Ranger shortly after he resigned, the administrative judge credited the testimony of the appellant's second-level supervisor that he was able to hire a third full-time GS-9 Ranger in October 2014, after an employee occupying a lower-graded position unexpectedly left and he obtained approval to abolish the lower-graded position and instead hire a third GS-9 Ranger."); <span class="Italic">Einstein v.

<p class="Body-Text">The agency must prove that it had a valid reason for not honoring the appellant's request to withdraw her resignation. This burden is applied during the Board appeal; the agency should probably also provide the appellant prior to the Board appeal an explanation of its reason for failing to permit withdrawal of the resignation; but its failure to explain its actions to the appellant will be treated under the harmful error analysis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Olsen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 65 MSPR 60, 64 (1994). Under <span class="Italic">Olsen</span>, if one resignation leads to more than one separation of the same employee, a situation that could result when the first separation is then canceled as a result of MSPB litigation and another separation results, each separation will be examined by the Board to determine whether the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal, that is, whether the agency demonstrates a legitimate reason for declining to permit withdrawal of appellant's resignation. <span class="Italic">But cf</span>. <span class="Italic">George v.

The appellant's argument on review that such a requirement exists under the CSRS and FERS Handbook is misplaced because section 41A3.1-1 pertains to the withdrawal of a retirement application, not the withdrawal of a resignation.").</p>

Withdrawal is at the discretion of the agency before it becomes effective, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 715.202(b).

<p class="Body-Text">The employee sets the effective date of the resignation. Agency supervisors may suggest other dates, but the choice is the employee's alone.

If, however, the record suggests that the agency allowed the effective date of the resignation to pass and assured the employee that the resignation could be undone and his employment would be continued, then the AJ must determine whether the resignation was actually effected or whether the agency involuntarily separated the employee by later imposing a retroactive resignation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Berg v.

<p class="Body-Text">Of the effective date or time, although the late Federal Personnel Manual stated that separation from the federal service is effective at the end of the day (midnight), the Board will recognize a resignation that is effective on a particular day at an earlier time, e.g., "immediately," if it is clear from the statements and the conduct of the appellant that his intent is to resign immediately. <span class="Italic">Heinze v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 47 MSPR 375, 378 (1991). If the employee announces that he "quits" and walks out, the resignation is immediately effective, irrespective of the date placed on a personnel form memorializing the resignation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 433, 437 (1991) (if the employee's announced and unequivocal intent was to resign on August 5, the date of resignation was not changed by a statement that he would return on August 8 to sign a written resignation). Chairman Levinson dissented in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, arguing that agency regulations gave precedence to written resignations and that the appellant had demonstrated an intent to submit a written resignation. Without a specification setting an earlier effective time for a resignation, however, the resignation takes effect at midnight on the day set for the resignation. <span class="Italic">Harmon v. DOD</span>, 50 MSPR 218, 221 (1991) (appellant called her supervisor before midnight on the day that she tendered her resignation and asked to rescind it).

<p class="Body-Text">Avoidance of an action against an employee, whether based on misconduct or unacceptable performance, is not a valid reason for declining a request to withdraw a resignation or retirement. 5 CFR 715.202 (2022); <span class="Italic">Gonzales</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Einstein v. Dept. of Army</span>, 26 MSPR 404, 407 (1985) (immaterial whether the problem is unacceptable conduct or poor performance).

<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 715.202 (2022), recruitment that does not reach actual hiring or commitment to hire a replacement is not a valid reason to refuse withdrawal, nor can recruitment at that stage, without special circumstances, constitute administrative disruption. <span class="Italic">Einstein v. Dept. of Army</span>, 26 MSPR 404, 408 (1985) (agency continued its recruitment efforts after receiving notice of the appellant's intent to withdraw the resignation/retirement). Tentative hiring commitments, or the remote possibility of a future RIF, will not likely excuse an agency's failure to permit the withdrawal of a resignation, unless to do so would implicate another's legal rights or cause the agency further disruption because of its detrimental reliance on the resignation, <span class="Italic">Browning v. Dept. of Army</span>, 61 MSPR 232, 236-40 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the information that led to a refusal to allow the withdrawal of a resignation is within the agency's control, the agency bears the burden of proving the validity of its reasons under this regulation by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Almon v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration</span>, 16 MSPR 124, 128 (1983). In making the determination of whether the agency met its burden, the Board has held that the agency's discretion to refuse to accede to a withdrawal "is not unfettered, but rather is conditional," <span class="Italic">McBeen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 27 MSPR 207, 210 (1985), and "limited." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 211.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that it abused its discretion in declining the appellant's withdrawal of his resignation because it had committed to temporarily promote Mr. Lasater to the appellant's position and also because it was able to avoid a reduction in force when Mr. Oura exercised his return rights. For the reasons discussed below, we find no merit to these claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the commitment to temporarily promote Mr. Lasater, we find that the evidence fully supports the administrative judge's conclusion that no sufficient commitment was made because the testimony indicates that no one could be hired or promoted without the personnel department's approval of the applicant's qualifications....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Commitment" means "a pledge or promise to do something," Webster's New World Dictionary 286 (2d College Ed. 1972); an "agreement or pledge to do something," either as a "conditional commitment," subject to certain items being met, or a "firm commitment," which is binding without conditions. Black's Law Dictionary 273 (6th Ed. 1990). The regulation does not specify what kind of "commitment to hire" suffices to block an attempt to withdraw a resignation, but we find that the phrase should be interpreted in light of the circumstances it addresses to permit the appellant to retain what has been his position over the conditional claim of another who has not occupied the job, unless to do so would implicate the other's legal rights or cause the agency further disruption because of its detrimental reliance on the resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, therefore, that the administrative judge properly found that the agency's commitment to Mr. Lasater does not represent the type of commitment that will suffice to block the appellant's otherwise valid, timely attempt to withdraw his resignation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's remaining reason is that another employee had previously occupied the job the appellant held at the time of his resignation, and he had return rights to it. Because that employee's right to the job was superior to the appellant's, the agency asserts that it was able to avoid a reduction in force by declining to allow the appellant to withdraw <span id="Page_1955"></span>his resignation. While the avoidance of a RIF might otherwise be an appropriate situation for the exercise of such agency discretion, we agree with the administrative judge that this was not such a situation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the administrative judge found that the concern that a RIF would be necessary was speculative because the agency's first action upon Mr. Oura's return, assuming that it were to occur, would be to find out whether there were vacancies that could be offered to avoid such a reduction. Moreover, he noted that the anticipated return was from 10 to 18 months away, and that Oura had previously sought and won an extension of his overseas tour. The agency argues that the administrative judge erred because although Mr. Oura previously extended his tour, a further extension would result in the loss of his return rights, and that despite the accuracy of the administrative judge's statement that there was no specific testimony that there were no vacancies into which the appellant could be placed upon Oura's return, a reasonable inference could be drawn that this is so. It also asserts that, given the disruption caused by a RIF, some degree of speculation should not cause its determination to be reversed, and that the administrative judge erred in relying on 5 CFR &#x00A7; 352.208(a) in making his decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the testimony shows that the agency was aware, by the time that the appellant attempted to withdraw his resignation, that Mr. Oura had stated that it was then his intention to return during the summer of 1994, but we have found no "accompanying testimony" that a further extension of his overseas tour would result in his loss of return rights. Rather, Mr. Fee's testimony was that although there may be status of forces agreements that limit a tour to five years, he was not very familiar with them, and in his experience, "Some commands are pretty hard and fast on that and some aren't." In fact, he indicated that the discretion resided with the commander of PTA. We further note the testimony of Col. Ellzey that he did not ask what the probable results of any RIF might be before declining to allow the appellant to withdraw his resignation...but that he also confirmed that if the RIF had been done "at least up to now," no one except the appellant would have been affected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we find that the agency's desire to avoid a RIF that appeared to be at least 17 months away and might, indeed, not occur at all, does not constitute a sufficient showing of administrative disruption to justify its decision. <span class="Italic">Cf. Knox v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 12 MSPB 58, 13 MSPR 479, 482 (1982) (agency acted properly in declining to allow the appellant to withdraw his resignation in the midst of a nationwide RIF because to have granted it would have adversely affected other employees whose jobs had been saved by the resignation and would cause the agency to violate the Anti-Deficiency Act). Because of this finding and the small significance of the initial decision's reference to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 352.208(a), we find that any error in citing that regulation was harmless....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency argues that even if none of its reasons alone suffices, in combination all of them should. We disagree. Although the potential disruption caused by the RIF and the inconvenience to Mr. Lasater provide some support for the agency's position, we do not find them sufficient to amount to the type of valid reason or disruption that should cause the appellant to lose his right to withdraw his resignation at the early date he sought to do so. Adding to those reasons the agency's concern that the appellant would have failed to perform his duties if he were allowed to return, under circumstances where he had not been told that the agency regarded his recent performance as poor, nor had he been asked to improve, and even assuming that it does not constitute the invalid reason of avoidance of an adverse action, we find that the agency nonetheless has not met its burden of proving a valid reason for its action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once an agency hires a replacement for the appellant or makes a commitment to hire one, the agency may refuse the employee's request to withdraw his resignation before its effective date. <span class="Italic">Calvert v. Marine Corps</span>, 32 MSPR 23, 23 (1986). An employee of the Department of Justice obtained a position with the Customs Service. His replacement was hired and the appellant began to train the new employee. The appellant's SF-52 documenting his resignation and transfer noted that his selection at Customs Service was dependent upon his ability to pass a field examination. A starting date was set at Customs. The employee took some annual leave from Justice until he began his new job. Prior to the starting date, Customs advised the employee that he would not be hired. Justice refused to take the employee back in his prior job, but the agency gave him a lower-graded position. The Board determined that the appellant's resignation became effective when he told Justice that he would take the new job and left on annual leave after turning in his agency identification. There was no condition on the resignation. A replacement was brought in when the employee's resignation became unconditional. <span class="Italic">Pronechen v. DOJ</span>, 25 MSPR 54, 57 (1984). As to other "special circumstances," an agency properly refused to permit the withdrawal of a resignation of an employee who desired to be placed on sick leave. The agency was concerned that details of individuals to fill his position would create an unstable work environment. <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. EEOC</span>, 30 MSPR 186, 187 (1986) (citing <span class="Italic">McBeen v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 27 MSPR 207 (1985), and <span class="Italic">Knox v. EEOC</span>, 13 MSPR 479, 482 (1982) (withdrawal of a resignation during the period of the RIF would have disrupted agency operations by precluding another employee from taking the appellant's position and would have required additional expenditures to provide 30 days of notice to the adversely affected employee)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For agencies and appellants who settle appeals on the basis of appellants' resignations, the agency must still demonstrate by preponderant evidence the propriety of its refusal to allow the appellant to withdraw the resignation. The agency will rely on the settlement agreement to meet its burden of proof. The appellant may then seek to show that the settlement was invalid or that the agency breached the settlement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DHUD</span>, 63 MSPR 649, 656-57 (1994), and <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DHUD</span>, 71 MSPR 181, 191 (1996) ("A federal employee may resign at any time. The agency...must allow an employee to withdraw his resignation, unless it has a valid reason for refusing.... A valid contract between the parties providing for the resignation is such a valid reason."), <span class="Italic">rev'd and remanded on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DHUD</span>, 124 F.3d 1439 (Fed. Cir. 1997), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DHUD</span>, 78 MSPR 25 (1998); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Tretchick v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 109 F.3d 749 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (agency justifiably relied on a settlement agreement when it refused to permit the appellant to withdraw her retirement; the agency's alleged breach of the agreement could have been cured and did not serve to void the agreement). [Refer to Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-035.html#sec16-36">Setting Aside a Settlement</a>," for attempts to void settlements; and refer to Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-029.html#sec16-30">Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act</a>," concerning provision for a revocation period in settlement agreements leading to resignations or retirements.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an opaque decision, the Board remanded an appeal to determine if the appellant timely withdrew a resignation submitted on, apparently, the same date that her removal would have been effective. The initial decision was not much more enlightening. If separation was through resignation, the appellant's record might arguably be clearer than a termination, depending on how the agency coded the resignation. The interesting but unanswered question in <span class="Italic">Harvin v. USDA</span>, DC-0432-14-0154-I-1 (NP 2/5/2015), was the nature of any monetary remedy if the withdrawn resignation and the effected removal had the same date.</p>
