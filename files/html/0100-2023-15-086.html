<p class="Body-Text">With the cautionary observation that <span class="Italic">Gargiulo v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/12-3157.Opinion.8-14-2013.1.PDF">727 F.3d 1181</a>, 1187 <span id="Page_2553"></span>(Fed. Cir. 2013), determined as to an indefinite suspension based on a clearance suspension that, "the Board erred by holding that due process provides an employee with procedural rights in connection with a security clearance determination and justifies an inquiry into whether the agency had reasonable grounds for suspending or revoking the employee's security clearance," <span class="Italic">Romero v. DOD</span>, 527 F.3d 1324, 1327-30 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (removal affirmed following remand to Board and initial decision by AJ sustaining removal, <span class="Italic">Romero v. DOD</span>, 658 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2011)), charged the Board with responsibility for determining the significance of violations by agencies of their own regulations when those violations are raised by appellants who challenge adverse actions based on clearance revocations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(1), an agency's removal of an employee is an "adverse action." An employee subject to an adverse action is entitled to the protections of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. Those protections include written notice of the specific reasons for the proposed action, an opportunity to respond to the charges, the requirement that the agency's action is taken to promote the efficiency of the service, and the right to review of the action by the Board. When reviewing an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, the Board may sustain the agency's action only if the agency can show that its decision is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B). In most cases, the agency must provide evidence supporting the reasons for the adverse action. But in cases in which the adverse action is based on the denial or revocation of a security clearance, section 7701(c)(1)(B) does not require the agency to prove that the reasons for its decision to deny or revoke a security clearance are supported by a preponderance of evidence. In <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), the Supreme Court observed that imposing such a burden would be inconsistent with the normal standard applied when granting security clearances--i.e., that granting clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of the national security." Instead, the Court stated that in reviewing a for-cause removal action of an employee who was denied a security clearance, the Board may only determine "whether such cause existed, whether in fact clearance was denied, and whether transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 530.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Department of State</span>, 217 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2000), we addressed the scope of review of removal actions that involve the revocation or denial of security clearance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The principles we draw from the Court's decision in Egan are these: (1) there is no presumption that security clearance determinations will be subject to administrative or judicial review, as those determinations are committed to the broad discretion of the responsible Executive Branch agency; (2) unless Congress specifically provides otherwise, the Merit Systems Protection Board is not authorized to review security clearance determinations or agency actions based on security clearance determinations; and (3) when an agency action is challenged under the provisions of chapter 75 of title 5, the Board may determine whether a security clearance was denied, whether the security clearance was a requirement of the appellant's position, and whether the procedures set forth in section 7513 were followed, but the Board may not examine the underlying merits of the security clearance determination. <span class="Italic">See King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 662-63 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Drumheller v. Department of the Army</span>, 49 F.3d 1566, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Lyles v. Department of the Army</span>, 864 F.2d 1581, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although in a Board proceeding an agency does not need to provide evidence to justify the denial or revocation of a security clearance, section 7513(b)(1) requires agencies to give written notice to employees "stating the specific reasons for the proposed action." Section 7513 therefore requires--in some circumstances at least--that an agency do more than simply state that an adverse action is based on the revocation or denial of security clearance. In <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657 (Fed. Cir. 1996), and <span class="Italic">Cheney v. Department of Justice</span>, 479 F.3d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2007), we held that the suspension of an employee because of denial or revocation of a security clearance could not be sustained when the agencies involved did not "provide the employee with sufficient information to make an informed reply to the agency." <span class="Italic">Cheney</span>, 479 F.3d at 1352 (quoting Alston, 75 F.3d at 662).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7513 is not the only source of procedural protections for employees subject to adverse actions based on security clearance decisions; agencies must also follow the procedures established by their own regulations. <span class="Italic">See Drumheller v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 49 F.3d 1566, 1569-73 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (reviewing Department of the Army regulations related to the revocation of security clearances). In the event that an agency does not follow its own regulations, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) provides that an adverse action decision may not be sustained by the Board if the employee can show "harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at such decision."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that under <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, <span class="Italic">Hesse</span>, and <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 498 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the Board and this court may not review the procedural validity of a security clearance revocation. We disagree. <span class="Italic">Egan</span> and this court's decisions following it are based on the principle that foreign policy is the "province and responsibility of the Executive." <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 529 (quoting <span class="Italic">Haig v. Agee,</span> 453 U.S. 280, 293-94 (1981)). In light of that principle, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> observed that "unless Congress specifically has provided otherwise, courts traditionally have been reluctant to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in military and national security affairs." 484 U.S. at 530. The statutory provision allowing review of an agency's compliance with its own procedures leading to an adverse action does not amount to an unwarranted intrusion upon the authority of the Executive, however, because the authority to formulate procedures for denying or revoking security clearances remains with the Executive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the government in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> itself acknowledged that the Board may review whether the agency has complied with its procedures for revoking a security clearance, even though it may not review the substance of the revocation decision. The government's brief in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We agree with the Board that it may examine whether the agency made such a determination [to revoke a security clearance], that is, whether the agency had procedures for denying or revoking clearances and whether the procedures were followed. The Board also could, in an appropriate case, find that a determination was not validly made because the employee was not afforded procedural protections guaranteed to him by the agency's regulations....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Brief for Petitioner at 24-25, <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). In light of that concession, we decline to interpret <span class="Italic">Egan</span> as having precluded such review without comment. The Supreme Court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Service v. Dulles</span>, 354 U.S. 363 (1957), and <span class="Italic">Vitarelli v. Seaton</span>, 359 U.S. 535 (1959), also make clear that federal employees may challenge an agency's compliance with its regulations governing revocation of security clearances. Nothing in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> overrules those cases, and in fact the principle of those cases has been applied even in cases involving employee security issues. <span class="Italic">See Duane v. U.S. Dep't of Def.</span>, 275 F.3d 988, 993 (10th Cir. 2002) (holding that court was not precluded from reviewing a claim that agency violated its own procedural regulations when revoking or denying a security clearance); <span class="Italic">Reinbold v. Evers,</span> 187 F.3d 348, 359 n.10 (4th Cir. 1999) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In Mr. Romero's case, the Board was correct to reject the argument that the revocation of his Secret clearance was retaliatory, as that argument went to the merits of the security clearance decision. <span class="Italic">See Hesse,</span> 217 F.3d at 1380. The Board also did not err in finding that the agency had complied with the requirements of section 7513. Mr. Romero was provided with notice of his proposed removal, and the Department provided notice of the reasons for his removal and for the underlying revocation of his security clearance, and an opportunity to respond to the proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, however, did not address Mr. Romero's arguments that the Department failed to follow its own regulations in revoking his Secret security clearance. Mr. Romero has raised two challenges to the procedural validity of the Department's revocation of his Secret security clearance. First, he argues that the DIA-SAB was authorized to review the denial of his eligibility for access to SCI, but not to revoke his Secret security clearance. Second, he argues that the DIA-SAB did not actually revoke his Secret security clearance, even if it had authority to do so. As a result, he asserts that the WHS-CAF's "reciprocal revocation" of his Secret security clearance was invalid. Because there was no revocation to reciprocally accept, Mr. Romero claims that in order to revoke his Secret security clearance, the WHS-CAF was required to provide him with a statement of reasons, an opportunity to respond, and an opportunity to seek review of the revocation at the Personnel Security Appeals Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of those arguments, Mr. Romero relies on a July 16, 1998, memorandum from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense and DoD Regulation 5200-2-R.[1] The Board did not address whether the Department complied with its own procedures in revoking Mr. Romero's Secret security clearance. Because the answer to that question may turn on the way that the Defense Department's procedures are interpreted and have been applied, matters that are not fleshed out in the record before us, we are not in a position to decide whether Mr. Romero's procedural objections have merit. That issue should be addressed by the Board in the first instance. Accordingly, we vacate the Board's decision and remand for the Board to determine whether Mr. Romero can show that the Department failed to follow its procedures and that any failure to do so resulted in harmful error.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Mr. Romero also relies on Executive Order No. 12,968. That order, however, provides that it is "intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, create any right to administrative or judicial review, or any other right or benefit." Exec. Order No. 12,968 &#x00A7; 7.2(e). Such language in Executive Orders bars a court from reviewing agency <span id="Page_2554"></span>compliance with rules or regulations qualified in that manner. <span class="Italic">See Sur Contra La Contaminacion v. EPA</span>, 202 F.3d 443, 449 (1st Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Air Transp. Ass'n of Am. v. FAA</span>, 169 F.3d 1, 8-9 (D.C. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Morongo Band of Mission Indians v. FAA</span>, 161 F.3d 569, 575 (9th Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">State of Mich. v. Thomas</span>, 805 F.2d 176, 187 (6th Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The American Civil Liberties Union, as<span class="Italic"> amicus curiae</span>, argues that the Board erred because the record does not support a finding that Mr. Romero's Secret security clearance was actually revoked. We believe the WHS-CAF's statement that his eligibility "for access to classified information and to occupy a sensitive position has been revoked" shows that his clearance was revoked. In substance, the <span class="Italic">amicus</span>'s argument largely parallels the argument that the Department did not follow its own procedures when it issued the reciprocal revocation. It differs in one respect, however. Under section 7701(c)(2)(A), it is the employee's burden to show that the agency failed to follow its own procedures in reaching a removal decision and that the procedural deficiency constituted harmful error. Accepting the ACLU's characterization of the Department's action would seem to shift the burden to the Department to show compliance with its security clearance procedures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand by the court, the AJ sustained Mr. Romero's removal for loss of his clearance. The initial decision became final, and on a second appeal to the court, removal was sustained. The court discerned no harmful error in the agency's treatment of Mr. Romero's clearance issues. <span class="Italic">Romero v. DOD</span>, 658 F.3d 1372, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Wonders v. Dept. of Army</span>, 659 Fed. Appx. 646, 648 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">Applying <span class="Italic">Romero</span>, the Board declined to review substantive defenses other than the procedural error that occurred when an agency did not provide appellate level review within the agency to a decision to remove or cancel the employee's required ability to access classified information.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was an Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) in a United States Attorney's Office (USAO) until his January 16, 2009 removal. The events leading up to his removal began in August 2008. On August 4, 2008, Supervisor 3 (the United States Attorney) told the appellant that he was being reassigned from the Economic Crimes Unit to the Community Crimes Unit, i.e., the "Gun Unit." On August 11, 2008, the appellant submitted a reasonable accommodation request asking not to be reassigned, asserting that it would exacerbate his anxiety disorder. In response to the agency's request for medical documentation to support the request, the appellant submitted Doctor 1's (his psychologist's) August 29, 2008 letter. The last sentence of the letter stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">He [the appellant] is currently having obsessive thoughts that he will have suicidal or homicidal ideation if he is moved to the "guns unit." I view this as evidence of his potential to decompensate into a depression with paranoid features.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the letter, Employee 1 (the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys' (EOUSA's) Chief of Personnel Security Section) determined on September 9, 2008, that the appellant was no longer eligible to hold a Special-Sensitive Level 4 position and that his assignment as an AUSA posed an unnecessary and unacceptable operational security risk. On September 11, 2008, the agency placed the appellant on administrative leave. On September 18, 2008, the appellant filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) concerning his reassignment and office move. He subsequently responded to OSC's request for information, apparently identifying his public placement on administrative leave as another personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 10, 2008, Supervisor 3 proposed to remove the appellant based on charges of (1) "failure to maintain a qualification for your position," and (2) "posing an operational security risk to the office. Under Charge 1, Supervisor 3 stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In order to be qualified for an AUSA position, you must maintain eligibility to hold a Special-Sensitive, Level 4 position. On September 9, 2008, [Employee 1], Chief of the Personnel Security Section, EOUSA, determined that you were no longer eligible to hold a Special-Sensitive, Level 4 position. Therefore, you are no longer qualified for an AUSA position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under Charge 2, Supervisor 3 stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On September 9, 2008, [Employee 1], Chief of the Personnel Security Section, EOUSA, determined that your "continued assignment as an AUSA in the USAO poses an unnecessary and unacceptable operational security risk to the Department."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Supervisor 3 also explained, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant's AUSA position was designated as a Special-Sensitive, Level 4 position, which "involves the highest degree of trust; requires access, or affords ready opportunity to gain access, to Top Secret National Security Information (NSI) and material described in Executive Order 12356; and requires access to grand jury information. The appellant submitted a supplemental response to OSC, apparently identifying his proposed removal as another personnel action. OSC subsequently informed the appellant that it had closed its file and that he had the right to seek corrective action from the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Supervisor 4 (EOUSA Chief of Staff and Deputy Director) upheld the proposed removal based on the two charges identified in the proposal notice. He explained as follows: Based on Doctor 1's note, USAO management spoke with the EOUSA security programs staff, including Employee 1. During the conversation, USAO management detailed the appellant's history of aberrant behavior in the office. Based on Doctor 1's note and the conversation detailed in the notice of proposed removal, Employee 1 "determined that you were no longer eligible to hold a Special-Sensitive Level 4 position, which is a requirement to be an AUSA. In addition, [Employee 1] determined that you posed a security risk to the office. Based on [Employee 1 's] determinations [Supervisor 3] proposed your removal." As previously noted, the agency removed the appellant effective January 16, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal with the Board. The parties engaged in extensive prehearing activities, the appellant submitted voluminous records, and the administrative judge issued multiple orders. The administrative judge held a bifurcated hearing on August 25-27 and October 14, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the two charges brought against the appellant merged into one charge because they were both based on Employee l's September 9, 2008 determination and involved the same conduct. Based on regulations, delegations, and practice, he found that the agency officials who decided the appellant's case properly exercised responsibilities within their authority. In that regard, he found that the Attorney General (AG) was not required to personally decide whether the appellant should be removed. He noted that the agency did not take the action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532 and the applicable agency regulation, which would require the AG to make the decision; rather, it took the action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-13. He found that the appellant's interpretation of 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 0.138(a) as requiring the AG to personally decide all personnel actions involving agency attorneys was unreasonable on its face.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the requirement that the appellant maintain eligibility to hold a Special-Sensitive, Level 4 position, was functionally equivalent to a security clearance determination because employees in those positions have ready access to obtaining security clearances on short notice. He found that all AUSAs occupy Special-Sensitive, Level 4 positions; that under 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 17.12(d), the EOUSA's Security Programs Manager was authorized to withdraw access to classified information; and that Employee 1 had been delegated this authority in her position as Security Officer. He found that the appellant was not entitled to the procedures set forth at 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 17.47, which provide for Access Review Committee (ARC) review of any decision denying access to classified information, because he did not have actual access to classified information due to his lack of a security clearance. He acknowledged the appellant's argument that the agency's failure to grant him ARC review denied him due process rights to an "internal appeal procedure" to which he could object to an adverse decision on "security clearance issues." He found, though, that the appellant was afforded access to an "internal appeal procedure" that satisfied all due process requirements because the notice of proposed removal provided him with specific notice of the reasons for the proposed disciplinary action, allowing him to make an informed reply; Supervisor 4 considered his response before deciding to remove him; and Supervisor 4 specifically testified that he had authority to overturn Employee 1's security determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the administrative judge found that the requirement to maintain eligibility to hold a Special-Sensitive, Level 4 position was functionally equivalent to a security clearance determination, he applied the limited scope of Board review set forth in <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan,</span> 484 U.S. 518 (1988), in reviewing the appeal. Concerning the four factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> he found as follows: (1) the appellant was required to maintain eligibility to occupy a Special-Sensitive, Level 4 position; (2) the appellant's eligibility to occupy his position was withdrawn; (3) it was not feasible to transfer the appellant to a non-sensitive position; and (4) the agency followed the procedural requirements specified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 in processing the removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge addressed the appellant's affirmative defense of whistleblowing, although noting that the agency strenuously argued <span id="Page_2555"></span>that the defense cannot be heard under <span class="Italic">Egan.</span> Citing <span class="Italic">Fellhoelter v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 568 F.3d 965 (Fed. Cir. 2009), he found that, if the agency were able to establish by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed the appellant in any event, he was not required to examine the particulars of the whistleblowing defense. He rejected as unproven the appellant's affirmative defense after finding as follows: (1) the strength of the agency's evidence supporting its decision was strong, if not irrefutable because the agency's determination was functionally equivalent to a security clearance determination and the appellant could not challenge the agency's designation of his position as Special-Sensitive, Level 4 or the merits of its decision to revoke his eligibility to hold his position as part of a whistleblowing claim; (2) there was little evidence supporting the appellant's supposition that the agency officials who took this action had a motive to remove him; and (3) there was no evidence that the agency engaged in disparate treatment of whistleblowers in comparison to non-whistleblowers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge rejected as unproven the appellant's affirmative defense of disability discrimination as follows: The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act (ADAAA) of 2008 did not expressly change the meaning of reasonable accommodation. The appellant must articulate a reasonable accommodation under which he believes he could perform the essential duties of his position or of a vacant funded position to which he could be reassigned. The agency proved that the appellant was ineligible to hold his position, and the appellant did not show that there is any vacant funded position to which he could be reassigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also rejected as unproven the appellant's affirmative defense of retaliation for filing equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaints. The administrative judge acknowledged that the appellant established that he engaged in a protected activity and that officials taking the action knew of the activity. He found, though, that the appellant had not shown that the intensity of the agency's motive to retaliate overcame the reasonableness of the agency's action because his failure to meet an essential eligibility requirement for his position was a compelling, if not irrefutable basis for the agency's disciplinary action; he had not proven the existence of a similarly-situated employee comparator; there was no evidence from which an inference of retaliatory intent might be drawn; and the evidence did not show that the agency's action was pretextual in nature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Concerning the appellant's other defenses, the administrative judge rejected as unproven his argument that the agency did not give him the information on which it relied in proposing his removal. He found that the appellant failed to show harmful procedural error warranting reversal in the agency's reliance on disciplinary actions that allegedly should have been removed from the record. In that regard, the administrative judge found that the appellant cannot challenge the merits of the agency's action finding him ineligible to hold a Special-Sensitive, Level 4 position, and that, because consideration of the appellant's past disciplinary record and the underlying reasons for that record goes to the merits of the agency's decision, he could not show harmful error warranting reversal of the agency's action. The administrative judge acknowledged the appellant's contention that the agency was obligated by regulation to obtain independent medical verification of his condition and that it distorted the medical evidence relied on in its action, but similarly found that the appellant's argument addressed the merits of the agency's security determination, a matter beyond the Board's scope of review. He further acknowledged the appellant's allegation that, in failing to secure independent medical verification of his condition, the agency violated adjudicative guidelines under Exec. Order No. 12,968. He found, though, that Exec. Order No. 12,968 does not create any right to administrative or judicial review or any other right or benefit, citing <span class="Italic">Romero v. Department of the Defense,</span> 527 F.3d 1324, 1330 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge concluded that the Board must uphold the appellant's removal. He found that the agency had supported its charges by the requisite burden of proof and that the appellant had not established any affirmative defense warranting reversal of the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a petition for review. The agency filed a response opposing the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">ANALYSIS</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Designation of Position/Scope of Board Review</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's position was designated Special-Sensitive, Level 4. Although the appellant protests that he did not learn that he was required to maintain "a Level 4 clearance eligibility" until after his eligibility was revoked and he learned that he was to be terminated, he has not contested the administrative judge's finding. In that regard, the administrative judge cited agency documentation providing that all AUSA positions "are designated Level 4." He also cited testimony from Employee 3 (EOUSA Acting Chief Operating Officer and Acting Administrative Officer) that all AUSAs occupy Special-Sensitive, Level 4 positions. Further, he stated that, as he previously advised the parties, "the appellant cannot challenge the decision of the agency to classify his position as Special-Sensitive, Level 4. As the administrative judge found, the Board lacks authority to determine whether the agency properly designated the position. <span class="Italic">Skees v. Department of the Navy,</span> 864 F.2d 1576, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Brady v. Department of the Navy,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 133, 138 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his supplemental filing, the appellant asserts that, regardless of his position's designation, the limited scope of review set forth in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> does not apply in his case, citing <span class="Italic">Conyers v. Department of Defense,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 572 (2010), and <span class="Italic">Northover v. Department of Defense,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 451 (2010). He contends that the Board held in those decisions that <span class="Italic">Egan's</span> limited scope of review does not apply to adverse actions taken against federal employees "who do not actually have a security clearance," and states that the agency conceded that he did not have a security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's supplemental filing misinterprets <span class="Italic">Conyers</span> and <span class="Italic">Northover.</span> In those cases, the agencies stipulated that the appellants' positions did not require them to have security clearances or access to classified information. <span class="Italic">E.g., Conyers,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6; 13. Under those circumstances, the Board concluded that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> did not limit its statutory review authority. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board further concluded, however, that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> limits the Board's review of an otherwise appealable adverse action "if that action is based upon a denial, revocation or suspension of a 'security clearance,' i.e., involves a denial of access to classified information <span class="Italic">or eligibility for such access</span>." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added). Thus, the Board defined "security clearance" to mean "eligibility for access to, or access to, classified information." <span class="Italic">Conyers,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6; 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the limited scope of review set forth in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> applies in adjudicating the charge. The administrative judge correctly found that Employee 3 explained that the agency limits the number of actual security clearances it issues but that employees occupying Special-Sensitive, Level 4 positions "have ready access to security clearances should the need to secure one on short notice become necessary. The administrative judge also correctly found that Employee 3 further stated that "only employees who actually hold a security clearance have authority to review classified material. In its response, citing Exec. Order No. 12,968, the agency noted that AUSAs do not ordinarily maintain active security clearances because of government policy requiring that such clearances be limited, but explained that all AUSAs are subjected to the same background check as individuals with security clearances and must be able to be quickly authorized to handle classified information, thus making activation of security clearances "simply an administrative matter." The appellant has cited nothing to contest this representation. Thus, we find that the appellant's position required eligibility for access to classified information, and the limited scope of review set forth in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> applies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appears to be arguing that the agency was required to remove him under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532 because it based his removal on a national security determination, and, thus, that the AG was required to decide his appeal and he was entitled to the procedures set forth in that statutory provision. In that regard, he apparently believes that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511-13 governs only "suitability" proceedings. He contends that the agency similarly erred in not designating the officials involved in his removal proceedings consistent with that provision and its applicable regulations and in citing superseded regulations, and that the AG was required to decide his appeal, in any event. As the administrative judge found, the agency proceeded under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511-13, not 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532. Further, it was not required to act under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532, and if it had chosen to act under that authority, his removal would still not be subject to Board review. <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> 484 U.S. at 522 n.4. Moreover, to the extent that the appellant argues that Exec. Order No. 12,968 provides him with some appeal rights, it does not, at least not outside of the Department of Justice. <span class="Italic">Romero</span>, 527 F.3d at 1330. The appellant's assertion that the administrative judge's finding in that regard did not absolve the agency, because the agency was required to adhere to its own separate regulations in processing his removal, is addressed below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Application of Egan Scope of Review</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> the agency must prove only that the appellant was required to maintain eligibility to occupy a Special-Sensitive, Level 4 position; his eligibility was withdrawn; transfer to a position that did not require this eligibility was not feasible; and he was provided with the procedural requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530-31; <span class="Italic">see also Hesse v. Department of State,</span> 217 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The record shows that the agency met this burden of proof.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the unrebutted documentary evidence as well as testimony from at least four knowledgeable employees showed that the appellant's position required eligibility for Special-Sensitive, Level 4 status. Moreover, it is undisputed that the agency revoked the appellant's eligibility for Special-Sensitive, Level 4 status. Further, Employee 3 provided unrebutted <span id="Page_2556"></span>testimony that the agency did not have a regulation that gave the appellant the right to be considered for vacant, non-sensitive positions. The Board does not have authority to review the feasibility of reassigning the appellant to a vacant non-sensitive position, absent an enforceable right to such consideration. <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Defense Mapping Agency,</span> 864 F.2d 1579, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1989). In any event, the record reflects that all AUSA positions require Special-Sensitive, Level 4 eligibility, and therefore, that it was not feasible to assign the appellant to another AUSA position. The administrative judge found it undisputed that the agency followed the procedural requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 by providing the appellant with advance written notice of the charges and a reasonable amount of time to make an informed reply, by considering the appellant's response before issuing its decision, and by providing the reasons for that decision. Therefore, we find that, contrary to the appellant's assertion, the agency complied with the minimum due process requirements set forth in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> in removing him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Violation of Agency Regulations/Harmful Error</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues in this appeal that the administrative judge erred, under <span class="Italic">Romero,</span> 527 F.3d at 1329, in finding that the agency's action was analogous to a security clearance revocation, while concomitantly declining to enforce agency compliance with its own regulatory procedures for such revocations. In connection with this, he asserts that the agency erred in relying on Department of Justice Order 2610.2A, which gave authority to the EOUSA's "self-professed security expert" (Employee 1) to revoke his eligibility, and on Exec. Order No. 12,356. He contends that an agency Inspector General report recommended revising the order, that the order and Exec. Order No. 12,356 were superseded by Exec. Order No. 12,968, and that the order did not survive the promulgation of 28 C.F.R. part 17. He asserts that under 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 17.15(a), he was entitled to the ARC review procedures afforded employees whose security clearances were revoked. He contends that the administrative judge impermissibly equated the deciding official on his removal with ARC review of an internal appeal in finding that he received the required procedures. He further contends that the errors were harmful because they caused the agency to reach a conclusion different than it would have reached absent the errors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Romero,</span> 527 F.3d at 1329, the court acknowledged that the Board may not review the substance of a security clearance revocation decision and found that the Board did not err in finding that the agency had complied with 5 U.S.C. 7513 in removing Romero after it revoked his security clearance. The court vacated the Board's decision and remanded the matter, however, because the Board did not address whether Romero had shown that the agency committed harmful error in failing to follow its own procedures when revoking his Secret security clearance. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1325-26, 1329-30. The court found that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> and other decisions did not preclude the Board from reviewing whether the agency complied with its own regulations and procedures in revoking Romero's security clearance. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1329. The statutory basis for such review is 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A), which provides that the Board may not sustain an action on appeal if the appellant "shows harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at [its] decision." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1328.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that he had the right to ARC review of EOUSA's decision to withdraw his eligibility for access to classified information. Our analysis begins with a statute enacted in 1994, which charged the President with establishing standards for access to classified information that would bind all executive branch agencies, and also with establishing--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">uniform minimum standards to ensure that employees in the executive branch of Government whose access to classified information is being denied or terminated under this subchapter are appropriately advised of the reasons for such denial or termination and are provided an adequate opportunity to respond to all adverse information which forms the basis for such denial or termination before final action by the department or agency concerned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 435(a)(5). Pursuant to this statute, on August 2, 1995, President Clinton issued Exec. Order No. 12,968, which provides in relevant part as follows:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;...Suitability determinations shall not be used for the purpose of denying an applicant or employee the review proceedings of this section where there has been a denial or revocation of eligibility for access to classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From the foregoing, it is clear that departmental-level ARC review procedures mandated by Exec. Order No. 12,968 were intended to apply to termination of eligibility for access to classified information. The agency's argument that ARC review is available only for employees who have actually been granted access to classified information is based on 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 17.2(a), which describes the coverage of part 17 as "[a]ll employees, contractors, grantees, and others granted access to classified information." However, the regulations at part 17 must be read as a whole, not selectively. <span class="Italic">Lezama-Garcia v. Holder,</span> 666 F.3d 518, 532 (9th Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Benitez-Pons v. Comm. of Puerto Rico,</span> 136 F.3d 54, 63 (1st Cir. 1998). Section 17.15(a) states that the ARC "is hereby established to review all appeals from denials or revocations of <span class="Italic">eligibility for access</span> to classified information under Executive Order 12968" (emphasis supplied). Likewise, section 17.47 indicates that ARC review is available to an employee whose "eligibility for access to classified information" is being terminated; indeed, section 17.47(a) expressly references section 3.1 of Exec. Order No. 12,968, which deals with "eligibility for access to classified information." Furthermore, section 17.47(a) expressly contemplates a right of ARC review for "applicants," yet it is hard to imagine the agency giving an applicant for employment access to classified information; contrary to the agency's suggested reading of part 17, this provision would have meaning only if it were applied when an applicant sought ARC review of a denial of eligibility for access to classified information. Additionally, subsection (i) of section 17.47 unmistakably indicates that the right to ARC review is triggered when "there has been a denial or revocation of eligibility for access to classified information." It is also noteworthy that a June 3, 2011 opinion of the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel entitled <span class="Italic">Applicability of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act's Notification Provision to Security Clearance Adjudications by the Department of Justice Access Review Committee</span> states that the ARC review process under 28 C.F.R. part 17 is triggered when a "component determines that [an] employee is not eligible for access to classified information."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that where, as here, a component of the Department of Justice terminates an employee's eligibility for access to classified information, the Department's own rules provide for a right of review before the ARC. Absent an express grant of authority, a component of a department may not provide employees with lesser rights than are granted under a policy issued at the departmental level. <span class="Italic">Black v. Department of Transportation,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 87, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15 (2011). Here, EOUSA does not claim that it has authority to vary from 28 C.F.R. part 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 17.2(a) indicates (as the law would imply anyway) that if there is a conflict between 28 C.F.R. part 17 and Exec. Order No. 12,968, the Executive Order governs. Both the title of section 5.2 of Exec. Order No. 12,968 and the language of subsections (f)(2) and (3) of that section leave no doubt that an employee has a right to departmental-level (or agency-level, as the case may be) review when his eligibility for access to classified information is withdrawn. Because we find that the appellant had a right to ARC review under a plain reading of Exec. Order No. 12,968 and 28 C.F.R. part 17, we do not credit the testimony Employee 3, who opined that the appellant had no such right. <span class="Italic">Cf. Connolly v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 422, &#x00B6; 15 (2005) (an agency's interpretation of its own regulation is ordinarily entitled to deference, but no deference is due when that interpretation is "plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation" itself). We do not accept the agency's argument that this career-ending revocation was also exempt from the intra-department review procedures mandated by Exec. Order No. 12,968 and 28 C.F.R. part 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the foregoing, an agency's procedural error does not warrant reversal of an employee's removal unless the employee has shown that the error was harmful under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 (c)(2)(A). When an agency commits a procedural error in the course of an adverse action, the Board may not assume that the employee was harmed. <span class="Italic">Handy v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 754 F.2d 335, 337-38 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681 (1991). Rather, the appellant bears the burden of proving harm. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(1) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(1)]; <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 634 F.3d 1274, 1281-82 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Helms v. Department of the Army,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 6 (2010). A procedural error is harmful where the record shows that the error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)]; <span class="Italic">Stephen,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. at 685.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board lacks authority to review the merits of the revocation decision, and thus, cannot ultimately determine whether the agency's compliance with its own procedures would have resulted in a decision not to revoke the appellant's clearance, our reviewing court in <span class="Italic">Romero</span> unequivocally directed that the Board review whether an agency's failure to comply with its own regulations and procedures in revoking a security clearance is harmful error. <span class="Italic">Romero,</span> 527 F.3d at 1325-26, 1329-30. Where, as here, the agency failed to afford the appellant any access to its internal process, the Board does not have any record upon which to conduct the review mandated by <span class="Italic">Romero.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other circumstances, when the Board must defer to a decision that is within the sole discretion of the agency, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has indicated that the Board may opt to remand the matter back to the agency to make a redetermination on the matter. <span class="Italic">See LaChance v. Devall,</span> 178 F.3d 1246, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (when the Board reverses some of the charges, it may remand the appeal to the agency for a redetermination of the penalty, if there is an indication that <span id="Page_2558"></span>the agency would have imposed a lesser penalty for the misconduct sustained by the Board). Although <span class="Italic">Devall</span> concerned the deference that the Board must afford an agency's penalty determination, we find that it is applicable in this situation because it establishes a mechanism for the Board to resolve an appeal without intruding into a matter within the agency's sole discretion. Accordingly, we find that it is necessary to remand the appellant's removal to the agency for a determination in compliance with 28 C.F.R. part 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Medical Evidence</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues at length that the agency and the administrative judge did not properly handle or evaluate the medical evidence. He contends that the agency violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 752.404(c)(3) and .404(f). He also contends that he rebutted the agency's reasons for finding him ineligible for the position and an operational security risk by presenting testimony from his doctors. He cites several decisions as supporting his assertions that the agency violated Board precedent by using statements made to a private mental health professional as grounds to revoke his eligibility and terminate him and that the Board must independently consider the medical evidence. He asserts that the administrative judge erred in not mentioning his and his doctors' testimony and did not address Supervisor 4's alleged bias against, or ignorance of, mental health issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has failed to show any harmful or prejudicial error. He has not explained how 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(c)(3) applies to his situation because the record does not indicate that the agency prevented him from submitting medical evidence before he was removed, and, as stated above, he did so. Moreover, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(f) states only that an agency <span class="Italic">may</span> offer an examination. In any event, as the administrative judge essentially found, the Board lacks the authority to review whether the agency properly considered the medical evidence because it lacks the authority under <span class="Italic">Egan</span> to review the reasons underlying the ineligibility determination. The decisions the appellant cites do not involve the limited scope of Board review under <span class="Italic">Egan.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Whistleblowing/Retaliation</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in declining to accept the evidence he submitted at approximately 10 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on September 30, 2009, on the basis that it was untimely, while accepting agency documents submitted after 5 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on that date, and in finding that he did not prove his affirmative defense of whistleblowing. He apparently contends that the administrative judge erred in precluding him from presenting rebuttal evidence and evidence of motive to retaliate and in limiting the second hearing to Employee l's testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an August 31, 2009 Notice, the administrative judge informed the appellant that, one week before an October 1, 2009 prehearing conference, the appellant must provide a list of each whistleblowing disclosure as well as the date and to whom the disclosure was made, and that any additional exhibits and a list of witnesses with their expected testimony must be received one day in advance of the conference. On September 30, 2009, the appellant submitted a motion for leave to file his list of disclosures late, stating only that he believed that he had previously provided the information. The exhibits, which the appellant submitted at approximately 10:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on that date, consisted of seven volumes of documents. The agency objected to the motion, and the administrative judge sustained the objection, finding that the appellant did not establish good cause for his failure to comply with the clear instructions provided in the August 31, 2009 Notice. The administrative judge also rejected the exhibits, noting the time of submission; the number of exhibits, and therefore the impossibility of reviewing them in the October 1, 2009 conference; and the agency's objection. He indicated that, given his finding that the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed him even absent any protected disclosures, it was unnecessary to consider them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has failed to show that the administrative judge abused his discretion in rejecting the appellant's lists and exhibits or committed any prejudicial error in connection with his whistleblowing allegation. An administrative judge has wide discretion to control the proceedings, including holding prehearing conferences for the simplification of issues and ruling on exhibits and witnesses. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sanders v. Social Security Administration,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 10 (2010); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41. The Board will not overturn the administrative judge's rulings absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sanders,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 10. Here, we find that the appellant has failed to show that the administrative judge abused his discretion in rejecting seven volumes of exhibits submitted overnight before the date of the scheduled prehearing conference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, the appellant has not shown how any adjudicatory error prejudiced his substantive rights. The Board lacks jurisdiction to hear the appellant's whistleblowing affirmative defense, given the finding that this case is analogous to a security clearance determination and that the limited scope of Board review set forth in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> applies. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hesse,</span> 217 F.3d at 1380; <span class="Italic">Roach v. Department of the Army,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 464, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 48-54 (1999) (the Board found that the authority to review the merits of security clearance determinations under <span class="Italic">Egan</span> must be specifically granted by statute and that Congress has not specifically authorized the review such determinations as personnel actions under the Whistleblower Protection Act). Therefore, the appellant has provided no basis for reversing the initial decision on the ground that the administrative judge erred in declining to accept his exhibits. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Disability Discrimination</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant apparently asserts that the agency regarded him as disabled as evidenced by its previously granting him a limited accommodation and that it erred in not offering him reassignment as an accommodation. The Board generally cannot decide a claim of discrimination in an appeal from an action that was based on suspension or revocation of access to classified material because deciding the discrimination allegation would involve an inquiry into the validity of the agency's reasons for deciding to revoke the appellant's access to classified information. <span class="Italic">Helms,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Department of State,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 489, &#x00B6; 9 (1999), <span class="Italic">affd,</span> 217 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The Board may not engage in such an inquiry under <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> 484 U.S. at 530-31. Thus, in this appeal, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's disability discrimination claim and cannot address it on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Helms,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 9 and cases cited therein.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Penalty</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in refusing to order disclosure of documentation supporting the prior discipline taken against him and in not mitigating the penalty. Mitigation, however, is not appropriate in this type of case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Robinson v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 498 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (in an adverse employment action, such as removal, based on failure to maintain the security clearance required by the job description, the absence of a properly authorized security clearance is fatal to the job entitlement). Therefore, any error in this regard did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights and provides no basis for reversing the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Panter,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. at 282.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Campbell v. DOD</span>, SF-0752-16-0688-I-1 (NP 2/15/2023) ("Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A), the Board may not sustain an adverse action if the employee can show 'harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at such decision.' <span class="Italic">Blatt v.

If, on remand, the administrative judge is unable to make a determination as to whether the agency committed error and whether such error was harmful without reviewing the merits of the revocation decision, it may be appropriate to remand the matter to the agency to make a redetermination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 31-33 (2012) (finding it appropriate to remand to an agency to determine whether its procedural error was harmful to its access-eligibility determination). Such a remand would allow the Board to resolve the appeal without intruding into a matter within the agency's sole discretion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 33.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency procedural error in the review procedure involving an employee's ability to fill a noncritical sensitive position resulting in a finding of harmful error because the agency error led to the employee's loss of an agency appeal right that, if successful, could have resulted in the employee's continued employment in <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOD</span>, 646 Fed. Appx. 989, 992-94 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases concerning the denial of eligibility to occupy a sensitive position, our review is further limited to determinations relating to whether an agency properly followed its own internal procedures. <span class="Italic">See Romero v. Dep't of Def</span>., 527 F.3d 1324, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 661-62 (Fed. Cir. 1996). An agency's ultimate eligibility determination is unreviewable. <span class="Italic">Kaplan v. Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d 1148, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(r), harmful error is error "that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error." Because it is an affirmative defense, the party alleging harmful error has the burden of proof to demonstrate that an error was harmful, "i.e., that it caused substantial harm or prejudice to his...rights." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(r); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at &#x00A7; 1201.56.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government is correct that WHS-CAF's ultimate eligibility determination is unreviewable. <span class="Italic">Kaplan</span>, 733 F.3d at 1160. Thus, any harmful error defense requiring a determination that Mr. Brown would have been granted eligibility but for the error must fail. However, a harmful error defense is not limited to final agency determinations. A harmful error defense may be applied to a conclusion that causes "substantial harm or prejudice" to an individual's rights. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3). Therefore, a party may raise a harmful error defense concerning an agency's <span id="Page_2559"></span>ultimate conclusion, as well as any subsidiary conclusion, as long as that conclusion has a substantial impact on that party's rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the harm Mr. Brown alleges is not the denial of eligibility to occupy a sensitive position. Rather, it is the loss of his right to appeal that denial to WHS-CAF. Though Mr. Brown had no due process rights in connection with his eligibility, he did have statutory rights, which, under WHS-CAF's own procedures, included the right to have an adequate opportunity to reply to WHSCAF and have that reply be considered. <span class="Italic">See Gargiulo v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 727 F.3d 1181, 1186-87 (Fed. Cir. 2013). When WHS-CAF concluded that Mr. Brown should be denied the opportunity to be heard, his statutory rights were prejudiced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that had Mr. Lancaster treated Mr. Brightbill's letter as a response and forwarded it to WHSCAF, then Mr. Brown would not have lost his appeal rights before WHS-CAF. Further, if, at a minimum, Mr. Lancaster had advised Mr. Brightbill or Mr. Brown of the letter's deficiencies, timely corrective action could easily have been taken. But for Mr. Lancaster's error in failing to take any action regarding Mr. Brightbill's letter, WHSCAF would have provided Mr. Brown with the ability to appeal the denial of eligibility, a conclusion different from the one it reached. Because the appeal of Mr. Brown to appeal his denial to WHS-CAF resulted from Mr. Lancaster's action and inaction, Mr. Brown has met his burden in demonstrating harmful procedural error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we conclude that no reasonable factfinder would find that Mr. Brown has not met his burden in showing that Mr. Lancaster's failure to forward Mr. Brightbill's letter or otherwise contact Mr. Brown constituted harmful procedural error. Consequently, the Board's determination that there was no harmful error is unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Of a procedural problem during the clearance revocation process, the Board cautioned as to limitations on its scope of review, <span class="Italic">Green v. DOD,</span> DC-0752-11-0231-I-1 (NP 8/5/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that the Board may not review security clearance decisions for minimum due process because federal employees do not have a liberty or property interest in access to classified information. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 498 F.3d 1361, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2007). However, the Board may still consider whether the agency committed harmful error by violating its own procedures in revoking a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See Romero</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of Defense</span>, 527 F.3d 1324, 1328-39 (2008). On review, the appellant reiterates his argument that he did not receive his complete security file from the agency, appearing to assert that the agency violated its own policy by not providing him with three foreign contact reports. We agree with the administrative judge's finding that the evidence shows that the agency provided him with copies of the documents relied on during the security clearance revocation process. Further, even if the appellant had established that the agency erred by not providing him with the foreign contact reports, he has failed to prove his affirmative defense of harmful error because he did not show that any such error would have had a harmful effect on the outcome of the case before the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boltz v. Social Security Administration</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 568, &#x00B6; 10 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that he was not "informed of the actual grounds for the allegations for the discharge." To the extent the appellant is arguing that he was not provided with specific reasons for the revocation of his security clearance, the Board may not consider his claim because security clearance decisions are not reviewable for minimum due process protection. <span class="Italic">See Robinson</span>, 498 F.3d at 1364-65.</p>

However, it would be impossible to determine the merits of that claim without considering the substance of the clearance determination, which lies outside our review authority.
