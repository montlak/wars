<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-71"><span class="space">1.</span> Veteran, Other Preferences</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Veterans preference laws give priority to the retention of veterans. Courts treat these rights with solicitude. <span class="Italic">Monaco v. United States</span>, 523 F.2d 935, 939 (9th Cir. 1975) ("A pension is the most direct and calculable of a government's bounties to ex-servicemen. <span class="Italic">A fortiorari</span>, with respect to a fringe benefit like a preferential right to retention in federal civil service employment."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Brannan v. Elder</span>, 71 S. Ct. 685 (1951) (legislative background and regulatory application of veterans preference). Evidence of veterans preference rights affecting RIF entitlements should be submitted to the AJ, not to the Board for the first time through a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schroeder v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 60 MSPR 566, 573 (1994). If RIF rights depend on veterans preference status, specifically on whether an individual employed in a civilian capacity was earlier retired on the basis of disability during military service, the Board will not go behind the military record of the reasons established for retirement. <span class="Italic">Parton v. Dept. of Army</span>, 4 MSPR 74, 77-78, 4 MSPB 162 (1980). [Refer to "<a href="0100-2023-08-064.html#sec1-65">Preference Eligible Status</a>" in Chapter 1.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For examination of the Dual Compensation Act and its effect on retention standing, review <span class="Italic">Burrough v. TVA</span>, 43 MSPR 117, 120-23 (1990), partially overruling <span class="Italic">Billings</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Starkey v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 198 F.3d 851, 855 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (remanding to the Board the issue of whether the appellant was entitled to a veterans preference as a result of "constructive service" that would count toward "active service"). <span class="Italic">Brooks v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 207, 211-15 (1993), discussed 5 USC 6303(a)(3)(B) concerning creditable military service for RIF annual leave accrual purposes, including consideration of benefits to military personnel who served during periods of war or in campaigns or expeditions supporting campaign badges.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 3501(a)(3)(B), a retired military member is considered preference eligible only if his service time is not more than 20 years of full-time active service; the formula does not include constructive time that may have been granted by the military for purposes of pension computation. <span class="Italic">Billings v. TVA</span>, 21 MSPR 630, 632 (1984). Preference eligibility for a retired military member was explored in <span class="Italic">Reyes v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 476, 480-82 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3075"></span>A retired member of the military may be considered a preference eligible if his retired pay from a uniformed service is not based upon 20 or more years of full-time service regardless of when performed but not including periods of active duty for training. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.501(d); <span class="Italic">Burrough v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 43 MSPR 117, 120 (1990). An employee whose retirement pay is based on at least 20 years of full-time active service is considered, for RIF purposes, to have 20 or more years of full-time service even when the actual day-for-day service totals less than 20 years (the military sometimes awards "constructive time" for pension purposes as a bonus for beneficial actions taken by a military member). <span class="Italic">See Burrough</span>, 43 MSPR at 119, 121.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted below that his military service began in May 1966, and he presented a December 1983 performance evaluation (prepared by Lt. Cmdr. D.L. Marra, U.S. Navy, of the USS Coontz) which referred to his 17 years of military service. The Standard Form (SF) 50 effecting the appellant's first appointment with the agency cited a military retirement date of December 18, 1985. Based on the evidence presented below, then, the appellant's retirement might have been based on less than 20 years of active service. In that case, the appellant should have been considered a preference eligible, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Burrough</span>, 43 MSPR at 120, and the agency thus should have placed him in subgroup A. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.501(c). By operation of the retention preference standings, then, Mr. Baskerville (subgroup B) should have been released from the competitive level before the appellant, and the latter's separation thus should not have been effected. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.601(a).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant is a preference eligible, his separation must be reversed, for the reasons stated above. If he is a non-preference eligible and thus falls within subgroup B, he can receive credit for prior military service for RIF purposes (as he requested below) only for the length of time in active service in the armed services during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.503(c)(1). The phrase "during a war" has been interpreted to mean only those conflicts for which Congress issued a declaration of war, i.e., World War I and World War II. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 68 MSPR 395, 397 (1995); <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 59 MSPR 207, 210-15 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not claimed service during those conflicts but has claimed service during the Vietnam Era and for the Grenada campaign. To receive credit for his service during the Vietnam Era, the appellant must have received the Vietnam Service Medal or the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brooks</span>, 59 MSPR at 214. Nothing in any of the submissions filed by the appellant shows that he has received either award, and he thus cannot receive credit for service in the Vietnam Era. <span class="Italic">See id....</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Constructive service was again in controversy, and again explained, <span class="Italic">Kizer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 87 MSPR 249, 252-55 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-15 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant served as an enlistee in the Navy before he joined the civil service. According to Form DD-214, Report of Separation from Active Duty, which the appellant submitted with his petition for appeal, in 1974 the appellant was transferred from the regular Navy to the Fleet Reserve with 19 years, 6 months, and 12 days of "total active service." In the petition for appeal itself, the appellant checked the box marked "Yes" in response to the question: "Are you a veteran and/or entitled to the employment rights of a veteran?." He wrote next to the box: "Navy Service &#x003C; 20 years (19 yrs 6 months) but received a 20 yr retirement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For RIF purposes, "a retired member of a uniformed service is considered a preference eligible only if his service does not include twenty or more years of full-time active service, regardless of when performed but not including periods of active duty for training." 5 USC &#x00A7; 3501(a)(3)(B). Congress imposed the 20-year rule in 1964 because it believed that an individual who retired after a 20-year military career and then joined the civil service would have too much of an advantage over others if, in addition to entitling him to military retired pay, his military service conferred "built-in seniority" in the civil service<span class="Italic">. See Burrough v. Tennessee Valley Authority,</span> 43 MSPR 11 7, 121 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The military branches allow (or at least did allow at the relevant time) retirement with fewer than 20 years of actual service, based on "constructive service." Constructive service is credited "for various reasons, such as early reenlistment, but [is] not actually served<span class="Italic">. Starkey v. Department of the Navy,</span> 198 F.3d 851, 854 (Fed. Cir. 2000). A service member can achieve 20 years of service credit toward retirement by combining actual service, i.e., real calendar time, with constructive service. The statute governing veterans' preference for RIF purposes, 5 USC &#x00A7; 3501(a)(3)(B), does not specify whether the 20-year "active service" limit includes actual service and constructive service, or actual service only. <span class="Italic">Starkey,</span> 198 F.3d at 855. The Office of Personnel Management has filled this gap with a regulation, found valid by our reviewing court, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, which sets forth a simple test for determining whether the 20-year limit has been met: If the individual's <span class="Italic">retired pay</span> is based on 20 or more years of active service, he is not eligible for veterans' preference. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.501(d)(2). "Under the regulation, it does not matter how the retiree's pay was determined (including or excluding constructive service), just what the basis for the pay is." <span class="Italic">Starkey,</span> 198 F.3d at 854.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge resolved the veterans' preference eligibility question as follows: "Given that the uncontroverted evidence reflects that the appellant's military pay is based upon less than 20 years of active service, I find that the appellant is entitled to veterans' preference for RIF purposes." We disagree with this finding. There were only two pieces of evidence bearing on the active service question before the administrative judge. The first, the Form DD-214 described above, indicates merely that as of December 23, 1974, the appellant's "total service for pay" was 19 years, 7 months, and 29 days. The form does not indicate what the basis was for his retired pay at the time of the RIF <span class="Italic">in 1999</span>. The other piece of evidence was the appellant's hand-written notation on his petition for appeal: "Navy Service &#x003C; 20 years (19 yrs 6 months) but received a 20 yr retirement." This notation indicates that for purposes of retirement eligibility the appellant was credited with 20 years of service, although it does not directly address the basis for the appellant's retired pay, which is the relevant inquiry.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency bears the burden of proving that it properly invoked and administered the RIF regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Vickers v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Labor,</span> 20 MSPR 114, 116 (1984). The appellant argues in response to the petition for review that the agency has failed to meet its burden of proving that it placed him in the correct tenure group. As explained below, we conclude that the appeal should be remanded for supplementation of the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again, the Form DD-214 that the appellant submitted with his petition for appeal showed that the appellant transferred from the regular Navy to the Fleet Reserve. By law, a transfer to the Fleet Reserve is permitted only if the service member concerned "has completed 20 or more years of active service." 10 USC &#x00A7; 6330(b). Thus, despite the appellant's unsupported assertion that he was entitled to veterans' preference, the agency could reasonably have believed that the appellant had 20 or more years of active service in the Navy. Such a belief would have been supported by the appellant's own statement in the petition for appeal to the effect that he had received a "20 yr retirement from the Navy." Prior to the hearing the appellant asserted that he "had only worked 19 years and 6 months in military service," but he did not claim that he never received credit for constructive service, nor did he assert that his retired pay was based on fewer than 20 years of active service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is similar to <span class="Italic">Hargis v. Tennessee Valley Authority,</span> 41 MSPR 490) 493 (1989), where the appellant, who had been treated as a non-veteran in a RIF, asserted in his petition for appeal that he was a veteran. The Board found the record incomplete on the issue and remanded the appeal for the taking of additional evidence; it did not resolve the matter against the agency for failing to present evidence that the appellant was not a veteran<span class="Italic">. See also Reyes v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 70 MSPR 476, 480-81 (1996) (where there was a "legitimate question" as to whether the appellant, a military retiree, should have been given veterans' preference in a RIF, and where the record was "fragmentary" on the issue, the appeal was remanded for the taking of additional evidence).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a case such as this, adversarial principles must yield to the public interest in achieving the right result. <span class="Italic">See Schroeder v. Department Of</span> <span class="Italic">Transportation,</span> 60 MSPR 566, 577 (1994) (it could have led to "illogical and inequitable results" that would have "work[ed] an injustice on the federal workforce and its mission" if a RIF appeal were decided in the appellant's favor because of a void in the record); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Wutke v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 67 MSPR 523, 527-28 (1995) (supplementation of the record was permitted, where deciding a retirement case in favor of the government based on the incomplete record developed before the administrative judge likely would have led to the wrong result). If this were a case in which there was more than one plausible version of the facts and the only evidence to be adduced was from witnesses with an interest in the outcome, it might be seen as unfair or unwise to remand the case for supplementation of the record. However, we see no reason for resolving this case based on a void in the record, when we would expect that it could be determined with near certainty, by resort to documentary evidence or disinterested witnesses (the officials responsible for disbursing the appellant's military retired pay) whether or not the appellant's retired pay is based on fewer than 20 years of active service....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board analyzed Indian preference rights in a RIF, <span class="Italic">Antoine v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 63 MSPR 185, 186-88 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 25 USC 46, "[p]reference shall at all times, as far as practicable, be given to Indians in the employment of clerical, mechanical, and other help on reservations and about agencies." The appellant alleged below, and the agency did not dispute, that he performed mechanical work on the Grand Coulee Dam Project which was partly on the Colville reservation. <span id="Page_3076"></span>The appellant asserted that 25 USC 46 afforded preference to Indian employees in the application of RIF regulations and that he should have preceded non-Indians on the retention register. The administrative judge found that the appellant was not entitled to preference for RIF purposes because 25 USC 472a grants such preference only to Indian employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and the Indian Health Service (IHS). That statute provides in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">For purposes of applying reduction-in-force procedures under...[5 USC 3502(a)], with respect to positions within the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service, the competitive and excepted service retention registers shall be combined, and any employee entitled to Indian preference who is within a retention category established under regulations prescribed under such subsection to provide due effect to military preference shall be entitled to be retained in preference to other employees not entitled to Indian preference who are within such retention category.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">25 USC 472a(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly found, the appellant is not employed by the BIA or IHS, and therefore 25 USC 472a does not apply to him. Nothing in that statutory provision, however, bars Indian employees from receiving a preference under some other statutory provision. The appellant argues that 25 USC 46 affords him retention preference as an Indian employee for RIF purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Interpreting Indian preference laws and their effect on the order of retention in a RIF before the enactment of 25 USC 472a, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Mescalero Apache</span> <span class="Italic">Tribe v. Hickel</span>, 432 F.2d 956, 959-61 (10th Cir. 1970), <span class="Italic">cert</span>. <span class="Italic">denied sub nom.</span>, <span class="Italic">Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Russell</span>, 401 U.S. 981, 91 S. Ct. 1195, 28 L. Ed.2d 333 (1971), found that Indian employees of the BIA were not entitled to preferential treatment in RIF actions under the provisions of 25 USC 44, 46, and 472. In 1979, Congress enacted section 472a, granting Indian employees of the BIA and IHS retention preference in RIFs to "overcome the adverse effects of the <span class="Italic">Mescalero</span> decision." <span class="Italic">Preston v. Heckler</span>, 734 F.2d 1359, 1371 n.15 (9th Cir. 1984) (quoting the legislative history of 25 USC 472a at H.R. Rep. No. 370, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1979), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1979 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Adm. News 2068, 2077). Congress did not similarly amend sections 44, 46, and 472 regarding Indian employee preference, however. We agree with the Tenth Circuit that 25 USC 46 does not extend preference for Indian employees to the order of retention in a RIF<span class="Italic">. See Mescalero Apache Tribe</span>, 432 F.2d at 959-61. Furthermore, the fact that Congress chose to enact 25 USC 472a to afford RIF retention preference to Indian employees of the BIA and IHS, but did not amend sections 44 and 46, indicates that Congress did not intend to grant such a retention preference to Indian employees of other agencies. <span class="Italic">See generally Benedetto v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 32 MSPR 530, 534 (1987) (Congress's expression of one statutory exception indicates that no other exceptions apply), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub</span> <span class="Italic">nom.</span>, <span class="Italic">Horner v. Benedetto</span>, 847 F.2d 814 (Fed. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute authorizing the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to prescribe regulations for the release of competing employees in a RIF, 5 USC 3502, directs OPM to give due effect to an employee's tenure of employment, military preference, length of service, and efficiency or performance ratings. The statute makes no mention of preference of any kind other than that based on military service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 3502(a). OPM's implementing regulations at 5 CFR 351.501 prescribe the method for determining the order of retention, taking account of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, veteran preference, but do not mention any other preferences. While the RIF regulations do not refer to the retention preference for Indians employed by the BIA and the IHS under 25 USC 472a, that statute itself provides the details for implementing the preference. In contrast, 25 USC 46 is utterly silent as to RIFs. Thus, we find no support for the appellant's argument that 25 USC 46 provides him as an Indian employee with retention preference in this RIF appeal.</p>
