<p class="Body-Text">Veterans preference eligibility may provide advantage to the veteran who applies for a job with the federal government; it may establish a Board appeal right for an individual in the excepted service; and it may provide competitive advantage among employees vying for a limited number of positions during a reduction in force. As to appeal rights, 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B) defines employees who may bring appealable actions to the Board to include a "preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions: (i) in an Executive agency; or (ii) in the United States Postal Service or Postal Rate Commission." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vercelli v.

<p class="Body-Text">Through 1990 and the Civil Service Due Process Amendments, even though an individual completed one year of service, he did not have an appeal right in an action brought under 5 USC 7511-13 if he was in the excepted service without veterans preference. <span class="Italic">Richardson v.

Under 5 U.S.C. 7511, as an employee in the excepted service who was not a preference eligible, he was not an 'employee' for the purpose of Subchapter II (Removal,...). As such, he was not entitled to the procedural or appellate rights provided to certain employees in removal cases under Title 5, and had no entitlement to appeal his allegedly involuntary resignation...."). Following the Civil Service Due Process Amendments, as of August 17, 1990, a preference eligible in the excepted service continued to enjoy appeal rights after a waiting period of one year; without preference eligibility, other excepted service employees acquired MSPB appeal rights upon completion of a two-year waiting period.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Preference eligibility is a matter of considerable jurisdictional significance for the MSPB. In one case, an agency's personnel paperwork stated that the appellant was a preference eligible but the agency then discovered at the PFR stage that the appellant was not entitled to preference eligible status. On the theory that jurisdiction may be raised at any time, the Board allowed the agency to challenge the appellant's status at the PFR stage and remanded the case to the judge for receipt and evaluation of evidence concerning that status. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fish v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...While the appellant asserts that she is a veteran, not all veterans are preference eligible. To qualify as a preference eligible, a veteran, such as the appellant, must, among other things, have served on active duty in the armed forces of the United States, including in the reserve components. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108; 38 U.S.C. 101(10); <span class="Italic">Strachan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 333, 336-37 (1994). "Active duty" is defined in relevant part as "full-time duty in the Armed Forces, other than active duty for training." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(21)(A); <span class="Italic">see Strachan,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. at 337. "Active duty for training" is defined, in pertinent part, as "full-time duty in the Armed Forces performed by Reserves for training purposes." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(22)(A); <span class="Italic">Strachan,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. at 337.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge findings that, while the appellant is a veteran, she is not preference eligible. Specifically, on an initial employment form, the appellant clearly indicated that she is not preference eligible. Further, the appellant's initial employment form and DD-214 form indicate that the appellant served in the Army Reserves for approximately 4 months, that she had no prior active service, and that the appellant was separated from "initial active duty training." Because the appellant was serving in the Army Reserves for training purposes, she does not meet the definition of "active duty" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3), and therefore has not shown that she is preference eligible. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(21)(A) and 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(22)(A). Accordingly, the administrative judge properly found that the appellant has no appeal rights to the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reserve training status relative to preference eligibility was discussed in <span class="Italic">Geiren v. MSPB</span>, 476 Fed. Appx. 256, 258-59 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board correctly found that Ms. Geiren does not satisfy those requirements. While there is no dispute that Ms. Geiren completed at least one year of continuous service with the Postal Service, the evidence in the record indicates that Ms. Geiren is not a preference-eligible veteran. The statute defining veterans' preference provides that veterans who served on "active duty" are eligible for preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1). The term "active duty" is defined as "full-time duty in the Armed Forces, <span class="Italic">other than active duty for training</span>." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(21)(A) (emphasis added). The term "active duty for training," in turn, is defined as "full-time duty in the Armed Services performed by Reserves for training purposes." 21 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(22)(A), (26), (27)(A). Thus, the statute expressly excludes reserve training from the type of service that qualifies a veteran for preference. <span class="Italic">Cf. Burrow v. Nicholson</span>, 245 Fed. Appx. 972, 973 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting that Department of Veterans Affairs regulations distinguish active duty from Army Reserve service). Ms. Geiren's Form DD214 indicates that she participated only in initial active duty training with the Army Reserve for about four months. There is no evidence that she served in any capacity other than reserve training. Ms. Geiren, therefore, cannot claim that she is a preference-eligible veteran.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her informal brief, Ms. Geiren argues that "the law states a veteran qualifies under the requirements of MSPB." Ms. Geiren fails to take into account the preference-eligibility requirement. As we have explained above, not all veterans have the right to appeal; only preference-eligible veterans do. Ms. Geiren's four months of reserve service is insufficient to make her eligible for veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Veterans preference status may depend upon active duty status during a period and in an endeavor that qualifies for a campaign badge. If preference eligibility depends upon service on active duty in the Armed Forces in a "campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized," 5 USC 2108(1)(A), 2108(3)(A), and if the agency offers record evidence showing that the appellant lacks that status, the appellant will be expected to come forward with more than a bare claim to entitlement <span id="Page_78"></span>to that status for the Board to exercise jurisdiction based on veterans preference eligibility. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bergon v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant's DD Form 214 shows he served on active military duty from 1989 until 1997, when he received an "Honorable" discharge. The agency, relying upon 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)-(3), asserted below that an employee is a preference eligible if he served on active duty in the armed forces during a war between 1952-1955, 1955-1976, or 1990-1992, or served in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized; is a disabled veteran; or shares certain familial relationships with a preference eligible or disabled veteran. The agency argued below that the appellant's "mere service on active duty" did not make him a preference eligible and that there was no evidence to show he had served in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge was authorized. The administrative judge relied upon this reasoning in his initial decision dismissing the appellant's prior appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress, however, amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108 in 1998[2] to expand the definition of a preference eligible to include an individual who "served on active duty as defined by section 101(21) of title 38 in the armed forces during the period beginning on August 2, 1990, and ending on January 2, 1992...and who has been discharged or released from active duty in the armed forces under honorable conditions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(C), (3)(B).[3] Whereas under prior law an individual had to have actually served in the southwest Asia theater of operations to receive preference-eligible status based upon active duty during the first Persian Gulf conflict, that requirement no longer holds, and "mere service on active duty" between August 2, 1990, and January 2, 1992, is sufficient to confer preference-eligible status. <span class="Italic">Wyatt v.

The agency correctly amended the appellant's PS Form 50 to show that he was a preference eligible based upon his service on active military duty from 1989 until 1997, followed by his "Honorable" discharge. Thus, the appellant, as a preference eligible who has completed one year of current continuous service, has Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See Bolton</span>, 154 F.3d at 1316 &#x0026; n.2.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Determination of preference eligibility can become complex, depending on the timing and nature of the military service and the terms of discharge from the service. The term "preference eligible" most commonly reflects a special privilege as to appointment, retention, or appeal rights conferred upon those who have served in our Armed Forces. The term is defined at 5 USC 2108 to include disabled veterans and certain veterans who have served in time of conflicts or from 1952 through 1976, with exceptions for short-term service and some service in the National Guard and reserves. As further defined by 5 USC 2108(1), a preference eligible is an individual who served on active duty and who was separated from the Armed Forces under honorable conditions.

An appellant may also qualify under a statutory definition of preference eligible that covers those who served on active duty in the armed forces between August 2, 1990, and January 2, 1992, and received honorable discharges. <span class="Italic">Olson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "preference eligible" includes disabled veterans and certain veterans who have served in times of conflict from 1952 through 1976, excluding short terms of service and some service in the National Guard and reserves. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2108; 38 USC 101(21). Here, the appellant was not a preference eligible because he served from 1979 to 1987, is not disabled, and did not directly participate in an armed conflict.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Strachan v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 333, 336-39 (1994), discussed preference eligibility relative to the nature of service on active duty and in the reserves:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has claimed preference eligibility under 5 USC 2108(3)(B), which defines a "preference eligible" to include a "veteran" as defined by 5 USC 2108(1)(B). Section 2108(1)(B), 5 USC, defines "veteran" as an individual who has:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">served on <span class="Italic">active duty as defined by section 101(21) of title 38</span> at any time in the armed forces for a period of more than 180 consecutive days any part of which occurred after January 31, 1955, and before the date of the enactment of the Veterans' Education and Employment Assistance Act of 1976, <span class="Italic">not including service under section 511(d) of title 10</span> pursuant to an enlistment in the Army National Guard or the Air National Guard or as a Reserve for Service in the Army Reserve, Naval Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, or Coast Guard Reserve; and who has been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions[.] [Emphases added.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not determine whether the appellant has been "separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions," because we find that the appellant has failed to satisfy the "active duty" requirement for preference eligibility under 5 USC 2108(1)(B), (3)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the appellant performed some type of active duty service for slightly more than 180 days and that this service occurred in 1961, a period covered by 5 USC 2108(1)(B). The issue is whether this type of active duty constituted "active duty as defined by section 101(21) of title 38" and not "service under section 511(d) of title 10 pursuant to an enlistment...in the Army Reserve...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Active duty" is defined by section 101(21) of title 38, in pertinent part, as "full-time duty in the Armed Forces, other than active duty for training." 38 USC 101(21)(A). For purposes of this definition, "Armed Forces" is defined as "the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard, including the reserve components thereof." 38 USC 101(10); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> 5 USC 2101(2) (defining "armed forces" as "the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard" without specifically including the reserve components). "Active duty for training" is defined, in pertinent part, as "full-time duty in the Armed Forces performed by Reserves for training purposes." 38 USC 101(22)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under section 511(d) of title 10, a "non-prior-service person" who enlists in the Reserves must "perform an initial period of active duty for training of not less than twelve weeks to commence insofar as practicable within 270 days after the date of that enlistment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge determined that, since individuals enlisting in the Reserves were required to "perform an initial period of active duty for training of not less than twelve weeks," under 10 USC 511(d), the appellant's 6 months of active duty must have included a minimum of 12 weeks, or approximately 3 months, of active duty for training. She further determined that, when the 3 months of active duty for training were subtracted from the 6 months of total active duty service, the remaining active duty service period did not satisfy the minimum 180 consecutive days of active duty, not for training, required for preference eligibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on petition for review that the administrative judge erred in relying on 10 USC 511(d) to deny his claim of preference eligibility, because that provision was not enacted until 1963, several years after his period of active duty service. We need not address this argument because the appellant did not raise it below and has not shown that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite his due diligence.... Moreover, even considering the substance of the argument, we find that it is without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, subsection (d) of 10 USC 511 was not enacted until 1963. Universal Military Training Act, Pub. L. 88-110, &#x00A7; 3, 77 Stat. 134-35 (1963). Our review of the legislative history behind Pub. L. 88-110 reveals, however, that, even before this provision was enacted, those enlisting in the Reserves were required to undergo 3-6 months of "active duty for training," depending on the particular enlistment program, and that the purpose of the provision was to provide "flexibility, uniformity, and equity within the Reserve enlistment programs" by, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, requiring "[a] minimum period of active duty for training of not less than 4 months and leaving the maximum to be determined by the training period necessary to qualify the individual in the military specialty for which he enlisted." S. Rep. No. 388, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. (1963), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1963 USCCAN 849-50.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, it is apparent that, at the time the appellant performed his active duty service in the Reserves, in 1961, Reserve enlistment programs required a minimum of 3 to 6 months of active duty for training. The appellant admitted that he enlisted under a program requiring only 6 months of active duty service and has, in fact, claimed only 6 months of active duty service. Because this 6-month period must have included, at a minimum, 3 months of active duty for training, the appellant has failed to establish that he served 180 consecutive days of active duty, other than active duty for training. We therefore agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to establish his preference eligibility.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Geiren v. MSPB</span>, 476 Fed. Appx. 256, 258-59 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Preference eligible status may depend on a minimum period of military service, although there are exceptions to the minimum service requirements, as <span class="Italic">Gordon-Cureton v. USPS</span>, 105 MSPR 165, 169-70 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-16, 2007 MSPB 71 (2007), also including comments (not excerpted here) on service in training status, noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is, however, another issue that we must consider in order to determine whether the appellant is preference eligible. An individual who entered on active duty after October 13, 1982, and who was discharged or released from a period of active duty before completing the shorter of either 24 months of continuous active duty, or the full period for which she was called or ordered to active duty, is generally not eligible by reason of such period of active duty for any benefit based on meeting the definition of preference eligible in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3). 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5303A(d); <span class="Italic">Kelley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 38, &#x00B6; 7 (1999). Certain classes of individuals are exempt from this minimum active service requirement. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5303A(b)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Evidence submitted below by the appellant shows that she served on active duty from February 9, 1989, until April 28, 1989, and from November 21, 1990, until January 15, 1991. She therefore has not completed 24 months of continuous active service. However, because the circumstances under which the appellant was released from active duty and discharged from the Army are not apparent from the record before us, we are unable to determine whether the appellant served the entire period for which she was called to active duty, or whether she is exempt from the minimum active service requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has asserted that the appellant received a "hardship honorable discharge." Although the record establishes that the appellant did receive an honorable discharge, there is no evidence to support the agency's assertion that it was a hardship discharge. However, if the appellant did receive a hardship discharge, she would be exempt from the minimum active service requirement in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5303A(d). 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5303A(b)(3) (exempting from the minimum active service requirement "a person who is discharged or released from active duty under section 1171 or 1173 of title 10"); 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1173 (authorizing hardship discharges).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the appellant is not exempt from the minimum active service requirement, whether she satisfied that requirement remains an open question. The appellant's unit was called to active duty "for a period of [180] days ([6] months) unless sooner released or later extended." The appellant was released from active duty just 55 days after she was called up. It is not clear from the record before us why the appellant served less than the full 180 days. It is possible that the Army released the appellant's entire unit from active duty earlier than initially planned. If so, the appellant would have served the entire period for which she was called to active duty, and she would therefore be entitled to veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_80"></span>Given the absence of evidence in the record concerning the circumstances under which the appellant was released from active duty and discharged from the Army, we are unable to determine whether the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal. Because the appellant was not informed that the minimum service requirement was a jurisdictional issue, remand is necessary to give the appellant an opportunity to address that issue. <span class="Italic">See Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the AJ may need to hold a hearing before making a jurisdictional determination. If the appellant makes non-frivolous allegations of Board jurisdiction, then she is entitled to a hearing at which she must prove jurisdiction by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006). In determining whether the appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling her to a hearing, the AJ may consider the agency's documentary submissions; however, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the AJ may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive<span class="Italic">. Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994). Therefore, if the parties offer conflicting evidence on remand concerning the circumstances under which she was released from active duty in January 1991, or any other potentially dispositive matter, the AJ should grant the appellant's request for a hearing in order to resolve those factual disputes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">Easley v. USPS,</span> 100 MSPR 344, 345-46 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-6 (2005), the statutory scheme now in effect does not permit "active duty for training" to qualify for veterans preference:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A Postal Service employee with at least one year of current continuous service in a single position or similar positions may appeal an adverse action to the Board if at the time of the action he or she was: (1) A preference eligible, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(ii); or (2) a manager, supervisor, or personnelist doing other than purely non-confidential clerical work, 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). There is no dispute that the appellant, as a Window Clerk, does not fall within category (2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to category (1), and insofar as is relevant to the issue in dispute on review, the appellant has submitted evidence showing that on December 17, 1991 she was ordered by the Naval Reserve to perform 12 days of active duty for training beginning no later than February 3, 1992. The administrative judge found that this service did not confer preference eligible status because the appellant had not shown that the service was in a campaign or expedition for a which a campaign badge had been authorized. While at one time this would have been the correct analysis, <span class="Italic">see Perez v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 85 F.3d 591 (Fed. Cir. 1997), a subsequent statutory amendment not discussed in the initial decision conferred preference eligible status on anyone who--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">served on active duty as defined by section 101(21) of title 38 in the armed forces during the period beginning on August 2, 1990, and ending on January 2, 1992; and who has been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(C); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(B) (individuals described in section 2108(1)(C) are "preference eligible"). The appellant argues on review that the administrative judge should have found that she is a preference eligible under section 2108(1)(C). We find that the appellant does not meet the terms of section 2108(1)(C) because that provision applies only to those who performed active duty "as defined by section 101(21) of title 38," and the latter section expressly excludes those whose service was "active duty for training" from its coverage. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(21). On this basis, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant is not a preference eligible with standing to appeal her removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">St. Pierre v. DOJ</span>, PH-0432-21-0364-I-1 (NP 1/27/2023), analyzed the appellant's service record, including his training status, and the effect of his status as disabled veteran, and remanded for further jurisdictional analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of this appeal, a preference eligible means a veteran or a disabled veteran. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3). Under Title 5 of the United States Code, a veteran is an individual who has served on active duty in the <span id="Page_81"></span>armed forces during a war, in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized, or during statutorily specified time periods including from August 2, 1990, to January 2, 1992, and was discharged under honorable conditions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1). A disabled veteran is an individual who served on active duty in the armed forces, was separated under honorable conditions, and has established the present existence of a service-connected disability or is receiving compensation, disability retirement benefits, or a pension because of a public statute administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) or a military department. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly found that the appellant failed to allege below that he was a preference eligible under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108.[2] However, for the first time on review, the appellant provides his DD Form 214 documenting his status as an Officer Trainee in the U.S. Air Force from September 24, 1991, to February 11, 1992, and a June 9, 2021 DVA letter indicating that he is a veteran receiving compensation for a service-connected disability. The appellant notes that he was unable to submit the DD Form 214 earlier because it is an older military record secured in a storage area unavailable for access and review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The appellant's DD-214 submitted to the administrative judge reflects that he served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force from February 12, 1992, to May 1, 1999, and that he was honorably discharged. His service does not confer preference eligible status, however, because the record does not reflect that the appellant served during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized, or that he served during one of the statutorily specified periods. The appellant's SF-50 indicated that he did not have veterans' preference and the appellant did not allege below that he was a disabled veteran.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that he is a veteran as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(C), because he served on active duty in the armed forces in the statutorily specified time period of August 2, 1990, to January 2, 1992. The term "veteran" as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(C) applies only to individuals whose military service included a period of "active duty as defined by [38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(21)]." Active duty as relevant for this appeal is defined as full-time duty in the armed forces, other than active duty for training. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(21)(A); <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Department of the Army</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 647, &#x00B6; 7 (2007). Because the DD Form 214 the appellant submitted on review shows that he was an Officer Trainee in the U.S. Air Force from September 24, 1991, to February 11, 1992, his service during that time period does not constitute active duty as defined by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(21)(A). Thus, the appellant does not qualify as a preference eligible on that basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that he is a disabled veteran as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2). There is no dispute that the appellant served on active duty in the armed forces and that he was separated under honorable conditions. The Board has held that the plain language of the statute limiting the definition of a veteran to individuals who served on active duty for purposes other than training does not apply to the definition of "disabled veteran" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2). <span class="Italic">Hesse</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 647, &#x00B6; 7. Therefore, the issue is whether the appellant has established the present existence of a service-connected disability or is receiving compensation, disability retirement benefits, or a pension because of a public statute administered by the DVA or a military department. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The June 9, 2021 DVA letter states that the appellant has a service-connected disability (rated at 40%) and that he is receiving monthly compensation for that service-connected disability. Significantly, the DVA letter also states that the agency is providing the letter for the appellant to use in applying for benefits, such as civil service preference. Accordingly, we find that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that he is a preference eligible as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Badana v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 182, &#x00B6; 10 (2006) (finding that a DVA disability rating constituted a nonfrivolous allegation that an appellant was entitled to veterans' preference); <span class="Italic">Santiago v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 41, 43 (1994) (finding that a letter submitted for the first time on review certifying that the DVA records showed that the appellant had a service-connected disability required remand to determine whether he was a preference eligible).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the administrative judge determines that the appellant established by preponderant evidence that he is a preference eligible as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2), he shall consider whether the appellant has satisfied the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511. If the administrative judge finds that the Board has jurisdiction over this case, he shall then adjudicate the appeal on the merits, including holding the hearing requested by the appellant, and issue a new initial decision. If the administrative judge finds no jurisdiction, then the appeal may be dismissed on that basis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Perez v. MSPB</span>, 85 F.3d 591, 593-94 (Fed. Cir. 1996), elaborated on the connection between preference eligibility and eligibility for a campaign badge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 2108(1)(A) addresses three types of active duty service that will grant an individual veteran status for purposes of title 5. Those three are service "during a war, in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized, or during the period beginning April 28, 1952, and ending July 1, 1955." 5 USC 2108(1)(A) (1994). We note that, in establishing these three types of active duty service, the statute utilizes two different prepositions, "during" and "in," to define how broadly the preference is to be granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we must determine the distinction, if any, drawn in section 2108(1)(A) by the use of the different prepositions "during" and "in." It is true that "in" can mean "during." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Webster's Third New International Dictionary</span> 1139 (1986) (defining "in" as, "<span class="Italic">inter alia</span>," "during the course of" or "during"). However, to construe "in" to mean "during" here would render superfluous the distinctions created by the terms of the statute ("active duty in the armed forces <span class="Italic">during</span> a war [or] <span class="Italic">in</span> a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized") (emphasis added). As this court must construe a statute so as to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word...we decline to hold that in section 2108(1)(A) Congress used "in" to mean "during."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In section 2108(1)(A), "during" modifies two periods of time--"during a war" and "during the period beginning April 28, 1952, and ending July 1, 1955." As used in section 2108(1)(A), however, "in" modifies "a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized." The statute thus requires service "in" the campaign, rather than "during" the campaign or "at the time of" the campaign. The limitation imposed by "in" is not just one of time, but also one of involvement or participation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, in order to be accorded veteran status under section 2108(1)(A), only one condition is required when the country is at war--service during, or at the time of, the war. When the country is not at war, but the armed forces have conducted a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized, the statute requires more. It is not enough to be on active duty in the armed forces during, or at the time of, the campaign; the individual must have served <span class="Italic">in</span> the campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Perez</span> added, 85 F.3d at 594 n.3:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perez contends that he is entitled to preference eligible status because he received the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross. Receipt of a campaign badge from the Republic of Vietnam does not qualify one as a veteran under section 2108(1)(A). The statute requires service <span class="Italic">in</span> a campaign or expedition. It does not bestow veteran status upon those awarded a badge by a foreign country.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A campaign badge, or lack of one, was the focus of <span class="Italic">Dabney v. MSPB</span>, 566 Fed. Appx. 920, 922-23 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP), affirming the Board's determination of lack of jurisdiction over an appeal by a Postal Service employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's Administrative Judge ruled that Ms. Dabney did not qualify as a preference eligible veteran, for she did not satisfy the criteria set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108. Ms. Dabney responded that she served in and was honorably discharged from the United States Armed Forces. She further stated that jurisdiction should be found because she was injured while working for the Postal Service prior to this vehicular accident, and was returned to work under a limited-duty job offer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ held that Ms. Dabney's Form DD214 did not establish preference eligibility for Postal Service appeal purposes because it did not show that Ms. Dabney ever received a campaign badge or served in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized. Ms. Dabney's Army service of 1978-80 does not correspond to any of the time periods specified in Section 2108, and her Form DD214 does not state that Ms. Dabney received a campaign badge or served in a campaign for which a campaign badge has been authorized. Although Ms. Dabney received Sharpshooter Badges for the M16 rifle and the hand grenade, those badges do not qualify as campaign badges as designated by the Office of Personnel Management's Veterans Guide. <span class="Italic">See</span> <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/</a>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Dabney relies on the Notice of Personnel Action that lists her veterans preference as "2" to support her claim of preference eligibility. However, Ms. Dabney does not contend that her military record Form DD214 inaccurately portrays her service record. The military record must be afforded controlling weight. <span class="Italic">See Perez v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 85 F.3d 591, 594 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Gordon-Cureton v.

<p class="Body-Text">A National Defense Service Medal did not serve as a campaign badge qualifying the appellant for veterans preference status, <span class="Italic">Jones v. DOJ</span>, DC-315I-12-0847-I-1 (NP 10/28/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that his receipt of the National Defense Service Medal meets the criteria in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(A) to qualify him as a preference eligible. Section 2108(1)(A) defines "preference eligible veteran" as an individual who served on active duty in the armed forces during a war, in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized, or during the period beginning April 28, 1952, and ending July 1, 1955. However, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which administers entitlement to veterans' preference in employment under Title 5 of the United States Code, has taken the position in its <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span> that the National Defense Service Medal is not a campaign badge that qualifies under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(A). U.S. Office of Personnel Management, <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span>, Appendix A, <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/</a> (last visited Oct. 28, 2013). The Board has held that positions taken by OPM in the <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span>, while not entitled to the deference accorded to regulations, may be entitled to some weight. <span class="Italic">Durand v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 14 (2007). The amount of weight to be given to such positions depends in part on factors such as the consistency of the agency's position, its formality, and its persuasiveness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We are not aware of any issuance in which OPM has taken a contrary position regarding the National Defense Service Medal. In addition, we note that the Board previously held in <span class="Italic">Brandt v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 15 (2006), that the <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span> is a formal document published on OPM's web site with the apparent expectation that it would be relied on by agencies, employees, prospective employees, and other interested members of the public. The Department of Defense (DoD) in its Manual of Military Decorations and Awards also lists the National Defense Service Medal as a personal service medal and not a campaign or expeditionary medal. Department of Defense, Manual of Military Decorations and Awards, Volume 1, Change 2 at 59 (Mar. 7, 2013). OPM relies on the DoD manual for the listing of qualifying campaigns and expeditions in the <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span>. OPM, <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span>, Appendix A. Accordingly, we affirm the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's receipt of the National Defense Service Medal does not qualify him as a preference eligible. Because we find the appellant is not a preference eligible and only preference eligible FBI employees can qualify as employees with Board appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), we need not address whether the appellant's prior positions were similar to his position with the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), (b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that he relied on the agency's documentation indicating that he was a preference eligible and that the agency should therefore be estopped from arguing otherwise. However, as the appellant acknowledges in his petition for review, the SF50 is not a legally binding document. In addition, the Board has only that jurisdiction conferred on it by Congress. <span class="Italic">Campion v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 326 F.3d 1210, 1215 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Section 7511(b)(8) is unambiguous in providing that only preference eligible FBI employees have adverse action appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8). The Board's jurisdiction cannot be expanded by an agency's alleged misstatements, in this case two incorrect SF50s. <span class="Italic">See Campion</span>, 326 F.3d at 1215. Even if the appellant relied on the agency's documentation, the Board cannot have jurisdiction over his appeal because the appellant is not a preference eligible and, therefore, is not a covered employee with adverse action appeal rights to the Board.</p>
