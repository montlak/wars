<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-37"><span class="space">2.</span> Circumstantial Evidence; Pretext; Presumption</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Decisions discussed earlier in this chapter examined circumstantial evidence of discrimination. The Supreme Court determined that circumstantial evidence is sufficient for an employee to meet her burden in a mixed motive discrimination case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa</span>, 123 S. Ct. 2148 (2003). A few decisions recapitulate the dominant themes of Board law. <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 498, 507-09 (1995), outlined the proper analysis of circumstantial evidence of discrimination, and in the process distinguished the analytical approach toward direct evidence of discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues that the administrative judge applied the wrong legal standard to the appellant's discrimination claim. In this connection, the appellant argues that the administrative judge should not have applied the legal standard for "mixed motive" cases set forth in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v.</span> <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span>, 490 U.S. 228, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 104 L. Ed.2d 268 (1989), to analyze the appellant's discrimination claim. Instead, he contends that the applicable legal standard is set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> <span class="Italic">Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973). We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 61 MSPR 601, 604 (1994), we found that a case in which the agency responds to the employee's direct evidence of discrimination with a legitimate reason(s) for its adverse action is referred to as a "mixed motive" case. In such a case, the appellant must prove by direct evidence that membership in a protected category was a "substantial factor" in the employment decision at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Since the appellant here presented solely circumstantial evidence to support his discrimination claim, the administrative judge should have applied the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> test rather than the <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> framework. Accordingly, the administrative judge erred in requiring the appellant to show that race was a substantial factor in the removal decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a claim of prohibited employment discrimination through circumstantial evidence under the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework, the employee must first establish by preponderant evidence a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by showing that: (1) He is a member of a protected group; (2) he was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of his protected group; and (3) he was treated more harshly or disparately than the individual who was not a member of his protected group. The burden of going forward then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. An agency meets this burden when it introduces evidence, which, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse action, regardless of whether the agency actually proves the charges. <span class="Italic">See Carter v. Small Business Administration</span>, 61 MSPR 656, 666 (1994), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, __U.S.__, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2748, 2752, 125 L. Ed.2d 407 (1993). Finally, the employee must show by preponderant evidence that the agency's stated reason is merely a pretext for prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">See e.g., McDonnell Douglas Corp.</span>, 411 U.S. at 802-04, 93 S. Ct. at 1824; <span class="Italic">Carter</span>, 61 MSPR at 666 (1994). Thus, the appellant must actually show both that the stated reason was false, or not the real reason for the action, and that discrimination was the real reason for the action. <span class="Italic">Carter</span>, 61 MSPR at 666, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, __U.S.__, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L. Ed.2d 407 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3374"></span>In support of his contention that the agency's action was the result of discrimination because of his race, the appellant related that a white employee, Donald Anderson, had made a direct threat on his life and that Anderson had not been sent to a psychiatrist or removed as a result of that statement. Thus, the appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by showing that Anderson had made a direct threat on the appellant's life but that Anderson had not been subject to any discipline by the agency. The agency, however, articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory explanation for this disparity in treatment. In this connection, we note that the appellant argues on review that this explanation was not articulated by the agency below and thus that the administrative judge improperly relied on this reason. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hebert testified below that, although she was aware of Anderson's threat, she did not recommend discipline for him because he was not her employee, but was involved in an employee "swap" program with her department. She stated that she did not have the authority to discipline him or recommend discipline for him. She explained that she contacted Anderson's supervisor and had Anderson removed from her section. The appellant has not disputed Hebert's claim that she was not Anderson's supervisor. Moreover, he has not alleged that Hutchinson, the deciding official, had any knowledge of Anderson's case or was in any way involved in it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the agency articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the difference in treatment of the two employees, it created a genuine issue of fact as to whether its treatment of the appellant was based upon prohibited race discrimination. The appellant, if he was to prevail on his claim of disparate treatment based upon race discrimination, was obligated to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the proffered reason for the difference in treatment was merely a pretext for prohibited discrimination. The appellant failed to meet this burden. He produced no evidence to show that the agency's proffered reason for the different treatment was pretextual. <span class="Italic">See Fenn v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 362, 369 (1987). We therefore find that the appellant has not established his affirmative defense of discrimination by the requisite evidence. We thus conclude that the administrative judge's error in applying the <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse</span> framework provides no basis for reversal of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of circumstantial evidence, <span class="Italic">Beam v. OPM</span>, 77 MSPR 49, 54 (1997), said:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Frequently, acts of discrimination may be hidden or subtle; an employer who intentionally discriminates is unlikely to leave a written record of his illegal motive, and may not tell anyone about it. "There will seldom be 'eyewitness' testimony as to the employer's mental processes." <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens,</span> 460 U.S. 711, 716 (1983). Because of those realities, plaintiffs are often obliged to build their cases entirely around circumstantial evidence. The unique proof problems that accompany discrimination cases are the genesis of the unique solutions that the Supreme Court has devised for those cases in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> [<span class="Italic">Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792 (1973),] and its progeny.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Combs v. Plantation Patterns,</span> 106 F.3d 1519, 1537 (11th Cir. 1997) (citations omitted), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 118 S. Ct. 685. The appellant's claim that OPM applied an unannounced selection criterion when it re-ranked the candidates for the position he sought, by its very nature, is a claim that OPM engaged in "hidden or subtle" discrimination of the sort that the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework was designed to resolve....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Decker v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 119, 132 (1989), an age discrimination case, decided that the employee must show that his age was the determinative factor in the agency's challenged action. The Board weighs all credible evidence that in sum must support the inference with substantial or reasonable probability, as distinguished from mere possibility, that the employee's age was the determining factor in the separation or demotion action. To determine whether discrimination exists, the focus is upon actions that, if unexplained, permit an inference of discrimination. A bare allegation of systemic discrimination is insufficient to support that finding. <span class="Italic">Jefferson v. VA</span>, 6 MSPR 348, 351, 6 MSPB 297 (1981). Lawful acts, held <span class="Italic">Decker</span>, may not be used to demonstrate illegal discrimination. There the agency asked an appellant about his retirement plans, an action the Board found justified by statutory and OPM guidelines authorizing agencies considering a RIF to survey employees eligible for retirement as a means of using voluntary retirement to lower employee complements and reduce the number of employees affected by a RIF. Procedural errors in the processing of a case may or may not be considered evidence of the failure to accommodate a handicap, depending on the nature and effect of the error. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fontanilla v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 312, 316 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an action against an employee appears to be independently and properly motivated, the Board does not become involved in extensive analysis of background circumstances that might permit an inference of discrimination, <span class="Italic">Rockwell v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 39 MSPR 217, 224 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's allegation of sex discrimination is also unsupported by the record. The appellant presented no evidence that showed her sex was a consideration in the decision to eliminate her position by RIF. Rather, the appellant alleged that the agency had engaged in sex discrimination in the past by preventing her upward mobility to a writing position and failing to give her due credit for her writing. These are not matters related to the appellant's RIF so that, even if the product of sex discrimination, they do not establish that sex discrimination was even a motivating factor for the abolishment of the appellant's position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board looks for plausible explanations of conduct to dispel an inference of intentional discrimination. Consider <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 99 MSPR 626, 629-633 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-19 (2005) (presenting, in addition to an EEO analysis, evidence of MSPB awareness of pop culture):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant proved her race and sex discrimination claims by direct evidence. However, as described below, the evidence in this case was circumstantial at best, and was insufficient to establish that the agency was motivated to remove the appellant because of her race or sex. While the appellant, as an African-American female, is a member of protected groups, the comments upon which the administrative judge based his "direct evidence" findings are not the sort that demonstrate discriminatory animus. <span class="Italic">Cf. id. [Arrendondo</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 113,] &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly after the appellant successfully completed a performance improvement plan (PIP), she broke her foot. The appellant was absent from work for approximately 2 1/2 months as a result. During her absence, her supervisor, Ralph Cook, saw the appellant at a Macy's department store in a local shopping mall trying on what he described as "high-heeled shoes." He then requested that the appellant provide medical documentation regarding whether she was able to work part-time or with accommodation. The form he gave the appellant for her doctor to fill out indicated that Cook had seen the appellant at Macy's trying on high-heeled shoes. When the appellant did not submit the requested medical documentation, Cook charged her with absence without leave (AWOL). Eventually, the appellant submitted the requested medical documentation and Cook removed the AWOL charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found Cook's comment that he saw the appellant at Macy's trying on high-heeled shoes was "clearly sexist." However, the appellant admitted that Cook saw her in the shoe department of Macy's and that she was looking for shoes the same height as her walking cast. This would indicate that the shoe she was trying on likely had some sort of heel. Cook's use of the phrase "high-heeled shoes" does not appear to reflect a discriminatory attitude toward women. Rather, he testified that he was concerned that the appellant was out walking around the shopping mall on a broken foot when she was supposedly unable to walk or stand for any length of time. Cook's statement that he saw the appellant trying on high-heeled shoes appears to have been fairly accurate, and it is understandable that a supervisor would be concerned when an employee who is allegedly unable to attend work due to an injury is well enough to go shopping at the mall.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, Raymond Tatum, an African-American male employee supervised by Cook, but with a different specialist and team lead than the appellant, was also perceived to have performance problems. Cook had at least three meetings concerning performance with Tatum and his team lead and/or Specialist around the middle of 2002. Cook testified that one of Tatum's problems was that "[h]e didn't have the ability to understand and function in the MODERN [computer] system, same as [the appellant], actually--I mean, same problem." Additionally, when Tatum discussed a job offer with Cook, Cook advised him to take it because Tatum would be placed on a PIP or possibly removed if he remained in the Personnel Assistant position. Tatum testified that Cook told him, "Well, I was given two names when I took over this job. One, I had to issue a removal letter. I don't want to issue one on you."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Tatum, unlike the appellant, was not removed. But Tatum testified that, during his third meeting with Cook regarding performance, Tatum's team lead, Theresa Green, had accused Tatum of putting the wrong pay information on three actions. Tatum had previously told Cook that he felt "someone had something against him." According to Tatum, when he explained during the meeting that Green had told him the amount to put on two of the actions, Cook responded, "Well, I guess you're right. Maybe somebody is out to get you." Cook then apologized to Tatum, and said to Green, "I was ready to put this man on a PIP and you haven't even talked to him."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered whether Cook's treatment of Tatum compared to his treatment of the appellant could be considered evidence of sex discrimination against the appellant. While the two employees both had performance problems, the appellant was placed on a PIP and removed, but Tatum was not. However, Cook made it clear to Tatum that, if he did not transfer to the other position he had been offered, Cook would have put Tatum on a PIP and would have possibly removed him. Therefore, Tatum was not similarly situated to the appellant because his impending transfer made his potential placement on a PIP and removal unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no other evidence, direct or circumstantial, that the appellant <span id="Page_3375"></span>was removed based on her sex, or that anyone involved in the removal decision treated male employees more favorably than female employees. While the appellant's supervisor and proposing official, Cook, was male, the vast majority of his employees were female, and there is no evidence that he treated them in a disparate fashion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are similar problems with the administrative judge's determination that race was a motivating factor in the appellant's removal. He based this finding largely on Cook's e-mail that read as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Subject: Music soothes the soul...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Dear Musicophiles:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Katherine [Coffman] has requested that I ease the restriction on wearing headphones in code 530. Accordingly, you may wear headphones while working if you so desire. (be advised, however, that the first time I see two of you slow-dancing to some Righteous Brothers song in your cubicle, the jig is up).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Please use good judgement and be polite with your music.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">ralph</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The e-mail was sent after the appellant and Coffman settled the appellant's EEO complaint regarding wearing headphones at work. We do not find that this e-mail message reflects directly an allegedly discriminatory attitude toward members of the appellant's race, nor that it bore directly on the agency's decision to remove the appellant. Contrary to the administrative judge's finding, Cook's use of the word "soul" does not seem to reference "soul music." The Board takes administrative notice that the Righteous Brothers were Caucasian. There is nothing in the record suggesting that Cook intended to use any of the words in his e-mail in a discriminatory manner. Moreover, the tone of Cook's e-mail was similar to that of other e-mails he sent that had nothing to do with the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant failed to present any other direct or circumstantial evidence that the agency discriminated against her on the basis of race. Cook was Caucasian, but 22 of his 45 employees were African-American. Cook promoted 18 of those 22 employees, including the appellant. As a comparison, Cook promoted 9 of the 13 Caucasian employees he supervised during the same period. The deciding official, Coffman, had 190 employees from November 2001, to October 2003, 50 of whom were African-American. She promoted 24 African-American employees. She promoted 27 out of 62 Caucasian employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a deciding official, Coffman held in abeyance a decision on whether to suspend a Caucasian female employee for 14 days for performance problems, but she appears to have done this because the employee planned to retire within 2 months. In any event, the appellant did not establish that she was similarly situated to this employee because it is unclear whether the Caucasian employee's performance problems were comparable to those alleged against the appellant. Additionally, Cook was not the proposing official in that matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency was correct in arguing that there was no direct evidence of discrimination in this case. In the absence of direct evidence, the Board typically uses the "pretext standard" of analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802&#8209;04 (1973). <span class="Italic">George v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 71, 83 (1997). to establish a claim of prohibited employment discrimination through circumstantial evidence, the employee first must establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; the burden of going forward then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action; and, finally, the employee must show that the agency's stated reason is merely a pretext for prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp.</span>, 411 U.S. at 802&#8209;04. However, because there was an evidentiary hearing and the record was complete in this case, the order for presentation of evidence and the allocation of the burden of production were no longer at issue. Thus, contrary to the agency's argument, using the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> burden-shifting analysis would have been inappropriate after the appeal was fully adjudicated. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 714-15 (1983); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 46, 51-52 (1998); <span class="Italic">Beam v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 49, 55 (1997). Instead, the Board must review all of the evidence to determine whether the agency intentionally discriminated against the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. at 714-15; <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. at 51-52.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon a review of all of the evidence, we find that the appellant has failed to establish by preponderant evidence that the agency intentionally discriminated against her on the basis of her sex or race when it removed her. Accordingly, the administrative judge's findings of race and sex discrimination were improper and are REVERSED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The pretext analysis was reiterated, <span class="Italic">Mahaffey v. USDA</span>, 105 MSPR 347, &#x00B6; 13, 2007 MSPB 93 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of direct evidence, the Board typically uses the "pretext standard" of analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

<p class="Body-Text">Standards applied only to a member of a minority group and not to all employees suggest discriminatory intent. Employment decisions affecting only minorities, depending solely on arbitrary and subjective evaluations, are mechanisms for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Cho v. Dwight David Eisenhower Army Med. Ctr.</span>, 8 MSPR 52, 56-57, 7 MSPB 548 (1981), one of the few Board decisions concluding that an adverse action was motivated by racial discrimination, determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Cho was subjected to repeated acts of disrespect and was the target of racial slurs which characterized her as a "gook" and a "gook doctor." An employer is responsible for maintaining a working environment free of racial discrimination. Its failure to do so is violative of Title VII. <span class="Italic">Rogers v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span> 454 F.2d 234 (5th Cir. 1971), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 406 U.S. 957, 92 S. Ct. 2058, 32 L. Ed.2d 343 (1972). Where an employee who has been subjected to this type of discriminatory treatment is also removed, that action is automatically suspect. And where, as here, there is also overwhelming evidence that she was arbitrarily treated and unfairly judged, we agree with the Administrative Law Judge that there has been a violation of Title 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1607.11. The guidelines contained in that section are entitled to great deference in determining if there has been a violation of Title VII. <span class="Italic">Griggs</span> <span class="Italic">v. Duke Power Company,</span> 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. Ed.2d 158 (1971); <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,</span> 422 U.S. 405, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 45 L. Ed.2d 280 (1975). The use of standards applied only to a member of a minority group and not to all employees constitutes evidence of discriminatory intent. The facts in this case clearly establish that Dr. Cho was subjected to such arbitrary standards relating to time, attendance and productivity and that, moreover, she was judged by subjective criteria which the Administrative Law Judge concluded did not allow for a fair evaluation of her work. Employment decisions affecting only minorities which depend solely upon arbitrary and subjective evaluations have been found to be ready mechanisms for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Rowe v. General Motors</span> <span class="Italic">Corporation,</span> 457 F.2d 348 (5th Cir. 1972). We therefore affirm the Administrative Law Judge's determination that the appellant's removal was the result of unlawful discrimination.</p>
