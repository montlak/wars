<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-437"><span id="Page_848"></span><span class="space">9.</span> OPM Involvement in Agency Selection</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board went to some trouble to explain its jurisdiction over OPM employment practices involving agency employment selections in <span class="Italic">Beam v. OPM</span>, 61 MSPR 54, 58-60 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Beam I</span>). <span class="Italic">Beam I</span> involved a challenge to an OPM directive requiring heightened scrutiny of selection actions by agencies with delegated examining authority seeking to appoint into competitive service positions individuals who previously held Schedule C or noncareer SES appointments. The Board added some explanation concerning the place of hearing and discovery rights in employment practice cases initiated with MSPB regional offices:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 CFR 300.104(a), "[a] candidate [for a position in the competitive service] who believes that an employment practice which was applied to him or her by the Office of Personnel Management violates a basic requirement in[5 CFR] &#x00A7; 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board...." Section 300.103(c) provides in part that "[a]n employment practice shall not discriminate on the basis of...partisan political affiliation, or other non-merit factor."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of 5 CFR Part 300A "is to establish principles to govern...the employment practices of the Federal Government...that affect the recruitment, measurement, ranking, and selection of individuals for initial appointment...in the competitive service." 5 CFR 300.101. The term "'employment practices' includes the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments." 5 CFR 300.101. Further, the term "employment practices" was meant to be given a "broad and inclusive meaning." <span class="Italic">Dowd v. United States</span>, 713 F.2d 720, 723 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant here asserts that FPM Letter 273-4 is an employment practice that discriminates on the basis of partisan political affiliation. He contends that it impermissibly mandates heightened scrutiny of the selection process for competitive-service positions in agencies with delegated examining authority when individuals who hold or who recently held Schedule C or non-career SES appointments--a group that the appellant appears to claim was made up primarily of members of the Republican Party in 1992--compete. This contention can also fairly be interpreted as a claim that FPM Letter 273-4 discriminates on the basis of a nonmerit factor, i.e., status as a current or recent Schedule C or non-career SES appointee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argued below that its involvement in the selection process for the position that the appellant sought, under FPM Letter 273-4, was not an employment practice, but instead reflected "a procedural decision to safeguard the integrity of the civil service and the proper application of merit staffing procedures." We disagree. We acknowledge that not every action by OPM that affects the appointment process in the competitive service is an employment practice. OPM's decision to reject as untimely an application for an open competitive examination and not to reopen a closed register, for example, is a "procedural exercise of OPM's administrative discretion to accept untimely applications," not an employment practice. <span class="Italic">Maule v. OPM</span>, 40 MSPR 388, 393-94, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 892 F.2d 1050 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table). If an action by OPM involves substantive judgments regarding qualification standards for a competitive-service position, however, it is an employment practice. <span class="Italic">Maule</span>, 40 MSPR at 393-94; 5 CFR 300.101.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The oversight function prescribed by FPM Letter 273-4 plainly involves substantive judgments regarding qualifications for competitive-service positions, inasmuch as it requires review of certain agency decisions made in "the recruitment, measurement, ranking, and selection of individuals for initial appointment..." 5 CFR 300.101. Indeed, under FPM Letter 273-4, OPM performed its own ranking of the candidates for the Rural Development Specialist position. Thus, OPM itself used a "measurement instrument," an undertaking expressly encompassed by the term "employment practice." 5 CFR 300.101; <span class="Italic">cf. Curtin v. OPM</span>, 846 F.2d 1373, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (OPM's examination and ranking of candidates for administrative law judge positions is an "employment practice" for purposes of 5 CFR 300.104(a)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that OPM applied an employment practice to the appellant when, with respect to the Rural Development Specialist position that he sought, it exercised the oversight function prescribed by FPM Letter 273-4. Because the appellant "believes that [this] employment practice [violated] a basic requirement in [5 CFR] &#x00A7; 300.103," he is "entitled to appeal" to the Board. 5 CFR 300.104(a). Accordingly, the administrative judge erred in concluding that the Board lacked jurisdiction. The initial decision is REVERSED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The remaining matters raised by the appellant are beyond the Board's jurisdiction</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that OPM's re-ranking of the candidates for the Rural Development Specialist position was illegitimate. He contends that it was performed by an individual who lacked the expertise to evaluate candidates for the position, and whose aim was "to prevent a Schedule C employee from getting the job." He further contends that OPM's re-ranking was tainted by pressure from officials outside OPM, who allegedly sought to prevent "Republican Schedule C [a]ppointees from being selected for competitive[-] service positions." He also alleges that OPM intentionally delayed acting on FmHA's submission until after the Secretary of Agriculture announced a department-wide "hiring freeze" on January 22, 1993.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's challenge to OPM's re-ranking of the candidates for the Rural Development Specialist position is, in essence, a challenge to an examination rating, and as such, it does not fall within our jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Etelson v. OPM</span>, 35 MSPR 610, 611 (1987) (the individual rating that an ALJ candidate received from OPM was not appealable to the Board); 5 CFR 300.104(b) (a candidate may appeal his or her examination rating to OPM or, where an agency has delegated examining authority, to the agency). Furthermore, any delay in OPM's completion of the review process was not in itself an appealable employment practice, but instead was a procedural aspect of OPM's administration of the functions prescribed by FPM Letter 273-4. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Maule</span>, 40 MSPR at 393. Because the appellant's challenges to the results of the reranking and to OPM's allegedly improper delay in completing its review of FmHA's submission are beyond the Board's jurisdiction, the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion in not compelling discovery responses from OPM on those matters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appeal must be remanded for a hearing on the merits</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge held, in the alternative, and without holding a hearing, that, even if the appellant was subjected to an employment practice by OPM, such practice was not discriminatory. The appellant requested a hearing below, and renews his request in his petition for review. Because the appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction, the appeal must be remanded for a hearing on the merits. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7701(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Bommer v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 543, 551 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge should afford the appellant an opportunity to complete discovery on the merits, if he has any outstanding discovery requests on matters within the Board's jurisdiction. It appears that there are no material facts in dispute. If, after completing discovery and being afforded the opportunity to show that there are material factual issues that require an evidentiary hearing, the appellant does not establish that there is a dispute of material fact, the hearing to which he is entitled shall consist of the opportunity to present argument to the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">Bommer</span>, 34 MSPR at 551-52.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, the Board decided in <span class="Italic">Beam v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 469, 479-81 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Beam II</span>), that FPM Letter 273-4, mandating heightened scrutiny of the recruitment and selection process for competitive-service positions when current or recent Schedule C employees or noncareer senior executives compete, did not violate merit system principles. Nevertheless, the case was again remanded so that the appellant could develop discovery on whether OPM, as it reviewed agency tentative selections, imposed an unannounced qualification standard, i.e., whether or not the candidate was a Republican Schedule C employee, that discriminated on the basis of partisan political affiliation. After the second remand, the case was again considered, and again remanded, <span class="Italic">Beam v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 629, 634 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Beam III</span>), to permit completion of discovery and amendment of the appellant's pleadings. The appeal returned to the Board, and was remanded for yet further consideration in <span class="Italic">Beam v. OPM</span>, 77 MSPR 49, 52-57 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Beam IV</span>), when the Board explained the analytical framework to be applied to appellant's allegation that he was subjected to political discrimination during OPM's involvement in the appointment process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge granted the appellant's motion to compel responses to some discovery requests, declined to compel other discovery responses, and concluded that the appellant did not make non-frivolous allegations of fact that, if proven, could establish that OPM applied an impermissibly discriminatory selection criterion. Specifically, she held that, although OPM received letters from members of Congress in late 1992 and early 1993 reminding OPM about its duty to prevent inappropriate conversions of Schedule C appointees to competitive-service positions, he did not allege facts that, if proven, would show that OPM was "improperly pressured" to prevent conversions. She further held that the appellant was foreclosed from challenging the results of OPM's re-ranking of the candidates for the Rural Development Specialist position, and that his claim that OPM improperly credited another candidate--the candidate OPM determined should have been ranked higher than the appellant, and who ultimately was selected for the position--was mere disagreement with OPM's assessment of the other candidate's experience. Finally, she held that the appellant did not make a non-frivolous allegation that the selectee's application "would have alerted OPM to the applicant's affiliation with a particular political party."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues in his timely petition for review that he has made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, or at the very least has made nonfrivolous allegations, that OPM applied an unannounced, impermissibly discriminatory criterion, namely, lack of Republican Schedule C status, when it re-ranked the candidates for the Rural Development Specialist position. He further argues that the administrative judge abused her <span id="Page_849"></span>discretion with respect to her discovery rulings, that she should have imposed sanctions on OPM, and that she was biased....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employment practice, which includes the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.101, "shall not discriminate on the basis of...partisan political affiliation, or other non-merit factor," 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.103(c). "A candidate [for a competitive-service position] who believes that an employment practice which was applied to him or her by the Office of Personnel Management violates a basic requirement in &#x00A7; 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of its regulations." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.104(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our previous decisions, we stated that the appellant claimed that OPM applied an unannounced, impermissibly discriminatory qualification standard." <span class="Italic">See Beam III,</span> 71 MSPR at 631; <span class="Italic">Beam II,</span> 66 MSPR at 480. We did not intend to use the term "qualification standard" in a technical sense of a basic eligibility requirement that must be met in order to compete for a position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Morris v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 13 MSPB 208, 14 MSPR 578 (1983). As discussed below, the appellant meets the basic eligibility requirements for the Rural Development Specialist position. We used the term "qualification standard" to refer to what would more accurately be called a selection criterion, which may be challenged in an employment practices appeal because it is a "measurement instrument." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.101; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Curtin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 846 F.2d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (considering a challenge, as an employment practices appeal, to the portion of the administrative law judge (ALJ) examination in which those applicants who meet the minimum eligibility requirements for an ALJ position are ranked based on statements of their achievements); <span class="Italic">Dowd v. United States,</span> 713 F.2d 720, 723 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (the term "employment practices" has a "broad and inclusive meaning").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish jurisdiction over the remaining aspect of his appeal, the appellant must show that OPM considered lack of Republican Schedule C status when it re-ranked the candidates for the Rural Development Specialist. <span class="Italic">See Beam II,</span> 66 MSPR at 480. To be entitled to a jurisdictional hearing, he must "make an allegation that OPM re-ranked the candidates...based on whether a given candidate was a Republican Schedule C employee, 'supported by factual assertions indicating that the allegation is not a <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> pleading."' <span class="Italic">Beam III,</span> 71 MSPR at 631-32 <span class="Italic">(quoting Kiser v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Education,</span> 66 MSPR 372, 378 (1995)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although discrimination based on Republican Schedule C status is not prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2000e--2-2000e-16, we relied on the analytical framework developed under Title VII to evaluate the appellant's claim that FPM Letter 273-4 was discriminatory. <span class="Italic">See Beam II,</span> 66 MSPR at 474-76. We also find it appropriate to rely on that framework to evaluate the appellant's claim that OPM applied an impermissibly discriminatory selection criterion when it re-ranked the candidates for the Rural Development Specialist position. In particular, we find it appropriate to rely on the framework developed under Title VII to evaluate a claim of discrimination based on indirect, or circumstantial, evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Frequently, acts of discrimination may be hidden or subtle; an employer who intentionally discriminates is unlikely to leave a written record of his illegal motive, and may not tell anyone about it. "There will seldom be 'eyewitness' testimony as to the employer's mental processes." <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens,</span> 460 U.S. 711, 716, 103 S. Ct. 1478, 1482, 75 L. Ed.2d 403 (1983). Because of those realities, plaintiffs are often obliged to build their cases entirely around circumstantial evidence. The unique proof problems that accompany discrimination cases are the genesis of the unique solutions that the Supreme Court has devised for those cases in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas [Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed.2d 668.(1973),] and its progeny.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Combs v. Plantation Patterns,</span> 106 F.3d 1519, 1537 (11th Cir. 1997) (citations omitted), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __ U.S. __, 118 S. Ct. 685, 139 L. Ed.2d 632 (1997). The appellant's claim that OPM applied an unannounced selection criterion when it re-ranked the candidates for the position he sought, by its very nature, is a claim that OPM engaged in "hidden or subtle" discrimination of the sort that the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework was designed to resolve.[2] We turn to that framework now.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;This is not to say that the appellant may not attempt to prove, by direct evidence, that OPM discriminated against Republican Schedule C employees<span class="Italic">. See George v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 71, 80 (1997) (direct evidence is proof, such as a statement or policy by an employer reflecting a discriminatory attitude and bearing directly on the decision at issue, that an impermissible consideration was a motivating factor behind the decision). Thus far, however, the appellant has not presented direct evidence of discrimination by OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A discrimination claim based on indirect or circumstantial evidence is analyzed in three steps: (i) The individual must establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination; (ii) if a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established, the burden of going forward shifts to the party that took the action under challenge to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its action; and (iii) if the party that took the action articulates a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, it will prevail unless the individual claiming discrimination can show that this reason was merely a pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 802-05, 93 S. Ct. at 1824-26; <span class="Italic">see Beam II,</span> 66 MSPR at 474-76. To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the individual must show that he is a member of a protected group, he was similarly situated to an individual not a member of that group, and he was treated more harshly or disparately than the other individual. <span class="Italic">Buckler v. Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board,</span> 73 MSPR 476 (1997). Once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established, the party that took the action under challenge must introduce evidence which, taken as true, would permit a finding that there was a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its action. <span class="Italic">See George v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 71, 83 (1997); <span class="Italic">Carter v. Small Business Administration</span>, 61 MSPR 656, 666 (1994). If the party that took the action meets its burden, then the burden shifts to the individual claiming discrimination to establish that the stated reason was false or not the real reason for the action, and that the real reason was discrimination. <span class="Italic">George,</span> 74 MSPR. at 84; <span class="Italic">Buckler</span>, 73 MSPR at 497.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This framework governs "the order and allocation of proof." <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas,</span> 411 U.S. at 800, 93 S. Ct. at 1823. Whether the party claiming discrimination has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is no longer relevant once the case has been fully tried, <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span> <span class="Italic">Board of Governors v. Aikens,</span> 460 U.S. 711, 714-15, 103 S. Ct. 1478, 1481-82, 75 L. Ed.2d 403 (1983), but this case is still at the pleading stage on the appellant's remaining discrimination claim. In his pleadings, the appellant alleges as follows: He held a Schedule C position in a Republican administration and is affiliated with the Republican party; he is qualified for the Rural Development Specialist position; an official at USDA considered him to be the best candidate for the Rural Development Specialist position; OPM reviewed all of the applications for the position because the appellant held a Schedule C position and was selected for a competitive-service position during a presidential election year; the appellant's application made clear that he was affiliated with the Republican party; upon re-ranking the candidates, OPM concluded that an applicant from Montana should have received a higher rating than the appellant, and withheld its approval for the appellant's appointment; and the Montana candidate's application shows that he never held a Schedule C position, and does not reveal any affiliation with the Republican party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's allegations are supported by documentary evidence, and are not disputed by OPM. We find, therefore, that he has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. He is a member of a protected class, in this case, Republican Schedule C appointees. He was similarly situated to someone outside of this class, namely, the candidate from Montana who also applied for the Rural Development Specialist position. Finally, the candidate from Montana was treated more favorably than the appellant, insofar as OPM considered the Montana candidate to be better-qualified than the appellant for the Rural Development Specialist position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge noted that the Montana candidate's application did not reveal an affiliation with a particular political party. What matters for present purposes, though, is that the appellant was known to hold a Schedule C position in a Republican administration and to be affiliated with the Republican party, whereas the Montana candidate never held a Schedule C position in a Republican administration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also stated that the appellant was not permitted to challenge the results of OPM's re-ranking <span class="Italic">per se,</span> that he merely disagreed with OPM's assessment of the Montana candidate's experience, and that the Montana candidate in fact had extensive, relevant experience. The appellant did not have to show that he was better qualified than the Montana candidate in order to make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, however. Where, as here, an individual claims that an employer considered an impermissible factor when it chose someone else for the position he sought, the individual is not required to show, as part of his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, that he was as well-qualified as or better-qualified than the selectee. <span class="Italic">Mitchell v.</span> <span class="Italic">Baldrige,</span> 759 F.2d 80, 85, 88 (D.C. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Reilly v. Califano</span>, 537 F. Supp. 349, 29 F.E.P. Cases 1437, 1440 (N.D. Ill.), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 673 F.2d 1333 (7th Cir. 1981) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 456 U.S. 916, 102 S. Ct. 1772, 72 L. Ed.2d 176 (1982). Rather, he need only show that he meets the basic qualifications for the position at issue. <span class="Italic">See Mitchell,</span> 759 F.2d at 85; <span class="Italic">see also Lidge-Myrtil v. Deere &#x0026; Co.,</span> 49 F.3d 1308, 1310 (8th Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Shalala,</span> 902 F. Supp. 259, 264-65 (D.D.C. 1995). That the appellant herein meets the basic qualifications for the Rural Development Specialist position is undisputed. For purposes of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, then, the appellant is similarly situated to the Montana candidate; each applied for the Rural Development Specialist position and met the basic qualification requirements for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the Montana candidate was in fact better qualified than the appellant goes to the second and third elements of the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis, namely, whether OPM articulated a legitimate <span id="Page_850"></span>nondiscriminatory reason for overruling USDA's selection and withholding approval of the appellant's appointment, and if so, whether the appellant showed in rebuttal that such reason was false or not the real reason, and that the real reason was discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lidge-Myrtil</span>, 49 F.3d at 1310-11; <span class="Italic">Hayes,</span> 902 F. Supp. at 264-65. The administrative judge thus erred by addressing these elements and disposing of the case in OPM's favor without a hearing. As explained above, to receive a jurisdictional hearing, the appellant was only required to allege facts that, if proven and uncontroverted, would permit a finding that OPM considered his Republican Schedule C status when it re-ranked the candidates for the position he sought, i.e., a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. The appellant did not have to make out the third element under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> to get to a hearing, that is, he was not required to rebut, at the pleading stage, the nondiscriminatory reason OPM advanced for its action. <span class="Italic">Cf. Ferdon v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994) (an appellant is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing if he or she makes specific allegations of fact that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of Board jurisdiction; an administrative judge may not resolve disputed factual issues going to jurisdiction against the appellant solely on the pleadings and dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction). Accordingly, the January 16, 1997 remand initial decision is VACATED. The appeal must be remanded for a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It appears that on further remand, the AJ denied relief to Mr. Beam (Initial Decision DC-300A-93-0238-B-5 (Aug. 12, 1998), and the Board denied a subsequent petition for review without opinion, DC-300A-93-0238-B-5 (June 8, 1999). Mr. Beam had applied for the contested position in September 1992.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Glospie v. DHS</span>, NY-3443-16-0121-I-1 (NP 7/28/2016) ("In seeking to include OPM as a party to this action, the appellant asserted that OPM oversees the competitive hiring practice, suggesting that other agencies who advertise for Criminal Investigators also measure applicants' experience in a way that prejudices veterans. As such, the appellant has alleged, but not established, OPM involvement in the agency's hiring practice that arguably violates one of the 'basic requirements' set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103.").</p>
