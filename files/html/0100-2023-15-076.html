<p class="Body-Text">In appeals by employees removed from their civilian positions for failing to meet the employment condition of maintaining reserve military status, the Board's scope of review is limited to determining whether: (1) the position required the incumbent to possess reserve status; (2) the appellant lost that status; (3) minimal due process was granted by the military; and (4) the loss <span id="Page_2525"></span>was within the appellant's control. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Army</span>, 34 MSPR 678, 680 (1987), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">Colligan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 36 MSPR 547, 550 (1988). "All circumstances are within the employee's control except for age and physical disability." <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 74 Fed. Appx. 896 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP) (appellant was properly dismissed from the reserves for a reason within his control: he missed too many drills; an agency regulation that required an offer to the employee to apply for a civil service regulation did not preclude discharge when testimony from the agency suggested no vacancies existed within the appellant's commuting area); <span class="Italic">Beck v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3144) (Board determined whether the stated reason for a discharge from the reserve was "within the individual's control"; Board could then review only if the appellant was discharged for that reason).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The burden of proof is on the agency, not on the employee, to prove that the employee lost reserve status for reasons within his control. <span class="Italic">McClanahan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2 MSPR 403, 404-05, 2 MSPB 566 (1980). If the loss of reserve status is for reasons within the employee's control, e.g., conviction of a crime, the military discharge properly disqualifies the individual for, and justifies discharge from, the civilian employment. <span class="Italic">Best v. DOD</span>, 6 MSPR 330, 331-32, 6 MSPB 282 (1981) (citing <span class="Italic">McClanahan v. Dept. of Army</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Rolles v. Civil Serv. Comm'n</span>, 512 F.2d 1319 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (remanding to CSC or the Air Force tribunal for a due process hearing to determine whether the appellant's military status was lost for reasons within his control and to permit the appellant an opportunity to refute the charges against him).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For some history of the relation between reserve status and employment in the civilian technician program, refer to <span class="Italic">AFGE v. Resor</span>, 387 F. Supp. 63 (D.D.C. 1974), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE v. Hoffman</span>, 543 F.2d 930 (D.C. Cir. 1976); <span class="Italic">see</span> 32 USC 709(e)(1-6), (f); <span class="Italic">Harding v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3071) (a loss of military reserve status due to unsatisfactory military performance or conduct was within a civilian technician's control); <span class="Italic">Baum v. Zuckert</span>, 342 F.2d 145 (6th Cir. 1965) (an Air Force regulation requiring the loss of a civilian position if a loss of status as a reserve member was "for reasons within [appellant's] control").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board provided more elaborate analysis of the burdens of proof for the agency, and for the appellant asserting affirmative defenses, in appeals involving removal of reserve technicians for loss of membership in a reserve unit in <span class="Italic">Schaffer v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 9 MSPR 305, 307-10 (1981), involving an individual who did not meet standards governing weight:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">Tennessee v. Dunlap</span>, 426 U.S. 312 (1976), that a former civilian employee of the Tennessee Air National Guard, who was denied re-enlistment with the Guard and then removed from his employment for not being a member, was not entitled to a hearing to determine whether he was removed in this manner to circumvent the statutory requirement of good cause if he had been removed directly. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Thornton v. Coffey</span>, 618 F.2d 686, 691 (10th Cir. 1980), the court declined consideration of a claim by an applicant for civilian employment with the Oklahoma National Guard that the Guard's discharging him from military service resulted from retaliation for his filing a discrimination complaint, because "the courts have a strong policy of avoiding interference in internal military matters."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Rolles v. Civil Service Commission</span>, 512 F.2d 1319 (D.C. Cir. 1975), on the other hand, the court took jurisdiction over a case the circumstances of which are very similar to this appeal. The court found that it had jurisdiction to determine whether a former employee of the Department of the Air Force, whose civilian employment was conditioned on his retention of active Air Force Reserve membership, had lost his active membership for reasons within his control, as required by Air Force regulations. There was no similar regulatory requirements in <span class="Italic">Dunlap</span> or <span class="Italic">Thornton</span>. The <span class="Italic">Rolles</span> court noted that revoking a person's military status unilaterally, without opportunity for response, and then dismissing him from civilian employment solely on the basis of the first action, again without opportunity for response to the underlying charges, deprived the person of a property interest in continuing employment without any semblance of due process of the law<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1327. For that reason, the court remanded the case to the Board's predecessor, the former Civil Service Commission, for a hearing on the removal action<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1328.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the appeal now before the Board, the agency's regulations provide that an Air Force Technician like the appellant who loses Reserve membership in his unit for reasons beyond his control will retained "<span class="Italic">status quo</span>" until he can be reassigned to another position not classified as an Air Force Technician at the same or higher grade in the same geographic area. Air Force Reserve Regulation 40-2, 3 (a) (August 13, 1979). Since this regulation may afford the appellant a right to retention and reassignment despite the fact that his re-enlistment was denied, the Board must examine whether that right was wrongfully withheld as the appellant claimed, 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(1) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(1)] and 1201.111(b) (1). Moreover, in keeping with <span class="Italic">Rolles</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">McClanahan</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the initial burden is placed on the agency to prove by preponderant evidence that the appellant was properly removed because the reason for his loss of Reserve membership was within his control. 5 USC 7701(c)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official found in his initial decision that the agency did prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant's overweight condition was due to factors within his control. None of the parties have challenged this finding, and our review of the record has disclosed no reason to question its propriety. The logical converse of this finding under the agency's regulations is that, since the appellant did not lose this Reserve membership for reasons beyond his control, he has no right to retention or reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of the generally limited nature of a non-military body's review of the military decision to deny re-enlistment, once the Board has considered whether the agency has proved its reasons for denial and the appellant's ability to control those reasons, the Board will not consider affirmative defenses raised <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> the fact of the denied re-enlistment.[2] If we were to analyze the appellant's disparate treatment claim with respect to the grounds for the denial of his re-enlistment, as the presiding official erroneously did, we would have to consider whether the Air Force Reserves was justified in treating the appellant's circumstances of remaining more than fifty pounds overweight, despite repeated warnings to reduce, differently from those of several other Reservists who were only ten or twelve pounds overweight and in the process of losing weight. As do the courts, we decline to review such a discretionary military decision that accords with the agency's regulations and has no constitutional ramifications<span class="Italic">. See Mindes v. Seamans</span>, 453 F.2d 197, 201 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Parenthetically, we note that this situation does not evidence disparate treatment because the circumstances of the other overweight Reservists are significantly different. The agency had a reasonable expectation that the other would soon meet its weight standards, but had no such expectation of the appellant who had ranged from 42 to 59 pounds over the maximum weight for his age and height for the past five years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Also, with respect to the anti-union animus claim, we note that the appellant failed to prove a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation under 5 USC 2302(b)(9) in any event. He did demonstrate that he took part in filing unfair labor practice claims as president of the union local, that the deciding official had actual knowledge of his protected activity, and that he was subsequently removed. But the appellant neglected to adduce any evidence tending to show a causal relationship between his protected activities and the removal action<span class="Italic">. Bodinus, supra</span> at 6-7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We might consider, therefore, only whether the claims of disparate treatment and anti-union animus are supportable in comparing the appellant's circumstances with those of other employees who failed to retain their Reserve membership. Since the appellant has proffered and the record contains no evidence of such other employees in this appeal, however, we find that the appellant failed to prove his affirmative defenses. 5 CFR 1201.56(b) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(c)].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, in addition, that the appellant's removal for failing to maintain Reserve membership as required by Air Force Reserve Regulation 40-2, 3(b) (August 13, 1979), promotes the efficiency of the service under 5 USC 7513(a). This finding accords with the consistent holding of the courts that the requirement of a military agency that certain of its civilian employees retain an active Reserve membership is related to the agency's purpose of providing active Reserve units with a core of Reservists who are fully trained in supplying support services, and that dismissal from civilian employment from failure to maintain an active Reserve membership promotes the efficiency of the service<span class="Italic">. See American Federation of Government Employees v. Hoffman</span>, 543 F.2d 930, 939 (D.C. Cir. 1976); <span class="Italic">Baum v. Zuckert</span>, 342 F.2d 145, 147 (6th Cir. 1965).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The problem of the reserve technician who loses a job upon loss of military status was examined briefly by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Zimmerman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 755 F.2d 156 (Fed. Cir. 1985). As a condition of her employment, Ms. Zimmerman, an Army technician, was required to be an enlisted member in good standing with an Army Reserve unit. Her reserve status was lost when she could not attend a training session due to inability to secure care for her children. She was then removed from her civilian position. The court, concerning itself with Ms. Zimmerman's claims that Army regulations were violated as to her status and inability to attend the training session, ruled that the Board did not have jurisdiction to examine military assignments and transfers. The agency sustained its burden of proof by establishing that the reason for the loss of reserve membership resulted from circumstances falling within Zimmerman's control. Because she was no longer in an Army reserve unit, she was properly separated. The court relied on <span class="Italic">McClanahan</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The Federal Circuit reaffirmed <span class="Italic">Zimmerman</span> in <span class="Italic">Buriana v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 777 F.2d 674 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The appellant was demoted when he was passed over for promotion. The agency regulation stated that technicians who lose reserve status for reasons within their control will be separated from their civilian position. The same regulation stated that being twice deferred for promotion is a reason within the control of the individual. Sustaining the validity of the regulation, the court decided that it precluded a wide-ranging collateral inquiry into the military promotion process and rating procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hill v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 309 Fed. Appx. 413 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP) (nondisciplinary <span id="Page_2526"></span>removal of Air Reserve Technician based upon the appellant's acquisition of his "High Year of Tenure": "[b]ecause the Agency was required by regulation to remove Hill from his ART position, the Board did not err in declining to consider the circumstances of other individuals").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board summarized its scope of review of reservists' appeals, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Army</span>, 34 MSPR 678, 680-82 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit has held that the Board does not have authority to review the merits of the military decision to revoke appellant's reserve status. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Zimmerman</span>....&#8197;The only issues that the Board may properly consider are: (1) Whether the position occupied contains a requirement that the incumbent possess such status; (2) whether appellant lost reserve status; (3) whether minimal due process was granted by the military; and (4) whether the loss was within the appellant's control....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the following reasons, we find that, because positions such as appellant's exist by agreement between the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the agency, whether a reason for losing membership in the reserve is considered "within one's control" is not to be determined according to the standards of everyday usage. In <span class="Italic">Buriani v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 777 F.2d 674 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit confronted the question of whether a reservist's failure to be promoted was beyond his control. The court noted that the Air Force's regulations specifically included failure to attain promotion. The court conceded that "[i]n a layman's sense, the regulation may not represent the perceived realities of the situation," but found that it represented the "determination of the agency and OPM that all failures to achieve...promotion...fall within the employee's control." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 677 (emphasis in the original). Thus, the court held that the employee could not defend against his removal by attempting to show that his failure to be promoted was not within his control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, however, there is no regulation in the record specifying what circumstances are considered "within one's control." In circumstances such as these, we find that, where an agency regulation concerning loss of reserve status does not define the circumstances which are considered to be within an employee's control, and where such status is a condition of employment, all circumstances are within the employee's control except for age and physical disability. We find this definition consistent with the purpose underlying the establishment of the Army Reserve Technician (ART) program, and prior Civil Service Commission (CSC) and judicial interpretation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1960, the CSC approved the Army's proposal for establishing the ART program. The program's main goal was to achieve maximum combat readiness of the Army's reserve units. Membership in the reserve was, therefore, made a condition of civilian employment. Membership in the reserve, however, requires satisfying certain age and physical standards. These standards have been found to be rationally related to the reserve's combat mission as well as contribute to the effective performance of the ART employees' duty of maintaining themselves in a position to increase the combat readiness and effectiveness of the reserve units. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. Hoffman,</span> 543 F.2d 930, 935-36, 945 (D.C. Cir. 1976), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 430 U.S. 965, 97 S. Ct. 1645, 52 L. Ed.2d 356 (1977).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A memorandum of understanding appended to the CSC's letter of approval of the Army's ART program included the Army's promise that the lack or involuntary loss of military status would not provide a basis for removing present or future employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 935. In deciding cases involving removal of ART employees, the CSC's policy contemplated that membership in the active reserve constituted a condition of employment, and loss of active reserve membership for military reasons within the employee's control provides the basis for a removal action. <span class="Italic">See Rolles v. Civil Service</span> <span class="Italic">Commission,</span> 512 F.2d 1319, 1331-32 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (Robb, J., dissenting). The CSC defined "within one's control," within the meaning of this policy, to be reasons other than age or physical disability<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Since the underlying purpose of the creation of the ART program has not changed, we find the definition of the "within one's control" requirement employed by the CSC to be equally valid now.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;While physical disability is generally considered beyond an employee's control, the agency may attempt to prove that the disability is within the employee's control under the circumstances of a particular case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schaffer v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 8 MSPB 631, 9 MSPR 305 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of our conclusion on this issue, we find that the administrative judge's error in the collateral estoppel issue does not denigrate appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Karapinka v. Department of Energy,</span> 6 MSPB 114, 6 MSPR 124, 127 (1981). Appellant asserts that he lacked the mental capacity to be responsible for the actions he may have taken which led to the loss of reserve status. This contention, however, does not relate to his age or physical condition and is, therefore beyond our scope of review. While an argument could be made that a distinction should not be drawn between emotional ills and physical maladies, as discussed above, appellant's position owes its existence to an agreement between the agency and OPM, rather than a statutory mandate, and the Board should neither rewrite the agreement between the parties nor supplant the judgment of OPM and the military as to precisely when an employee shall be deemed to lose reserve membership for reasons within his control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant also contends that he did not receive a fair opportunity to defend himself in the prior military proceeding. The record reflects, however, that appellant was afforded minimal due process protections, and therefore while appellant's contentions regarding that proceeding may be presented within the military judicial system, they will not be considered further by the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board seemed to leave open the possibility of a discrimination defense being available to an employee removed for loss of reserve status, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 29 MSPR 76, 78 (1985), <span class="Italic">Thomas, supra,</span> determined, 34 MSPR at 682-83, concerning EEO defenses (the Board's Chairman declining to reach this point):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]ppellant contends that the administrative judge improperly dismissed his claim of discrimination at the hearing and excluded evidence in support of that claim. The Board has previously found, however, that because of the generally limited nature of its review of the military decision regarding reserve status, once the Board has considered whether the agency proved the revocation of reserve status and the appellant's ability to control the underlying justification, the Board will not consider affirmative defenses relating to the military action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Buriani v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Butler v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 73 MSPR 313, 318-19 (1997), noted that as to an appellant who was denied reenlistment, a reason within his control under Air Force Reserve regulations and leading to loss of reserve membership, "[t]he Board is precluded from considering affirmative defenses relating to the loss of active reserve status," but the Board may consider affirmative defenses concerning the agency's alleged policy of providing extended employment, priority placement, and other benefits to employees who lose their active reserve membership. <span class="Italic">Butler</span> also noted that the Board would not consider the agency's efforts to reassign the separated reservist unless a statute, regulation, or other authority required reassignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP No. 03-2123) (noting 10 USC 10218(a)(3)(A), requiring that a reservist who loses dual status after October 5, 1999, and who does not meet the requirements for an unreduced annuity, shall be offered the opportunity to apply for, and if qualified, be appointed to, a position as a military technician (dual status) or apply for a civil service position that is not a technician position).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board states that it will not consider affirmative defenses, e.g., a disability discrimination defense, to a military action concerning reserve status, the Board examines the defense to the extent that it involves the appellant's assertion that the reason for loss of status was not within his control. <span class="Italic">Yarbrough v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 142 (1988), rejected the appellant's disability discrimination defense that his loss of status due to his failure to meet the agency's weight control program for military personnel was a factor beyond his control. Although the Board gave passing notice to the disability discrimination claim and rejected that claim, its decision rested on analysis of medical testimony concerning the appellant's weight problem. <span class="Italic">Yarborough</span> noted as to a claim of harmful procedural error, that "[i]n light of his two distinct pre-removal opportunities to challenge the loss of reserve status, we do not find that any procedural error likely had a harmful effect on the outcome of the case before the agency."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Jeffries v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 53 MSPR 35, 41-42 (1992) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Jeffries v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 999 F.2d 529 (Fed. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">post</span>), involving an employee discharged from reserve status principally for failing an alcohol rehabilitation program, the appellant unsuccessfully argued that the reason for his military discharge was beyond his control:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, looking to the definition of the phrase "within one's control" developed by the Civil Service Commission, the predecessor of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), held further that, if circumstances within one's control are not specified by regulation, all circumstances are within the employee's control except for age and physical disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 34 MSPR at 681. In <span class="Italic">Yarbrough v. Department of Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 142, 146 (1988), the Board held that it will admit evidence on the issue of whether the loss of reserve status based on a physical disability (not specified by agency regulation as always within an employee's control) rendered the loss beyond the employee's control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board finds that the administrative judge erred in admitting evidence regarding whether the appellant's misconduct was within his control. AFRES 40-2 provides that loss of reserve membership for "inaptitude, unsuitability, unfitness, misconduct, or inefficiency" is "within the individual's control." The defense that the loss of active reserve status for misconduct was not within the control of the appellant is thus precluded by virtue of the agency's regulation, despite the appellant's claim of physical disability....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2527"></span>The administrative judge did not err, however, in admitting evidence regarding whether the appellant's failure to complete a military alcohol rehabilitation program was within his control. AFRES 40-2 is silent about whether failing an alcohol rehabilitation program is voluntary or involuntary, opening the door to allow the appellant to submit evidence that the reason that he failed the program was age and/or physical disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant established that he suffers from the mental condition of paranoid personality disorder. The appellant's physicians diagnosed his condition as "paranoid personality traits, and alcohol abuse, continuous (secondary to characterological phenomenology)." Explaining this diagnosis, Mr. Storms stated that he could not detect primary alcohol abuse/dependence in the appellant. Dr. Tallman described the appellant's condition as a personality disorder. He stated that the appellant used alcohol to cope with his intense feelings of mistrust and anxiety brought about by his personality disorder. He stated further that, despite the appellant's personality disorder and alcohol abuse, he remained responsible for his behavior.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the evidence establishes that the appellant's failure of the rehabilitation program was due to his paranoid personality disorder, and that he abused alcohol as a method of coping with his personality trait, it does not establish that paranoid personality disorder or alcohol abuse as a coping mechanism is a physical condition beyond his control. Absent such a showing, the reasons for the appellant's failure of the alcohol rehabilitation program are beyond our scope of review. The appellant's position owes its existence to an agreement between the agency and OPM, rather than to a statutory mandate, and the Board will neither rewrite the agreement between the parties nor supplant the judgment of OPM and the military as to precisely when an employee shall be deemed to lose reserve membership for reasons within his control. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 34 MSPR at 682.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the Board finds that the appellant lost his reserve status for reasons within his control and there is therefore no basis for reversal of his removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jeffries</span> was affirmed by <span class="Italic">Jeffries v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 999 F.2d 529, 529-533 (Fed. Cir. 1993), analyzing the status of reserve technicians:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Certain civilian positions in the military departments owe their existence to agreement between the military agency and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that the positions may be restricted to persons who are members of the active reserves. In the Air Force, such civilian jobs are termed Air Reserve Technician (ART) positions. ARTs are full-time civilian employees who are also members of the Air Force Reserve unit in which they are employed. In addition to their civilian assignments, ARTs are assigned to equivalent positions in the reserve organization with a reserve military rank or grade. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. Hoffman</span>, 543 F.2d 930, 932-33 (D.C. Cir. 1976). An ART plays a vital role in combat readiness by training other reservists and serving as a mobilization asset when the unit is mobilized. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The conditions for ART employment reflecting the agreement with OPM are delineated in Air Force Reserve Regulation 40-2 (AFRESR 40-2)....&#8197;Under AFRESR 40-2, section 1(b), persons employed in ART positions must maintain active reserve status as a condition for employment. When an employee holding an ART position loses active reserve status and, therefore, no longer satisfies one of the requirements needed to effectuate the ART program, the employee will be removed from the ART position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cancellation of active reserve status is a uniquely military decision and is subject to review only within the military command. However, different rights in connection with removal are afforded an ART employee by Air Force regulations depending on whether the employee's loss of reserve status was voluntary, i.e., for reasons "within the individual's control," or involuntary, i.e., for reasons "beyond the individual's control." AFRESR 40-2, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3, 4, 7(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Individuals who lose active reserve status for reasons within their control may be separated from the agency on 30-day's [sic] notice and are not entitled to any type of priority consideration with respect to other agency positions....&#8197;Individuals who lose active reserve status for reasons outside of their control will also lose their ART position, but they are not immediately separated from the agency. Efforts must be made to place such employees in another position in the Air Force which does not require the active reserve status lost by the employee....&#8197;Further, these employees remain employed in the agency pending permanent placement for as long as a year or more as provided by AFRESR 40-2 sections 4 and 7(c). In sum, a determination that an employee's loss of reserve status was for an involuntary reason does not entitle the employee to restoration to the ART position he or she had occupied, but rather would provide rights to employment in some capacity other than in the ART position for the period of time and under the conditions set out in the regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Air Force regulations set out two lists of various grounds for loss of reserve status, one denominated "within the individual's control," i.e., voluntary, and one denominated "beyond the individual's control," i.e., involuntary. As explained in <span class="Italic">Buriani v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 777 F.2d 674, 677 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the phrase "within an individual's control" does not have a layman's meaning but is a term of art, resulting from OPM's and the Air Force's agreement. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Buriani</span>, a loss of reserve status for failure to achieve promotion was held to be "voluntary" because it was so designated in the regulation. This court further held that the defense that such failure was not within the control of the individual is precluded by virtue of that regulation....&#8197;Because an ART employee's rights respecting immediate or delayed removal from the agency are only those afforded by the regulations, review of the issue of voluntariness is precluded where the basis for loss of reserve status appears in the regulations as a reason within the individual's control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn to application of the above principles to this case. Jeffries was employed by the Air Force at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, as an Ordinance Equipment Mechanic, an ART position. On May 1, 1989, Jeffries' military commander recommended discharging Jeffries from the active reserves for alcohol abuse rehabilitation failure and misconduct. On August 22, 1989, a hearing was held before a military discharge board to determine whether Jeffries should be discharged from the active reserves. Jeffries was represented by military and civilian counsel and permitted to call witnesses on his behalf including witnesses who testified in his defense respecting his alcohol abuse and personality disorder. The military board found him unqualified for further military service by reason of misconduct and gave him an honorable discharge effective November 17, 1989.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 9, 1990, the Air Force notified Jeffries of its decision to remove him from his ART position for the nondisciplinary reason that he had lost his active reserve status. It was further determined the loss was voluntary. Thus, no efforts were required to place him in another position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jeffries appealed his removal to the MSPB. Following a hearing on April 11, 1990, the administrative judge issued an initial decision reversing the Air Force's action and directing the Air Force to reinstate Jeffries with back pay and benefits. The administrative judge's decision was based on evidence which indicated that Jeffries used alcohol as a method of coping with a personality disorder. The administrative judge held that Jeffries' loss of reserve status was not due to circumstances within his control, but instead to his personality disorder and its accompanying coping mechanism.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon the Air Force's petition for review, the full board reversed the administrative judge's decision, stating that because Jeffries had failed to maintain his reserve military status, a prerequisite for holding an ART position, the MSPB's scope of review of the merits was limited to determining whether Jeffries' loss of reserve status was for a reason within his control. The board then held that since Air Force regulations list "misconduct" as a circumstance "within the individual's control," under the ruling of <span class="Italic">Buriani</span>, the MSPB was precluded from further inquiry. Accordingly, the board affirmed Jeffries' removal. It is from this decision that Jeffries appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Misconduct is specifically defined by AFRESR 40-2, section 2(b)(3) as "within the individual's control." Jeffries argues that the MSPB, and this court on appeal, must look beyond the regulation and decide whether or not his personality disorder and its accompanying coping mechanism take his specific acts of misconduct outside of the regulation. We disagree. As held in <span class="Italic">Buriani</span>, where the stated reason for discharge from the reserves is specifically defined as "within the individual's control" by the applicable regulation, "the scope of the inquiry in the adverse action before the MSPB is limited to whether an individual lost active status for that reason." 777 F.2d at 677.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jeffries argues that <span class="Italic">Buriani</span> is distinguishable because in that case the loss of active status was due to failure to receive a promotion, a purely subjective decision which would have required the court (or the board) to interject its own judgment into an extremely subjective process. Jeffries argues that the present case does not require inquiry into the Air Force official's mental processes, but rather requires analysis relating only to whether Jeffries' misconduct was for reasons within his control. Again, we disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">No distinction can be drawn between a decision by the military that a reservist's specific acts amount to misconduct sufficient to warrant separation from the active reserves and a decision by the military that a reservist is not entitled to a promotion. Both decisions are subject to appropriate review only within the military. The grounds for discharge from the reserves are not reviewable indirectly through the MSPB. Once the Air Force established that misconduct was in fact the ground for Jeffries' loss of reserve status, as stated in <span class="Italic">Buriani</span>, the inquiry should have ended. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 677.</p>

In view of the Army's decision to remove Ms. Butler from Selected Reserve status, the Board's review of the decision is limited to: (1) whether her continued Selected Reserve status was a condition to Ms. Butler's employment as an MT; (2) whether that condition was no longer met; and (3) whether Ms. Butler was provided with the minimum level of due process. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jordan v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 74 Fed. Appx. 896, 897 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (nonprecedential).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that it is undisputed that Ms. Butler was employed as a civilian MT with the U.S. Army Reserves and that such position was an MT (dual status) position. The Board also found that in the notice proposing Ms. Butler's removal from employment, the agency listed the reason for the removal as her loss of membership in the Selected Reserve. By military orders dated July 18, 2012, and effective that same day, Ms. Butler was transferred from the Selected Reserve to the U.S. Army Reserve Control Group in an effort to curb overstrength (i.e., personnel in excess of what is required) within the Army. Thus, Ms. Butler no longer maintained membership in the Selected Reserve as of July 18, 2012. Further, the Board found that Ms. Butler was afforded due process because she was given advanced written notice stating the specific reason for the proposed action, an opportunity to respond, and a written decision. We find that the Board's limited review was in accord with law.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The Board is precluded from considering any of Ms. Butler's affirmative defenses relating to the loss of active reserve status. <span class="Italic">See Butler v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 313, 318-19 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Butler's failure to comply with a condition of her employment led to her removal. Contrary to Ms. Butler's arguments, the fact that her loss of Selected Reserve membership was not a result of misconduct, unacceptable military performance, or voluntary relinquishment, does not mean that the Army is <span class="Italic">obligated</span> to provide her with an additional year of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although, under the applicable statute, 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10216(e)(2), the Army <span class="Italic">may</span>, in some circumstances, exercise the <span class="Italic">option</span> of continuing to pay compensation to a separated employee for up to 12 months where the loss of dual status "was not due to the failure of that individual to meet military standards," a plain reading of the statute makes clear that this does not amount to an <span class="Italic">obligation. See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10216(e)(2). Thus, we agree with the Board that the Army was not <span class="Italic">required</span> to retain Ms. Butler in her dual status MT position for an additional 12 months even if her loss of Selected Reserve membership was involuntary.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10218, the Agency offered Ms. Butler the opportunity to reapply for, and if qualified, be appointed to, a position as an MT (dual status); or apply for a civil-service position that is not a technician position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harding v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3071) ("[M]ilitary decisions related to the loss of dual status by an employee are not reviewable in an appeal of the removal action.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Separation of a civilian technician when his military status was lost after he reached a military mandatory retirement date was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Holcomb v. Dept. of Army,</span> CH-0752-11-0569-I-1 (NP 4/27/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a dual status Staff Operations and Training Specialist (military technician), was transferred from the Selected Reserve to the Retired Reserve effective January 18, 2011, which was both his 60th birthday and his mandatory removal date (MRD) from his military position. The agency subsequently removed him from his civilian position effective April 23, 2011, for failure to maintain a basic condition of employment, i.e., Selected Reserve membership. The appellant filed a Board appeal challenging his removal, alleging that the agency was required to retain him in a non-dual status military technician position until he became entitled to a full unreduced annuity. The administrative judge affirmed the removal action, finding the agency proved that the appellant was required to maintain membership in the Selected Reserve as a condition of employment, that the appellant lost this membership on January 18, 2011, and that the appellant's removal constituted a reasonable penalty and promoted the efficiency of the service....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant challenges the administrative judge's and the agency's application of Army Regulation (AR) 140-315(8)(d)(2), which provides that a military technician appointed after December 8, 1983, is subject to removal from his civilian position even if his separation from the Selected Reserve occurred for a reason beyond his control. He argues that subsection (d) does not apply because he did not voluntarily relinquish his dual status and was not separated from the Selected Reserve due to unacceptable military performance or misconduct. We agree with the appellant. The regulation at AR 140-315(8)(d) only applies where a military technician voluntarily relinquished dual status or was separated from the Selected Reserve due to unacceptable military performance or misconduct, and the agency has not alleged and the record does not support that either of these circumstances are present in this appeal. Thus, both the agency and the administrative judge improperly applied AR 140-315(8)(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, the inapplicability of this regulatory provision does not change the outcome of this appeal. The record evidence shows that the agency issued a military decision in which it deemed the appellant's untimely request for retention beyond his MRD a loss of dual status within his control.[3] The Board has held that military determinations involving purely military matters are a category of decisions that are beyond the scope of the Board's review. <span class="Italic">See Archer,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. at 430; <span class="Italic">Gibler,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. at 420. Because the appellant was statutorily required under 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 10216(a)(1)(B) and 10216(d) to maintain membership in the Selected Reserve as a condition of employment and the agency issued a military decision finding that the appellant lost his Selected Reserve membership for reasons within his control, the agency has proven that the appellant failed to maintain a basic condition of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant argues on review that the administrative judge failed to consider his July 22 submission in which he alleged that extenuating circumstances outside of his control resulted in his untimely request for retention beyond his MRD and that the agency should have granted his request. Even assuming that the administrative judge failed to consider the appellant's submission, the Board has held that military determinations involving purely military matters are a category of decisions that are beyond the scope of the Board's review. <span class="Italic">See Archer v. Department of the Army</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 427, 430 (1990); <span class="Italic">Gibler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 417, 420 (1989). Thus, the alleged error does not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reasserts that the agency should have retained him until he became eligible for an unreduced annuity, relying on 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10218(a)(3)(B)(ii)(I) and AR 140-315(8)(i). However, 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10218(a)(3)(B)(ii)(I) does not apply here because the appellant did not continue employment with the Army Reserve as a non-dual status military technician. As a post-1996 hire who was ineligible at the time dual status was lost for an unreduced annuity, 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10218 merely affords the appellant the opportunity to (i) reapply for, and if qualified be appointed to, a position as a dual status military technician; or (ii) apply for a civil service position that is not a technician position. 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10218(a)(3)(A). It is undisputed that the agency apprised the appellant of these opportunities in the proposal and decision notices, and that the appellant did not apply for a non-dual status military technician position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, AR 140-315(8)(i)(1) merely provides that military technicians who have reached their MRD <span class="Italic">may</span> be retained in active status provided that certain requirements are met. This is a discretionary military determination. To the extent the appellant disagrees with the agency's decision not to take action on his request for retention beyond his MRD, the Board lacks the authority to review military determinations involving purely military matters. <span class="Italic">See Archer</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. at 430; <span class="Italic">Gibler</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. at 420. Consequently, the appellant has failed to point to any law, rule or regulation that applies and requires the agency to retain him until he becomes eligible for an unreduced annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon our review of the record evidence, the agency established that dual status requirements of military technicians were established to enhance the readiness and effectiveness of the Reserve units upon mobilization and, thus, the removal action was taken to promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Schaffer v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 9 M.S.P.R. 305, 310 (1981) (holding that removal based on the loss of required reserve membership promotes the efficiency of the service). Although the agency improperly relied on AR 140-315(8)(d)(2) in support of its argument that the appellant's removal was reasonable, the statute at 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10216(e) expressly provides that "Funds appropriated for the Department of Defense may not (except as provided in paragraph (2)) be used for compensation as a military technician" of any individual appointed to a dual status military technician position after February 10, 1996, who is no longer a member of the Selected Reserve. We interpret this statutory provision to mean that the agency must remove from its payroll any dual status military technician hired after February 10, 1996, once he loses his Selected Reserve membership. Accordingly, the administrative judge correctly concluded that the agency proved that the penalty of removal was reasonable and promoted the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of retirement options for dual status technicians who lose military reserve membership, under <span class="Italic">Garay v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-15-0235-I-1 (NP 9/24/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A military technician (dual status) is required, as a condition of that employment, to maintain active military reserve membership. 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10216(a)(1)(B). The appellant stipulated that he is no longer an active member of the reserve. Because the appellant no longer met a condition of his employment, the administrative judge affirmed the appellant's removal. The administrative judge further found that the appellant's removal promoted the efficiency of the service and was reasonable under the circumstances presented.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2529"></span>A dual status technician who is ineligible for an unreduced annuity and is under age 60 when dual status is lost must be offered the opportunity to: (1) reapply for, and, if qualified, be appointed to, a position as a military technician (dual status); or (2) reapply for a civil service position that is not a technician position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10218(a)(3)(A). The administrative judge found that the appellant was not eligible for an unreduced annuity and was under the age of 50 when he lost his dual status. The administrative judge further found that the appellant was not interested in either of the options noted above, <span class="Italic">see</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10218(a)(3)(A), but instead only requested that he be given a nondual status technician position. As the administrative judge correctly observed, the agency is not required to consider the appellant for a nondual status technician position, of which she noted there are few available.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant essentially argues that the agency should allow him to remain in his position until he is eligible to retire. However, in quoting the relevant authorities, he acknowledges that doing so is discretionary in that the agency "may" retain an individual like the appellant who lost his active reserve status for medical reasons, but he identifies no authority for the proposition that the agency must do so, or that the Board is authorized to review the agency's actions concerning such a determination, regardless of whether those actions are substantive or procedural in nature.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Related to an affirmative defense are the defenses of equitable estoppel and laches, evaluated as to of loss of reserve status, <span class="Italic">Talakowski v. Dept. of Army</span>, 50 MSPR 18, 20-23 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of his contention that his failure to reenlist was not within his control, the appellant explained that he had been seeking a medical discharge from his military position prior to the expiration of his term of enlistment, but that no decision had yet been reached as to whether he was medically fit to remain in the Reserves. The appellant further alleged that he had relied on a March 29, 1985 letter from Lieutenant Colonel B.N. Poulos, U.S. Army Congressional Coordinator, to Senator William Proxmire, in which Lieutenant Colonel Poulos stated that the appellant was exempt from the requirement that he retain his USAR membership, and that his discharge from the Reserves would therefore not affect his current employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency's regulation specifically provides that failure to reenlist is a matter within a Military Technician's control. Even in the absence of this regulation, failure to reenlist would have to be considered to be a matter within the appellant's control because it is a circumstance other than age or physical disability....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There remains the question whether an appellant who is removed from his civilian position because of the loss of his membership in the Reserves can assert an equitable defense to avoid the effect of the agency's <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule. The administrative judge in this case implicitly invoked two equitable defenses--equitable estoppel and laches--in reaching the conclusion that the appellant's failure to reenlist was not within his control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on the Appropriations Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court has held that the government cannot be estopped from denying benefits not otherwise permitted by law, even if the claimant was denied monetary benefits because of his reliance on the mistaken advice of a government official. <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 110 S. Ct. 2465 (1990). The agency argues that, under <span class="Italic">Richmond</span>, the erroneous advice contained in the March 29, 1985 letter from Lieutenant Colonel Poulos to Senator Proxmire cannot provide a basis for excepting the appellant from the requirement that he retain his military membership in order to keep his civilian employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not decide whether <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> applies to the facts of this case because the appellant has not established the requisite elements for the application of equitable estoppel. Equitable estoppel requires, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the party to whom a misrepresentation was made have relied on the misrepresentation to his detriment....&#8197;It was undisputed below that the deadline for applicant to reenlist in the Reserves was March 7, 1985....&#8197;The appellant could not have relied on the Poulos letter...received by the appellant about a month later...in making a decision not to reenlist on March 7, 1985.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Laches is an equitable time limitation on a party's right to bring suit which bars an action where a party's unexcused or unreasonable delay has prejudiced the adversary....&#8197;Even if the agency unreasonably delayed in removing the appellant from his position, the appellant has not claimed that such delay prejudiced his ability to defend himself in this proceeding. Indeed, the agency's delay could be said to have benefitted the appellant by extending his employment well beyond the time when it should have been terminated.</p>
