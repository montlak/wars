<p class="Body-Text">Retirement is involuntary if the employee is given incorrect information by his employing agency concerning retirement rights and decides to take retirement rather than face removal. <span class="Italic">Beaty v. USDA</span>, 24 MSPR 658, 662 (1984). "[A] decision to retire made with inadequate information upon which an employee reasonably relied to her detriment based on an objective evaluation of the surrounding circumstances and within a limited time frame can support a finding that the retirement was involuntary." <span class="Italic">Isabelle v. OPM</span>, 69 MSPR 176, 182 (1996); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Webb v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 275, 278 (1991) ("The applicable standard for determining whether an employee's election of retirement options is voidable due to improper information is whether a reasonable person would have been confused in the particular circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Frantz v. OPM</span>, 778 F.2d 783, 786 (Fed. Cir. 1985)."); <span class="Italic">Moriarty v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 280, 287 (1991) ("Misleading statements upon which an employee reasonably relied to his detriment are sufficient to render an action involuntary regardless of whether there was an intent to deceive by the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1983).... [T]he agency need not be aware that the statements were misleading--they can be negligently or even innocently provided to the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Covington v. DHHS</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Petric v. OPM</span>, 108 MSPR 342, 345-46 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10, 2008 MSPB 59 (2008), noting that the appellant should support the jurisdictional allegations by a sworn statement, provided a summary of the law concerning constructive adverse action appeals based on retirements that result from materially misleading information:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A retirement is involuntary if an agency made misleading statements upon which the employee reasonably relied to his detriment. The appellant need not show that the agency intentionally misled him. That is, the agency could have provided the misleading information negligently or even innocently; if the appellant materially relied on the misinformation to his detriment, his retirement is considered involuntary. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wallendorf v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 59, &#x00B6; 6 (2006). An appellant is entitled to a hearing on the issue of Board jurisdiction over an appeal of an alleged involuntary separation if he makes a non-frivolous allegation casting doubt on the presumption of voluntariness. <span class="Italic">E.g., Williams v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 10 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has failed to make a non-frivolous allegation that the agency misinformed him and that he reasonably relied on the misinformation to his detriment. In the show-cause orders, the AJ informed the appellant of the above cited standard for proving that his retirement was involuntary based on agency misinformation. The AJ notified the appellant that he would be entitled to a hearing if he made non-frivolous allegations sufficient to show that a material fact relating to jurisdiction was in dispute. The AJ further notified the appellant that statements to support a jurisdiction claim must be in the form of an affidavit, sworn statement, or declaration, and directed him to a form for the statement in the Board's regulations. Despite those instructions, the appellant failed to submit a sworn statement that the agency told him that he would be granted workers' compensation benefits in lieu of disability retirement if he voluntarily applied for and accepted disability retirement. Thus, he has not shown that the Board should remand this case for further proceedings on the issue. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hanna</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12; <span class="Italic">cf. Wallendorf</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 59, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (Board remanded for further findings on jurisdiction and timeliness where the appellant submitted a declaration asserting that the agency misinformed her that she must resign to retain her health insurance).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant reasserts on review that the agency provided him with incorrect information regarding his annuity that caused him to involuntarily retire. Specifically, the appellant contends that the Army had a responsibility to verify the accuracy of the post-1956 deposit for his military service made in 1997, because it was supposed to conduct a comprehensive review of his retirement eligibility and provide him an accurate estimate on which he was to base his retirement decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge credited "as straightforward" the appellant's testimony that he would have delayed his retirement had the Army, the agency which processed his retirement, properly detected and corrected the error made by the INS in collecting the post-1956 deposit under FERS rules. ID at 6.[2] Further, the record includes an affidavit, sworn under oath, from Carla M. Gilbert, Human Resources Specialist, in which she states that she spoke with the appellant on January 9, 2009, and provided him with a "final counseling." Ms. Gilbert's affidavit states that the final counseling included an estimate for the appellant's monthly annuity and that, while she and the appellant did not specifically discuss his post-1956 military deposit, the counselor based her estimates on the proof of payment in full of a military deposit the appellant included in his retirement packet. This proof of payment information, however, was wrong. The appellant had not paid his post-1956 military deposit in full at the CSRS rate. As a result, because the Army did not verify the accuracy of the appellant's military deposit, the Army's estimate of the appellant's monthly annuity was, therefore, also incorrect. Thus, the Army provided the appellant with misinformation, albeit unintentionally. The Board has repeatedly held that whether the agency provided the misinformation intentionally, unintentionally, negligently, inadvertently, or even <span id="Page_1982"></span>innocently is immaterial to whether it was, in fact, misinformation, and that a decision based on misinformation is not binding as a matter of fundamental fairness and due process. <span class="Italic">See Aldridge</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 670, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Baldwin v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;An accurate deposit for the appellant's post-1956 military service gives him retirement credit for an additional 7 years of service. The failure to pay the deposit thus has serious consequences.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant has shown that the Army provided him with misinformation and that he reasonably relied on it in deciding to retire, he has proven that his retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Baldwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 586, &#x00B6; 46 (2009). Accordingly, because the appellant has proven that his retirement was involuntary and thus tantamount to a removal, there is Board jurisdiction and he prevails on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Shoaf v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 260 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Aldridge</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 670, &#x00B6; 20. The appellant is therefore entitled to reinstatement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A retirement was set aside as involuntary when the agency provided the employee an estimate of retirement benefits based on an immediate retirement date, the employee then separated from the agency thinking he was retired, and it turned out that he was too young to secure an immediate rather than a deferred retirement, <span class="Italic">Notyce v. DHS</span>, AT-0752-12-0846-I-1 (NP 5/29/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contesting the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's retirement was involuntary, and therefore a constructive discharge, the agency makes three arguments. First, it contends that the appellant's decision to retire could not have been due to agency misinformation because the appellant made his decision and retired on February 29, 2012, before any alleged misinformation was provided. This argument ignores the fact that, on February 17, 2012, the agency provided a "Federal Retirement Benefits Estimate" that indicated that the appellant was eligible for immediate retirement benefits, listing the Annuity Start Date as May 1, 2012. The agency had an affirmative duty to provide the appellant information that was not only correct in nature but adequate in scope to allow the appellant to make an informed decision to retire. <span class="Italic">See Cortinas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 513, 515 (1987). The agency clearly violated that duty in this case and, as subsequent events showed persuasively, there is no reason to believe that the appellant would have retired on February 29, 2012, if he had known that he would not be eligible to start receiving a retirement annuity until January 2013.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency secondly argues that, even if the appellant were able to point to some misinformation he received from the agency, he would have to show that he would have made a different decision if he had been correctly informed of the consequences of his choices, and it points out that, after the appellant received his retirement package in March 2012, he did not question the written estimate that showed January 1, 2013 as his annuity start date. As discussed above, the administrative judge made credibility determinations, which we affirm, that the appellant did not become aware that he was eligible only for a deferred retirement starting in January 2013 until a later point in time, and that he acted promptly and diligently once he realized that he was not eligible for immediate retirement benefits and that the agency did not intend to compensate him for the period during which he was separated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency thirdly argues that, even if the appellant were able to show some misinformation by the agency and that he would have made a different decision had he been given correct information, his reliance was not reasonable. It notes that the appellant could have waited for an OPM determination before retiring, that he was fully aware that the agency did not have the authority to make a final determination of his eligibility for immediate retirement, and states that, as "a well-educated and experienced Federal employee," he "knew, or should have known, that he was not eligible to retire before age 62." The agency is here trying to hold the appellant to a higher standard of knowledge than it holds its own retirement experts, who should have known and immediately advised the appellant that he was not eligible for immediate retirement, but failed to do so.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The bottom line is that inaccurate information concerning benefits may result in an involuntary retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nazaroff v. DOD</span>, DC-0752-11-0959-I-4 (NP 11/20/2013) ("[T]he agency provided the appellant with misinformation, that the appellant erroneously believed that he was eligible for a law enforcement retirement without waiving his military retired pay, and that the DFAS supervisor did not correct this erroneous belief.

He further alleged that the agency provided him with "misinformation," "misrepresent[ed] " information, and did not inform him "that [he] had appeal rights."[8] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant's allegations can be fairly interpreted to mean that the agency advised him that his only alternative to termination was to accept the terms of the settlement agreement and indicated that he would not otherwise have appeal rights. Indeed, on review, the appellant reiterates that the agency provided him with "misinformation with regard to [his] due process rights and MSPB appeal rights" and "stat[ed] that there were no appeal rights." We therefore find that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness sufficient to warrant a jurisdictional hearing. If the appellant is able to prove his allegation that the agency provided him with misinformation upon which he detrimentally relied in signing the settlement agreement (namely, that he would not otherwise have appeal rights), this would demonstrate that he did not enter into the agreement voluntarily. <span class="Italic">See Gutierrez v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;To the extent the appellant alleges that the agency was required to notify him of his appeal rights before he signed the settlement agreement, this is incorrect.

The agency informed employees that their worksite was scheduled for closure. Employees were informed of priority placement programs, the possibility of relocating to other locations, and employees who were eligible for retirement were told of that option and offered a voluntary separation incentive payment. The appellant accepted the retirement option and the incentive payment and, following retirement, appealed a constructive adverse action, asserting the agency did not inform her, shortly after her agreement for the separation payment and before her retirement date, that the agency announced that it would retain fifteen positions at her location that would be filled through RIF procedures. The appellant alleged that agency officials knew of her interest in retaining employment and knew, but did not inform her, of the positions that would be retained prior to the date she signed the retirement incentive agreement. The appellant was entitled to a hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's primary argument is that the agency misled her into believing that there were to be no positions remaining at the Norfolk DFAS and no opportunity to be placed there through RIF procedures, even though the agency was aware that a number of positions would be retained in Norfolk and filled via RIF procedures, but postponed so announcing until 3 days after the closure date for VSIP elections. In addition, the appellant contends that she would have been retained through the agency's RIF and that she therefore would not have elected to retire.

<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons discussed above, we find that the appellant has proven by preponderant evidence her assertion that Jackson and Henry represented to her in the October 14, 2004 meeting that she would lose her retirement benefits if she were terminated. In reaching this conclusion, we rely on the appellant's clear and specific account of what she was told, the lack of any contradiction by Jackson and only a vague and ambiguous response by Henry, and the testimony from Solomon corroborating the appellant's account, as well as the lack of the contradiction cited by the AJ to find the appellant not credible. <span class="Italic">See Hillen,</span> 35 M.S.P.R. at 460 (contradiction by or consistency with other evidence as factors to be considered in determining credibility).

This was particularly true in the context of being told by Henry that she faced the option of retiring or being terminated. <span class="Italic">See Covington,</span> 750 F.2d at 942 (employee receiving RIF notice reasonably relied on erroneous statement that he had no right of reassignment and could retire); <span class="Italic">Scharf,</span> 710 F.2d at 1575 (employee who could not work due to health problems reasonably relied on misinformation from retirement counselor indicating that there would be no adverse consequences to taking optional retirement prior to disability retirement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we are persuaded that the statement regarding loss of retirement benefits if she were terminated was the decisive factor in the appellant's decision to retire because she made an appointment the very next day to sign her retirement papers. Although she had previously been told by her union representative that the agency's pending removal action would put an end to her retirement benefits, the appellant did not <span id="Page_1984"></span>retire until after she was told this by Jackson and Henry. As in cases where an individual alleges coercion, the showing of a short period of time between an employer's provision of misleading information and the employee's decision to resign or retire is probative evidence that the employer's action was the triggering event. <span class="Italic">Cf. Shoaf,</span> 260 F.3d at 1342; <span class="Italic">Axsom</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 605, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, there is no evidence to show that the appellant knew at the time of her retirement that the information she received during the October 14, 2004 meeting was incorrect or that she was in fact eligible for a deferred annuity at age 62. The appellant testified, without rebuttal, that she did not know about the option of a deferred annuity until she read about it in the Board's prior decision. She also stated that she did not ask Nero, when they met on October 18, 2004, to effect her retirement, whether what Jackson and Henry had told her was true. Nero did not testify that she told the appellant about the deferred annuity option. The AJ's statement that Nero testified that "she explained to the appellant she would always be eligible to receive a deferred annuity at age 62, even if the agency had removed her," is not supported by a review of the hearing tape. Finally, in finding that the appellant relied on the agency's misinformation to her detriment, we note the appellant's unrebutted testimony that she would not have retired but for the statement made in the October 14, 2004 meeting.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant has shown that the agency made a misleading statement and that she reasonably relied on it in deciding to retire, she has proven that her retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Scharf,</span> 710 F.2d at 1574-75; <span class="Italic">Baldwin</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 392, &#x00B6; 20. As noted above, in an involuntary separation case, the issue of Board jurisdiction and the merits of the case are inextricably intertwined. Accordingly, because the appellant has proven that her retirement was involuntary and thus tantamount to a removal, there is Board jurisdiction and she prevails on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Shoaf,</span> 260 F.3d at 1341; <span class="Italic">Schultz</span>, 810 F.2d at 1136; <span class="Italic">Porter</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 22. She is therefore entitled to reinstatement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To the same effect, the appellant stated a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency incorrectly secured his retirement by telling him he would lose all his retirement benefits if he was discharged, <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 122 MSPR 205, 208-09 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9, 2015 MSPB 15 (2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A retirement is involuntary if it is obtained by agency misinformation or deception. <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The misleading information can be negligently or even innocently provided; if the employee materially relies on such misinformation to his detriment, based on an objective evaluation of the circumstances, his retirement is considered involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A decision based on misinformation or lack of information cannot be binding as a matter of fundamental fairness and due process. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 943. The Board has stated that the principles set forth in <span class="Italic">Covington</span> require an agency to provide information that is not only correct in nature but also adequate in scope to allow an employee to make an informed decision. <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 586, &#x00B6; 16 (2009). This includes an obligation to correct any erroneous information an agency has reason to know an employee is relying on. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that an agency manager told him that he would lose his retirement benefits if he were removed. This appears to be misinformation. Retirement benefits earned over the course of one's federal career are generally available upon separation from federal service, even when that separation is agency initiated. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8312-15 (codifying limited circumstances under which an annuity is subject to forfeiture). This is an allegation that the appellant lacked a meaningful choice due to the agency's act of providing incorrect advice, and if true, would constitute an appealable constructive removal. <span class="Italic">See Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record includes evidence that the agency had reason to know the appellant was relying on this misinformation. The same manager who allegedly told the appellant that he would lose his retirement benefits if he were removed stated that in the months leading up to the removal decision the appellant was "very concerned" about how a removal would affect his retirement benefits. Failing to correct erroneous information that it has reason to know an employee is relying on is a wrongful action by an agency that may deprive an employee of a meaningful choice. <span class="Italic">Baldwin</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 586, &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Retirement was involuntary when a supervisor failed to correct the incorrect impression of the appellant that if he did not retire before a removal decision was issued he would lose his retirement benefits, <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Dept. of Navy</span>, PH-0752-14-0669-B-1 (NP 6/28/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that, because it was not the source of the misinformation the appellant relied on in deciding to retire, his retirement was voluntary. The agency also argues that the administrative judge erred by expecting its manager to act as a "full-blown benefits counselor" to the appellant, anticipating and answering questions the appellant had not asked. The agency's arguments are unavailing. The agency had an obligation to provide the appellant with information that was adequate in scope to make an informed decision whether to retire, including an obligation to correct misinformation it had reason to know the appellant was relying on, whether or not the agency was the source of that misinformation. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of the Army</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 449, 454-55 (1990). The administrative judge's findings on the dispositive facts are largely undisputed and are fully supported by the record as explained in the remand initial decision. The appellant repeatedly expressed concern to his supervisor that he would lose his retirement benefits after receiving the notice of proposed removal, the supervisor told the appellant that he would give him the opportunity to retire prior to issuing a decision, and the appellant retired when his supervisor subsequently gave him that opportunity. The supervisor testified that he did not know whether the appellant's belief about losing his retirement benefits was accurate, but he made no attempt to provide the appellant with adequate information so that the appellant could make an informed decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency cites to <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Service</span>, 750 F.2d 937 (Fed. Cir. 1984), and <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1983), for support of the proposition that the agency must be the source of the relied upon misinformation to render a retirement involuntary. However, the Board has found that, although <span class="Italic">Covington</span> and <span class="Italic">Scharf</span> involved affirmative misrepresentation by the agencies, those decisions go further and require that an agency provide information that is correct in nature and adequate in scope to allow an employee to make an informed choice. <span class="Italic">Wills v. Department of the Navy</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 137, 141 (1988). The agency is obligated to correct any erroneous information on which it has reason to know an employee is relying. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even if the agency was not the source of the misinformation, the agency reinforced the appellant's belief that he had to choose to retire before the decision to remove him was issued to avoid adverse consequences to his retirement benefits. After the appellant raised his concerns that a removal would adversely affect his retirement benefits, rather than disabuse him of this misunderstanding, the appellant's supervisor reassured him that he would have an opportunity to retire prior to being removed. At no point did the agency provide the appellant with the critical information he needed to make an informed choice, specifically, that even after the agency issued its decision the appellant could choose to retire and retain his right to appeal the removal decision to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j); <span class="Italic">Mays v. Department of Transportation</span>, 27 F.3d 1577, 1579-81 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Norton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 248, &#x00B6; 2 (2009). Instead, the agency allowed the appellant to believe that he had to choose between removal and retirement, and then argued that his retirement was voluntary and his appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge misstated and mischaracterized the appellant's supervisor's testimony. We do not agree. The administrative judge found that the appellant's supervisor admitted that it was "policy" for employees to first go to their supervisors prior to approaching human resources with questions. The agency argues that the supervisor testified that employees contacted him prior to contacting human resources as a "courtesy only."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, whether it was a policy, past practice, or mere courtesy is irrelevant. The testimony from both the appellant and his supervisor establishes that the appellant brought human resources issues to his supervisor prior to contacting human resources directly. The agency notes that this same supervisor testified that he "continuously" forwarded information regarding benefits and retirement to the employees under his supervision via email. This testimony supports the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant's supervisor operated as an intermediary between human resources and the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's supervisor testified that he knew he was providing advice that the appellant would rely on in making his decision to retire. He was asked what he did after the appellant asked if he would be given a chance to retire prior to being removed, and he testified, "I made a phone call because I wanted to provide [the appellant] accurate information." He contacted his supervisors, including the deciding official, and confirmed that the appellant would be given an opportunity to retire prior to issuing the decision on the proposed removal, and he communicated this to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While there is no requirement that this supervisor act as a "full-blown benefits counselor," an agency is required to provide employees with adequate information in order to make an informed retirement decision. <span class="Italic">See Freeborn v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 290, &#x00B6; 10 (2013) (stating that a decision made based on lack of information cannot be binding as a matter of fundamental fairness and due process). After careful review of the record, we find no basis to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Crosby v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 98, 105-06 (1997) (finding no reason to disturb the administrative judge's findings when she considered the evidence as a whole, drew appropriate inferences, and made reasoned conclusions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An early example of a retirement appeal based on misleading information is <span id="Page_1985"></span>the oft-cited <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">rev'g</span> <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 12 MSPR 418 (1982). The employee, who had the choice between taking optional and disability retirement, was counseled that no adverse effect would result if optional retirement preceded the disability retirement. The advice was incorrect. Under an optional retirement, accumulated sick leave is added to the length of the retiree's civil service to calculate his annuity. Under disability retirement, the retiree is allowed to stay on the payroll to exhaust his sick leave at full pay before receiving retirement benefits. This advantage to disability retirees is not available if an optional retirement precedes a disability retirement. Although the employee relied on the advice that he would be able to use up his sick leave if he filed for and received optional retirement before he was approved for disability retirement, there was no intention to deceive. The Board determined the retirement was voluntary, a ruling that was reversed by the Federal Circuit. The court's discussion provided its analysis of claims of involuntariness of personnel actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With freedom of choice as the guiding principle, it has been held that the element of voluntariness is vitiated when (1) an employee resigns under duress brought on by government action, <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">McGucken v. United States</span>, 407 F.2d 1349, 1351 (Ct. Cl.), <span class="Italic">cert. den.</span> 396 U.S. 894 (1969); (2) an employee unsuccessfully tries to withdraw his resignation before its effective date, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. United States</span>, 423 F.2d 1379, 1384-85 (Ct. Cl. 1970); (3) an employee submits a resignation under time pressure, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Perlman v. United States</span>, 490 F.2d [928], 932-33 (Ct. Cl. 1974); or (4) an employee fails to understand the situation due to mental incompetence, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Manzi v. United States</span>, 198 Ct. Cl. 489, 492 (1972). Several other cases have also indicated that a resignation will be held involuntary if obtained by agency misrepresentation or deception. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Taylor v. United States</span>, 591 F.2d 688, 692 (Ct. Cl. 1979); <span class="Italic">Christie v. United States</span>, 518 F.2d 584, 588 (Ct. Cl. 1975).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concluding that a reasonable person would have relied on the agency's improper advice concerning retirement options and that the employee did rely on that advice in good faith, <span class="Italic">Scharf</span> determined there was no need to demonstrate that agency personnel intended to deceive the employee. The test was whether a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency's statements. The court observed that the test involving misrepresentation or deception is objective; inquiring into the subjective perceptions of the employee or the subjective intentions of the agency was inappropriate. However, the court noted at footnote 5 of its opinion that if an employee is able to show an intent to deceive on the part of the agency, then an objective test may not apply; in this situation, it may be sufficient that the employee was actually misled, even though a reasonable person would not have been. Determining that the retirement was involuntary and treating it as an adverse action without procedural protections, the court ordered the agency to cancel the retirement and place the employee back on the rolls on sick leave status, with deductions for prior retirement payments received and conversion to disability retirement, already approved by OPM, once the sick leave was exhausted. The MSPB decision holding the retirement voluntary was reversed as contrary to law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Scharf</span> was the subject of commentary in another involuntary retirement case, <span class="Italic">Funesti v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1990 NP No. 90-3369):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1983), this court held that it is not necessary to show that alleged agency misrepresentations were intentional in order to establish involuntary retirement.... By the same token, it is also not necessary to show that any misrepresentations were made negligently. Instead, what Funesti is required to show is that the agency did, through Ms. Smith, make statements which were, under an objective test, materially misleading.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit offered additional guidance on involuntary retirement claims concerning an employee who retired on the effective date of an agencywide RIF under the belief that he had no retention rights, a belief later refuted by the outcome of judicial and administrative litigation concerning the retention and transfer rights of the employees whose positions were eliminated in the RIF. <span class="Italic">Covington v. DHHS</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 940-41 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Writing for the court, Judge Newman said of the Board's jurisdiction over Covington's appeal and his right to a hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Absent evidence to the contrary, retirement is presumed to be a voluntary act<span class="Italic">. Christie v. United States,</span> 518 F.2d 584, 587, 207 Ct. Cl. 333, 338 (1975); Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Supp. 752-1, subchapter S1-2(a)(1). Voluntary action initiated by the employee precludes a subsequent appeal to the MSPB. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.401(c)(3) (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether a retirement is voluntary, a court must examine "the surrounding circumstances to test the ability of the employee to exercise free choice.<span class="Italic">" Scharf v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 710 F.2d 1572, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (citing <span class="Italic">Perlman v. United States,</span> 490 F.2d 928, 933, 203 Ct. Cl. 397, 407-08 (1974)). The fact that an employee is faced with an inherently unpleasant situation or that his choice is limited to two unpleasant alternatives does not make an employee's decision any less voluntary. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States,</span> 591 F.2d 688, 692, 219 Ct. Cl. 86, 92 (1979); FPM Supp. 752-1, subchapter S12a(3). But the decision must ultimately be the employee's decision, not the government's; whether the employee made an informed choice is the touchstone of our analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official found that Covington made no allegation that his retirement had been involuntarily extracted through coercion or duress. However, a retirement need not be "coerced" to be involuntary. A resignation or retirement is involuntary if it is obtained by agency misinformation or deception. <span class="Italic">Scharf,</span> 710 F.2d at 1574; FPM Supp. 752-1, subchapter S1-2(a)(1). <span class="Italic">Scharf</span> held that an objective test applies to such situations and that a court in applying this test will not inquire into the "subjective perceptions of the employee" or "the subjective intentions of the agency." 710 F.2d at 1575. Unlike a retirement which is induced through duress, there is no requirement that an employee be intentionally deceived about his employment options, it being sufficient that "the employee shows that a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency's statements." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The misleading information can be negligently or even innocently provided; if the employee materially relies on the misinformation to his detriment, his retirement is considered involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he law also requires that a choice between two alternatives, however unpleasant, must be understood by the employee and that such a decision be freely made. In this case, the agency was responsible for Covington's lack of an informed choice. A decision made "with blinders on," based on misinformation or a lack of information, cannot be binding as a matter of fundamental fairness and due process. <span class="Italic">Cf. Shubinsky v. United States,</span> 488 F.2d 1003, 1006, 203 Ct. Cl. 199, 204 (1973) (Government's misleading notice of preference-eligible rights and withholding of information concerning plaintiff's right to appeal adverse action entities plaintiff to adjudication on the merits).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since Covington was not informed that a transfer of function had occurred (and actually was informed to the contrary), he had no grounds to believe an appeal of his RIF action might be productive. The agency's additional failure to inform him that a retirement election would preclude a later appeal denied him the right to consider this fact in making his decision. Covington was given a Hobson's choice, that is to say no real choice at all.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Covington also asserts that he was improperly denied a hearing on the issue of the voluntariness of his retirement. The decision of the Fifth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation,</span> 701 F.2d 36 (5th Cir. 1983), is instructive on this point. In that case petitioner received a termination notice which indicated that she could appeal and also either resign or accept involuntary separation and still receive retirement pay. The Fifth Circuit held that the voluntariness of her resignation could not be presumed by virtue of her application for retirement pay, and that petitioner was entitled to a hearing on the issue of the voluntariness of her resignation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Neither the initial reduction-in-force notice from the Agency, however, nor the subsequent letter from the Board requesting jurisdictional argument, informed her of her applicable rights. The Board's regulations furnished her do not show that a voluntary resignation waives the right to appeal the termination action of an agency-employer. Nor does the record indicate that Gonzalez was adequately informed, by the Agency or by the Board, of her applicable rights relative to voluntarily resigning and applying for discontinued employment retirement or, in the alternative, accepting involuntary separation and <span class="Italic">also</span> applying for discontinued employment retirement. In the first instance, she would lose her right to appeal, and in the second, she would not. However, the notice to Gonzalez as a whole indicated that she could <span class="Italic">both</span> appeal and <span class="Italic">also</span> either resign or accept involuntary separation and still receive retirement pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 39.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in <span class="Italic">Gonzalez,</span> the presiding official in the present appeal issued a decision on the merits of the jurisdictional issue, based solely upon the pleadings and written submissions of the parties. This violated procedures required by law that guarantee an employee a hearing on the issue of involuntary retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gratehouse v. United States</span>, 512 F.2d 1104, 1108, 206 Ct. Cl. 288, 296 (1975); <span class="Italic">McCormack v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States,</span> 204 Ct. Cl. 371, 373, 378 (1974). Precedent within the MSPB is also in accord. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Murray v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 1 MSPB 338 (January 17, 1980)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wylie v. USDA</span>, 99 MSPR 71, 74-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12 (2005), presents another example of a discontinued service retirement challenged as constructively adverse because of the agency's failure to provide proper information concerning what amounted to a RIF:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The November 20, 2001 letter that the appellant received from the agency falls woefully short of the regulatory requirements for a RIF notice. It was issued fewer than 60 days before the appellant's expected separation date, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.801(a)(1), and it did not contain, as a RIF notice must, a statement of the appellant's competitive area, competitive level, retention subgroup, service computation date, "the place where <span id="Page_1986"></span>the employee may inspect the regulations and record," or his right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board once the RIF is effected. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.802(a). The letter seems designed to deceive, or at the very least contained inadequate information. The letter created the clear impression that the appellant would be separated involuntarily on January 3, 2002 because his position was slated for elimination, but the letter did not use the words "RIF" or "reduction in force" and did not identify any other legitimate basis for separating the appellant if he did not choose to retire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency denies that the November 20, 2001 letter was a RIF notice leading to the question of just what it was. According to guidance issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), when an agency decides to abolish the position of an employee who meets the age and service requirements for discontinued service retirement, it should advise the employee in writing that: You "may be separated from the service"; "official retention registers will be used to determine your assignment rights in accordance with reduction in force procedures"; "you will receive specific advance notice at least sixty days prior to the effective date of the personnel action to be taken"; you are eligible for discontinued service retirement but "are under no obligation or pressure" to apply for it; and "this is not a reduction in force notice." <span class="Italic">CSRS &#x0026; FERS Handbook</span>, &#x00A7; 44C1.1-1 (ch. 44 at 39); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DeLaet v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 390, 394 (1996) (OPM's <span class="Italic">CSRS &#x0026; FERS Handbook</span> is an authoritative interpretation of employee rights and agency responsibilities under the federal retirement laws). The November 20, 2001 letter did not meet these requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the agency exacted the appellant's decision to accept a discontinued service retirement by threatening to separate him on a date certain. The administrative judge viewed the appellant's decision to retire as a voluntary choice between the unpleasant alternatives of retiring or "litigat[ing] the agency's inevitable termination action by RIF," but in fact the agency did not provide the appellant with either a RIF notice or the information that OPM says should be provided to a retirement-eligible employee when the agency is attempting to avoid a RIF. On this record, it appears that the appellant's decision to accept discontinued service retirement was involuntary because it was made "with blinders on," that is, without adequate information that the agency should have given him. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 943 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 620, 626 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Jones v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 306, 311 (1994), to hold that the agency's failure to advise the appellant about his RIF rights was excusable, but <span class="Italic">Jones</span> was a very different case. In <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, the appellant retired during the Postal Service's 1992-93 restructuring. Although it was later determined by the Board that the Postal Service should have followed OPM's RIF rules, <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 345, 347-48 (1993), at the time of the restructuring the Postal Service could have reasonably believed, based on its quasi-independent status and the fact that a large portion of its workforce was not covered by civil service rules, that it did not need to follow OPM RIF procedures. Accordingly, the Postal Service was not required to inform retirement-eligible employees about their RIF rights during the 1992-93 restructuring. <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. at 311-12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, by contrast, the agency (Forest Service) does not have any special status outside the executive branch, nor is there any indication that the appellant's competitive-service Archaeologist position was not covered by the civil service rules. Simply put, the agency could not have reasonably believed that if the appellant did not retire, it could nevertheless separate him involuntarily without running a RIF, offering him a directed reassignment and having him decline it, or taking some other legally-authorized action. Indeed, if the administrative judge was right in observing that the appellant's RIF separation was "inevitable" if he did not retire, then plainly <span class="Italic">Jones</span> does not control because in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> agency officials reasonably believed that they could restructure without running a RIF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On this record, then, it appears that the appellant retired after the agency provided him with information that the agency knew or should have known was inadequate. This amounts to a non-frivolous allegation that the appellant's retirement was involuntary, which<span class="Italic"></span> under the facts alleged also amounts to a non-frivolous allegation that the agency should have informed him of his right to file an appeal with the Board claiming that he was constructively removed. In this way, jurisdiction and timeliness are intertwined. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 583, 586-87 (1995) (jurisdiction and timeliness were intertwined, precluding a disposition on timeliness alone, where the agency failed to advise an employee of his appeal rights upon retirement but under the circumstances should have so advised him; an individual who should have been advised of his appeal rights but was not has no duty to exercise due diligence in attempting to discover those rights, but instead must act reasonably promptly only after discovering his potential right of appeal from an alleged constructive removal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board applies <span class="Italic">Covington</span> and <span class="Italic">Scharf</span> to require an agency to avoid actively misleading an employee, and to require the agency to advise the employee of an error it knew or should have known the employee was making in his reliance upon retirement-related information. But the employee is expected to read retirement forms, front and back, to determine benefit eligibility. The agency's responsibility to correct an employee error that was not the result of improper advice from the agency does not extend to a searching inquiry concerning the employee's actions leading to retirement; the agency is required only to attempt to correct erroneous impressions or actions of the employee that come to the attention of agency personnel specialists<span class="Italic">.

VA</span>, 31 MSPR 592, 592-93 n.1 (1986) ("Appellant may have wished to appeal to the Board and may have been unaware that if he retired, he could not appeal, but the record shows that he did not request information on his appeal rights.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant provides an undisputed statement sworn under penalty of perjury that the agency misrepresented his eligibility for a discontinued service annuity.

U.S. Postal Service,</span> 3 MSPB 308, 3 MSPR 211, 214 (1980). Thus, under the Board's regulations, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115, this evidence is admissible and will be considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant did not argue below that his retirement was involuntary as a result of not receiving the discontinued service annuity, he did express his belief generally that he was not adequately informed regarding his rights and options during the agency's reorganization. The appellant's statements also indicate that he made his decision to retire based on the information he received from the agency, in a context where he had a limited amount of time to make that choice (if he wanted to exercise the special retirement option offered by the agency).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's allegation of misrepresentation concerning a discontinued service annuity has two premises: (1) That based on the agency's statements, he reasonably believed that he was eligible for a discontinued service annuity and applied for it; and, (2) that in fact he was not eligible for such a retirement. Although the record is void of any documentation demonstrating that the agency advised the appellant that he was eligible for a discontinued service annuity, the appellant argued below, as he argues now, that the agency encouraged his retirement and offered him a discontinued service annuity with a lump-sum benefit if he retired by October 15, 1993. The agency has not challenged or denied the appellant's assertions, either below or on petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Misleading statements upon which an employee reasonably relied to his detriment are sufficient to render an action involuntary<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this instance, if the agency offered the appellant a discontinued service annuity with lump-sum benefits in exchange for his retirement by October 15, 1993, the appellant's reliance upon such an offer would have been reasonable. However, because it appears that the appellant was not eligible for a discontinued service annuity, since he met the requirements for an immediate optional retirement, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8336(a), (d), such an offer could reasonably have misled him. While the agency may not have intended to mislead the appellant regarding his retirement options, the appellant is not required to show that the agency had such an intent in order to establish that his retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Covington</span>, 750 F.2d at 942. Because the appellant has indicated throughout the appeal process that his decision to retire was influenced by the incentive of a discontinued service annuity with its lump-sum benefit, we find that he has raised a nonfrivolous allegation that he had inadequate and incorrect <span id="Page_1987"></span>information upon which to make an informed decision. Hence, we find that the appellant has raised a nonfrivolous allegation of an involuntary retirement based on misinformation by the agency concerning his eligibility for a discontinued service annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee's disappointment in not securing a discontinued service annuity did not make his FERS early retirement involuntary.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8414(b), an employee who, among other things, is "separated from the service involuntarily," except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency, after becoming 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service, is entitled to an annuity. OPM's regulations similarly provide that an employee who "separates from the service involuntarily" after becoming age 50 and completing 20 years of service is entitled to an annuity. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.206(a). In the context of the Civil Service Retirement System version of the above statute, which is set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d) and which is substantially similar to section 8414(b), the Board's reviewing court has held that the type of involuntary separation to which the statute speaks is one that results from a lawful agency action, rather than a coerced, unlawful separation. <span class="Italic">Nebblett v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 237 F.3d 1353, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as the AJ and the agency found, the appellant was not lawfully involuntarily separated from his position when he decided to retire under the "MRA + 10" provision instead of accepting the offered assignment to Arlington. In fact, the agency had not even <span class="Italic">proposed</span> the appellant's separation at the time the appellant retired; instead, it merely informed him that he would be assigned to the position of Transportation Security Specialist at TSA headquarters at the end of his overseas tour of duty, and that he would be expected to report to work on August 6, 2008. Thus, contrary to the appellant's claims, he did not nonfrivolously allege that he met all of the criteria for a discontinued service retirement, and that the agency therefore provided him with misinformation in this regard upon which he reasonably relied in deciding to retire under the "MRA + 10" provision. The fact that the appellant's choices may have been limited to unpleasant alternatives does not make his decision to retire involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Lawson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 345, 350 (1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Silvestri v. Dept. of Army</span>, 60 MSPR 594, 599-603 (1993), the Board faced the situation of an appellant seeking to rescind his OPM-approved retirement as involuntary because of allegedly misleading or incorrect advice concerning his eligibility for retirement. The Board determined that it could adjudicate the case without joining OPM. The Board decided it would review the representations made by the agency to both the appellant and, apparently, OPM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the appellant's allegation of coercion, his allegation that the agency misrepresented his eligibility to take discontinued service retirement could, if true, provide a basis for a finding of involuntariness. An incorrect representation in this regard would have materially altered the appellant's perceived options in the face of the abolishment of his Physical Scientist position. Instead of having three options--retirement, taking the Space Training position, or separation from the agency--he would have been faced with only two alternatives, separation or taking the Space Training position. The putative detrimental reliance, then, is that the agency may have misled the appellant into selecting discontinued service retirement instead of accepting the Space Training position, when he in fact was not eligible for such retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's allegation of misrepresentation has two premises: That he was in fact not eligible for discontinued service retirement; and that he reasonably believed, based on the agency's statements, that he was eligible for such retirement. Regarding the latter issue, we note that the agency's letter of July 25, 1989 did not specifically advise the appellant that he was eligible for discontinued service retirement. It advised him that he met the age and service requirements and that he was "eligible to apply" for such retirement. We nonetheless conclude that a reasonable person in the appellant's position would have understood that the agency was telling him that he was eligible for such retirement. Lurita Williams, Civilian Personnel Officer, was asked by agency counsel whether she provided the July 25 letter "notifying [the appellant] that he was eligible for discontinued service retirement," and she replied affirmatively, stating that such a letter is "routinely given to those <span class="Italic">who have that entitlement</span>." William McNamee, Chief of the Recruitment and Placement Branch of the Civilian Personnel Office, similarly testified that, before the agency resorts to a reduction in force, it "give[s] a formal notification that the employee <span class="Italic">is entitled to a discontinued service retirement</span> based on the abolishment of their job." In addition, both the agency and the appellant referred to the agency as making the appellant an "offer" of discontinued service retirement. We think that a reasonable person would conclude that the agency would make such an offer only if it believed the employee was entitled to accept it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the question of the appellant's entitlement to discontinued service retirement, an employee meets the age and length of service requirements if he is separated from the service involuntarily, except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct, after completing 25 years of service or after becoming 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service. 5 USC &#x00A7; 8336(d). An employee is not eligible for such retirement, however, if he has declined a reasonable offer of another position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. OPM's implementing regulations specifically provide that an offer of another position is not reasonable unless it is made in writing. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.504(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding "[n]o evidence in the appeal record support[ing] the appellant's claim that he was <span class="Italic">offered</span> continuing employment," the administrative judge cited only the agency's July 25, 1989, letter advising the appellant that his position was being abolished, noting that this letter did not even refer to, much less offer him, the position of Space Training Specialist. The administrative judge should also have considered two other pieces of evidence bearing on this issue. First, Mr. Garrison's July 12, 1989, memorandum to the appellant appears to be a written offer of the Space Training Specialist position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Attached at enclosure 1 is your new job position description: GS-1701-13, Space Training Specialist, Job Number 89223. (The Physical Scientist (Space Training) position: GS 1301-13, Job Number 88369, has been abolished). This action is, in reality, a reassignment for you because of the change in the career field. <span class="Italic">To accept the reassignment you need to sign the SF-52 at CPO [Civilian Personnel Office]</span> <span class="Italic"> or submit a memo to CPO, stating your acceptance</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Mr. Tovar stated twice on cross examination that the Space Training position was offered to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision also failed to address three other issues relating to the appellant's eligibility for discontinued service retirement. First, according to OPM's guidance in the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), a separation does not qualify for discontinued service retirement if an employee refuses or fails to accept a directed reassignment to another position in the same commuting area. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Supp. 830-1 &#x00A7; 44A2.1-1 (Oct. 1989). We note in this regard that the July 12 memorandum from Mr. Garrison to the appellant, in addition to giving the appellant a deadline by which to accept a reassignment to the Space Training position, informed him that "[r]efusal to accept the reassignment will result in a management directed reassignment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the FPM provides that an employee does not qualify for discontinued service retirement unless he receives a specific written notice that informs him that he faces involuntary separation from his position or from Federal service, specifies the reason for the proposed action, and states the date the proposed action is to be effective. FPM Supp. 830-1 &#x00A7; 44A2.1-1. We note that the July 25, 1989, agency notice did not inform the appellant that he faced involuntary separation or state the date on which the abolishment of his position would be effective.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, the FPM provides that there is no job abolishment for discontinued service retirement purposes when there is no material change in official job responsibilities and duties, and (1) the position has merely been redescribed, (2) a paperwork transaction eliminates one position and creates another, or (3) there is only a change in title and/or series. FPM Supp. 830-1, &#x00A7; 44A2.1-4. There was a question of the applicability of this provision in light of the similarity between the Physical Scientist and Space Training positions involved in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we thus find that the administrative judge did not consider all of the pertinent issues and evidence that were before him, we do not believe it would be appropriate for us to resolve these issues at this time. First, resolution of these issues may require credibility determinations that must be made by the administrative judge. Second, we believe that the Office of Personnel Management, which approved the appellant's <span id="Page_1988"></span>application for discontinued service retirement, should have the opportunity to submit evidence and argument relating to the appellant's present contention that he was not legally entitled to that benefit. We do not believe, however, that resolution of the appellant's eligibility for retirement will necessarily entail a remand of the case to OPM. Although the Board has jurisdiction to adjudicate an individual's rights and interests under the retirement laws only when OPM has rendered a reconsideration decision on the issue in question, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 11 MSPR 562, 565 n.1 (1982), the instant appeal does not involve a direct adjudication of the appellant's entitlement to discontinued service retirement. We consider his eligibility for such retirement only for the limited purpose of determining whether the Appellant's retirement must be rescinded as involuntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lematta v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 22 MSPR 18, 20 n.2 (1984) (the Board's determination of the voluntariness of a resignation or retirement for purposes of Board jurisdiction is separate and distinct from OPM's determination of whether an individual has been involuntarily separated for retirement purposes).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ultimately, the Board sustained Silvestri's appeal from his involuntary retirement. The agency misinformed the appellant concerning his entitlement to discontinued service retirement because the agency made an offer of continued employment to the appellant prior to his retirement, leaving him ineligible for a discontinued service annuity. <span class="Italic">Silvestri v. Dept. of Army</span>, 60 MSPR 580, 584 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a D.C. Circuit decision, <span class="Italic">Keyes v. District of Columbia</span>, 372 F.2d 434, 440-41 (D.C. Cir. 2004), although the court relied on decisions not involving federal civil servants, the court emphasized general knowledge of personnel issues by the employee, the presence of counsel to the employee, and the period of time that the employee had to consider the option of a retirement that was apparently represented by the agency as a status that would not preclude the employee's use of internal appellate proceedings to challenge the termination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Her alternative misrepresentation theory ultimately fares no better. Like the decision of the district court, our analysis is guided by <span class="Italic">Stone v. University of Maryland Medical System Corp.,</span> 855 F.2d 167 (4th Cir. 1988). There the Fourth Circuit held that "a resignation may be deemed involuntary if induced by the employee's reasonable reliance on her employer's misrepresentation of a material fact concerning the resignation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 174; <span class="Italic">see Scharf v. Dept. of the Air Force,</span> 710 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The court rejected the argument that the resignation of the Chief of the Division of General Surgery at a state university hospital was involuntary as a result of university officials' misrepresentation that they could immediately expel him from the hospital's medical staff if he did not resign on the spot<span class="Italic">. Stone,</span> 855 F.2d at 171, 176. The court held that no reasonable jury could find that Stone had reasonably relied on this threat in resigning, because, as a sophisticated, well-educated doctor with three decades of service at teaching hospitals, where he had supervised numerous medical staff members, he was familiar with hospital bylaws, which precluded such summary actions<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. He could not have reasonably resigned without consulting them, and because his reliance on the university officials' misrepresentations was therefore unreasonable, his resignation could not be deemed involuntary<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Keyes proffered evidence that she was told by a District government personnel specialist that she could retire and continue to fight the charges against her. The specialist also told her she would be off the payroll after the fifteen day notice period. Furthermore, Director Graham's letter stated that Ms. Keyes was being given only fifteen days' notice of her proposed termination, even though in Ms. Keyes' experience thirty days was the norm. These misrepresentations are material because they concern the consequences of her resignation or the alternatives thereto<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 174; <span class="Italic">Covington v. Dept. of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984). But assuming the truth of these claimed misrepresentations, for the first two of which we must rely exclusively on Ms. Keyes' declaration that fails to describe adequately the context in which the specialist's advice was given, the district court correctly concluded, on the record at hand, that no reasonable jury could find that Ms. Keyes was misled. She had received written notice of the proposal to remove her and of her right to administrative review of that proposal; she was represented by private counsel; and, after meeting with the personnel specialist, she had nearly a week to decide whether to retire before the earliest date on which her termination could have become effective. Under the circumstances, Ms. Keyes could not have reasonably relied on the incorrect statements. Like the supervising physician in <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> Ms. Keyes was in an unusually good position to know that the information could not be correct. She had been a District government employee for twenty-seven years, had served in senior positions for most of that time supervising numerous employees, and was knowledgeable about personnel rules. Critically, she was also represented by private counsel, whom she does not claim was unfamiliar with District personnel laws, and who could advise her on such matters, including any personnel issues with which she might be unfamiliar. Additionally, after receiving the notice and speaking with the personnel specialist, she had ample time--fifteen and six days, respectively--to confirm the accuracy of the information. A person in Ms. Keyes' position could not reasonably be misled by the misinformation. If, as she claims, she was confused, she should not have resigned on the basis of the representations without verifying them with her attorney or perhaps even with the decisionmakers or the regulations themselves.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Keyes relies on <span class="Italic">Cocome v. District of Columbia Lottery and Charitable Games Control Board,</span> 560 A.2d 547 (D.C. 1989), for the proposition that, where an employee is misled about her rights, her retirement must be deemed involuntary. In <span class="Italic">Cocome,</span> the court was reviewing an agency action under the plainly erroneous standard, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 550, which is a more deferential standard than <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review. Nothing in <span class="Italic">Cocome</span> raised serious doubts about the reasonableness of the employee's reliance on his supervisor's misrepresentations. Mr. Cocome, who at the time of his retirement was Chief of the Charitable Games Division of the Lottery Board, had worked for the District government for less than two years, was not well-acquainted with its personnel rules, had inadequate time--less than one day--to verify his supervisor's representations and to consider whether to resign, and consulted counsel who was unfamiliar with District of Columbia personnel law and who, because of the short time period, was unable to consult with the relevant decisionmakers or gain access to pertinent materials<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 548-49. Given Ms. Keyes' very different circumstances, her reliance on <span class="Italic">Cocome</span> is misplaced and does not support her claim that her employer's misrepresentations rendered her resignation involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, because Ms. Keyes has failed to present a material issue of disputed fact that her retirement was involuntary, either as a result of duress or her employer's misrepresentations, and because the court declines to resolve her belated contentions that her other claims do not hinge on the voluntariness of her retirement, we affirm the grant of summary judgment for the District and Director Graham.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Advice of counsel figured into the analysis of <span class="Italic">Nguyen v. MSPB</span>, 646 Fed. Appx. 980, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, Ms. Nguyen argues that she was not properly informed that her decision to retire would terminate her appeal rights, and thus her decision to retire was involuntary. In general, an agency is not required to inform an employee about the ramifications of voluntary decisions, such as the decision to retire or resign. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dep't of Agric.,</span> 832 F.2d 1259, 1261 (Fed. Cir. 1987). However, "[a] resignation or retirement is involuntary if it is obtained by agency misinformation or deception." <span class="Italic">Covington v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Thus, when an agency has affirmatively misled an employee, by providing inaccurate information or by failing to correct inaccurate information regarding the employee's rights, the resulting action may be involuntary. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. But Ms. Nguyen does not allege that the agency here gave her incorrect information. Rather she argues that her emails indicated that she (incorrectly) believed that she could still appeal after retiring and that the agency misled her by not correcting her error. This allegation, however, is not supported by evidence. Ms. Nguyen's emails do not indicate that she believed she could still appeal after voluntarily retiring. Rather, in the emails, Ms. Nguyen stated that she was considering different options, writing that she "intend[ed] to file an appeal and/or an EEO complaint," but that she was "also considering retiring immediately in order to avoid having [her] record damaged." Moreover, the emails indicate that Ms. Nguyen was represented by counsel, who presumably could have correctly counseled her on the ramifications of deciding to retire. Ms. Nguyen's allegations of deception are not non-frivolous.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although many involuntary retirement appeals involve affirmative misstatements, the agency's duty goes beyond the avoidance of affirmative misstatement. In <span class="Italic">Wills v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 137, 141-42 (1988), the appellant retired after receiving notice of a proposed removal for poor performance. He learned after his retirement that his personnel file had been annotated with a statement that he retired after receiving the proposal notice. He claimed that his retirement was involuntary because he had not known that adverse information would be made part of his OPF. He was entitled to a hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that, although <span class="Italic">Covington</span> and <span class="Italic">Scharf</span> involved affirmative misrepresentation by agencies, they require an agency to provide information that is correct in nature and adequate in scope to allow an employee to make an informed choice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kolstad v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the appellant alleged that he thought that he could preserve his clean record if he retired and that he did not find out until after his retirement was effective about the notation on the SF-50. Contrary to the finding by the administrative judge, the appellant did not have to allege that he was affirmatively misinformed or that he <span id="Page_1989"></span>specifically spoke to agency officials about whether the notation would appear on the SF-50.

His belief was based on the Employee Relations Specialist's statements that a retirement before any removal took effect would be processed as a normal retirement and on her failure to mention that even if the appellant retired, his records would show that he retired after receiving a notice of removal. We find that the Employee Relations Specialist's failure to provide that information even though the appellant made it clear to her that a clean record was of great importance to him, was a material omission of fact that deprived the appellant of the opportunity to make an informed choice between retiring and facing removal. <span class="Italic">See Baldwin</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 586, &#x00B6; 44 (noting that the SF-52 erroneously stated that the appellant retired when the agency processed his separation as a resignation); <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 325, &#x00B6; 19 (finding a lack of information concerning the appellant's reduction-in-force appeal rights if he decided to accept a downgrade rather than retire); <span class="Italic">Wills v. Department of the Navy</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 137, 141 (1988) (noting a lack of information concerning whether the appellant would have a clean record if he retired). Therefore, we conclude that the appellant's decision to retire was the product of misinformation and was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The failure of an agency to provide an appellant with timely and complete information about retirement options during a reorganization may justify a jurisdictional hearing, <span class="Italic">Barnett v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 125, 128-29 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board's inquiry focuses not on whether an employee was intentionally deceived about his options but on whether the information provided by the agency was not only correct in nature but adequate in scope to allow him to make an informed decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant did not argue below that his retirement was involuntary as a result of misinformation, his submissions, if true, generally express his belief that he was not adequately informed regarding what his rights and options were during the agency's reorganization. They also indicate his belief that he made his decision to retire based on this information in a context where he had a very limited amount of time to make that choice, if he wanted to exercise the special retirement option offered by the agency. Taken together with our decision in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> these submissions raise the issue of whether the appellant had adequate time and information to make an informed decision regarding whether or not he should retire, because he apparently did not know what his appeal rights were during the agency's reorganization and made his decision without that information. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barthel</span>, 38 MSPR at 253; <span class="Italic">Gettings v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Even without imputing constructive knowledge to Moon, however, we would arrive at the same result: a finding of involuntary retirement, based on the agency's non-conveyance of information which it already had, and policies which it had already formulated, by the relevant date. <span class="Italic">See Covington v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed.

The misleading information can be negligently or even innocently provided; if the employee materially relies on such misinformation to his detriment, based on an objective evaluation of the surrounding circumstances, his retirement is considered involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Covington</span>, 750 F.2d at 942; <span class="Italic">Barnett v. United States Postal Service,</span> 59 MSPR 125, 129 (1993).

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this matter, and in the context of the above case law, the record reflects that on Friday, November 20, 1992, the last day of the buyout nationwide, the agency had information crucial to the appellant's decision to retire, and it had the means to disseminate such information in timely fashion. Unlike situations in which the agency knew no more than the appellant did, <span class="Italic">see Gaudette v. Department of Transportation</span>, 32 MSPR 375, 378-79, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 832 F.2d 1256, 1258 (Fed. Cir. 1987), here the agency did in fact have more information than the appellant did, and Moon knew that the information was pertinent to exactly those concerns on which the appellant based his decision to retire: layoff and benefits protection for PCES executives. The record reflects that the agency knew, as of the critical date, that it was extending protection in those areas to PCES employees, yet it did not provide that information to the appellant, who was in the process of relying on it on the last day designated by the agency for him to act. We therefore sustain the administrative judge's ruling that the agency failed to fulfill its obligation to provide the appellant information that was adequate in scope to allow him to make an informed decision, and that that failure rendered his decision to retire involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the record thus reflects that lack of information rendered the appellant's retirement involuntary, we need not reach the agency's argument that its lump-sum incentive for retiring was not coercive, but was merely an "unpleasant choice."...</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Suggestions to an appellant that his job was in definite jeopardy and that he had to accept retirement by a certain date to obtain a retirement incentive were sufficient to cast the retirement as a constructive adverse action when the agency's representations concerning the appellant's job status were incorrect, <span class="Italic">Murray v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In his appeal filed November 26, 1994, the appellant asserted that he is a preference-eligible employee who retired involuntarily from the EAS-24 position of Tour Superintendent of Mails, Chicago Postal Facility, effective October 30, 1992, during the agency's 1992 nationwide restructuring. In support of his claim of involuntary retirement, the appellant contended that the agency informed him before he retired that his position would be abolished, that he relied on that information in deciding to retire, and that he later learned that his position had not been abolished.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant's decision to retire was not merely a choice between unpleasant alternatives, but rather constituted a choice between false alternatives. That is to say, given the deadline imposed by the agency for election of the early-out option, the appellant could not have awaited the purported abolition of his position and then made a decision to retire or not to retire under the early-out option; rather, he was compelled by the manner in which the agency structured the early-out option to make his retirement decision in reliance on statements allegedly made by agency officials that his position definitely would be abolished after the early-out-option period had expired. The appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that he detrimentally relied on incorrect statements by the agency in making his decision to retire, and that his retirement was therefore involuntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleged that: (1) He based his decision to retire on Ms. Cave's statement to him that his Mechanical Engineering Technician position would be abolished; and that (2) he subsequently learned that this position was not abolished, but was given to Mr. William A.

We find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that he detrimentally relied on materially incorrect statements by the agency in making his decision to retire, and that his retirement was therefore involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Body-Text">If an employee applies for retirement based on misleading information from his employer and the employee is placed on leave for the period beginning with his separation from the service until the restoration to service that follows disapproval of the retirement application, the leave status may constitute a constructive suspension, <span class="Italic">Chichowski v. FEMA</span>, 72 MSPR 474, 475-79 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following facts are undisputed. In a March 23, 1995 memorandum to all of its employees, the agency announced that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had approved its request for an "Agency-wide Voluntary Early Retirement Authority." As explained in the March 23 memorandum, to have been eligible for the early retirement option, an employee must, as of the effective date of retirement, have had "20 years of creditable service and have reached 50 years of age; or, [have had] 25 years of credible [sic] service regardless of age." On May 5, 1995, the appellant applied to OPM for an immediate retirement annuity under the early-option retirement authority. The appellant separated from the agency effective June 5, 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM disallowed the appellant's application, finding that he did not meet the age and service requirements for retirement on the date of his separation. OPM considered the appellant's retirement to have been erroneous, and it advised the agency "to restore [him] to its rolls retroactively, and to determine the amount of any back pay [he] may be entitled to receive."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency returned the appellant to duty effective October 6, 1995, and placed him in leave without pay (LWOP) status for the period June 5 through October 5, 1995. The appellant requested that the agency grant him administrative leave with back pay for the period June 5 through October 5, 1995, on the ground that it "mistakenly advised [him that he] was eligible for retirement." The agency determined that the appellant's retirement was voluntary and not induced by misinformation, and it denied his request for back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant asserts that information provided to him by the agency before he retired led him to believe that he met the age and service requirements for an immediate annuity....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bannister v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question therefore is whether the appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations of an involuntary retirement and a constructive suspension so as to entitle him to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994). In determining whether the appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations of the Board's jurisdiction, we will consider the agency's submissions, but, to the extent the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, we will not weigh the evidence and resolve the conflicting assertions of the parties. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The April 3, 1996 letter from OPM states that the appellant "needed 20 years of creditable service to qualify for early-optional retirement when [he] separated on June 5, 1995," but that, as of that date, he had only nineteen years and eight months of creditable service, including credit for military furlough periods not exceeding six months in each calendar year. The letter notes that the appellant was on military furloughs during the periods August 4, 1977, through August 23, 1981, and April 3, 1982, through September 25, 1983. According to the letter, full retirement credit could not be allowed for these periods of military furlough because the appellant was receiving military retired pay which bars such credit. Thus, in computing the amount of the appellant's creditable service, OPM credited him with no more than six months of service in each of the calendar years when he was on military furlough.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the appellant's pre-retirement request for annuity information, the agency sent him an April 25, 1995 memorandum transmitting its estimate of his Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) annuity. The estimate showed that the appellant had over thirty-six years of CSRS service credit, including more than nineteen-and-one-half years of military service. Included in the "Remarks" section of the estimate was a statement that "[a]ll active duty military service has been credit [sic];...retired military pay must be waived and a deposit plus interest, is required for military service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency subsequently provided the appellant with a revised annuity estimate dated May 1, 1995. In contrast to the April 25, 1995 estimate, the May 1 estimate showed that the appellant had only twenty-two years of CSRS service credit, including approximately five-and-one-half years of military service. The "Remarks" section of the May 1 estimate did not include a statement regarding military service, nor did it contain a reference to any requirement that retired military pay must be waived in order to receive credit for military service. The appellant declared that based on the "new information" provided in the May 1, 1995 document, which stated nothing about waiving military pay, he decided to retire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's submissions show that the final information provided to him by the agency (the May 1, 1995 estimate) did not mention any requirement that he needed to waive his retired military pay to receive credit for his periods of military service, nor did it state that he would not receive full credit for his military furloughs. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that information provided to him by the agency in the May 1, 1995 estimate was misleading, and that he relied to his detriment on that information. Moreover, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that, upon his return to duty from his erroneous retirement, the agency placed him in LWOP status without his consent. Accordingly, we find that the appellant is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing on his claims of involuntary retirement and constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See Bannister</span>, 42 MSPR at 367-68.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...He contended below that his decision to retire had been forced by the inability of agency officials to "assure" him that he would still occupy a position after the reorganization and by a general lack of information about the placement process. Regarding the 1992 reorganization, however, the Board has held that an appellant's awareness that the agency was in the process of restructuring and that his future placement was uncertain does not suffice to make his decision to retire involuntary, since he could have resolved the uncertainty by waiting to determine how the reorganization would ultimately affect him. <span class="Italic">See Bissett v.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Willis v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 433, 439-40 (1993), the appellant retired when he learned that he was to be removed for poor performance. The question before the Board was whether the retirement mooted an adverse action appeal (a topic discussed in Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-117.html#sec2-115">Mootness of Appeal</a>"). Vice Chairman Amador offered a concurring opinion, stating that if the performance-based removal appeal was beyond the Board's jurisdiction because the retirement preceded a Chapter 43 removal, the appellant should have the opportunity to demonstrate that the retirement was involuntary. The agency had not explained to the appellant that he might lose his right to appeal to the Board from the Chapter 43 action if the retirement preceded removal, but that he would retain the right to challenge the removal if his retirement followed his removal by at least a day. The Board offered its (majority) opinion discussing misstatements and omissions in the involuntary retirement appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the decisions cited in the concurring opinion is <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Although that decision supports the proposition that agency misinformation may cause a retirement to be involuntary, a failure to provide information does not qualify as misinformation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937 (Fed. Cir. 1984), is cited in the concurring opinion for the proposition that "the crucial inquiry is whether the appellant made an informed choice," and for the proposition that a "decision made 'with blinders on,' based on misinformation or a lack of information, cannot be binding as a matter of fundamental fairness and due process." The decision does support those statements. One of the bases for the court's finding that the employee's retirement (in the face of a separation by reduction in force) was involuntary was that the employee had not been informed that a transfer of function had occurred, and that he therefore had no grounds for believing an appeal of a separation by reduction in force might be "productive." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Covington</span>, 750 F.2d at 943. In relying on this failure, however, the court pointed out that the employee "actually was informed to the contrary," i.e., the agency told him that there had been no transfer of function. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Furthermore, although the court also stated that the "agency's additional failure to inform [the employee] that a retirement election would preclude a later appeal denied him the right to consider this fact in making his decision," <span class="Italic">id</span>., this does not appear to be a major basis for the court's conclusion that the appellant was "given a Hobson's choice, that is to say no real choice at all." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. That failure is mentioned briefly in a single sentence near the end of the analysis, while the agency's incorrect denial that there had been a transfer of function that could have given the employee a right to another job is mentioned repeatedly in the decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 939-43. The agency's failure to provide information about the effect of the employee's retirement apparently became significant only in light of the misinformation the agency provided.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Army</span>, 44 MSPR 449 (1990), is cited in the concurring opinion for the proposition that "the Board has found that an agency is required to provide information that is not only correct in nature but adequate in scope to allow an employee to make an informed decision." The concurring opinion also indicates that, in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, "the Board specifically noted that this includes an obligation to correct any erroneous information that the agency has reason to know that the appellant is relying on." Again, the cited decision supports the propositions for which it is cited. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 44 MSPR at 451. It does not indicate, however, that an agency has an obligation to correct erroneous information absent "reason to know that the appellant is relying on" that misinformation, and there appears to be no indication in the present appeal that the agency knew the appellant misunderstood his appeal rights. Most likely, the agency assumed the appellant's decision to retire was, in effect, a decision to give up his appeal right in return for a relatively clean record, an end to his job-related problems, and an annuity. This would seem to be a reasonable assumption.</p>

Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 58 MSPR 579, 583 (1993). A retirement is deemed involuntary not only when owing to an affirmative misrepresentation, but also when it results from the agency's failure to correct erroneous information that it has a reason to know an employee is relying on. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Nicoletti v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Justice,</span> 60 MSPR 244, 247-248 (1993) (whether the appellant put the agency on notice that he viewed his demotion as involuntary generally implicates the issue of the timeliness of his subsequent appeal, not the Board's jurisdiction over the demotion).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant alleges that the agency was aware that he considered his retirement to be involuntary, and that therefore it was obligated to inform him that his retirement would prevent him from appealing the RIF action. The appellant cites to the fact that he wrote "Job abolishment-RIF" on his SF-52 form, and that his SF-50 uses the same language to describe the reason for his "resignation." However, the Board has found that such notations, of themselves, do not render a retirement involuntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bravman v. Department of the Navy</span>, 26 MSPR 169, 172-73 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also cites to testimony from agency witnesses indicating that they knew the appellant was leaving his position involuntarily. This testimony is consistent, however, with the theory, asserted by these same witnesses, that the appellant, in retiring rather than being separated under the RIF, was simply choosing between unpleasant alternatives. In any case, such evidence falls far short of establishing either that the agency knew the appellant intended to appeal his RIF action, or that he misunderstood the effect his retirement would have on his appeal rights. For example, in <span class="Italic">Drummonds</span>, relied upon as support by the appellant, the Board found that an employee's resignation was involuntary where he notified the agency in writing that he intended to appeal his demotion action at the time he tendered his resignation, thereby alerting the agency that he was relying upon erroneous information regarding his appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Drummonds,</span> 58 MSPR at 584.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, by contrast, Lisa Johnson (Johnson), the agency's employee relations specialist, testified that the appellant never discussed appealing the RIF action. Although the appellant initially stated that "I believe I told [Johnson] on each occasion when I met her that I intended to appeal the job abolishment," he contradicts this testimony in his petition for review: "[T]he Appellant had no reason to discuss his appeal rights with Ms. Johnson, as the RIF notice was clear as to the fact that the Appellant had appeal rights to the Board." From this evidence, we conclude that the administrative judge acted within her discretion in crediting the agency's testimony over the appellant's as to this point. Accordingly, we find that the agency had no reason to know that the appellant intended to appeal his RIF action subsequent to retiring, and that therefore it was under no obligation to disabuse him of this notion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1992"></span>Based on the agency's own evidence and argument regarding the appellant's motivation for retiring, we find that the appellant reasonably relied upon misleading statements to his detriment, however. The agency asserts that "[t]he Administrative Judge correctly found that Respondent 'retired rather than face a removal pursuant to a RIF and lose health benefits.'" It is undisputed that the appellant lacked the requisite five consecutive years of service in a health benefits plan prior to his retirement, as prescribed under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8905(b). Johnson testified that she advised the appellant to retire before the effective date of the RIF in order to ensure that he would obtain a waiver of this requirement, allowing him to carry his health coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program (FEHBP) into retirement. Johnson conceded, however, that it was possible for the appellant to obtain such a waiver following separation by RIF, a fact of which the agency should have been aware. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 890.108, setting forth the considerations the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will apply in acting on waiver requests. Indeed, OPM, in exercising its discretion to waive the 5-year requirement, explained that the appellant was prevented from meeting the requirement by circumstances beyond his control, a factor which was based on the abolishment of his position during the RIF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Misleading statements upon which an employee reasonably relied to his detriment are sufficient to render an action involuntary<span class="Italic">. See Moriarty v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 47 MSPR 280, 287 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 989 F.2d 1202 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table). Further, the agency need not be aware that the statements were misleading, but may instead have provided them to the employee negligently or innocently<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the agency expressly affirms that the appellant's decision to retire prior to the effective date of the RIF was strongly influenced by his perception, engendered by the agency's official, that such an election was necessary to preserve his health benefits. Regardless of any other advantages or disadvantages of so electing, this advice was clearly misleading.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant's decision to retire was not voluntary, and that the appellant is entitled to a hearing on his appeal of the RIF action, and on his claim of age discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Young v. OPM</span>, 72 MSPR 146, 148 (1996) (although the Board lacked jurisdiction over OPM's determination of the appellant's eligibility for continued health plan enrollment, the appellant could appeal from a retirement entered on the strength of the employer's representations concerning eligibility for continued health plan coverage).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most of the foregoing decisions depend on either an affirmative misstatement from an agency or a failure of the agency to correct an appellant's known erroneous understanding of his rights. If the appellant, without requesting clarification, makes a unilateral error, e.g., concerning the date of his eligibility for retirement, the agency will not likely be held to have deceived the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lematta v. DHHS</span>, 22 MSPR 18, 20 (1984). An unfounded belief by the appellant concerning his retirement eligibility does not serve to invalidate the retirement if the agency did not contribute to that belief, <span class="Italic">Holser v. Dept. of Army</span>, 77 MSPR 92, 95-96 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant is alleging that, notwithstanding his stated reason for his resignation on the SF-50 form, his resignation was involuntary on the basis of misinformation concerning his disability retirement options, he has not alleged that, prior to his resignation on July 1, 1994, the agency misinformed him that he had to resign before he could be eligible for disability retirement. Rather, his allegation concerns his <span class="Italic">belief</span> that this was the case. Thus, the appellant has not raised a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness on the basis of misinformation provided by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Scharf v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1574-75 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (a retirement action is involuntary if the agency made misleading statements upon which the employee reasonably relied to his detriment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant is alleging that his resignation was involuntary because he did not have adequate time and information to make an informed decision whether or not he should resign, the appellant states that the agency provided him with forms concerning disability retirement in December 1993, and that 6 months later, in June 1994, he signed a form to request his resignation, setting July 1, 1994 as the effective date. The appellant has not alleged that he was under any time constraint at the time he signed his request for resignation or during the period preceding the effective date of his resignation. Nor has the appellant alleged that prior to his resignation he notified the agency that he needed specific information to make an informed resignation decision, let alone that the agency had this information before he resigned but neglected to give it to him. Therefore, the appellant has not raised a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness on the basis of inadequate time and information. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 MSPR 620, 627-28 (1995) (where the agency had more information than the employee at the time of his retirement, and the employee had indicated that such information was critical to his decision to retire, the agency's nonconveyance of such information prevented the employee from making an informed decision and his retirement was therefore involuntary); <span class="Italic">Barnett v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 59 MSPR 125, 129 (1993) (allegations that the employee was not adequately informed regarding his rights and options during the agency's reorganization and that he made his decision to retire based on this information in a context where he had a very limited amount of time to make that choice, if he wanted to exercise the special retirement option offered by the agency, constituted a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If allegedly incorrect information comes from a union representative, under <span class="Italic">Morris v. NASA</span>, AT-0752-15-0015-I-1 (NP 8/19/2015), the error is not attributed to the agency to invalidate a retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further agree with the administrative judge's assessment that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness based on a theory of agency misinformation or deception. On review, the appellant emphasizes alleged "failed promises" and actions by his union. The appellant, however, must show that his agency's improper actions forced his retirement. <span class="Italic">See Green v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 59, &#x00B6; 9 (2009) (finding that the union representative was not a representative of the agency and her acts could not be imputed to the agency for purposes of determining whether the appellant's resignation was involuntary); <span class="Italic">see also Scharf v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (stating that "a resignation will be held involuntary if obtained by agency misrepresentation or deception"). The appellant has not alleged a valid reason for attributing any union-provided misinformation or union action to the agency for purposes of determining whether the agency had subjected him to an appealable adverse action. <span class="Italic">Cf. Danelishen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 376, 380 (1990) (finding that the appellant failed to establish jurisdiction over his resignation based on bare allegations of collusion and conspiracy among the agency, an arbitrator, and the union). The Board, moreover, lacks jurisdiction over a claim of a union's breach of its duty of fair representation or other claim regarding the operation of the grievance process. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Berry v. Department of Justice</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 676, 678 (1986). We agree with the administrative judge that the alleged statements of agency officials, even if proven, could not establish that the agency improperly compelled his retirement through misrepresentation, coercion, or duress.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Halterman v. USDA</span>, DC-0752-17-0081-I-1 (NP 1/26/2023) ("A retirement action is involuntary if the agency made misleading statements upon which the employee reasonably relied to his detriment. <span class="Italic">Miller v.

VA</span>, AT-0752-16-0353-I-1 (NP 7/20/2016) ("The appellant asserted below that the union informed her that she might lose her retirement benefits if the agency terminated her. The administrative judge found that, while it appeared that the appellant may have been given incorrect information, that misinformation was not provided to her by the agency. Although the appellant asserts again on review that she was laboring under misinformation when she decided to retire, she has not disputed the administrative judge's finding that the agency did not provide the misinformation.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An incomplete or inaccurate estimate of retirement benefits supplied by the agency was not sufficient to make retirement involuntary when the lack of information did not lead to detrimental reliance, <span class="Italic">Roll v. VA</span>, AT-0752-14-0612-I-1 (NP 7/28/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Prior to retiring, the appellant received two CSRS benefit estimate reports from the agency that projected his future retirement annuities. The later CSRS benefit estimate report is dated 5 days prior to the effective date of the appellant's retirement, and it projected that his gross monthly annuity would be $2,594.03.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequent to retiring, however, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) informed the appellant that his gross monthly annuity would be offset by an additional $215.00, which represented the monthly social security benefit he would receive. The appellant objected to the offset and raised his concerns with several government agencies and officials, and he ultimately filed an appeal with the Board raising an involuntary retirement claim based on agency misinformation. Following a hearing, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the appellant failed to establish that, under the totality of the circumstances, he relied on agency misinformation to his detriment. In reaching his decision, the administrative judge conducted a detailed credibility assessment of each witness, and based on these findings, he found that the agency provided the appellant with both CSRS benefit estimate reports which, although omitting information about his social security offset, emphasized that they were estimates and not intended to represent actual retirement annuity amounts. The administrative judge thus found that the agency did not provide the appellant misinformation upon which he detrimentally relied in making his decision to retire.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1993"></span>...To overcome the presumption of voluntariness which normally attaches to a retirement or resignation, an appellant must show that his decision to retire or resign was the result of agency misrepresentation, coercion, or duress. <span class="Italic">See Salazar v. Department of the Army</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 296, &#x00B6; 9 (2010).

An appellant, however, need not show that the agency intentionally misled him, and an agency is required to provide accurate information to permit an employee to make an informed, and thus voluntary, decision regarding his retirement or resignation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant has failed to establish that he reasonably relied on agency misinformation to his detriment in making his decision to retire. The appellant has failed to establish that, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would have relied on a projected monthly retirement annuity where that projection is presented on a report entitled "CSRS Benefit Estimate Report," which contains an express disclaimer noting that it is not a final calculation and that OPM has the final authority to determine an employee's retirement annuity. Additionally, we find no evidence in the record that the agency knew that the appellant was operating under a misapprehension based upon the agency's omission of information that would have required the agency to affirmatively correct his misunderstanding. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 620, 628 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon considering the appellant's arguments on review, we further find that his primary focus is on the propriety of the social security offset itself. The offset challenged by the appellant, however, is mandated by statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8349. The appellant's retirement annuity, therefore, would have been subject to a social security offset regardless of when he retired, and the amount he ultimately received would have been the same under either CSRS or CSRS Offset. <span class="Italic">See generally id</span>.; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831 Subpart J; <span class="Italic">see also Wible v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 333, &#x00B6; 6 (2013) (explaining CSRS and CSRS Offset formulas). We therefore find this appeal distinguishable from those instances where an employee demonstrates that he decided to retire based on an erroneous retirement estimate that had a demonstrable and detrimental financial impact to the employee which would not have occurred in the absence of the misinformation. <span class="Italic">See Salazar</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 296, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 &#x0026; n.2. In such cases, an employee can clearly demonstrate how his decision to retire based on misinformation had a negative impact on his financial interests. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (explaining that the appellant lost 7 years' creditable service toward his retirement based on agency misinformation). Here, by contrast, because the appellant's retirement annuity would have been offset regardless of when he retired, we conclude that he has not demonstrated any detrimental reliance on misinformation which resulted in a financial impact that would not have resulted, had the offset amount been included in the benefit estimate report. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Hunter v.
