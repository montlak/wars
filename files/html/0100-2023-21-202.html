<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-202"><span class="space">A.</span> SEPARATION OR FURLOUGH MUST RESULT FROM COMPENSABLE INJURY</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">"A compensable injury is defined as one that is accepted by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) as job-related and for which medical or monetary benefits are payable from the Employees' Compensation Fund. <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 404, &#x00B6; 14 (2016)." <span class="Italic">Askew v. USPS</span>, AT-0353-16-0757-I-1, n.4 (NP 10/25/2022). Under <span class="Italic">Fisher v. USPS</span>, 100 MSPR 94, 98-99 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2005) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Fisher v. USPS,</span> 06-3043<span class="Italic"></span> (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who is separated or furloughed from an appointment without time limitation as a result of a compensable injury may have restoration rights under Title 5, Part 353, of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, and may appeal the denial of those rights to the Board. <span class="Italic">Davis v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 270, &#x00B6; 6 (2001); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.103(b), 353.304. An employee may seek to be restored as either fully or partially recovered from a compensable injury. At all times during these appeals, the appellant has asserted that she was seeking restoration to duty as a partially recovered employee under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). A partially recovered employee is an injured employee who, although not ready to resume the full range of his or her regular duties, has recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. An individual who is partially recovered from a compensable injury can establish Board jurisdiction over a restoration appeal by making non-frivolous allegations that: (1) She was absent from her position due to a compensable injury; (2) she is partially recovered from her injury; (3) she requested restoration within certain limitations, and the agency denied that request; and (4) the agency's denial was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Chen v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 13 (2004); <span class="Italic">Morman v. Department of Defense,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 10 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The nexus between a compensable injury and the employee's separation or furlough is the primary jurisdictional requirement at this juncture of the appellant's restoration appeals. <span class="Italic">See Mobley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 5 (2000). A compensable injury is a medical condition accepted by the OWCP to be job-related and for which medical or monetary benefits are payable from the Employees' Compensation Fund. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. Here, in terminating the appellant's benefits, OWCP determined that she no longer suffered from a compensable injury as of December 5, 1998. The determination of whether an individual suffers from a medical condition that is compensable under the Federal Employees Compensation Act is within the exclusive purview of OWCP (subject to review by the ECAB). <span class="Italic">Chen,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 15. Because the appellant's absence from work after December 5, 1998, was no longer due to a compensable injury, she was not a partially recovered employee, and therefore has failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction over the agency's alleged denial of her requests for restoration as a partially recovered employee to positions after December 5, 1998, i.e., several verbal requests in late 1998 and early 1999 to Lyons Postmaster Alyce Madison for a window clerk position or other productive work, requests for EAS Postmaster positions in October 2001 and 2002, and requests for window clerk positions at three different Colorado post offices in January 2003.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We have considered but rejected any claim that the appellant has restoration rights as a fully recovered employee under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a) or (b). "`Fully recovered' means compensation payments have been terminated on the basis that the employee is able to perform all the duties of the position he or she left or an equivalent one." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102; <span class="Italic">Foley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 7 (2001) (if the appellant's workers' compensation benefits have been terminated on the basis that he is able to perform all duties of the position he left or an equivalent one, he would be considered a fully recovered employee). While OWCP terminated the appellant's benefits, it did not further conclude that she could perform the duties of her rural carrier position or an equivalent position. Indeed, as noted earlier, the appellant maintained that she could no longer perform her rural carrier duties. Further in this regard, her asserted inability to perform rural carrier duties and her withdrawal of her request for restoration and reasonable accommodation from the agency precludes any claim that the agency placed her in an enforced leave status for any period after her OWCP benefits ceased.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A covered separation may be through furlough, <span class="Italic">Artis v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 309, 312 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Restoration rights under Part 353 accrue only to employees who were separated or furloughed from a position without time limitation as a result of a compensable injury. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b). A furlough means the placement of an employee in a nonduty, nonpay status for nondisciplinary reasons, and a compensable injury means an injury for which an employee received benefits from the Employees' Compensation Fund. <span class="Italic">See DeLoach v. Department of Treasury</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 574, 578 (1993); <span class="Italic">see also Taylor v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 479, 482 (1996). Agencies must make every effort to restore, according to the circumstances in each <span id="Page_4442"></span>case, an employee or former employee who is partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d); <span class="Italic">see Sapp v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 189, 192-93 (1997). A "partially recovered" individual is one who has recovered sufficiently to return to less physically demanding work. <span class="Italic">Sapp</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 193.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant suffered a compensable injury, and it is undisputed that she has "partially recovered" from that injury because her physician has released her for return to less physically demanding duty. The agency thus would be obligated to make every effort to restore her under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) if she was either separated or furloughed "as a result of a compensable injury." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.103(b). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304, the Board will review an agency's actions in such a case only to determine whether it acted arbitrarily and capriciously. <span class="Italic">See Sapp</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 193.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first note that the agency's action in maintaining her in a nonpay status, if she requested return to duty, would constitute her placement on "furlough." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McCloud v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 508, 511 (1996) (employee's claim that instead of returning her to duty upon her recovery, agency placed her in leave without pay status constituted allegation of Board jurisdiction under Part 353); <span class="Italic">DeLoach</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 578 (claim of continued retention on leave without pay despite recovery required adjudication under Part 353); <span class="Italic">cf.

While the ID found that the appellant was removed for cause, it contained no analysis concerning whether a denial of restoration rights occurred following a request for restoration made during a period of furlough and prior to separation....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Walley v. VA</span>, 279 F.3d 1010, 1012-1022 (Fed. Cir. 2002), applied the causation test to reemployment rights for partially recovered employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, probationary employees like petitioner have very limited statutory rights of appeal. The statute specifically excludes probationary workers from the definition of "employee."<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7501(1) and 7511(a)(1)(A)(i). Although a limited right of appeal is granted to a probationary employee under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b), (c) and (d), none of these provisions applies here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, another notable exception allows appeals by probationary employees if they have been denied restoration rights based on compensable injuries. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Roche v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 828 F.2d 1555, 1557 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding that a probationary employee "could appeal the denial of restoration rights if he could show that his removal was the result of a compensable injury or was substantially related to a compensable injury").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Employees' Compensation Act ("FECA"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8101 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> provides that federal employees who suffer on-the-job compensable injuries enjoy certain rights to be restored to their previous or comparable positions. An agency's obligation to restore an injured employee to his or her former position or an equivalent position is codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151 and its corresponding regulations at 5 C.F.R. Part 353. Generally, the recovery period and whether the employee fully or partially recovers determine the scope of the injured employee's restoration rights. The regulations describe restoration rights for two categories of fully recovered individuals: those who fully recover within one year and those who fully recover after one year. Specifically, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a) provides employees who fully recover within one year immediate and unconditional restoration; whereas, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b) provides employees who take longer than one year to recover priority consideration for restoration to his or her former position or an equivalent one. In contrast, partially recovered employees are entitled to have the agency "make every effort" to restore them to "suitable" jobs in the local commuting area. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) (1996). Ms. Walley's claims here are that the agency's action should be set aside because (1) she was terminated because of a compensable injury, and (2) she was required to return to work without an OWCP suitability determination. The parties agree that Ms. Walley suffered an injury during her probationary period as an employee; she was partially recovered; and she was terminated. However, the government contends that it should prevail here because (1) Ms. Walley has not shown that she was terminated solely "because of a compensable injury," and (2) an OWCP suitability determination was unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have not previously considered the restoration rights of partially recovered employees. We have, however, considered the restoration rights of fully recovered employees. The regulation governing fully recovered employees states that an employee who has fully recovered after one year and who has been separated "because of a compensable injury" may claim entitlement to priority consideration for restoration. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b) (1996). In cases pre-dating our decision in <span class="Italic">New v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 142 F.3d 1259 (Fed. Cir. 1998), this court consistently held that a fully recovered employee's compensable injury must be the <span class="Italic">only</span> reason for his or her removal in order for fully recovered employees to claim priority consideration for restoration rights. For example, in <span class="Italic">Cox v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> Mr. Cox sought restoration to his former position or an equivalent position claiming that he was separated as a "result of a compensable injury." 817 F.2d 100, 101 (Fed. Cir. 1987). This court explained that "[by] definition, separation <span class="Italic">as a result of</span> a compensable injury excludes a valid removal for cause unrelated to the employee's compensable injury."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, this court upheld the board's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction because Mr. Cox relied solely on the OWCP decision and offered no other evidence that his separation was because of or substantially related to his disability. <span class="Italic">See also Minor v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 819 F.2d 280, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("An employee who has been removed for cause rather than a compensable injury is not entitled to restoration and cannot appeal to the Board.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Most recently in <span class="Italic">New,</span> we addressed the meaning of "because of a compensable injury." Ms. New was an employee who fully recovered after more than one year, and as such an employee she was entitled to priority consideration for restoration to her former or an equivalent position. <span class="Italic">New,</span> 142 F.3d at 1265. Although there was no OWCP suitability determination, Ms. New refused to return to work because she believed that the agency's accommodations did not comply with her physician's recommendations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1264. Ms. New asserted that there was a nexus between her termination and her compensable injury because she was removed solely for refusing to return to work. In addressing Ms. New's assertion, this court followed the principle previously identified in <span class="Italic">Cox,</span> 817 F.2d at 101, and stated: "[i]n order to prove that [she] was removed because of [her] compensable injury, the petitioner was required to demonstrate that no cause aside from [her] compensable injury precipitated [her] removal."<span class="Italic">New,</span> 142 F.3d at 1264. This court agreed "that there was a sufficient nexus between her removal and her compensable injury not only to create jurisdiction in the Board over the appeal but also to entitle her to priority consideration for restoration, in the absence of a valid removal for cause unrelated to her compensable injury."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1265. Accordingly, we reversed the Board's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction and remanded to determine whether there was a valid cause for removal unrelated to her compensable injury. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner and the government appear to assume that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b), which includes the "because of a compensable injury" standard involved in <span class="Italic">New,</span> also applies here. The problem here is that this regulation does not apply to Ms. Walley because she is a partially recovered employee, not a fully recovered employee. Instead, the regulations applicable to Ms. Walley are 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.301(d) and 353.304(c). Those regulations do not contain the "because of a compensable injury" language that the parties focus on. Therefore, we must determine whether this same "because of a compensable injury" requirement should apply to partially recovered employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that it does. "An individual who is partially recovered from a compensable injury may appeal to [the] MSPB for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c) (1996). In the present context, the agency is alleged to have acted arbitrarily because it violated its own regulations. The applicable regulation is 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d), which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Agencies must make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has <span class="Italic">partially recovered</span> from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty. <span class="Italic">At a minimum, this would mean treating these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,</span> as amended. (See 29 U.S.C. 791(b) and 794). If the individual fully recovers, he or she is entitled to be considered for the position held at the time of injury, or an equivalent one. A partially recovered employee is expected to seek reemployment as soon as he or she is able.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) (1996) (emphases added). Thus, section 353.301(d) requires that partially recovered employees be treated "substantially the same" as handicapped employees under the Rehabilitation Act. The Rehabilitation Act protects employees from being denied benefits or being subjected to discrimination "solely by reason of her or his disability." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A number of courts of appeals have interpreted the meaning of "solely by reason of her or his disability" within the context of the Rehabilitation Act. Uniformly, they have concluded that there can be no other cause for the discrimination aside from the employee's disability. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Crocker v. Runyon,</span> 207 F.3d 314, 318-19 (6th Cir. 2000) ("It is not enough for the plaintiff to show that his handicap contributed to the nonhiring, because the Rehabilitation Act 'does not forbid decisions based on the actual attributes of the handicap.'"); <span class="Italic">Amir v. St. Louis Univ.,</span> 184 F.3d 1017, 1029 n.5 (8th Cir. 1999) ("[t]he Rehabilitation Act imposes a requirement that a person's disability serve as the <span class="Italic">sole</span> impetus for a defendant's adverse action against the plaintiff."); <span class="Italic">Johnson by Johnson v. Thompson,</span> <span id="Page_4443"></span>971 F.2d 1487, 1493 (10th Cir. 1992) ("The word <span class="Italic">solely</span> provides the key: the discrimination must result from the handicap and from the handicap alone. If others with the same handicap do not suffer the discrimination, then the discrimination does not result 'solely by reason of [the] handicap.'").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the text of the regulation read in light of the Rehabilitation Act requires that Ms. Walley's injury be the sole cause of her termination, as it is for fully recovered employees under our decision in <span class="Italic">New</span> and earlier cases. We also note that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.103(b) provides additional support for requiring that the injury be the sole cause of her termination. Specifically, this regulation contains language requiring that all individuals claiming restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. Part 353 be separated "as a result of a compensable injury."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Walley contends that the Board improperly assigned her the burden of proof on the issue of whether she was terminated because of a compensable injury. While she admits that she bears the burden of proof on "jurisdictional issues" pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)], she claims that the Board's jurisdiction is established by the presence of a non-frivolous allegation and that, once there is such an allegation, the burden shifts to the agency to justify its action by a preponderance of the evidence. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have recently had occasion to review the question of whether Board jurisdiction is established by a non-frivolous allegation on a jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Based on a long line of this court's decisions, we concluded that the Board can properly reach the merits of a claim because a non-frivolous allegation is sufficient to confer jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> ("This court has held that the Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal if the appellant has exhausted his administrative remedies before the [Office of Special Counsel] and makes 'non-frivolous allegations.'..."); <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 978 F.2d 679, 687-88 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("The forum had jurisdiction to hear the matter in the first instance--that is, subject-matter jurisdiction existed--as long as the petitioner asserted nonfrivolous claims."). Once the Board has jurisdiction, it may address the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under our decision in <span class="Italic">Yunus,</span> there are issues before the Board that are at one and the same time jurisdictional issues--requiring a non-frivolous allegation for Board jurisdiction--and merits issues--requiring a determination in favor of the employee if relief is to be awarded. As we discuss below, in the present context the question of whether a termination occurred because of a compensable injury is one of those issues. Board jurisdiction is established by a non-frivolous allegation of a termination because of a compensable injury, but the employee can succeed on the merits only if after a hearing there is a finding that such a termination occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1201.56 of the regulations, placing the burden of proof on the employee with respect to "jurisdictional issues," is plainly not concerned with the first issue of technical jurisdiction (the need for a non-frivolous allegation), but rather with the second issue (concerning the ultimate merits). It places the burden of proof on the employee at a merits hearing with respect to merits issues that are also jurisdictional issues. Thus, although the regulation characterizes the issues with which it is concerned as "jurisdictional" in nature, the regulation is directed, in fact, to the allocation of the burden of proof on the merits. The consequence is that if a merits issue is one that is also "jurisdictional," the burden of proof on that merits issue remains with the employee even though, as a technical matter, the Board's jurisdiction is established by a non-frivolous allegation. The Board itself has interpreted this regulation as governing the burden of proof on those issues that the Board has viewed as "jurisdictional." <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 430, 434 (2001); <span class="Italic">Giove v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 89 M.S.P.R. 560, 564 (2001); <span class="Italic">Mobley v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 86 M.S.P.R. 161, 164 (2000). We owe deference to the Board's interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Am. Express Co. v. United States</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7096293605647392232&q=279+F.3d+1010&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">262 F.3d 1376</a>, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2001). We accordingly conclude that this regulation allocates the burden of proof to the employee on merits issues which are also "jurisdictional issues."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue here--whether the employee was terminated because of a compensable injury--is an issue that the Board has traditionally considered to be "jurisdictional." <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 491, 494 (2001) ("[a]nexus between a compensable injury and the employee's separation is the primary jurisdictional requirement in a restoration appeal...."); <span class="Italic">Chism v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 436, 440 (2000) ("In order to establish Board jurisdiction over such an appeal, the appellant must show that: (1) he was separated from his position due to a compensable injury; (2) he partially recovered from the injury; (3) he requested restoration within certain limitations; and, (4) the agency denied that request."); <span class="Italic">Mobley</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. at 164 ("To have any restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. part 353 based on a compensable injury, an individual must first establish that he was `separated or furloughed from an appointment without time limitation...as a result of a compensable injury....'") (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.103(b)). Hence the burden of proof properly remained with the employee at a hearing on that issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Proving that her termination was solely because of her compensable injury required Ms. Walley to prove that even her approved absences were because of her injury, since even approved absences could be a valid basis for termination. <span class="Italic">See Richards v. Dep't of Navy,</span> 24 M.S.P.R. 50, 53 (1984) (noting that there are "limited circumstances when removal for excessive authorized absences is appropriate"). At oral argument, counsel for Ms. Walley even conceded that <span class="Italic">New</span> places this burden on petitioner. <span class="Italic">See New</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13284869535953515255&q=279+F.3d+1010&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">142 F.3d at 1264</a>. Therefore, Ms. Walley, not the agency, had the burden of proving that any absences, even approved absences, were caused by her compensable injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Walley asserts that she satisfied her burden of proof. The Board noted that petitioner's assertion that she was compensated by OWCP for all absences was uncorroborated. Specifically, the Board found that "she produced no evidence showing that she claimed OWCP benefits for her absences after the agency restored her to full-time light duty in the LPN position."[<span class="Italic">Walley III, supra</span>] . Accordingly, the Board concluded that "the appellant failed to meet her burden to establish that her termination resulted from her compensable injury."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> We have reviewed the record and conclude that the Board's decision was supported by substantial evidence. Indeed, Ms. Walley concedes that the evidence shows only that "her absences were for the most part related to her compensable injury."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, relying on <span class="Italic">New,</span> petitioner also urges that she should not have been required to return to work before the OWCP determined the suitability of the position offered to her in light of her injuries. The consequences of Ms. Walley's prevailing on this issue are unclear. Presumably, Ms. Walley is claiming that she could not be terminated for poor attendance after her restoration if she were not obligated to return to work. However, we disagree that an OWCP determination was required. Agencies are required to make every effort to restore partially recovered employees to "suitable" jobs in the local commuting area. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) (1996). The regulation states that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Where an employee has been offered suitable employment (or reemployment) by the employing agency (i.e., employment or reemployment which the [OWCP] has found to be within the employee's educational and vocational capabilities, within any limitations and restrictions which pre-existed the injury, and within the limitations and restrictions which resulted from the injury),...the employee is obligated to return to such employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.124(c) (1996). OWCP evaluates the suitability of the position offered by the agency "in light of several factors, including the nature of the employee's injury, the degree of the employee's impairment, and the employee's age and qualifications for other work."<span class="Italic">New,</span> 142 F.3d at 1262.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the regulations require that an employee return to work if an OWCP suitability determination has been made, <span class="Italic">see</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.124(c) (1996), they also require that an employee return to work if the accommodations offered by the agency correspond to the recommendations of the attending physician. For example, 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.123(a) requires the agency to "[a]dvise the employee in the same manner as provided by &#x00A7; 10.207(b)." In turn, 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.207(b)(3) provides in pertinent part that "[the agency] [s]hall advise the employee of his or her responsibilities under &#x00A7; 10.209 of this subpart." Section 10.209(e) clearly provides that "[w]here an employee has been offered duties within the limitations and restrictions imposed by the physician, the <span class="Italic">employee is obligated to return to duty.</span>" 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.209(e) (1996) (emphasis added). In this case, the agency assigned Ms. Walley duties in the LPN position that complied with her medical restrictions as specified by her doctor. Ms. Henderson, Ms. Walley's immediate supervisor, completed a written Temporary Position Description identifying these duties for Ms. Walley. As Ms. Walley was offered duties that complied with her physician's recommendations, she was obligated to return to work, and the agency did not constructively deny her restoration rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This situation is to be contrasted with the situation in <span class="Italic">New</span> where the duties offered by the agency were directly contrary to the instructions of Ms. New's doctor, and there was no suitability determination by the OWCP. The agency removed Ms. New for refusing to return to work even though "in the estimation of her physician, working under the conditions provided by the VA could have endangered her health."<span class="Italic">New,</span> 142 F.3d at 1264. This court held as a matter of law that "when an agency removes an employee who has a compensable injury <span class="Italic">solely</span> for refusal to return to work in the absence of a suitability determination by the OWCP, a sufficient nexus exists between the compensable injury and the removal to entitle the employee to priority consideration for restoration."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1265 (emphasis added). In such circumstances, we held that the agency has the burden of securing a suitability determination before the employee is compelled to return to work. In contrast, Ms. Walley returned to work and never asserted that the agency's accommodation did not comply with her physician's instructions. Instead, Ms. Walley disagreed with her physician's instructions and his assessment of her ability to perform her restricted duties. In this situation, the absence of an OWCP suitability determination is not a necessary predicate to the employee's obligation to return to work. Accordingly, the Board's finding that Ms. Walley was <span id="Page_4444"></span>not denied restoration rights in the period before her termination was correct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Board's decision that Ms. Walley failed to carry her burden of proving that her termination was due to her compensable injury was supported by substantial evidence and an OWCP suitability determination was unnecessary, we affirm the Board's dismissal. Since Ms. Walley's allegations of denial of restoration rights were non-frivolous, the Board had jurisdiction. While the Board has improperly labeled its dismissal as one for "lack of jurisdiction" as opposed to a dismissal on the merits, the use of such terminology is harmless error.</p>

The appellant asserts that because he was "involuntarily reassigned" for medical reasons, he is "under the assumption that the illness was work related."

To have any restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. part 353 based on a compensable injury, an individual must first establish that he was "separated or furloughed from an appointment without time limitation...as a result of a compensable injury." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.103(b). Thus, the right of restoration applies only to those employees who suffer from a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">Brooks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 217, 219 (1985). In this case, there is no evidence that the appellant sustained an on-the-job compensable injury for which he might have restoration rights pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151 and 5 C.F.R. part 353....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gowdy v. USPS</span>, SF-0353-14-0803-I-1 (NP 2/9/2016) ("As noted above, the appellant here filed a claim for a recurrence of her injury and OWCP denied it and terminated her benefits retroactive to April 11, 2014. Thus, as of April 11, 2014, OWCP has determined that the appellant is not entitled to medical monetary benefits and the Board is constrained to find that she was not absent from her position because of a compensable injury. Because the appellant failed to satisfy the first prong of the jurisdictional test, the administrative judge correctly dismissed this appeal for lack of jurisdiction."); <span class="Italic">Morgan v. USPS</span>, AT-0353-14-0669-I-1 (NP 1/14/2015) ("Here, while it is not disputed that the appellant suffers from a medical condition that affects his ability to perform the full range of his duties, he has submitted no evidence to show that his condition has been accepted as job-related by OWCP or that he is receiving medical monetary benefits for it. Because the appellant has not shown that he has a compensable injury, he has not shown that he is an employee with restoration rights and, therefore, the administrative judge correctly dismissed his restoration claim for lack of jurisdiction."); <span class="Italic">Matthews v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-14-0451-I-1 (NP 11/21/2014) ("A compensable injury is a condition that is accepted by OWCP as job-related, and for which medical monetary benefits are payable from the Employees' Compensation Fund. <span class="Italic">Burnett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 308, &#x00B6; 8 (2006); <span class="Italic">Norwood v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 494, &#x00B6; 4 (2005).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. USPS</span>, 16 MSPR 578, 581 (1983), if OWCP retroactively restores benefits, the right to restoration is extinguished. Member Devaney dissented as to that result. An employee who receives OWCP benefits but who is not physically separated from the government may be entitled to OWCP restoration benefits.

Cir. 2012).]</p>
