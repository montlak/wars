<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-27"><span class="space">a.</span> FMLA Request, Agency Compliance; Medical Documentation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 112 MSPR 173, 178 &#x00B6; 11, 2009 MSPB 165 (2009), outlined the nature of an FMLA leave request in defense to an unauthorized absence charge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FMLA allows an employee to take up to 12 weeks of leave per year (paid or unpaid) for various purposes, including an employee's own serious health condition. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1). A serious health condition is defined as an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves, among other things, continuing treatment by a health care provider. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6381(5)(B). An agency may require that a request for such leave be supported by certification from a health care provider and that the employee must submit this certification to the agency in a timely manner. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(a). The certification "shall be sufficient" if it states the date the serious health condition began, the probable duration of the condition, the appropriate medical facts known by the health care provider, and a statement that the employee is unable to perform her position's functions, or that she will require intermittent leave or leave on a reduced schedule, including the dates for and duration of the expected treatment. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(b). The Board has held that an agency has the burden of proving that it properly denied FMLA leave in charging an appellant with unauthorized absence. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6; 21 (2001). Where the facts, either specifically raised by the appellant or otherwise shown by the record evidence, implicate the FMLA relative to a leave-related charge, the Board will consider and apply the FMLA without shifting the burden of proof to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sullivan v. USPS,</span> DA-0752-10-0348-I-1 (NP 7/12/2011) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. USPS</span>, 464 Fed. Appx. 895 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>), provided additional explanation of the FMLA concerning an adverse action based on failure to provide proper medical documentation to the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claimed below, and continues to claim on review, that his absences should have been covered under the FMLA. If an agency bases an adverse action on its interference with an employee's rights under the FMLA, the adverse action is a violation of law and cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">Gross v. Department of Justice</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 83, 90 (1997). The agency bears the burden of proving that it complied with the FMLA as part of its overall burden of proving a leave-based charge. <span class="Italic">Moore v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 21 (1999). The administrative judge did not specifically find that the agency complied with the FMLA. Under <span class="Italic">Moore</span>, we believe such a finding is necessary to reach the issue of whether the agency met its overall burden of proving the leave-based charge. We thus address the issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FMLA allows an employee to take up to 12 weeks of leave (paid or unpaid) during a 12-month period for various purposes, including an employee's own serious health condition that renders him unable to perform the functions of his position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2612(a)(1)(D); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.200(a)(4). For the purpose of determining an employee's entitlement to leave, an employer may select any one of three definitions for the 12-month period: (1) the calendar year; (2) any fixed 12-month "leave year," such as the fiscal year; or (3) a rolling 12-month period measured backward from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.200(b). The Postal Service calculates FMLA leave based on its own leave year, which begins the first day of the first full pay period in the calendar year. Employee and Labor Relations Manual &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 512.12, 515.41 (Jan. 2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to granting FMLA leave, an agency may require that a leave request be supported by documentation from a health care provider, and the employee must submit this certification to the agency in a timely manner. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2613(a); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 825.305(a), (b), (d). For a condition lasting beyond a single leave year, an agency may require the employee to submit medical certification, including second and third opinions, in each subsequent leave year. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.305(e). Pending receipt of final medical certification, an agency will grant provisional leave under the FMLA. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.307(b). An agency will cancel provisional leave if the employee fails to provide the requested medical certification. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, an agency may seek clarification of an employee's medical certification, or require the employee to obtain a second or third opinion at the agency's expense. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 825.307(a)-(c). To remain entitled to FMLA leave for a medical condition an employee must comply with the agency's requirement that he submit to a second- or third-opinion examination with a health care provider other than his own. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 825.305(d), .307(b)(1), .307(c); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 825.313(a), (b). The Board generally will not look behind the agency's determinations during the certification process with respect to an employee's need for FMLA leave. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Dias v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 53, &#x00B6; 7 (2006) (Congress intended for the final or binding determination regarding an employee's need for FMLA leave to occur at the agency level, and it did not envision the Board's participation in that process), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 223 F. App'x 986 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the period relevant to this appeal, the appellant requested FMLA leave several times, and the agency advised him that he might be eligible for leave if he were to submit additional documentation regarding his own serious health condition or the condition of a relative for whom he was caring. Except for the first request in the record, which was submitted in early January 2009 and for which the agency requested more information, the agency disapproved the appellant's requests for FMLA leave, whether for his own condition or that of a relative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submitted a certification dated January 12, 2009, from his physician, Diane Chen, M.D., indicating that he suffered from frequent and painful attacks of gout in his feet and ankles, requiring him to be absent from work for 5 to 10 days per month. The agency's FMLA coordinator, Gail L. Thomas, testified that an agency committee reviewed the certification and decided that the frequency and duration of potential absences made it necessary for the agency to exercise its right to obtain a second medical opinion regarding the appellant's condition. On February 23, 2009, Thomas instructed the appellant to report for a second-opinion examination at the agency's expense on March 10, 2009. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.307(b). Thomas testified that she mailed the letter to the appellant at his address of record with delivery confirmation, and a tracking inquiry showed that the letter was delivered on February 24, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2469"></span>When the appellant failed to appear for the second-opinion examination, Thomas mailed him a letter, dated March 17, 2009, which stated that the agency considered his failure to appear to be "a failure to act in good faith absen[t]good and sufficient cause." The appellant responded, stating that he had not known about the appointment and never received the February 23, 2009 letter. During the hearing, the appellant testified that he had not received the February 23, 2009 appointment letter <span class="Italic">and</span> that he may have missed the appointment because he overslept that day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thomas advised the appellant that the agency was withdrawing its conditional approval of leave under the FMLA, which had been granted while final certification was pending. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.307(b)(1). She also advised him that he was no longer eligible for FMLA leave for the gout condition during that year, and his future requests for leave would be disapproved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the 2009 leave year, the appellant also submitted two additional medical certification forms to the agency. These forms, dated July 1, 2009, and October 6, 2009, and signed by Dr. Chen, addressed the appellant's gout condition and were similar to the January 12, 2009 form in terms of the information included. The agency explained that it declined to grant FMLA based on these certification forms, because the appellant had previously failed to attend a second-opinion examination regarding his gout condition. As for the appellant's requests in 2010, Thomas testified that the agency denied these requests, because he did not submit any medical information showing that either he, or a family member, suffered from a serious health condition that justified FMLA leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency met its burden of proving it complied with the FMLA, because it established that it notified the appellant of his obligation to attend a second-opinion examination, and the appellant failed to comply. The administrative judge found the appellant's conflicting testimony regarding his failure to attend the second-opinion examination to be less than credible. Because the appellant failed to attend the examination appointment, the agency did not violate the appellant's rights under the FMLA when it withdrew its approval of provisional FMLA leave for the appellant's gout condition that it had granted while the medical certification was pending and declined to grant additional leave requests during the 2009 leave year for the same condition. <span class="Italic">See Diaz v. Fort Wayne Foundry Corp.</span>, 131 F.3d 711, 713 (7th Cir. 1997) (where employer asked for second opinion regarding employee's medical certification pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.307(a)(2), and employee did not appear for medical examination, court found that employee lost the benefit of FMLA leave under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2612(a)(1)(C) or (D)); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 825.307(b)(1), .305(d), .313(b). Moreover, even though the appellant continued to request FMLA leave for his own condition and a relative's unspecified condition during 2010, he never provided any medical documentation to address these conditions. Accordingly, the agency properly continued to deny him leave. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 825.305(d), .313(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sullivan v. USPS</span>, 464 Fed. Appx. 895, 897 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), affirmed the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Sullivan argues that the Board erred by affirming the removal decision because it failed to evaluate whether USPS followed required procedures regarding his FMLA leave requests and adequately accounted for his gout. We disagree. The Board thoroughly considered Mr. Sullivan's contention that he should have been granted FMLA leave for his absences and found that USPS met its burden of proving compliance. Under FMLA, an agency is permitted to seek clarification of an employee's medical certification or require the employee to obtain a second or third medical opinion at the agency's expense. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.307(a)-(c). After reviewing the evidence, including testimony by the FMLA coordinator and by Mr. Sullivan's supervisor, the Board found that USPS notified Mr. Sullivan that he was required to attend a second opinion medical evaluation and that he failed to comply. The Board further found that Mr. Sullivan's testimony regarding his absence was not credible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a result, we hold that substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that USPS met its burden of proving compliance with FMLA, and thus that USPS did not violate Mr. Sullivan's rights by withdrawing approval of FMLA leave for his gout condition. Moreover, we hold that substantial evidence supports the Board's decision affirming Mr. Sullivan's removal based on his failure to comply with agency leave regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has not crisply defined the dividing line between what constitutes reasonable expectations of agencies for documentation supporting family leave and impermissible interference with FMLA entitlement. <span class="Italic">Somuk v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 117 MSPR 18, 19-23 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-11, 2011 MSPB 89 (2011), approached a demarcation, but the Board remanded to the AJ for factual development:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from his NT-0690-04 Industrial Hygienist position based on charges of Failure to Follow Proper Leave Procedures, 238.6 hours of Absence Without Leave (AWOL) between August 10, 2009, and October 15, 2009, and Inattention to Duty. Regarding the charge of Failure to Follow Proper Leave Procedures, the agency asserted that between July 30, 2009, and August 10, 2009, the appellant failed to call and request leave or report to duty, and subsequently failed to provide medical documentation to support his absences within 30 days after the date that the agency requested medical certification. The agency noted that although the appellant had submitted his medical documentation late, the agency approved his request for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) for the period from July 14, 2009, through August 10, 2009. The proposal notice indicated that "[w]hile Ms. Stoll approved your FMLA request, it does not negate the fact that you repeatedly failed to follow proper leave procedures which resulted in an unnecessary burden on management and your coworkers." The agency noted that the appellant's failure to provide timely notification and justification for his absences, as well as the dates he planned to return to duty, negatively impacted the mission and the agency's ability to meet customer demand, and that "[w]ork which would normally be assigned to you had to be completed by other employees who were already fully work loaded."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After a hearing on appeal, the administrative judge found that the agency proved its AWOL and Inattention to Duty charges, but did not prove all of its AWOL specifications. The administrative judge also found that, although the appellant testified that he was aware of the leave policy and tried to follow that policy, the agency did not prove its charge of Failure to Follow Proper Leave Procedures because the agency approved the appellant's request for leave under the FMLA for the period in question. In this regard, the administrative judge noted that the Board has held that if an agency bases an adverse action on its interference with an employee's rights under the FMLA, the adverse action is a violation of law and cannot stand....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts on review that under Board precedent it can discipline the appellant for failure to follow leave procedures even if it approves the leave. The agency further claims that neither party had notice that interference with the appellant's FMLA rights was an issue in the case, that the cases the administrative judge relied upon regarding the FMLA were distinguishable from this case because they involved a denial of FMLA leave, not a granting of FMLA leave, and that the appellant failed to meet the notice requirements under the FMLA of 30 calendar days' notice or notice within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances involved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Wilkinson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 4, 6 (1995), the agency removed the appellant for failure to request leave according to established procedures. The Board held that, although the agency eventually approved leave and/or leave without pay (LWOP) for the absences covering the period of the charge of failure to request leave according to established procedures, non-Postal Service agencies should be able to discipline employees for such behavior. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 6-7. The Board noted that such action will encourage agencies to grant compelling leave requests even though proper leave-requesting procedures were not followed, while allowing agencies to hold employees accountable for their failure to follow such leave-requesting procedures. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 7. Thus, the Board held that "a charge of failing to properly request sick leave, annual leave, or LWOP can be maintained by an agency that is bound by the laws and regulations that govern leave administration in the civil service, even though the agency eventually approves the leave request (or the Board on review determines that the agency's denial of the leave request was unreasonable), so long as the employee is on notice of the agency's requirements." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge in this case relied on <span class="Italic">Gross v. Department of Justice</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 83, 88 (1997), and <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 54, 73 (1997), in finding that the agency's decision to discipline the appellant for failure to follow leave procedures for FMLA-protected dates interfered with the appellant's FMLA rights and could not be sustained. In <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 85, the agency suspended the appellant for 20 days based on a charge of failure to comply with the agency's leave-request policy. The agency suspended the appellant after placing him in an AWOL status for 5 unspecified days, and the appellant asserted that the agency violated the FMLA by improperly denying him leave to care for an ill family member. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board found that the appellant's family medical emergency situation was covered by the FMLA, that the appellant satisfied the notice requirements of the FMLA and invoked entitlement to leave under it, and that the agency's denial of LWOP violated the provisions of the FMLA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 87-90. The Board noted that if an agency bases an adverse action on its interference with an employee's rights under the FMLA, the adverse action is a violation of law and cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 90. The Board concluded that "by failing to grant the appellant LWOP to care for his seriously ill mother, and then placing him in AWOL status and suspending him, the agency interfered with his rights under the FMLA," and the agency's action could not be sustained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 90-91 (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 62, the agency removed the appellant based on charges of inability to perform her job duties and unauthorized absence from duty. The Board found that the agency did not prove its charges, <span id="Page_2470"></span>and specifically found with respect to the AWOL charge that the charge could not be sustained because the appellant was entitled to LWOP for that period under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 71. The Board noted that "there is no basis for treating the FMLA and its implementing regulations differently from any other leave-related statute and regulations which may apply to a leave-related charge." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 73. The Board thus held that when the facts, either specifically raised by the appellant or otherwise shown by the record evidence, implicate the FMLA relative to a leave-related charge, the Board will consider and apply the FMLA without shifting the burden of proof to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, following the principle set forth in <span class="Italic">Wilkinson</span>, we find that the mere fact that the agency approved leave under the FMLA for a period of time during which the agency also charged the appellant with Failure to Follow Proper Leave Procedures does not mean that the charge cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Bowen v. Department of the Navy</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 11 (2009) (the appellant identified nothing in the FMLA or the regulations implementing the FMLA that prohibited the agency from requiring him to call in or request leave), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 402 F. App'x 521 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Rather, as set forth in <span class="Italic">Gross</span> and <span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span>, the question is whether the agency interfered with the appellant's rights under the FMLA in charging him with Failure to Follow Proper Leave Procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1206(a), if FMLA leave for a serious health condition is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the employee shall provide notice of the intention to take leave not less than 30 calendar days before the date the leave is to begin. If the need for leave is not foreseeable and the employee cannot provide 30 calendar days' notice of the need for leave, the employee shall provide notice within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances involved. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1206(c). An agency may waive the notice requirements under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1206(a) and instead impose the agency's usual and customary policies or procedures for providing notification of leave, but such notification policies or procedures must not be more stringent than the requirements set forth in section 630.1206. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1206(e). An employee must provide written medical certification requested by an agency under the FMLA no later than 15 calendar days after the date the agency requests such medical certification. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1207(h). However, if it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to provide the requested medical certification no later than 15 calendar days after the date requested by the agency despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts, the employee must provide the medical certification within a reasonable period of time under the circumstances involved, but no later than 30 calendar days after the date the agency requests such medical certification. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency bears the burden of proving that it complied with the FMLA as part of its overall burden of proving a leave-based charge. <span class="Italic">Bowen</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 8. Thus, in order to prove its charge of Failure to Follow Proper Leave Procedures the agency was required to show that it did not violate the appellant's rights under the FMLA as set forth above relating to notice requirements and the timely provision of medical certification in response to an agency's request.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ramey v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 463, 468 (1996), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, essentially establishing FMLA as a defense to AWOL, was modified in <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 54, 73-78 (1997), deciding the agency must demonstrate that it properly denied leave under FMLA if the employee raises the issue as to an AWOL charge. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span> also discussed medical documentation requirements under FMLA and the operative provisions of the statute, noting, in part, that "The FMLA does not specify whether the employee must explicitly invoke it in requesting leave":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having dealt with the propriety of the AJ's consideration of the appellant's use of the FMLA as a "defense" to the AWOL charge, we turn to how such a "defense" should be litigated in denial-of-leave cases. In doing so, we revisit <span class="Italic">Ramey</span>, 70 MSPR at 467, where the Board held that a claim of entitlement to FMLA leave, with respect to a leave-related charge, should be treated as a "defense" under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C), over which the appellant has the burden of proof. Upon reconsidering this holding in <span class="Italic">Ramey</span>, we modify it, for the reasons that follow.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On further consideration, the Board is persuaded that there is no basis for treating the FMLA and its implementing regulations differently from any other leave-related statute and regulations which may apply to a leave-related charge. We therefore find that where the facts, either specifically raised by the appellant or otherwise shown by the record evidence, implicate the FMLA relative to a leave-related charge, the Board will consider and apply the FMLA without shifting the burden of proof to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Jeffrey,</span> 25 MSPR at 699 (in finding that the agency's charge of "excessive unauthorized absences" was not proven because the appellant was entitled to military leave under 38 USC 2024(d) for the absences, the Board did not explicitly or implicitly shift the burden of proof to the appellant to prove his entitlement to military leave); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">DiGiulio v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 66 MSPR 659, 665-66 (1995) (the agency's burden of proving a charge of AWOL includes showing that the appellant's request for leave was properly denied). Accordingly, we find that an FMLA claim should not be treated as a defense under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C), over which the appellant has the burden of proof.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, in holding that the burden of proof regarding an FMLA claim should not be shifted to the appellant, we are not suggesting that the agency should have the burden of proving the appellant's nonentitlement to FMLA leave in all cases where the FMLA potentially could be implicated. Unless an appellant raises nonfrivolous factual allegations, or the agency's evidence or allegations otherwise show that FMLA-qualifying leave was involved, the Board will not examine this issue or require the agency to disprove her entitlement to FMLA leave. Just as in other situations where a statutory provision or other applicable law is potentially implicated with respect to an agency's charge, the parties have the obligation to timely raise pertinent factual allegations, to timely submit proof in support of such allegations, and to timely rebut the other party's evidence, with respect to FMLA issues. The AJ has the responsibility to develop the record evidence as necessary and appropriate, while considering administrative efficiency and fairness to the parties. Based on the record, as so developed, and the applicable law, the Board then determines whether the agency proved its charge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally Hanner v. Department of the Army</span>, 62 MSPR 677, 682-83 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 48 F.3d 1236 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table); <span class="Italic">Jeffrey</span>, 25 MSPR at 698-99. We note that the AJ implicitly found that the agency had the burden of proving its compliance with the FMLA as part of its overall burden of proving the AWOL charge. For the reasons discussed above, we agree with the AJ's implicit finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant was a covered "employee" under the FMLA. 5 USC 6381(1); 5 CFR 630.1201(b). The FMLA became effective on August 5, 1993, for non-Postal federal civilian employees, and thus covered the appellant's absence commencing September 5, 1994. 5 USCA 6381, Historical and Statutory Notes. The maximum amount of FMLA leave which may be taken during "any 12-month period" is "12 administrative workweeks." 5 USC 6382(a)(1); 5 CFR 630.1203; <span class="Italic">Ramey</span>, 70 MSPR at 466. The ten-week absence in question lasted less than the maximum limit under the FMLA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FMLA leave may be taken by an employee for her own "serious health condition." 5 USC 6382(a)(1)(D); 5 CFR 630.1203(a)(4). The term "serious health condition" is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;continuing treatment by a health care provider[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 USC 6381(5); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR 630.1202.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The undisputed record evidence shows that the appellant was hospitalized for her depression during her absence of several months' duration. Because the appellant thus received "inpatient care in a hospital" for her depression, we find that it constituted a "serious health condition." In addition, the medical evidence showed, as described above, that the appellant was "unable to perform the functions of [her]position" due to the "serious health condition" during the absence in question. 5 USC 6382(a)(1)(D). We therefore find that the appellant was entitled to FMLA leave for the absence, subject to the notice and medical certification requirements, as discussed below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FMLA specifies the employee's obligation to provide notice to the agency when "the necessity for [FMLA]leave...is foreseeable," either "based on an expected birth or placement," or "based on planned medical treatment." 5 USC 6382(e). However, the FMLA is silent regarding the employee's notice obligation when the need for leave is unforeseeable, as here. <span class="Italic">See Manuel v. Westlock</span> <span class="Italic">Polymers Corp.,</span> 66 F.3d 758, 761 (5th Cir. 1995). The implementing regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) provide, with respect to unforeseeable absences, that "the employee shall provide notice within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances" and that the "notice may be given by an employee's personal representative (e.g., a family member or other responsible party)." 5 CFR 630.1206(c). The regulations further provide that "[i]f the need for leave is not foreseeable and the employee is unable, due to circumstances beyond his or her control, to provide notice of his or her need for leave, the leave may not be delayed or denied." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the appellant's absence commencing September 5, Dr. Smith provided advance notice to the agency on September 2 of her need for leave due to her disabling depression, pending a reevaluation on October 14. He subsequently kept the agency apprised of the progress of her condition, as described above, until she returned to work. Considering the nonspecific notice standard applicable for unforeseeable absences and the fact that the appellant was suffering from a medically documented, severe psychiatric condition, we find that she provided timely notice under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2471"></span>The agency argues on petition for review that the appellant's initial notice was deficient because she failed to explicitly invoke the FMLA, which she invoked only after her return to work on November 14, 1994. We disagree. The FMLA does not specify whether the employee must explicitly invoke it in requesting leave. <span class="Italic">See Manuel</span>, 66 F.3d at 762. OPM's interim regulations, applicable here, are similarly silent on this issue. In <span class="Italic">Manuel</span> the court found that there is nothing in the FMLA or its legislative history to warrant requiring the employee to explicitly invoke the FMLA in requesting FMLA-qualifying leave, and we concur in this finding by the court. Although the court in <span class="Italic">Manuel</span> was considering Title I of the FMLA, applicable to private-sector and Postal employees, the notice provisions under Title I and Title II are identical in material respects, <span class="Italic">compare</span> 5 USC 6382(e) <span class="Italic">with</span> 29 USC 2612(e), and we therefore find that <span class="Italic">Manuel</span> constitutes persuasive authority on this issue. We therefore find no basis for imposing on the appellant an obligation not contained in the statute and applicable regulations and that the appellant satisfied the statutory and regulatory notice requirement even though she did not explicitly invoke the FMLA in initially requesting FMLA-qualifying leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FMLA allows an agency to request in writing that the employee provide written medical certification, and requires the employee to submit the certification "in a timely manner." 5 USC 6383(a). The agency requested such certification in its September 13 letter. This letter did not specify a deadline for the appellant to submit the medical certification. Dr. Smith subsequently communicated with the agency on September 30 and October 20, regarding her condition. Concurrent with her recovery and return to work on November 14, the appellant submitted the November 10 medical certification by Dr. Smith. We find that the appellant's submission of the medical certification upon her return to work was not untimely under the circumstances, considering that: the agency's September 13 letter did not set a deadline; the FMLA and the implementing regulations do not set a specific time limit for the submission of medical certification; Dr. Smith periodically communicated with the agency regarding her condition; and the appellant was suffering from a medically documented, severe psychiatric condition during the relevant time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we find that the substance of Dr. Smith's November 10 report was sufficient under the statutory criteria. The report described the history and progress of the appellant's depression, when and how it became incapacitating, how it was treated, and the duration of the incapacity. The report thus satisfied the statutory minimum requirements because it included "(1) the date on which the serious health condition commenced; (2) the probable duration of the condition; (3) the appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider regarding the condition...[and] (4)(B) a statement that the employee [was] unable to perform the functions of the position of the employee." 5 USC 6383(b). We therefore agree with the AJ that the report was "sufficient" under 5 USC 6383(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Beyond the statutory minimum requirements, the implementing regulations provide that the statement of disability for work, contained in the medical certification, must be "based on written information provided by the agency on the essential functions of the employee's position or, if not provided, discussion with the employee about the essential functions of his or her position...." 5 CFR 630.1207(b)(5). It appears that the agency did not provide Dr. Smith with written information on the appellant's essential functions, and it is not clear from Dr. Smith's November 10 report whether it was based on a discussion with the appellant about the essential functions of her position. Even assuming that the appellant's medical certification did not meet the technical requirements of 5 CFR 630.1207(b)(5), we find that it was sufficient to entitle the appellant to FMLA leave because it clearly showed that the appellant was incapacitated for her essential job functions. Dr. Smith's statement that the appellant's condition during her absence included "a complete inability to care for herself or her daily needs, anergy, anhedonia, impaired concentration, social withdrawal, and ultimately suicidal ideation and plan," which required hospitalization, was adequate to show such incapacitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Smith's report was apparently forwarded contemporaneously to the agency, which forwarded it to its medical director for review. The medical director commented that the report did not contain all of the information the agency requested in its September 13, 1994 letter. As the AJ found and as discussed above, however, the FMLA's medical certification requirements are much less stringent than those contained in the agency's leave restriction letter based on 5 CFR 339.104. Therefore, the fact that Dr. Smith's report did not satisfy the requirements of the agency's leave restriction letter did not, without more, warrant denial of FMLA leave. The FMLA provides that a medical certification "shall be sufficient" if it satisfies the minimum requirements under 5 USC 6383(b). If the agency "has reason to doubt the validity of the certification provided," the onus shifts to the agency to obtain "at the expense of the agency," a second medical opinion and then, if necessary, a third, and final, opinion. 5 USC 6383(c), (d). Since the appellant submitted medical certification that satisfied the minimum FMLA requirements, and the agency made no attempt to obtain any further medical opinion, it cannot deny her FMLA leave based on any alleged deficiencies in her medical certification.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends on review that it determined that detailed medical documentation was required because the appellant was seen attending a professional conference on September 24, 1994, as a private citizen, during the period of her alleged disability. The fact that she attended a one-day conference as a private citizen does not necessarily mean that she was capable of performing her job duties on that date. In any event, once an employee has submitted minimally sufficient medical documentation, the burden is on the agency to obtain a second opinion, as discussed above. For the reasons discussed above, we concur in the AJ's determination that the agency failed to prove its charge of AWOL.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span> referenced <span class="Italic">Manuel v. Westlake Polymers Corp</span>., 66 F.3d 758, 761-64 (5th Cir. 1995), a private sector case relying, in part, on Department of Labor regulations implementing FMLA and negating a requirement of specific invocation of FMLA by an employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FMLA provides eligible employees such as June Manuel twelve weeks of unpaid leave each year for "a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee." 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2612(a)(1)(D). Where that leave is <span class="Italic">foreseeable</span>, the Act requires that the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;shall provide the employer with not less than 30 days' notice, before the date the leave is to begin, of the employee's intention to take leave under such subparagraph, except that if the date of the treatment requires leave to begin in less than 30 days, the employee shall provide such notice as is practicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 U.S.C. Sec. 2612(e)(2)(B). Significantly, the Act does not specify the form of notice required for foreseeable leave, nor does it mention any notice requirement for <span class="Italic">unforeseeable</span> leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the legislative history of the FMLA does not mention the content of the notice that an employee must give. The Senate Report accompanying the Act explains that 30-day advance notice is required for foreseeable leave but that "[e]mployees who face emergency medical conditions or unforeseen changes will not be precluded from taking leave if they are unable to give 30 days' advance notice." S. Rep. No. 3, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. 25 (1993), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 27. The House Report is more vague, stating only that "30-day advance notice is not required in cases of medical emergency or other unforeseen events." H.R. Rep. No. 8, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, at 38 (1993). However, neither report mentions whether an employee must expressly invoke the FMLA when taking leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More helpfully, the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to his statutory authority, promulgated interim regulations specifying what notice an employee must give. 29 C.F.R. Secs. 825.302, 825.303. The interim regulations provide that, when the need for leave is foreseeable, the employee must give "at least verbal notice sufficient to make the employer aware that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave." 29 C.F.R. Sec. 825.302(c). Significantly, the regulation continues, providing that an employee "need not expressly assert rights under the FMLA or even mention the FMLA, but may only state that leave is needed for an expected birth or adoption, for example." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the need for leave is unforeseeable, however, the interim regulations contain no disclaimer of notice expressly invoking the FMLA's protection. The regulation requires that an employee "should give notice to the employer of the need for FMLA leave as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case." 29 C.F.R. Sec. 825.303(a). Westlake interprets this difference in regulatory language as denoting that, when the need for leave is unforeseeable, an employee must mention the FMLA in order to provide sufficient notice to the employer. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the regulation governing notice for unforeseeable leave does not, on its face, require express invocation of the FMLA. Rather, the regulation requires "notice of the need for FMLA leave." The reference to "FMLA leave" is ambiguous at best; it does not compel the conclusion that an employee seeking "FMLA leave" must mention the statute by name. The district court itself doubted that the phrase "FMLA leave" denotes a substantive requirement that an employee mention the FMLA when requesting leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the absence of the disclaimer does not impose a requirement that the leave be expressly invoked by employees who could not foresee their need for leave. To the contrary, other provisions in the interim regulations suggest that the Secretary did not intend employees, including those who could not foresee their need for FMLA leave, to expressly invoke the FMLA to satisfy their notice obligation. Sec. 825.208(a)(1) iterates:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As noted in section 825.302(c), an employee giving notice of the need for unpaid FMLA leave does not need to expressly assert rights under the Act or even mention the FMLA to meet their [sic] <span id="Page_2472"></span>obligation to provide notice, though they would need to state a qualifying reason for the needed leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, this regulation provides that <span class="Italic">"[i]</span> <span class="Italic">n all circumstances</span>, it is the employer's responsibility to designate leave, paid or unpaid, as FMLA-qualifying, based on information provided by the employee." 29 C.F.R. Sec. 825.208(a)(2). If the employer does not have sufficient information about the employee's reason for taking leave, "the employer should inquire further to ascertain whether the paid leave is potentially FMLA-qualifying." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To require the employee to designate her leave as pursuant to the FMLA would render these provisions meaningless, if not directly contradict them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Any doubt as to the Secretary's intention is resolved by the final regulations, which confirm that an employee seeking leave for unforeseen medical treatment need not expressly invoke the Act's protection. Resolving the ambiguity lying at the heart of this case, the final regulation governing notice requirements for unforeseeable leave incorporates the disclaimer of express notice. 29 C.F.R. Sec. 825.303(b) now provides that "[t]he employee need not expressly assert rights under the FMLA or even mention the FMLA, but may only state that leave is needed." 60 Fed. Reg. 2181, 2258 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Westlake argues that this change in regulatory language confirmed that the interim regulation did require express mention of the FMLA. We disagree. The Department of Labor's explanation of the amendments to the interim regulations does not even discuss its addition. <span class="Italic">See</span> 60 Fed. Reg. 2221. This treatment suggests that the Department of Labor was attempting to clarify the law as it existed under the interim regulation, not to remove a pre-existing duty to mention the FMLA when requesting leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Westlake's argument ultimately rests on a perceived regulatory error. It offers no practical reason for its proposed reading. Westlake does not explain why the Secretary would impose such a stringent requirement upon employees who cannot foresee their need for leave but not upon employees who can foresee their need for leave. Congress added the notice requirement to assist employers plan around their employees' absences. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 3 at 2, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 4; 137 Cong. Rec. H9727 (statement of Rep. Roukema) (noting that employee must give notice "so as not to unduly disrupt the operations of the employer"). That goal is not advanced by requiring employees to expressly mention the FMLA by name: an absent employee is an absent employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Westlake argues that requiring express mention of the FMLA furthers the employers' ability to invoke their rights under the Act. We disagree. The FMLA grants no rights to employers that they did not possess prior to the Act. Nor do we believe that Congress added the notice provision to apprise employers of their right to pursue their statutory safeguards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Meanwhile, requiring employees unable to foresee their need for leave to expressly invoke the FMLA's protection would significantly burden the employees. Employees often cannot foresee their need for medical or family leave. S. Rep. No. 3 at 25, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 27. Even more than employees who can foresee their need for leave, those who cannot foresee such need are ill-equipped to identify the statutory source of their right. We do not believe that Congress, in enacting the FMLA, intended to impose such an onerous requirement on employees, particularly where employers receive no benefit from it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are persuaded that the interim regulations do not require employees to expressly mention the FMLA when notifying their employer of their need for FMLA leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Westlake argues that if the regulations permit employees to invoke the FMLA's protection without expressly mentioning the Act, they are contrary to the FMLA. We disagree. Where a statute is silent or ambiguous, we limit our inquiry to "whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute." Chevron<span class="Italic">, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984). Administrative regulations promulgated in response to express delegations of authority, like the one at issue here, "are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 844, 104 S. Ct. at 2782; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 1A Sutherland Stat. Const. Sec. 31.06 (5th ed.) (noting "regulations are generally entitled to great deference").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the statutory language nor the Act's legislative history disclose congressional will regarding the content of the required notice. We are unable to say that the regulations challenged here are so patently at odds with the legislative scheme as to render them invalid. To the contrary, their disclaimer of any requirement that notice must expressly invoke the FMLA is a reasonable interpretation of the statutory scheme created by Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Westlake points to the "express mandate" of the statute requiring notice of the employee's intention "to take leave under such subparagraph." 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2612(e)(2)(B). We reject the contention that the FMLA requires employees not only to invoke the statute's protection by name, but to refer to the specific subparagraph of the FMLA under which they claim protection. These are workers, not lawyers. <span class="Italic">Accord D'Alia v. Allied-Signal Corp</span>. 260 N.J. Super. 1, 614 A.2d 1355, 1359 (App.Div.1992) (holding that "rights and benefits granted by [analogous state law] should not depend on the sophistication of the employee").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress enacted the FMLA in order "<span class="Italic">to entitle employees</span> to take reasonable leave for medical purposes." 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2601(b)(2) (emphasis added). Its legislative history discloses that it "is based on the same principle as the child labor laws, the minimum wage, Social Security, the safety and health laws, the pension and welfare benefit laws, and other labor laws that establish minimum standards for employment." S. Rep. No. 3 at 4, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3, 6-7. Significantly, none of these other federal labor laws granting benefits to employees requires those employees to refer to the specific statute, much less the specific statutory subsection, in order to avail themselves of its benefits. We do not believe Congress intended to depart from this practice and require employees to consult attorneys before notifying their employer of their need for FMLA leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, contrary to Westlake's suggestion, permitting employees to avail themselves of the FMLA's protection without expressly invoking the statute does not leave employers such as Westlake without protection from abuse of the Act's generous provisions, nor does it require employers to engage in intrusive inquiries to determine whether the FMLA applies. The Act permits employers notified of an employee's intent to take leave due to a serious health condition to require the employee to provide certification from a physician. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2613(a). If the employer has reason to doubt the validity of the certification, it may ask for a second opinion from a different physician. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2613(c). If the second opinion differs from the first, the employer may require a third opinion. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2613(d). Moreover, the employer may require recertification on a reasonable, on-going basis. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2613(e). In short, the FMLA provides safeguards from delinquent employees, but express notice by an employee that she takes leave pursuant to the FMLA is not one of those safeguards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 does not require an employee to invoke the language of the statute to gain its protection when notifying her employer of her need for leave for a serious health condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We decline to announce any categorical rules for the content of the notice by an employee. When an employee cannot give 30-days advance notice of the need for FMLA leave, the FMLA requires notice "as is practicable." 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2612(e)(2)(B). What is practicable, both in terms of the timing of the notice and its content, will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case. The critical question is whether the information imparted to the employer is sufficient to reasonably apprise it of the employee's request to take time off for a serious health condition. <span class="Italic">Accord D'Alia</span>, 614 A.2d at 1359.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress, in enacting the FMLA, did not intend employees like June Manuel to become conversant with the legal intricacies of the Act. The district court erred by requiring such knowledge. We leave to the district court the question of whether Manuel gave Westlake sufficient notice under the FMLA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The OPM regulations referenced in <span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span> may not be quite as clear as the DOL regulations referenced in <span class="Italic">Manuel.</span> The OPM regulation, 5 CFR 630.1203 (2022), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An employee must invoke his or her entitlement to family and medical leave under paragraph (a) of this section, subject to the notification and medical certification requirements in &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 630.1207 and 630.1208. An employee may not retroactively invoke his or her entitlement to family and medical leave. However, if an employee and his or her personal representative are physically or mentally incapable of invoking the employee's entitlement to FMLA leave <span class="Italic">during the entire period</span> in which the employee is absent from work for an FMLA-qualifying purpose under paragraph (a) of this section, the employee may retroactively invoke his or her entitlement to FMLA leave within 5 workdays after returning to work. In such cases, the incapacity of the employee must be documented by a written medical certification from a health care provider. In addition, the employee must provide documentation acceptable to the agency explaining the inability of his or her personal representative to contact the agency and invoke the employee's entitlement to FMLA leave during the entire period in which the employee was absent from work for an FMLA-qualifying purpose. An employee may take only the amount of family and medical leave that is necessary to manage the circumstances that prompted the need for leave under paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(h)&#x2003;An agency may not put an employee on family and medical leave and may not subtract leave from an employee's entitlement to leave under paragraph (a) of this section unless the agency has obtained confirmation from the employee of his or her intent to invoke entitlement to leave under paragraph (b) of this section. An employee's notice of his <span id="Page_2473"></span>or her intent to take leave under &#x00A7; 630.1207 may suffice as the employee's confirmation.</p>

The agency must be given sufficient information to determine whether an employee's situation satisfies those requirements to grant FMLA leave.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">Moore v. USPS</span>, 83 MSPR 533, 541-43 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-21 (1999), involving compliance proceedings seeking reinstatement of an individual who won his adverse action appeal but who was denied FMLA leave when he returned to the job because his employer mistakenly believed that the period of absence while Moore was improperly fired did not count as qualifying employment for FMLA purposes. As to the appellant's specific qualifications for FMLA coverage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FMLA leave may be taken by an employee for a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of his position. 29 USC &#x00A7; 2612(a)(1)(D); 5 USC &#x00A7; 630.1203(a)(4). A "serious health condition" is defined as either "an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves (A) inpatient care in a hospital, <span id="Page_2474"></span>hospice, or residential medical care facility; or (B) continuing treatment by a health care provider." 29 USC &#x00A7; 2611 (11). "Continuing treatment" by a health care provider includes a period of incapacity of more than 3 consecutive calendar days that also involves treatment two or more times by a health care provider, or treatment by a health care provider on at least one occasion that results in a regimen of continuing treatment provided under the supervision of the health care provider. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.114. Based on the evidence in the record below, we find that the appellant suffered from a serious health condition (chronic back pain) involving a period of incapacity of more than 3 consecutive calendar days and treatment on more than two occasions by health care providers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial appeal to the Board, the appellant alleged that he suffered severe back pain and negative side effects from prescribed medication. The appellant submitted medical documentation to the administrative judge in support of these claims....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Thus, the appellant has presented medical evidence that he suffered from chronic back pain before, during, and after the period he was charged with AWOL, that he was incapacitated for a period of more than 3 days, and that his treatment involved more than two sessions with various health care providers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant provided sufficient notice to implicate his FMLA rights when he telephoned the agency on his next scheduled work day following the February 5, 1998, injury and requested sick leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.303(b) (the employee need not expressly assert rights under the FMLA or even mention the FMLA, but may only state that leave is needed). It is undisputed that the appellant requested that his absences be covered under the FMLA. It is also undisputed that the agency repeatedly refused to consider the appellant's FMLA requests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant has raised nonfrivolous factual allegations that FMLA-qualifying leave was involved, the agency bears the burden of showing that it complied with the FMLA in its removal of the appellant on leave-related charges. <span class="Italic">See Ellshoff,</span> 76 MSPR at 73. The agency has not attempted to rebut the appellant's medical evidence and concedes that it refused to consider the appellant's requests for FMLA leave based on its determination that he was not an eligible employee....&#8197;Accordingly, the removal action cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[The analysis in <span class="Italic">Moore</span> of the relationship of the Back Pay Act and FMLA is covered in Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-089.html#sec16-88">Leave Account; FMLA; Military Leave</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span> was elaborated on in <span class="Italic">Gardner v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 9, 12-14 (1998), noting that the Board independently assesses FMLA entitlement and that the burden is on the agency to request medical documents from the employee to justify FMLA leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time the appellant filed his appeal, an appellant's use of the provisions of the FMLA in response to a charge of AWOL or failure to follow leave-requesting procedures was governed by the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Ramey v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 MSPR 463, 468 (1996). In <span class="Italic">Ramey,</span> we found that "[t]he FMLA...may be a relevant and material defense to a charge that requires proof of failure to follow leave procedures." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We further found that an AWOL charge must also be examined with regard to a properly raised FMLA claim. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 469. However, because we treated an FMLA claim as a defense under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(C), the burden of raising and proving this defense was placed on the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 467.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We subsequently modified our decision in <span class="Italic">Ramey</span> in <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 54 (1997), a decision issued shortly before the hearing in this case. In <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> we were persuaded that there was no basis for treating the FMLA and its implementing regulations differently from any other leave-related statute and regulations for the purpose of evaluating a leave-related charge. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 73. We therefore found "that where the facts, either specifically raised by the appellant or otherwise shown by the record evidence, implicate the FMLA relative to a leave-related charge, the Board will consider and apply the FMLA without shifting the burden of proof to the appellant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We limited consideration of the FMLA to cases where "an appellant raises nonfrivolous allegations, or the agency's evidence or allegations otherwise show that FMLA-qualifying leave was involved." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 74. Furthermore, the administrative judge was tasked with "the responsibility to develop the record evidence as necessary and appropriate, while considering administrative efficiency and fairness to the parties." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the evidence in this case was sufficient to trigger consideration of appellant's FMLA claims. In reaching this conclusion, we note several items of evidence contained in the record. First of all, on several of the PS Form 3971's the agency included in its response, the appellant indicated that his absence was due to illness. On one of these forms, he specifically alluded to the FMLA. <span class="Italic">Cf. Gross v. Department of Justice,</span> 77 MSPR 83, 88 (1997) ("An employee is not required to explicitly invoke the FMLA in requesting covered leave."); <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> 76 MSPR at 76. In addition, it was apparent from the appellant's appeal form that he believed that his illness and hospitalization excused his absences. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> 76 MSPR at 72 (finding that the administrative judge correctly considered the appellant's FMLA claim in connection with an AWOL charge where the appellant claimed in her petition for appeal that she was entitled to FMLA leave as a matter of right). At the hearing, the appellant alleged that the agency was aware of his medical condition, and this testimony is supported by the fact that the agency referred the appellant to the Employee Assistance Program on at least two occasions. Finally, Pouncy testified that employees who wish to justify an absence as sick leave are given 15 days after their return to work to provide the substantiating medical documentation. The appellant's representative argued that the appellant was not afforded this opportunity because he did not return to work after the agency proposed the appellant's removal. We find that these items of evidence indicate that FMLA-qualifying leave may have been involved, and the administrative judge should have considered the FMLA claims without shifting the burden of proof to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, with respect to the record's lack of medical certification covering the absences in question, we note that the FMLA does not require the employee to provide such documentation unless the employer requests it. The FMLA provides that "[a]n employer may require that a request for leave [on the basis of a "serious health condition"] be supported by a certification issued by the health care provider of the eligible employee...as appropriate. The employee shall provide, in a timely manner, a copy of such certification to the employer." 29 USC &#x00A7; 2613(a). The regulations implementing the FMLA provide that upon an employer's request to provide medical certification, "The employee must provide the requested certification within the time frame requested by the employer (which must allow at least 15 calendar days after the employer's request), unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent, good faith efforts." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.305(a). Because the FMLA provides a mechanism by which the agency can require an employee to provide medical certification, and the record does not indicate that the agency took advantage of that provision in this case, we do not attribute the record's current lack of medical documentation solely to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the fact that the Postal Service may discipline employees for their use of approved yet unscheduled leave, the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Ramey</span> stands for the proposition that, "If an adverse action is predicated on the agency's erroneous interference with an employee's rights under the FMLA, such adverse action is in violation of law, and it may not be sustained." <span class="Italic">Ramey</span>, 70 MSPR at 467. The decision in <span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span> shifted the burden of proof with respect to nonfrivolous FMLA claims to the agency. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> 76 MSPR at 73....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span> and <span class="Italic">Ramey</span> were followed in <span class="Italic">Gross v. DOJ</span>, 77 MSPR 83, 86-91 (1997), emphasizing the liberal interpretation of leave requests under FMLA, the burden of proof requiring the agency to justify its exercise of discretion against an employee who seeks leave under the Act, and the requirement that an AJ analyze AWOL offenses with regard for the purpose of the Act. <span class="Italic">Gross</span> concluded that an agency may not deny an employee leave under the FMLA for failure strictly to follow the agency's FMLA leave procedures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the FMLA, an "eligible" employee of a covered employer is entitled to unpaid leave, or paid leave, if earned, for a period of 12 weeks in any 12-month period because of the birth of a child or the placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or because the employee is needed to care for a covered family member, including a parent, with a serious health condition, or because the employee's own serious health condition renders him unable to perform his job. 5 USC &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1); <span class="Italic">see also Ramey v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 MSPR 463, 466 (1996), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds, Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior,</span> 76 MSPR 54, 73-74 (1997). A "serious health condition" is defined as "an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves--(A) inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility; or (B) continuing treatment by a health care provider[.]" 5 USC &#x00A7; 6381(5).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency bears the burden of proving that it properly denied FMLA leave in taking an AWOL-based action against an employee who is eligible for leave under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">See Ellshoff,</span> 76 MSPR at 73-74. Here, it is undisputed that the appellant is an "eligible" employee under the FMLA<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 6381(l).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the applicable interim regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), if the need for leave is foreseeable, the employee is required to provide the agency with not less than 30 days' notice. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1206(a). "If the need for leave is not foreseeable e.g., a medical emergency...the employee shall provide notice within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances involved." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1206(c). The FMLA places no additional notice obligation on the employee<span class="Italic">. See Ellshoff,</span> 76 MSPR at 75-76. However, "[i]f the need for leave is not foreseeable and the employee is unable, due to circumstances beyond his or her control, to provide notice of his or her need for leave, the leave may not be delayed or denied." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1206(c). While an agency may apply its own leave procedures to FMLA leave requests, an agency may not apply a more restrictive leave policy than that provided under the FMLA, and it may not deny an employee leave under the FMLA for failure to follow the agency's leave procedures. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1206(e). The agency may, of course, require that the employee provide administratively acceptable documentation to support an FMLA leave request. 5 USC &#x00A7; 6383(a); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.1206(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the facts as alleged by the parties are essentially undisputed. On December 5, 1995, the appellant submitted a request for annual leave from December 21, 1995, to December 31, 1995. The request was approved by Patrol Agent In Charge, John Munch. On December 18 or 19, 1995, Munch informed the appellant that, because the continuing resolution under which the agency was operating had expired on December 15, 1995, all previously approved leave was cancelled. By memorandum dated December 22, 1995, the agency officially notified employees that, because the continuing resolution under which it was operating had expired and another continuing resolution had not been enacted, it had no funding as of midnight on December 15, 1995, and it was imposing a furlough. The agency stated that it was cancelling leave because leave could not be granted for a nonworkday. During the furlough, the appellant's position was designated "excepted" and he was required to report for duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 23, 1995, the appellant telephoned his immediate supervisor, Nick Leonard, regarding his situation. Because Leonard was preoccupied with other matters, it was agreed that the appellant would submit a memorandum to Leonard explaining his situation. Later that day, the appellant went to see Leonard, who was preparing to leave work for the day. The appellant did not have the memorandum ready but stated that he would leave it for Leonard. On December 24, 1995, when Leonard returned to work, he found the appellant's memorandum. The signed memorandum, entitled "Renewing Leave Request," stated in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This memo is written to "renew my leave." This Leave would enable me to visit my mother for Christmas. My mother was stricken by congestive heart failure as determined by her attending physician at the Pioneer Hospital in Brawley, California., [sic] within the last two weeks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Cardiologist forecasted [sic] that this will be my mother's last Christmas, because of her failing condition; therefore, I find it absolutely necessary to be there for my mother this Christmas to visit, to take care of her affairs, and to make arrangements for her personal care before it's too late.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">I respectfully request that I be put on Furlough</span> since no leave is being approved due to the lack of a Continuing Resolution or passed Budget that would've permitted me to take my Annual Leave as pre-approved earlier this month by PAIC John E. Munch for this Christmas.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As previously noted, the agency placed the appellant in an AWOL status for 5 calendar days during his absence. In response to the suspension proposal notice, the appellant stated that he initially requested annual leave for the purpose of visiting his mother, who was ill and had suffered a heart attack on December 7, 1995. He stated that, initially, he was not disturbed by the cancellation of his annual leave because "his mother had recovered significantly from her heart attack of December 07, 1995." He stated, however, that, late in the evening of December 21, 1995, his brother telephoned him and informed him that his mother's condition had taken a turn for the worse and that he was needed in California "to assist in providing support, arrange for his mother's care, and to attempt to get her affairs in order." The appellant stated that he was in an off-duty status for 4 days and, when the agency failed to contact him, he left for California on December 25, 1995, to visit his mother. Additionally, the appellant submitted below medical documentation confirming that his mother, who was 67 years old at the time, and lived alone, had suffered acute congestive heart failure and had been hospitalized on December 7, 1995, in Pioneers Memorial Hospital, Brawley, California, and discharged on December 8, 1995. Therefore, he established that she had a "serious health condition" within the meaning of 5 USC &#x00A7; 6381(5).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an employee is not required to explicitly invoke the FMLA in requesting covered leave. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> 76 MSPR at 76. The agency has not disputed the appellant's allegation that he was needed to care for his seriously ill mother or the urgency or unforeseeability of the appellant's December 24, 1995 leave request for this purpose. The agency also has not, at any time, required the appellant to submit medical certification regarding his mother's condition. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 6383(a); 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 630.1206(f), 630.1207(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's actions in telephoning Leonard on December 23, 1995, regarding his mother's situation, visiting him the same day, and then leaving him a signed memorandum on December 24, 1995, as agreed, stating that the appellant was needed to care for his ill mother, explaining that she had suffered congestive heart failure and that her condition was serious were sufficient under the circumstances to satisfy the notice requirements of the FMLA and to invoke entitlement to leave under it even though the appellant did not explicitly invoke it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Antideficiency Act, 31 USC &#x00A7; 1341, provides in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)(1) An officer or employee of the United States Government or of the District of Columbia Government may not--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;make or authorize an expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an appropriation of fund for the expenditure or obligation; [or]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;involve either government in a contract or obligation for the payment of money before an appropriation is made unless authorized by law....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its December 22, 1995 Furlough Decision Notice, the agency stated that, "[u]nder the Antideficiency Act, no obligations may be incurred in the absence of appropriations except for the protection of human life or property, the orderly suspension of operations, or as otherwise authorized by law," and, thus, it was cancelling previously approved leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that the record demonstrates that, notwithstanding the furlough and the resulting cancellation of all leave, the agency retained some discretion in granting leave to "excepted" employees such as the appellant, as indicated in additional information the agency apparently provided its supervisors, i.e.:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The granting of paid leave to "excepted" (essential) or fee account employees is discretionary. However, in view of the situation, supervisors should be cautious about approving non-emergency leave which may be perceived as contrary to the intent of the furlough.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It follows logically then that, if the agency had the discretion to grant "excepted" employees paid leave, it also had the discretion to grant them LWOP because such grant did not require the agency to make or authorize an expenditure or obligation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carrow v. Veterans Administration</span>, 9 MSPB 251, 9 MSPR 630, 633 (1982) (LWOP is a temporary nonpay status and absence from duty granted upon the employee's request). As we noted in <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> 76 MSPR at 71, "[a]bsent a specific statutory or regulatory right to LWOP, an employee is not entitled to it as a matter of right, and the grant of LWOP is a matter committed to an agency's administrative discretion." Nevertheless, where disciplinary action results from an agency's denial of LWOP, the Board will review the circumstances to determine if the denial was reasonable. <span class="Italic">Joyner v. Department of the Navy,</span> 57 MSPR 154, 159 (1993); <span class="Italic">Fisher v. Department of Defense,</span> 54 MSPR 675, 679 (1992); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 54 MSPR 370, 372 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant did not request paid leave. He requested in his December 24, 1995 memorandum received by Leonard to be placed on furlough. We find that the appellant's request to be placed on furlough to care for his seriously ill mother, which he supported by specific information regarding her medical circumstances in his signed memorandum to Leonard...was tantamount to a request for emergency medical LWOP under the FMLA and was sufficient to place the agency on notice that the appellant was invoking the leave provisions of the FMLA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> 76 MSPR at 76. Therefore, we find that the agency's failure to grant the appellant LWOP under these circumstances was unreasonable. <span class="Italic">See Joyner</span>, 57 MSPR at 159; <span class="Italic">Fisher,</span> 54 MSPR at 679; <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 54 MSPR at 372. We further find under these circumstances that the agency's denial of LWOP violated the provisions of the FMLA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1); 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 630.1203(a), 630.1205(a), 630.1206(c), 630.1206(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an agency bases an adverse action on its interference with an employee's rights under the FMLA, the adverse action is a violation of law and cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Ramey</span>, 70 MSPR at 467. Here, we find that by failing to grant the appellant LWOP to care for his seriously ill mother, <span id="Page_2475"></span>and then placing him in AWOL status[3] and suspending him, the agency interfered with his rights under the FMLA<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. Therefore, the agency's action cannot be sustained<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note that the administrative judge initially adjudicated the appellant's claim that he was improperly placed on AWOL as a separate claim warranting a jurisdictional showing. We find, however, that the agency's placement of an employee in AWOL status must be examined where the employee claims entitlement to leave under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">See Ramey,</span> 70 MSPR at 469. Thus, in such a situation, AWOL need not be considered as a separate charge requiring a showing of Board jurisdiction. Because, however, the administrative judge ultimately considered the appellant's placement in AWOL status in determining whether the agency proved by preponderant evidence that it properly placed the appellant in such status, any error by the administrative judge in regard to the AWOL jurisdictional issue did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights, <span class="Italic">see Panter v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed adverse action against an employee who did not properly follow the procedures established for FMLA leave when, in defense to an AWOL-based adverse action, the employee asserted that the leave should have been provided, <span class="Italic">Bradley v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Ms. Bradley argues that she was not AWOL and instead was on family leave. For relief, she requests restoration to her old position with an increase in pay and a promotion. The agency responds that the Board considered all of the relevant facts, that the Board applied the correct law, and that the Board's decision is correct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no error in the Board's decision in this case. The Board's finding that Ms. Bradley was AWOL and failed to follow proper leave procedures from November 19, 2003, to December 29, 2003, is supported by substantial evidence. While there is no question that the birth of a child entitles an employee to leave under the Family Medical Leave Act, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1)(A) (2000), it is still necessary for the employee to "provide the employing agency with not less than 30 days' notice, before the date the leave is to begin, of the employee's intention to take leave under such subparagraph, except that if the date of the birth...requires leave to begin in less than 30 days, the employee shall provide such notice as is practicable." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6382(e) (2000). In this case, there is no dispute that Ms. Bradley was absent from November 19, 2003, to December 29, 2003, and there is also no dispute that she did not provide the proper medical documentation or request leave at any point either before or after her absence.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Williams also argues that his AWOL should not have been charged, and that he should have been offered FMLA leave instead. The arbitrator appears not to have directly addressed whether FMLA could or should have affected the decision to remove. However, this omission is irrelevant because, as the government correctly states, it is incumbent upon the employee to request FMLA leave pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 630.1203, 630.1206, and 630.1207. The arbitrator found that Williams failed to provide notice as required no less than 30 days prior to a foreseeable leave, or within a reasonable time if the circumstances requiring leave are emergent. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1206. He also failed to provide required medical documentation. <span class="Italic">See Id.</span> &#x00A7; 630.1207.

In such case, he must invoke FMLA within two workdays of returning. Substantial evidence shows that Williams did not present a non-frivolous invocation of FMLA before the fact, and was not entitled to it after the fact.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brantley v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 296 Fed. Appx. 65 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) (agency properly denied FMLA leave for lack of proper supporting medical documentation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal from the MSPB through mixed-case judicial review, the Ninth Circuit concluded that an agency acted properly when it removed for AWOL an employee who failed properly to document a FMLA request, <span class="Italic">Lewis v. United States</span>, 641 F.3d 1174, 1176-78 (9th Cir. 2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the FMLA, a federal employee is entitled to up to twelve weeks of unpaid leave within a twelve-month period if he or she has a "serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's position." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1)(D). The employing agency may require that the employee provide a medical certification to support an FMLA request for leave. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 6383(a). Relevant here, the Act provides that a medical certification "shall be sufficient if it states [among other things] the appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider regarding the condition." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 6383(b)(3); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1207(b)(3) (requiring that a medical certification state "[t]he appropriate medical facts within the knowledge of the health care provider regarding the serious health condition, including a general statement as to the incapacitation, examination, or treatment that may be required by a health care provider").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lewis challenges the MSPB's finding that "none of the documents submitted by [Lewis] to the agency in support of her FMLA leave provide[s] sufficient medical facts to support the conclusion that appellant is suffering from a serious health condition." We conclude that the MSPB's finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lewis's WH-380 form states only that she was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and needed therapy, medical treatment, bed rest, two prescription medications, and 120 days off work. The form, however, fails to provide a summary of the medical facts that support this diagnosis. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(b)(3) (requiring the certification to state "the appropriate medical facts"). The form contains no explanation as to why Lewis was unable to perform her work duties and no discussion about whether additional treatments would be required for her condition. When Lewis refused to submit any further documentation, her medical certification remained deficient.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lewis argues that her certification was sufficient because of the MSPB's discussion in <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Department of Interior,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. 54 (M.S.P.B. 1997). Lewis is mistaken. In <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> the MSPB held that a doctor's report can be a satisfactory medical certification if it contains the minimum statutory requirements under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(b). 76 M.S.P.R. at 77. Because Lewis's documentation failed to meet the minimum statutory requirements, Ellshoff does not support her. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Novak v. MetroHealth Med. Ctr.,</span> 503 F.3d 572, 578-79 (6th Cir. 2007) (holding that a medical certification form under a related FMLA provision is insufficient where it lacks a statement of "the appropriate medical facts within the healthcare provider's knowledge" to support the FMLA claim).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on <span class="Italic">Dias v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 53, 55-56 (M.S.P.B. 2006), Lewis next argues that disputes as to the adequacy of an employee's medical certification can be resolved only by the employer's requiring the employee to submit second and even third opinions. We disagree. The need for second or third opinions is triggered only when an employer "has reason to doubt the validity" of the medical certification. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(c)(1). DeShasier testified, and the ALJ credited, that she doubted the <span class="Italic">sufficiency</span>, not the <span class="Italic">validity</span>, of the documentation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Substantial evidence supports the MSPB's finding that Lewis's WH-380 form and the two doctors' notes did not provide the minimum information required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6383(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lewis also contends that the MSPB erred in finding that the Agency did not violate her FMLA rights by requesting Lewis to provide medical documentation beyond the documentation required by the FMLA, even after she had provided a WH-380 medical certification form. As discussed above, Lewis submitted an incomplete WH-380 form and refused to submit further documentation. Because Lewis failed to submit the minimal mandated medical certification, which requires less detailed information than the information sought by the Agency, she cannot show any harm arising from the Agency's request for more documentation than is required under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">See Burge v. Dep't of Air Force,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 75, 85 (M.S.P.B. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ALJ properly rejected Lewis's argument that the Agency failed to give her adequate time to provide the medical certification. Regulations require that the Agency provide an employee at least fifteen days and, if that period is "not practicable," that the Agency provide "a reasonable period of time under the circumstances involved," to a maximum of thirty days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1207(h). Here, the record reflects that the Agency requested certification no later than November 20, 2006, and that, because of the unavailability of Lewis's doctor, Lewis was given until December 13, 2006, to provide sufficient medical certification. Lewis has not provided any reason why this period of twenty-two days did not meet the regulatory requirements that the Agency provide "a reasonable period of time under the circumstances involved." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lewis asserts that the MSPB erred in finding that she had not complied with the requirements of the FMLA because, she contends, she submitted adequate medical documentation to the human resources department in support of her workers' compensation claim. The record shows that Lewis submitted a workers' compensation claim to the Agency with medical documents and a detailed diagnosis. But Lewis did not deliver this <span id="Page_2476"></span>documentation to DeShasier. Instead, Lewis specifically requested that the human resources department keep her medical records confidential and out of the hands of DeShasier. Because of these facts, substantial evidence supports the MSPB's finding that "appellant refused to provide any additional information or documentation" aside from the two letters and the WH-380 form.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fairley v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 588, 590-92 (1999), summarized the burdens of proof and the necessity for the agency and Board to develop information pertaining to FMLA entitlement based on information provided by the appellant on the need for his absences:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[B]ecause the administrative judge also lacked the Board's guidance in <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior,</span> 76 MSPR 54, 74 (1997), at the time the initial decision was issued, we find that a remand is necessary to determine if any of the six absences upon which the charged misconduct was based are covered under the FMLA.[1] Prior to <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> the Board treated an FMLA claim as an affirmative defense and the burden of proving that defense was placed on the appellant. <span class="Italic">Ramey v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 MSPR 463, 467 (1996). In <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> the Board found that there was no basis for treating the FMLA differently from any other leave-related statute, and found "that where the facts, either specifically raised by the appellant or otherwise shown by record evidence, implicate the FMLA relative to a leave related charge, the Board will consider and apply the FMLA without shifting the burden of proof to the appellant." <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> 76 MSPR at 73. Thus, where an appellant raises nonfrivolous factual allegations reasonably relating to an FMLA claim, or the agency's evidence or allegations otherwise show that FMLA-qualifying leave was involved, the administrative judge has the responsibility to develop the record evidence as necessary and appropriate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 74. An appellant is not specifically required to invoke the FMLA in requesting covered leave. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 76. <span class="Italic">See also Gross v. Department of Justice,</span> 77 MSPR 83, 88 (1997). The appellant must merely present sufficient evidence to trigger consideration of the absences under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">Gardner v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 MSPR 9, 13 (1998). The agency then bears the burden of proving that it properly denied FMLA leave in taking a leave-based action against the employee<span class="Italic">. Ellshoff</span> at 73-75; <span class="Italic">Gross</span> at 86.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Under the FMLA, an "eligible" employee of a covered employer is entitled to unpaid leave, or paid leave, if earned, for a period of 12 weeks in any 12-month period because of a birth of a child or the placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or because the employee is needed to care for a covered family member, including a parent, with a serious health condition, or because the employee's own serious health renders him unable to perform his job. 5 USC &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant stipulated to the charged misconduct and the stipulated issues make no reference to the FMLA. Nonetheless, viewing the record as a whole, there is evidence that should have placed the agency and the administrative judge on notice that the reasons for the appellant's absences, the underlying basis for the agency's charges, may be covered by the FMLA. The five instances of attendance infractions cited in support of the first charge of failure to be regular in attendance, and the second charge of AWOL, include references to emergency annual leave and unscheduled sick leave. The PS Forms 3971 (Request for or Notification of Absence) covering this time period frequently refer to appellant's illness. The narrative to charge two in the notice of proposed removal makes reference to the appellant's belief that he had a blood clot in his leg on the date he was charged AWOL. The agency also includes a copy of a medical certificate dated February 19, 1996, from the appellant's personal physician, in which he states, "Mr. Fairley has been under my care for thrombophlebitis." In addition, the appellant alludes to his right to utilize leave when he states in his petition for appeal that "emergency annual cannot be scheduled." We also note that the administrative judge's penalty discussion includes reference to the appellants argument that his wife's illness should be considered as a mitigating factor in assessing the removal penalty. Although the record evidence refers to the fact that the appellant's wife was ill and subsequently died, there is little evidence in the record on the time frames of these circumstances or whether they may be related to possible FMLA claims. Thus, to the extent that the FMLA may impact on the appellant's absences, and in light of the changes in Board law since the issuance of the initial decision, the administrative judge should afford the appellant the opportunity to litigate the FMLA issue and the administrative judge should develop the record evidence as necessary and appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Byers v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 456, 459 (1998) (interpreting <span class="Italic">Ellshoff, supra</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Black v. USPS,</span> CH-0752-10-0649-I-1 (NP 7/28/2011), rejected the argument that the agency improperly requested additional medical documentation rather than recertify the appellant for FMLA leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant argues that he visited the Department of Veterans Affairs for medical treatment and supplied the medical documentation to the agency, and he explains that his prescription medication affected his ability to drive such that he could not perform the essential functions of his position. Even in light of these arguments, however, the appellant's participation in the softball tournament while engaging in many of the same physical movements that were required of him at work was fundamentally inconsistent with his representation to the agency that he was incapacitated during that period of time. We find that the administrative judge properly weighed the evidence and concluded that the appellant provided incorrect information about his medical condition with the intent to deceive the agency. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice,</span> 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have also considered the appellant's arguments that the agency committed harmful error by requesting additional medical information rather than recertification. Given the appellant's participation in the softball tournament during a period in which he was on approved Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) leave for debilitating flare-ups, we find that the agency's requests for further medical documentation once it had reason to suspect the legitimacy of the appellant's leave requests were not inconsistent with the FMLA regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 825.305(a), 825.308(c)(3). The appellant has failed to demonstrate by preponderant evidence that the agency's decision was not in accordance with law or that the agency erred in the application of its procedures in a manner that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(1), (3) &#x0026; (c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(1), (3) &#x0026; 1201.4(r)]. Furthermore, the appellant's reliance on <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Jernberg Industries, Inc.</span>, 677 F. Supp.2d 1042 (N.D. Ill. 2010), which concerned a company's doctor's note policy that discouraged the plaintiff from taking his FMLA-certified leave, is misplaced. Unlike <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, here the agency had an honest suspicion that the appellant obtained FMLA leave based on false pretenses, and we find that the agency was justified in requesting additional medical documentation once it received information that casted doubt upon the appellant's stated reason for his absences. <span class="Italic">See Jackson</span>, 677 F. Supp.2d at 1052-53; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.308(c)(3).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. DOD</span>, DC-0752-13-0065-I-1 (NP 5/16/2014) ("Thus, although the agency repeatedly advised the appellant that his request for FMLA leave must be supported by appropriate documentation, the appellant failed to provide the agency the documentation to support his request. Therefore, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency properly denied the appellant's request for FMLA leave. Accordingly, the administrative judge correctly found that the agency proved the AWOL charge.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If some of an appellant's absences should be excused under FMLA, but others should not, the Board assesses whether the agency's penalty is reasonable as to the unexcused absences. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 112 MSPR 173, 179-80 &#x00B6; 15, 2009 MSPB 165 (2009) (appellant's FMLA request was not invoked for the reason supplied on a particular day of absence);<span class="Italic"> Byers v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 456, 462-63 (1998); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Young v. VA</span>, 83 MSPR 187, 192-93 &#x00B6; 11 (1999) ("Because the appellant's unpaid leave lasted for more than 12 weeks, the FMLA does not preclude sustaining the charge of excessive use of unpaid leave here."). For the application of FMLA provisions to NAFI employees, and for a discussion of the judicial review provisions of the statute, refer to <span class="Italic">Mann v. Haigh</span>, 120 F.3d 34 (4th Cir. 1997). <span class="Italic">Young</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, also discusses regulatory requirements governing notice to employers by employees who seek leave. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 36-37.
