<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-287"><span class="space">I.</span> DESIGNATION OF SENSITIVE POSITIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE, Dept. of Educ. Council of AFGE Locals and Dept. of Educ.</span>, 38 FLRA 1068, 1079 (1990), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied as to other proposals</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Minerals Mgmt. Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 969 F.2d 1158 (D.C. Cir. 1992), rejected negotiability of Section B of Proposal 2, setting some criteria for the designation of "sensitive" positions for purposes of drug testing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The employer agrees that designations of "sensitive" employees pursuant to E.O. 12564 shall be done in strict accordance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and this agreement. Only employees who occupy positions within agencies at a level of responsibility that could have a direct, material, adverse effect on national security, law enforcement, protection of life and property, public health and safety, may be designated as "sensitive."</p>
<p class="noindent">Section B was nonnegotiable, 38 FLRA at 1081-83:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 3(a) of Executive Order No. 12564 requires the head of each Executive agency to "establish a program to test for the use of illegal drugs by employees in sensitive positions." Section 7(d) of the Executive Order provides that "employee in a sensitive position" refers to: (1) an employee in a position designated by the agency head as having a sensitivity level of 2-4 under Chapter 731 of the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) or in a position which the agency head designates as sensitive under Executive Order No. 10450; (2) an employee who is granted access to classified information or who may be granted such access under Section 4 of Executive order No. 12356, 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 401 note; (3) Presidential appointees; (4) law enforcement officers as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20); and (5) other positions that the agency head determines involve law enforcement, national security, the protection of life and property, public health or safety, or other functions requiring a high degree of trust and confidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states that the first sentence of section B "seeks to have the [A]gency comply with E.O. 12564 in the designation of 'sensitive' positions."... We find that the wording of the first sentence of section B is consistent with the union's statement of intent and that the effect of the first sentence of section B is to require the Agency to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations when it designates employees in sensitive positions under the Executive Order. As we stated in our discussion of Proposal 1, above, a proposal which merely requires an agency to comply with applicable law and regulation could constitute a negotiable procedure under section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute or an "appropriate arrangement" under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the second sentence of section B creates an exception to the first sentence by providing that only those employees who occupy positions within the Agency at a level of responsibility that could have a direct, material, adverse effect on national security, law enforcement, protection of life and property, or public health and safety may be designated as "sensitive." The terms of the second sentence of section B modify the terms of section 7(d)(5) of the Executive Order by making designation of sensitive positions under section B more restrictive than under section 7(d)(5) of the Executive Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that "[t]he second sentence refers only to the requirements of E.O. 12564 and merely repeats the criteria of the Order[.]"... We disagree. Section 7(d)(5) requires the agency head to designate as "sensitive" all employees in positions that the agency head determines involve law enforcement, national security, the protection of life and property, public health or safety, or other functions requiring a high degree of trust and confidence. Under the proposal, the agency head may designate as "sensitive" only employees in positions "at a level of responsibility that could have a direct[,] material, adverse effect" on national security, law enforcement, protection of life and property, or public health and safety. These are all areas specified in section 7(d)(5). The second sentence of section B, however, would not permit an agency head to designate as "sensitive" those employees in positions that involve functions requiring a high degree of trust and confidence within the meaning of section 7(d)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By limiting in this manner the agency head's ability to designate sensitive positions...the second sentence of section B establishes a class of positions which may be designated as "sensitive" positions that is more limited than the class established under section 7(d) of the Executive Order. By creating a more restricted class of positions...the second sentence of section B prevents the Agency from designating as "sensitive" positions which it would otherwise be able to designate under section 7(d)(5) of the Executive Order. Therefore...[the] second sentence of section B is inconsistent with section 7(d)(5) of the Executive Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By precluding the Agency from designating employees in sensitive positions consistent with section 7(d)(5) of the Executive Order, the proposal would exclude from the Agency's drug testing program employees who may be tested under that program in accordance with section 3(a) of the Executive Order. We find, therefore, that section B of Proposal 2 is inconsistent with Executive Order No. 12564 because it prevents the Agency from designating and, therefore, from testing employees in sensitive positions consistent with the Executive Order. Because section B of Proposal 2 is inconsistent with Executive Order No. 12564, we conclude that it is nonnegotiable under section 7117(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We need not address the Union's contention that the proposal is an "appropriate arrangement"...because we have found that the proposal is inconsistent with Executive Order No. 12564, which is accorded the force and effect of law.... Section 7106(b)(3) does not make negotiable a matter which is inconsistent with law other than the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whether a union could negotiate for a provision defining the positions subject to testing was considered in <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 3097 and DOJ, Justice Mgmt. Div.</span>, 42 FLRA 412, 441-44 (1991), Proposal 12 soliciting agreement that "[a]ny positions designated as testing designated positions ([T]DP) shall be only those positions which require that the duties of the incumbent have a top secret security clearance, and shall not include positions in which the incumbent has a top secret security clearance for duties that are not required for the position in question." The proposal was nonnegotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 12 provides that only those positions with duties requiring the incumbents to hold top secret security clearances may be designated for random drug testing.&#x2003;The proposal also specifically excludes from TDP designation positions held by employees with top secret clearances when the clearances are not required for the duties assigned to the positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The term "testing designated position," or "TDP" does not appear in Executive Order 12564. Rather, that term is used in section 3.a(2)ii of FPM Letter 792-19 to identify "which positions will actually be tested." Section 3.a(2)ii states that "an agency head may determine not to designate all sensitive positions as TDPs, but may limit testing to certain positions." Accordingly, to the extent that Proposal 12 would prevent the Agency from identifying certain positions as TDPs, it is not inconsistent with the discretion in identifying positions as TDPs, it is not inconsistent with the FPM Letter. Instead, the FPM Letter allows agencies discretion in identifying positions as TDPs....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Proposal 12 is not inconsistent with the FPM Letter, we conclude that the proposal is nevertheless nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals prescribing substantive criteria governing the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute directly interfere with that right. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation</span>, 39 FLRA at 1526. Management's right under section 7106(a)(1) includes the right to conduct random <span id="page_826"></span>drug tests. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1527. Proposal 12 would limit the Agency's right to designate TDPs to "only those positions which require that the duties of the incumbent have a top secret security clearance[.]" Contrary to the Union's explanation, the proposal does not address only those TDPs that have been designated because they require certain security clearances. Instead, the plain wording of the proposal restricts the identification of all TDPs. That is, instead of constituting a restriction on the Agency's right to designate one class of TDPs, the proposal addresses all such positions. As the Union's interpretation of the proposal is inconsistent with its plain wording, we base our analysis of the proposal on its plain wording. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 38 FLRA 1366, 1373 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 12 would limit the types of positions that the Agency could designate as TDPs and, thereby, subject the incumbents of those positions to random testing. The proposal constitutes a substantive restriction on the Agency's right to conduct random testing. Therefore, we conclude that Proposal 12 directly interferes with management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having concluded that the proposal directly interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices, the proposal is nonnegotiable unless it constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. We conclude that the Union has failed to establish that Proposal 12 constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement under the criteria stated in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states that the proposal is an arrangement to prevent the random testing for drugs of employees who hold top secret security clearances but have no access to top secret information.&#x2003;The proposal would, thereby, benefit such employees by eliminating the adverse effects which may flow from being subject to the Agency's drug testing program. For example, the proposal would reduce the potential for an employee's privacy being invaded by a drug test. In addition it would reduce the possibility of false positive drug test results. Finally, the proposal would reduce the likelihood that employees would be disciplined as a result of confirmed positive drug tests. The proposal's broad scope severely restricts the Agency's discretion to determine what positions should be subject to random testing, however. By limiting TDP designation to positions involving access to top secret information, the proposal would prevent the Agency from subjecting any other positions to random testing. We find that such a broad restriction on the Agency's ability to designate TDPs and, thereby, to conduct random drug testing, excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. Therefore, we conclude that Proposal 12 is not an appropriate arrangement and is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOD, DLA and NAGE Local R14-52</span>, 56 FLRA 843, 846 (2000), set aside an arbitrator's award that restricted positions designated for testing to a classification of employees designated in a contract. The award restricted the "Agency head's discretion in a manner that is inconsistent with the Executive Order."</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">NFFE Council of GSA Locals and GSA</span>, 41 FLRA 728, 739, 741-51 (1991), Proposal 2 was negotiable, providing that "[i]f an employee believes his or her position has been wrongly designated a testing designated position, the employee may grieve the designation under the negotiated grievance procedure." FLRA took pains to explain the proposal's negotiability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Proposal 2, the Agency's designation of a position for random drug testing would be subject to challenge through the negotiated grievance procedure, if an employee believes his or her position "has been wrongly designated." The Union interprets the proposal as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The specific intent of the proposal would allow an employee to grieve, under the negotiated grievance procedure, if the employee believes his or her position has been wrongly designated as a testing designated position. GSA Order OAD 9700 Chapter 2, Section 3 lists the criteria for designating a position for random, drug testing. If the employee does not believe his or her position meets the criteria given in Chapter 2, Section 3, the employee can use the negotiated grievance procedure to challenge the designation of his or her position as a position designated for testing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject, at the outset, three Agency arguments. First, although the proposal would enable employees to challenge Agency compliance with the GSA Order, the proposal would not incorporate in the parties' agreement the criteria contained in the order. The Union states, in this regard, that it "has no intention of incorporating the criteria into the collective bargaining agreement...." As such, we reject the Agency's argument that the proposal is nonnegotiable because "incorporation into the agreement of specific terms would impose an independent contractual requirement" on the exercise of the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. Put simply, incorporation of the proposal in the parties' agreement would not affect, in any way, the Agency's ability to modify, eliminate, or replace its existing regulatory provision concerning the designating of positions for drug testing. The proposal would require only that "when management acts, it does so in accordance with applicable...directives existing at the time."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, we reject the Agency's argument that the proposal directly interferes with its right to direct employees. Nothing in the proposal, as plainly worded, or in the Union's interpretation of the proposal, would affect in any way the Agency's rights to establish performance standards or critical elements. The Agency's argument is without merit and we will not address it further.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, we reject the Agency's argument that the proposal is nonnegotiable because inclusion of it in the parties' agreement would enable an arbitrator "to substitute his or her judgement for management's in deciding whether a position meets management's criteria for test designation." An "assertion that an arbitrator's judgment may be substituted for its own is not a basis for finding a proposal to be nonnegotiable."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question remains, however, as to whether, by requiring the Agency to designate positions as subject to testing in accordance with the criteria set forth in its regulations, Proposal 2 is nonnegotiable because it violates the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. We are guided, with respect to this issue, by the Authority's decision in [<span class="Italic">AFGE Dept. of Educ. Council of AFGE Locals and Dept. of Educ.</span>, 38 FLRA 1068 (1990)].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 in <span class="Italic">Education</span> required the agency to establish and administer its drug-testing program in "strict compliance with the U.S. Constitution and all applicable laws, rules and regulations and [the parties'] agreement." 38 FLRA at 1074. As particularly relevant here, the disputed proposal in <span class="Italic">Education</span> "would allow challenges through the grievance and arbitration procedure to Agency actions concerning the establishment and administration of its drug testing program." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1078.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding the disputed proposal in <span class="Italic">Education</span> to be negotiable, the Authority noted previous decisions holding that proposals which merely required an agency to exercise its rights in accordance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and which enabled a union to enforce such compliance through a negotiated grievance procedure, were negotiable. The Authority stated, however, that the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA</span>, 110 S. Ct. 1623 (1990) (<span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>), required a reexamination of the Authority's previous decisions. In particular, the Authority pointed to the following statement by the Court:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The [Statute] does not empower unions to enforce all "external limitations" on management rights, but only limitations contained in "applicable laws." Or to put the point differently, there <span class="Italic">are</span> no "external limitations" on management rights, insofar as union powers under &#x00A7; 7106(a) are concerned, other than the limitations imposed by "applicable laws."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority noted that the disputed proposal in <span class="Italic">Education</span> involved the exercise of management's right under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute to determine its internal security practices. The Authority stated, in this regard, that unlike management's right to contract out under section 7106(a)(2), which was addressed by the Court in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, "[t]he literal wording of section 7106(a)(1)...does not contain a requirement that management exercise the rights enumerated in that section 'in accordance with applicable laws.'" 38 FLRA at 1076. The Authority reached the following conclusion on this point:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Given the wording of section 7106(a)(1), therefore, the logical extension of the Court's conclusion in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> is that nothing in section 7106(a) of the Statute would require management, in the context of a collective bargaining relationship, to exercise its rights under section 7106(a)(1) in accordance with applicable laws. Further, consistent with the Court's conclusion, section 7106(a) of the Statute does not, standing alone, empower unions to enforce through collective bargaining any "external limitations" on the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(1), including those contained in applicable laws.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority concluded, based on this analysis, that by requiring the agency to exercise its right to determine its internal security practices in accordance with external legal limitations, the disputed proposal directly interfered with that right....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also concluded, however, that although section 7106(a) of the Statute does not subject the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(1) to compliance with applicable laws and regulations, all management rights, including those under section 7106(a)(1), are subject to subsection (b) of section 7106. As such, a proposal requiring an agency to exercise its section 7106(a)(1) rights in accordance with applicable law and regulation "may be negotiable if it constitutes a procedure under section 7106(b)(2) or if it constitutes an 'appropriate arrangement' under section 7106(b)(3)." <span class="Italic">Education</span>, 38 FLRA at 1077. As relevant here, the Authority found that the disputed proposal was intended as, and <span id="page_827"></span>constituted, an arrangement, within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3). The Authority concluded as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In our view,...employees' interest in maintaining the protections afforded them under the Constitution and applicable laws, rules and regulations outweighs the Agency's interest in insulating its actions from challenges through the negotiated grievance and arbitration procedure. The Agency has not demonstrated that a requirement that it act in a manner consistent with laws, rules and regulations excessively interferes with its right to determine internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1). Indeed, the existence of applicable laws, rules and regulations already serves to limit agency action and indicates that an agency's interest in being able to act without regard to those provisions and without challenge to the legality of its action, such as in arbitration procedures, is negligible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1078. Accordingly, the Authority concluded that the disputed proposal was a negotiable appropriate arrangement....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Proposal 2 would, consistent with the parties' understanding, require the Agency to comply with its internal regulation, the GSA Order, in designating the positions subject to drug testing. The Agency asserts that the designation of positions subject to testing constitutes the exercise of its right to determine internal security practices. Consistent with our analysis of Proposal 1, above, as well as the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Education</span>, we find it unnecessary to resolve that issue. Instead, we conclude that even if the designation of the positions subject to testing constitutes the exercise of management's right, and even assuming that requiring the Agency to comply with its regulation directly interferes with that right, Proposal 2 is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he benefit afforded employees by the proposal is significant. Employees could, through the proposal, challenge through negotiated grievance and arbitration procedures the Agency's compliance with its regulation in designating their positions as subject to drug testing. By providing a forum in which to raise concerns over such designation, employee confidence in the drug-testing program as a whole and the Agency's administration of the program should be enhanced. Moreover, without addressing the extent, if any, to which the Agency's compliance with its regulation could be challenged in another forum, negotiated grievance and arbitration procedures generally are accessible to all unit employees. Indeed, the Statute requires such procedures to be "fair and simple, [and] provide for expeditious processing[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121 (b) (1) and (2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the latter point, the Union argues that Proposal 2 is negotiable because it merely defines the scope of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. The Union points out, with respect to this point, that grievances involving designations of positions for testing are not excluded from the scope of a negotiated grievance procedure by section 7121(c) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear, in this regard, that the grievances contemplated by Proposal 2 are not among the exclusions to negotiated grievance procedures required by the Statute. It is also clear, however, that with respect to a proposal which would subject the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a) of the Statute to negotiated grievance procedures, section 7121(c) of the Statute does not, standing alone, provide a basis for finding the proposal negotiable. In <span class="Italic">IRS v. NTEU</span>, the Court held as follows with respect to the relationship between sections 7106 and 7121(c) as they affect grievances over agency decisions resulting from the exercise of a management right:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Subsection 7121(c) removes these agency decisions from the coverage of <span class="Italic">only</span> &#x00A7; 7121(a)'s negotiated grievance provisions, yet does so whether or not the decisions are made in accordance with applicable laws; 7106(a) removes the decisions from the coverage of the <span class="Italic">entire</span> Act, but only to the extent the decisions are in accordance with applicable laws. Thus, although &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7106(a) and 7121(c) sometimes overlap in their treatment of these enumerated agency decisions (each removes the decisions from the coverage of &#x00A7; 7121(a) when they are made in accordance with applicable laws), each provision has quite a distinct effect on them as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">110 S.&#x2003;Ct. at 1628...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the Court's holding, we reject the Union's argument that Proposal 2 is negotiable based solely on the fact that the grievances encompassed by the proposal are not among the exclusions to negotiated grievance procedures listed in section 7121(c). Nevertheless, in weighing the benefits afforded employees by the proposal against the adverse impact on management's rights resulting from it, it is appropriate in our view to consider that grievance procedures are statutorily mandated and that "arbitration is as much a part of the system of self-government in the federal service as in the private sector."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement, we weigh "the competing practical needs of employees and managers" to determine whether the benefit to employees afforded by the proposal outweighs the burden placed by it on the exercise of management's right.... In this case, we conclude that the adverse impact on the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices is minimal. The Agency has not, in this regard, asserted an interest in acting without regard to its regulation and no such interest is apparent to us. Indeed, "[i]t is a familiar rule of administrative law that an agency must abide by its own regulations."... With particular regard to the designation of positions as subject to drug testing, the Agency also has an interest, in our view, in assuring employees that its designations are not based on inappropriate criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that the Agency's assertion is not based on the content of its regulation. That is, the Agency does not assert that its regulation is, in any way, impossible of review or application by an arbitrator. Moreover, as noted previously, the Agency is free under Proposal 2 to modify, rescind, or replace the regulatory criteria by which it designates positions as subject to testing.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 3097 and DOJ, Justice Mgmt. Div.</span>, 42 FLRA 412, 444, 448-49 (1991), considered negotiable a procedure (Proposal 14) that an employee may appeal the designation of his or her position as a "TDP" (Testing Designated Position) at any time except at the time the employee is called for random testing. Without examining the appeal process that was not otherwise identified in its decision, FLRA determined that an agency regulation requiring appeals to be filed within 15 days from an employee's notice that his position has been identified as "TDP" was unsupported by a showing of compelling need. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 and Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv., Blue Ridge Parkway</span>, 43 FLRA 836, 845, 848 (1991), permitted the negotiability of Proposal 2C, designed to allow grievance and arbitration challenges to the designation of an employee's position as sensitive.</p>
