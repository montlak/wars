<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-68"><span class="space">3.</span> Collateral Result of Restoration Order; Action Related to Case Under Appeal</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">A Board order canceling a removal can have the effect of placing two employees in one position. According to <span class="Italic">Meier v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <span class="blue">3 MSPR 247</span>, 259, 3 MSPB 341 (1980), the agency should then take action to place one of the employees in another position. This is an entirely separate (possibly adverse) personnel action. It must be taken in accordance with applicable law and regulation for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. In most cases, action by the agency would take the form of reassigning the new employee to another position. Circumstances may justify reassignment of the restored employee. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-170.html#sec16-168">Compelling Reason for Reassignment; Detail; Different Duties</a>" for discussion on compliance.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"There are circumstances where the Board may enforce an appellant's right to relief from the consequences of an unjustified action over which the Board has jurisdiction when the appellant is clearly entitled to such relief under a statute or regulation." <span class="Italic">Holliman v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 355, 360 &#x00B6; 11 (1999). Initially, <span class="Italic">Lavelle v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 329, 332 (1989) (challenging a shift reassignment and a pay differential loss resulting from the appellant's alleged misconduct and occurring between the incident leading to suspension and the effective date of suspension) (and repeated in <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 31, 34-35 n.1 (1991)) (<span class="Italic">Lavelle</span> overruled by <span class="Italic">Mattern v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MATTERN_MAX_T_DC_0752_98_0264_R_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249881.pdf">88 MSPR 65</a>, 68-72 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-16 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Mattern v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 291 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2002)), determined that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[N]onappealable actions based on the alleged misconduct that were executed during the period of time between the alleged misconduct and the wrongful suspension must also be remedied. Appellant suffered a loss of 7.5% shift differential for eleven months prior to his suspension due to an agency action based on the alleged misconduct. A return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> requires a restoration of this pay. While appellant was not specific about the effective dates of his loss of differential pay, he has maintained from the beginning that he was entitled to it. At any rate, there is no statute or regulation limiting an appellant's relief to that sought in the petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Spaulding v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 612, 616-17 (1994), <span class="Italic">overruled in part by</span> <span class="Italic">Mattern v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MATTERN_MAX_T_DC_0752_98_0264_R_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249881.pdf">88 MSPR 65</a>, 72 n.3 (2001), <span class="Italic">post</span>, expanded on <span class="Italic">Lavelle</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency is ordered by the Board to cancel a disciplinary action, compliance with that order requires the agency to restore the appellant as nearly as possible to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante, i.e.</span>, the injured party is to be placed, as near as may be, in the situation he would have occupied if the wrong had not been committed. <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984). To ensure the agency's compliance, the Board has broad enforcement powers and must make a substantive assessment of an appellant's return to duty when faced with a compliance petition. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under its compliance jurisdiction, the Board has oversight to ensure that an appellant receives all compensation he normally would have earned had the unlawful personnel action not occurred. <span class="Italic">Lavelle v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the agency actions that the Board will consider in compliance proceedings, the scope of its enforcement authority generally extends only to the action originally appealed<span class="Italic">. Pickard v. Department of Transportation</span>, 25 MSPR 404, 407 (1984). The Board has determined, however, that to fashion a make-whole remedy which is consonant with the Back Pay Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596, and the Board's broad remedial powers, the analysis of the appellant's circumstances upon his return to his position must not be rigidly circumscribed by the effective date of the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. When an agency waits a significant length of time between the incident forming the basis of the charges against the appellant and the imposition of punishment and, in the intervening period, takes an action against the employee which is not appealable but results in a loss of pay to the employee, the Board will consider the nonappealable action in its consideration of the agency's compliance with its order to cancel the disciplinary action and return the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. Unless the agency took the action for a legitimate reason unrelated to the unlawful personnel action, the Board will cancel the intervening action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 91.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The critical factor in the Board's determination of whether its enforcement authority extends to an agency action beyond that originally appealed is whether the action at issue was within the Board's appellate jurisdiction. If it was an appealable action which the appellant chose not to pursue, the Board will not consider it. In contrast, if the action was not appealable, then the Board may consider such an action in its determination of whether the agency has fully complied with its orders. <span class="Italic">Lavelle</span>, 37 MSPR at 91 n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this instance, a 14-day suspension is not generally within the Board's appellate jurisdiction. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512. Therefore, the Board will consider the agency's action in determining whether the agency has complied with its Order<span class="Italic">. Lavelle</span>, 37 MSPR at 91.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note first that it is clear from the record that the incident on December 29, 1992, which formed the basis for the removal action, also precipitated the agency's decision to place the appellant in a LWOP status from December 29, 1992 through January 11, 1993. Therefore, the action was not taken for a legitimate management reason unrelated to the unlawful personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Lavelle</span>, 37 MSPR at 91.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, when the Board determines that the penalty imposed by the agency exceeds the bounds of reasonableness, it will mitigate the penalty to the maximum reasonable penalty based upon the sustained charges.... Consequently, when an agency is ordered to cancel a removal action and assess a penalty of no more than a 60-day suspension, as in this instance, the Board has determined that the penalty cannot exceed that amount. The appellant has served a 60-day suspension between February 12, 1993 and April 11, 1993. Therefore, by failing to accord the appellant back pay for the period from December 29, 1992 through January 11, 1993, the agency has effectively imposed a punishment of a 74-day suspension, which is not in compliance with the administrative judge's Order. Consequently, we find that the agency is not in full compliance in this respect and direct it to award the appellant back pay for the period between December 29, 1992 and January 11, 1993.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has long recognized that the scope of its enforcement authority generally extends only to the action appealed. The Board has also held that, to fashion a make-whole remedy consonant with the Back Pay Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596, and the Board's broad remedial powers, the analysis of the appellant's circumstances pending an adverse personnel action and when he is returned to his position must not be rigidly circumscribed by the effective date of the personnel action. Otherwise nonappealable agency actions, related to the appealable actions, will be considered in determining whether the agency has fully complied with the Board's orders.

<p class="Body-Text">On OPM's reconsideration petition, however, the Board reversed its position in <span class="Italic">Mattern</span> and overruled <span class="Italic">Spaulding</span> in <span class="Italic">Mattern v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MATTERN_MAX_T_DC_0752_98_0264_R_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249881.pdf">88 MSPR 65</a>, 68-72 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-16 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Mattern v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 291 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2002), <span class="Italic">post</span>. The 2001 <span class="Italic">Mattern</span> decision severely limited the Board's authority to grant ancillary monetary relief by ruling that the Board's broad enforcement authority cannot remedy a nonappealable personnel action, even if that action was related to the action on appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency cancelled the removal and paid the appellant back pay for the period from the time of the removal until the time the appellant was restored to duty. It declined to pay the appellant the premium pay and other enhancements of his basic pay for the period during which he was on restricted duty and administrative leave during the period that preceded the removal action and during the interim relief period between the issuance of the initial decision on the merits and the date it became final. The appellant then filed a petition for enforcement, seeking payment of those amounts. The administrative judge assigned to the case granted the petition and found the appellant was entitled to the additional amounts he sought; and the Board subsequently issued its decision of March 28, 2000, and found the appellant was entitled to receive premium pay, night differential and overtime pay for the preremoval period and the interim relief period. <span class="Italic">Mattern v.</span> Department <span class="Italic">of Treasury,</span> 87 MSPR 352 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 12. The Board's March 28 order was based on its finding that the actions the agency took prior to the removal were related to the removal, and that it therefore was appropriate to consider those actions in determining whether the agency had complied fully with the order that the removal be cancelled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has now paid the disputed amounts. As we have noted above, however, the Director of OPM has exercised her statutory right to petition for reopening of this compliance case. In support of her petition, she argues that the Board does not have jurisdiction over the appellant's placement on restricted duty or administrative leave, and that it therefore does not have the authority to order back pay for pay enhancements lost as a result of those actions. The appellant has responded in opposition to the Director's brief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM does not deny that the Board has the authority to adjudicate the appellant's removal, or that it has the authority, therefore, to require the employing agency to provide the appellant the pay and differentials he lost after he was removed. We therefore do not read OPM's petition as challenging the Board's order to award back pay, including premium pay, night differential, and overtime pay for the interim relief period that followed the appellant's removal. OPM argues, however, that the actions the agency took with respect to the appellant's duties prior to the removal are not within the Board's jurisdiction; that neither the Back Pay Act nor the Board's enabling legislation authorizes the Board to award back pay with respect to actions that are only related to appealable actions, but that are not appealable themselves; and that the Board's March 28 order is inconsistent with the holding in <span class="Italic">King v. Jerome,</span> 42 F.3d 1371, 1375-76 (Fed. Cir. 1994), that the Board may not create new remedies not authorized by Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find OPM's reliance on <span class="Italic">Jerome</span> persuasive. In that case, the court was addressing the Board's authority to enforce an employing agency's compliance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A), a provision governing interim relief. <span class="Italic">Jerome</span>, 42 F.3d at 1373. The present case, by contrast, concerns the Board's authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) to enforce compliance with orders it has issued under its adjudication authority. The Board's authority under the interim relief provision is limited by "the precise statutory language and framework set out by Congress in section 7701(b)(2)," while its enforcement authority under section 1204(a)(2) "was meant to be a broad grant of enforcement power."...<span class="Italic">Jerome</span>, 42 F.3d at 1374; <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National</span> <span class="Italic">Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As OPM notes, however, the Board's authority under section 1204(a)(2) is not unlimited. Instead, the Board may order an agency to award relief, and therefore may enforce such an order under section 1204(a)(2), only to the extent to which the federal government has waived its sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hubbard v. Merit</span> <span class="Italic">Systems Protection Board,</span> 205 F.3d 1315, 1317-19 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) (authorizing Board to order compliance with "any order or decision issued by the Board under the authority granted under" section 1204(a)(1)); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(1) (authorizing Board to adjudicate and take final action on "matters within the jurisdiction of the Board..."). A waiver of sovereign immunity is construed strictly, and may not be found unless it is unequivocally expressed in statutory text. <span class="Italic">See Hubbard,</span> 205 F.3d at 1317.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's previous conclusion that the appellant was entitled to the pay he sought, and its implicit finding that it had the authority to order that relief, was based on a holding first enunciated in <span class="Italic">Lavelle</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of the Navy,</span> 37 MSPR 86, 90-91 (1988). In that case, the Board held that the effects of a nonappealable action that was related to an appealable action should be considered in determining whether the agency complied with an order to cancel the appealable action, and that, unless the agency shows that the nonappealable action was effected for a reason unrelated to the charges on which the appealable action was based, the agency was required to compensate the employee for the effects of the nonappealable action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 91. This holding was based in part on the Back Pay Act of 1966, Pub.L. No. 89-380, 80 Stat. 94 (1966), as it has been codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596. <span class="Italic">Lavelle</span>, 37 MSPR at 89, 91.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Back Pay Act authorizes an award of back pay to an "employee...who, on the basis of a timely appeal or an administrative determination...is found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, [or] regulation...to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1). We interpret this language as expressly authorizing the Board--which is an "appropriate authority" for the adjudication of appeals within its jurisdiction--to order compensation (1) if it finds that a personnel action appealed to it is unjustified or unwarranted and (2) to the extent that the employee affected by that action has lost pay, allowances, or differentials as a result of the action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rose v. United States</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service,</span> 78 MSPR 547, 549-52 (1998) (agency ordered to provide overtime back pay for period from removal to reinstatement). Nothing in the language of section 5596, however, unequivocally expresses an intent to provide compensation for losses resulting from other actions, and nothing in that language unequivocally expresses an intent that the Board award such compensation based solely on the existence of a relationship such as that described in <span class="Italic">Lavelle.</span> In the absence of such unequivocal expressions of intent, we find that Congress, in enacting the Back Pay Act, authorized the Board to award back pay only to the extent that an employee lost pay as a result of an action the Board, acting within its jurisdiction, found unjustified or unwarranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no doubt that the appellant appealed his removal to the Board, and that the Board has jurisdiction over that action. The appellant did not appeal his placement on restricted leave or his subsequent placement on administrative leave to the Board, however. Nor has he shown that the Board has jurisdiction over those actions. <span class="Italic">See Fair v. Department of Transportation</span>, 5 MSPB 28, 4 MSPR 493, 495-96 (1981) (temporary assignments, with no reduction in grade or basic rate of pay, are not appealable to Board as reductions in pay, even if such assignments may result in loss of holiday pay, shift differentials, and other premium pay). In addition, it is clear that the differential pay at issue here was lost as a result of those actions, rather than as a result of the appellant's removal. We find, therefore, that the Back Pay Act does not authorize the Board to order payment of the differential pay in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that the <span class="Italic">Lavelle</span> holding described above was based in part on a decision of the U.S. Court of Claims, <span class="Italic">Summers v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 227 Ct. Cl. 353, 648 F.2d 1324 (1981). <span class="Italic">Lavelle,</span> 37 MSPR at 91. In referring to that decision, the Board indicated that the court had awarded overtime pay covering a "reassignment period preceding unlawful suspension." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The "reassignment" at issue there, however, was in fact found to be an adverse action appealable to the Board's predecessor. <span class="Italic">Summers</span>, 648 F.2d at 1327-29. The basis for the award of overtime pay in that case, therefore, was not that the "reassignment" preceded or was related to the suspension, but that it was itself an appealable adverse action for which compensation was authorized under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1327 (improperly effected adverse action constitutes "unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" under Back Pay Act, entitling employee to back pay).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the <span class="Italic">Lavelle</span> holding was based in part on an opinion of the Comptroller General, 1968 WL 2582 (Comp. Gen.)<span class="Italic">. Lavelle,</span> 37 MSPR at 91. The explanatory parenthetical in the Board's citation of that opinion could be regarded as suggesting that the Comptroller General found the employee in question to be entitled to premium pay in connection with a reassignment that occurred prior to his unjustified removal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> ("employee who was reassigned to day shift prior to removal may be paid premium pay...") The opinion itself, however, shows clearly that the period for which the Comptroller General found that premium pay was appropriate was a period following the employee's removal and preceding <span id="Page_4857"></span>his restoration--a period during which the employee would have earned premium pay but for his unjustified removal. Accordingly, this opinion also does not indicate that the Board may award compensation lost as a result of a nonappealable action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that a plausible argument could be made that the Board is required to review and overturn a nonappealable personnel action when that action is related to the one heard on appeal, and when overturning the nonappealable action is necessary in order to restore the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> indicates that the Board has been granted broad enforcement power, as we have noted above, and it also indicates that the Board has an obligation to place the injured employee as nearly as possible "in the situation he would have occupied if the wrong had not been committed." <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, 726 F.2d at 733 &#x0026; n.3 (quoting <span class="Italic">Wicker v. Hoppock,</span> 6 Wall. (73 U.S.) 94, 99, 18 L. Ed. 752 (1867)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that the "wrongs" the Board is authorized to remedy are limited to those actions made appealable to the Board by law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Nordhoff v. Department of the Navy,</span> 78 MSPR 88, 90-91 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 185 F.3d 886 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table). Nothing in <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> shows that the Board may remedy other such "wrongs." Moreover, as we have indicated above, a waiver of sovereign immunity is necessary if the Board is to have the authority to award relief, such a waiver is to be construed strictly; it may not be found unless it is unequivocally expressed in statutory language; and we can find no such unequivocally expressed waiver in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a) or in the language of the Back Pay Act. Finally, the appellant has identified no such express waiver in any other statutory provision, and we know of none.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we overrule <span class="Italic">Lavelle</span> and other decisions to the extent they are inconsistent with this Opinion,[3] and we find that the appellant is not entitled to the award of night differential pay, Sunday premium pay, holiday pay, and overtime pay for the preremoval period from November 25, 1996 through November 18, 1998, that we addressed in our decision of March 28, 2000.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Spaulding v. United States Postal Service</span>, 63 MSPR 612, 616 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal, <span class="Italic">Mattern v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 291 F.3d 1366, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2002), affirmed the limitations on Board jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Back Pay Act, codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, governs awards to federal employees subjected to a personnel action later found to be unjustified. When an employee is "found to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted <span class="Italic">personnel</span> action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part" of his pay, he is entitled to recover:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">[F]or the period for which the personnel action was in effect</span> (i) an amount equal to all of or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any amounts earned by the employee through other employment during that period....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i) (2000) (emphases added). OPM, which Congress charged with promulgating regulations to carry out this section, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 5596(c), has defined the statutory phrase "pay, allowances, or differentials" to include "pay, leave, and other monetary employment benefits to which an employee is entitled by statute or regulation...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.803 (2000) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mattern asserts that it is unclear whether Congress intended the statutory phrase "personnel action" to be limited solely to an adverse action appealable to the Board, and therefore that we should look to the legislative intent in enacting the Back Pay Act for guidance. So directed, Mattern argues that because the Back Pay Act is a remedial statute enacted to make employees whole for any losses they suffer as a result of an unwarranted or unjustified action, it should be broadly construed to accomplish its purpose. <span class="Italic">See Curlott v. Campbell</span>, 598 F.2d 1175, 1181-82 (9th Cir. 1979) ("The [Back Pay] Act operates as a waiver of sovereign immunity to provide complete monetary relief to the employees."); <span class="Italic">see also Kerr v. Nat'l Endowment for the</span> <span class="Italic">Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government retorts that the Board lacks jurisdiction to remedy an agency personnel decision that is merely "related to" an appealable action. This is plainly so, the argument goes, because the Board's jurisdiction is limited by statute to removals, suspensions of more than 14 days, reductions in grade, reductions in pay, and furloughs of 30 days or less. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 (2000). Irrespective of whether the Back Pay Act is a remedial statute, argues the government, Congress clearly has not granted the Board authority to hear cases or award remedies for actions outside of its jurisdiction--such as Mattern's pre-removal reassignments to administrative leave or restricted duty. We agree that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this enforcement petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mattern cannot challenge his pre-removal reassignments because they effected no reduction in grade or basic pay. "An employee's reassignment to a position that does not allow for availability pay is therefore not an appealable action because the Board has consistently held that premium pay [such as overtime or night differential] is not part of basic pay, and the loss of or reduction in premium pay, through means within the agency's discretion and not otherwise appealable to the Board, including reassignment, is not appealable as a reduction in pay." <span class="Italic">Luciano v. Dep't of the</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 441, 1997 MSPB LEXIS 530, *23 (1997), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 152 F.3d 948 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recently reaffirmed this principle <span class="Italic">in Pann v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 265 F.3d 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The petitioner in <span class="Italic">Pann</span>, a Navy diver, complained that a reassignment from "Rigger (Diver)" to "Land (Diver)" was an adverse agency action because in his new position, although at the same grade and basic pay, he was no longer entitled to special "dive pay." We upheld the Board's dismissal of his appeal because the Board lacks jurisdiction over appeals challenging an involuntary reassignment without loss in grade or basic pay that resulted in a loss of "additional pay." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1348. We affirm the Board here under a similar rationale: the Board lacked jurisdiction to entertain Mattern's petition for enforcement because he had no entitlement in the first place to the overtime, premium, and night differential pay he sought, so the alleged denial of the opportunity to earn such pay could not be "adverse" within the meaning of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That the present petition implicates the Back Pay Act does not remove it from the purview of <span class="Italic">Pann</span> and similar precedent. Although the Back Pay Act is designed as a make-whole remedial statute, it is not without limits. <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, 726 F.2d at 733 ("The purpose of such a cancellation order [returning the employee to work with back pay] is to place the employee <span class="Italic">as nearly as possible</span> in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante.")</span> (emphasis added). Because the pre-removal placement on administrative leave or reassignment to restricted duty were not adverse actions, they are not remediable by the Board under the Back Pay Act; for example, the agency could have left Mattern in the restricted-duty position indefinitely and he still would have been without remedy before the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 (2000) (defining adverse actions); <span class="Italic">Pann</span>, 265 F.3d at 1348-49; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Phipps v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Serv.</span>, 767 F.2d 895 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (holding that returning an employee to his lower grade of pay after a 32-month "temporary promotion" was not an adverse action under &#x00A7; 7512(7)). As he was never entitled to premium, overtime, and night differential pay, Mattern in fact has been restored to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> and has been made whole "as nearly as possible."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Mattern's continued reliance on <span class="Italic">Lavelle</span>, the Board decision the Board itself overturned in this very case, is unpersuasive. We would not have been bound by <span class="Italic">Lavelle</span>, a Board decision, even if it had not been overruled. Moreover, as the Board in this case explained, <span class="Italic">Lavelle</span> relied in part on <span class="Italic">Summers v. United States</span>, 648 F.2d 1324 (Ct. Cl. 1981), a case wherein the <span class="Italic">reassignment</span> itself was deemed an adverse action<span class="Italic">. Mattern</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 65, 2001 MSPB LEXIS 269, **11 ("The basis for the award of overtime pay in [Summers], therefore, was not that the 'reassignment' preceded or was related to the suspension, but that it was itself an appealable adverse action for which compensation was authorized under the Back Pay Act.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore affirm the Board's dismissal of the petition for enforcement for lack of jurisdiction because, at least with respect to any pay other than basic pay, the Board's power to make an aggrieved employee whole under the Back Pay Act extends back only to the effective date of the adverse action, as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mattern</span> was distinguished in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/fed/053266p.pdf">458 F.3d 1359</a>, 1365-70 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (Judge Rader dissenting), involving an employee who successfully appealed a constructive suspension, then successfully appealed to EEOC the MSPB's failure to find discrimination and, when he was removed for inability to perform his job after the constructive suspension, successfully argued to the Federal Circuit that the MSPB improperly cut off his back pay remedy by refusing to order back pay as a remedy for the discriminatory lack of accommodation that led to his unappealed removal. In short, the court determined that the employee had the right to an MSPB back pay remedy for a personnel action that was found discriminatory by EEOC on appeal from the Board and that led to another personnel action, removal, that was not separately appealed to the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Smith argues that the Board erred by basing its denial on the theory that he is collaterally appealing his removal--rather, he states that he is merely seeking compensation for the illegal discrimination the Board already found that he endured, where his injury from that discrimination continued beyond his removal. The agency responds that the Back Pay Act only permits compensation for the period of the personnel action, here the period during which the constructive suspension was in effect. The agency also argues that jurisdictionally, the Board may not provide compensation for a date beyond the end of the adverse action for which it took jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that no relief was due past Smith's June 19, 1997 removal because he did not separately appeal that removal. The Board stated that Smith "may not use enforcement proceedings to obtain relief as to a separate non-adjudicated agency action," and that extending relief for Smith's discrimination beyond the date of his removal would <span id="Page_4858"></span>amount to "enforc[ing] a compliance order against a party in a matter that has not been heard on the merits." <span class="Italic">2004 Decision</span>. While these may be correct statements of law, neither is applicable to prevent Smith from obtaining relief beyond June 19, 1997.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Smith is using enforcement proceedings to obtain relief for disability discrimination that occurred in November 1996. As the EEOC and the Board found, a Material Expediter position became available in November 1996 that could have accommodated Smith's disability and which he was ready and willing to undertake. Thus, Smith argues that if the discrimination had not occurred, he would have been in the Material Expediter position from which he would not have been removed. Instead, when the Board issued its 1997 decision finding that Smith was improperly suspended and ordering his reinstatement, the agency reinstated Smith to the same Welder position which he had been unable to perform previously due to his disability. Smith is not contending that his subsequent removal from the Welder position in July 1997, due to his inability to wear the required hearing equipment, was improper on its merits. The improper action at issue is that he was not placed in the Material Expediter position to accommodate his disability when it became available almost a year earlier, in November 1996. The EEOC and Board have already held that the agency's failure to assign Smith to the Material Expediter position at that time resulted in disability discrimination in violation of the ADA. Therefore, the action for which Smith seeks relief, the illegal discrimination, was clearly adjudicated on its merits. By basing its denial of Smith's petition for enforcement on the grounds that his later removal was not adjudicated on its merits, the Board erred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case constitutes an unusual situation in which an appealable adverse action that began due to one improper agency act continued due to another. The agency improperly began the constructive suspension in July 1995 by denying Smith the required procedural due process. However, the constructive suspension continued past November 1996 due to disability discrimination--the agency's failure to place him in the then available Material Expediter position to accommodate his work-related disability. The petition for enforcement now before the Board relates only to the relief due for the discrimination. Therefore, we discuss below the relief due Smith under the Board's <span class="Italic">2003 Order</span> to compensate for the agency's discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As compensation for discrimination, the Board ordered the agency to "carry out EEOC's decision" which the Board recognized as at least requiring the agency to reinstate Smith to the position he was denied due to discrimination. <span class="Italic">2003 Order</span>. The Board also required the agency to "pay [Smith] the correct amount of back pay, interest on back pay, and other benefits under the Back Pay Act." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Reinstatement, back pay, and benefits are routinely awarded by the Board and the EEOC as relief for disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Stewart v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, No. 07A40045, 2005 EEOPUB LEXIS 1358, at *8-10 (E.E.O.C. Mar. 18, 2005); <span class="Italic">Payne v. Dep't of Vet. Affairs</span>, No. 01A42405, 2004 EEOPUB LEXIS 4727, at *17 (E.E.O.C. Aug. 24, 2004); <span class="Italic">Schrodt v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 609, 620-21 (1998);<span class="Italic"> Gonzales v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 75, 77 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the parties disagree as to the time period for which the Back Pay Act permits compensation. The language of the Back Pay Act states generally that an employee who has suffered an unwarranted personnel action and properly appeals the action is entitled to back pay "<span class="Italic">for the period for which the personnel action was in effect</span>--an amount equal to all or any part of the pay...which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A) (2000) (emphasis added). The agency argues that the "personnel action" for purposes of the Back Pay Act was the constructive suspension resulting from the Army's failure to place Smith in an available light duty position as a Materials Expediter. As the Act only requires compensation while that action was "in effect," the agency contends, Smith was due no compensation after the date his constructive suspension ended. Smith argues that the "personnel action" for purposes of the Back Pay Act is the discriminatory failure to place him in the available Material Expediter position in November 1996. Although the constructive suspension may have ended with his removal, Smith contends that the harm to him due to the wrongful discrimination did not end with his removal. If he had been placed in the available Material Expediter position in November 1996, he would not have been removed in July 1997 from the Welder position. Therefore, Smith argues that the period during which the personnel action was in effect continued beyond the date of his removal, and he is thus entitled to back pay beyond that date. As discussed further below, we agree with Smith that the Back Pay Act does not limit his compensation due to discrimination to the period of his constructive suspension, as the agency contends.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[T]he basic purpose of a...back pay order is 'restoration of the situation, as nearly as possible, to that which would have obtained but for the illegal discrimination.'" <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, 726 F.2d at 733 (quoting <span class="Italic">Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 313 U.S. 177 (1941)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"The [Back Pay Act] itself does not address specifically how an agency is to calculate a back pay award and under what circumstances an employee who otherwise might be entitled to back pay is not to be awarded back pay by an agency. Rather, Congress authorized [the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM")] to prescribe specific regulations to carry out the Back Pay Act. Pursuant to this authority, OPM has issued implementing regulations concerning the computation of back pay...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Martin v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 184 F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citations omitted). The OPM's regulations instruct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When an appropriate authority corrects or directs the <span class="Italic">correction of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action</span> that resulted in the withdrawal, reduction, or denial of all or part of the pay, allowances, and differentials otherwise due an employee--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The employee shall be deemed to have performed service for the agency <span class="Italic">during the period covered by the corrective action</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805 (2006) (emphases added). These regulations do not specify any particular termination of entitlement for relief, but only that the relief continues "during the period covered by the corrective action." We are left to determine the period for which the discrimination found by the EEOC and the Board was in effect for purposes of the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining the period for which the unwarranted personnel action was in effect under the Back Pay Act, it is instructive to look to a prior EEOC case providing an employee relief for an agency's failure to accommodate. In <span class="Italic">Payne v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, an employee was placed in a position which did not accommodate her disability for over two years, requiring her to take substantial leave from her position. 2004 EEOPUB LEXIS 4727 at *14. The employee filed a discrimination claim partially based on the grounds that the agency failed to provide her with a reasonable accommodation. Some time after she filed the claim, the employee took disability retirement. The EEOC found the agency had discriminated by failing to accommodate the disability and ordered the agency to reinstate her and pay various damages. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at *6. The agency provided her with pay only for unpaid leave taken prior to retirement, contending that neither back pay nor reinstatement were warranted after the date of retirement because the employee did not separately appeal that she was constructively discharged. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at *8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the employee argued that she was due back pay beyond the date of her retirement regardless of whether she appealed the retirement because she only took disability retirement due to her inability to continue working at her position without an accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at *7. The EEOC found for the employee, stating: "The agency failed to rebut complainant's contention and provided no evidence to show that she would have gone on disability retirement...even if the agency had provided her with a reasonable accommodation for her disability." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at *17. Therefore, the EEOC held that the employee was entitled to back pay from the date she took disability retirement until the date the discrimination was remedied through reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, here the EEOC held that Smith was subject to disability discrimination based on a failure to accommodate his disability. The Board adopted this finding and ordered the agency to reinstate Smith and provide back pay. As in <span class="Italic">Payne</span>, Smith has proven that he left the agency, here by removal, for inability to perform the very position from which the agency failed to accommodate him. Also as in <span class="Italic">Payne</span>, the agency has thus far failed to provide any evidence to show that Smith would have been removed even if the agency had provided a reasonable accommodation for his disability. Therefore, as in <span class="Italic">Payne</span>, Smith too may be entitled to back pay after the date of his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another consideration for the EEOC in <span class="Italic">Payne</span> was the irony "that had the agency conducted the EEO process in a timely and fair manner, complainant's complaint may have been resolved before she left the agency on disability retirement." <span class="Italic">Id</span> at *16. The same irony applies here. Had the Board realized in April 1997, when it issued its decision finding no disability discrimination, that Smith should have been accommodated in the Material Expediter position in November 1996 as ultimately held by the EEOC, and ordered his appointment to that position, the complaint would have been resolved before Smith was removed from the agency. Because of the Board's initial error in failing to find disability discrimination and the prolonged appeals process, the agency was not required to reinstate Smith and award back pay until August 2003. The agency cannot benefit from removing Smith for the very disability for which it failed to provide an accommodation, and then contend that it need not provide any relief for the discrimination because it removed him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Payne</span>, with circumstances very similar to those before us, the EEOC found that the appropriate measure of back pay as a remedy is that which will make the employee whole. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at *8-9 ("The purpose of a back pay award is to restore complainant to the position she would have occupied, but for the discrimination.") (<span class="Italic">citing Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 442 U.S. 405, 418-19 (1975)). <span class="Italic">Payne</span> demonstrates that the relief provided by the <span id="Page_4859"></span>EEOC under the Back Pay Act solely for a failure to accommodate is such relief as would return Smith to the position he would have been in absent the unlawful discrimination. While <span class="Italic">Payne</span> is not binding precedent for our court, we agree with its analysis of the intended remedy under the Back Pay Act in a discrimination case. Therefore, we agree with Smith that the "personnel action" of discrimination is in effect and an employee may receive relief under the Back Pay Act while he continues to suffer an injury flowing from the discrimination. In Smith's case, he showed that the effects of discrimination continued beyond his reinstatement to the Welder position because he should have been reinstated to the Material Expediter position from which he would not have been removed. Consequently, the right to relief for discrimination under the Back Pay act did not terminate merely because the constructive suspension formally ended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Smith's right to reinstatement also did not arbitrarily terminate when his constructive suspension ended. Smith had the right to placement in the available Material Expediter position in November 1996. His right to placement in that position did not end when the Board erred in finding no discrimination in April 1997, allowing him to be reinstated to a position from which he could be removed. This right may have ended when the Material Expediter position was eliminated in December 2000, but the Board must make this determination in the first instance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Board erred by not determining the appropriate relief owed Smith due to disability discrimination. As discussed below, the Board's jurisdiction also does not limit its ability to provide relief in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the Board's limited jurisdiction precludes an award of back pay beyond the period of the constructive suspension because the Board may not provide relief beyond the end of the adverse action under appeal. The agency, however, cites no case law for the proposition that when an employee has been discriminated against while constructively suspended, the relief for the discrimination ends if he or she is removed prior to final adjudication of the discrimination claim. Indeed, as discussed below, the cases cited by the agency do not require the result the agency urges here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Mattern v. Department of Treasury</span>, the only case from our court cited by the agency, the Board found that an employee was improperly removed and ordered the agency to award the employee back pay. 291 F.3d 1366, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The employee filed a petition for enforcement arguing that the agency was required to pay him back pay for a time prior to his removal when he was placed on administrative leave or restricted duty, two actions he could not appeal to the Board because the Board lacked jurisdiction to hear appeals from those actions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1370. This court held that these non-appealable actions did not trigger the commencement of an action for which an employee could be awarded back pay by the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In other words, "the Board's power to make an aggrieved employee whole under the Back Pay Act <span class="Italic">extends back</span> only to the effective date of the adverse action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1371 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Crippen</span>, another case cited by the agency, an employee appealed a demotion. 32 M.S.P.R. at 525. When the Board found the demotion was improper, the employee claimed back pay not from the date of the demotion, but from a date prior to the demotion when he alleged he was constructively suspended. The Board held that the employee could not receive back pay for the period between the date of his alleged constructive suspension and his properly challenged demotion reasoning that "back pay for this period <span class="Italic">would flow from</span> an alleged constructive suspension occurring before the agency effected the demotion action--not the demotion action itself." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 525 (emphasis added). Therefore, because the employee did not challenge the constructive suspension, he could not receive back pay for that earlier period. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As in <span class="Italic">Mattern</span>, the Board held that it could not grant relief for a period prior to the appealed action. Relief flowing from the action found to be wrongful could not have begun to accrue prior to the commencement of that action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the principle of these cases also establishes that the Board lacks authority to award compensation beyond the <span class="Italic">end</span> of the appealed action. This result is required, the agency contends, because these cases hold that the Board cannot award compensation for losses caused by actions outside its jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that the Board is a tribunal of limited jurisdiction and can only decide appeals based on an enumerated list of adverse actions. Once it finds that such an action occurred, it can order compensation for the losses caused by that action. In response to a petition for enforcement, the Board is required to consider whether these orders were followed and order corrective action in case of non-compliance. <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, 726 F.2d at 733 (citing 5. U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1205(a)(2)). However, the Board's jurisdiction to hear cases based on certain enumerated adverse actions does not limit its ability to compensate for injuries flowing from those actions. <span class="Italic">Cf. Crippen</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. at 525 (injury that occurred prior to the adverse action could not have flowed from the adverse action). The key question is whether the employee can show that those injuries <span class="Italic">flowed from</span> the unlawful action. If they did, relief putting the employee in the position he would have been in absent the adverse action must address these later injuries.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In both cases cited by the agency, <span class="Italic">Mattern</span> and <span class="Italic">Crippen</span>, the injuries for which the employees sought compensation occurred prior to the appealed actions. Therefore, the injuries necessarily could not have been caused by the improper agency actions. In contrast, here the period for which Smith seeks compensation occurred after the end of the improper agency action. The agency was found to discriminate against Smith by denying him an accommodation for his disability when a suitable position became available in November 1996. Smith's removal occurred after the discrimination, on July 19, 1997, and he has alleged that but for that discrimination, he would not have been removed. The agency does not appear to dispute that Smith would not have been removed if he had not suffered the earlier improper action of not being placed in an accommodating position. Instead, the agency argues that any injury to Smith after his removal was caused by his removal and not the discrimination. However, if the removal itself flowed from the discrimination, as Smith alleges, then compensation for the discrimination must include the period after the removal. On remand, therefore, the Board must determine the totality of the injury due to the discrimination and the remedy required to place him in the position he would have been in absent that illegal agency action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Abbott v. USPS</span>, 2023 MSPB 14, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-20 (2023) (distinguishing<span class="Italic"> Smith, supra</span>; disability retirement cut off continuing backpay liability for employee whose constructive suspension was set aside on appeal). [Refer in this chapter to "Effect of Disability Retirement."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In<span class="Italic"> Johnston v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/JOHNSTON_MARY_ANN_NY_1221_00_0220_X_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249394.pdf">100 MSPR 196</a>, 200-03 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12, 21 (2005), the Board was disinclined to extend its enforcement jurisdiction to issues collateral to the underlying appeal, including problems with a VSIP payment and difficulties concerning deductions from back pay of state and federal taxes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before proceeding with our examination of the agency's efforts at compliance with the administrative judge's order, we must clarify the issues properly before the Board in this case. As mentioned above, when the Board reverses a personnel action, as in this case, it orders the agency to provide the employee <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief. <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, 726 F.2d at 733; <span class="Italic">Foreman</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. at 336. The Board's compliance authority is limited to insuring that the agency fulfills that obligation. Other matters, although tangentially related to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief, are not, absent unusual circumstances, within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">O'Connell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 399, 402 (1995) (declining to order the agency to grant the employee's request for waiver of an indebtedness created when the employee's separation was cancelled and noting that such relief is not part of <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief); <span class="Italic">Green v. Department of the Army</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 88, 91 (1992) (declining to address an agency's debt collection efforts and stating that the Board may address actions that are not otherwise appealable to the Board only when the issues are integral to the disposition of an underlying appealable action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's VSIP payment to the appellant and the payments associated with her retirement from the agency, such as any payments for unused annual leave, are unrelated to the reversal of her removal. Likewise, the procedures regarding the collection of any overpayment by the agency are only loosely related to the reversal of the removal. Accordingly, those matters are not within the Board's jurisdiction and the administrative judge exceeded her authority in addressing them. <span class="Italic">O'Connell</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 402; <span class="Italic">Green</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. at 91. The only issue properly before us is whether the agency properly calculated, credited, and paid the appellant the pay, benefits, and interest due as the result of the reversal of the removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has repeatedly argued that the agency erred in computing the withholdings from the back pay award for federal and New York State taxes. The Board does not get involved with tax disputes regarding back pay. <span class="Italic">See Cuevas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 391 &#x00B6; 5 (2001); <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 78, 82 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 988 F.2d 130 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table). If the appellant believes that the agency withheld too much in taxes from the back pay award, she should seeks tax refunds from the federal and state governments. <span class="Italic">Cebzanov v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 562 &#x00B6; 11 (2004); <span class="Italic">Henderson v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bullock v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 93 MSPR 217, 219-20 &#x00B6; 7 (2002) ("The Back Pay Act does not authorize the restoration of leave that an appellant actually used and was paid for."); <span class="Italic">Orsay v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 91 MSPR 545, 549 &#x00B6; 12 (2002) ("To the extent that he is requesting restoration of sick leave and annual leave that he allegedly used or accrued prior to the suspension and removal actions...he is not entitled to such relief under the Back Pay Act"; 5 CFR 550.805(b)); <span class="Italic">Harris v.

But the Board determined that if an employee was removed in reprisal for union activities on the pretext of medical inability to perform duties, a period of enforced leave preceding the removal was a constructive suspension. It was part of the improper disciplinary action and the employee was ready, willing, and able to work. <span class="Italic">Clements v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 21 MSPR 275, 277 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Manzi v. United States</span>, 198 Ct. Cl. 489 (1972)). The Board suggested "for clarity" in <span class="Italic">Clements</span> that if an agency has improperly forced an employee to use leave, restoration of leave, and not its monetary equivalent, is the appropriate remedy (citing <span class="Italic">Ainsworth v. United States</span>, 185 Ct. Cl. 110 (1968)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hernandez v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 418 (2001), involved an employee whose resignation was forced when the agency failed to accommodate his disability. Before the resignation, the agency placed the employee on LWOP status. Following his successful appeal from the resignation, the employee asserted, in enforcement proceedings, that he was entitled to back pay for the period he was out of LWOP--a status resulting from the same refusal to accommodate his disability that led to his resignation--even though a separate appeal had not been docketed challenging the LWOP as a constructive suspension. The Board noted that appellant's LWOP was addressed by the parties and the AJ in the proceedings before the AJ and that the record was sufficiently developed for a Board decision. The Board deemed the period of LWOP to be a constructive suspension and directed back pay. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 423, 425 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 16.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is possible that after an employee's termination, he joins another agency. It is also possible that to accomplish full relief, e.g., recrediting of leave, the new employer must be joined as a party if the employee successfully appeals the termination from his prior agency. Joinder is permissible to ensure that necessary relief is provided to the appellant, e.g., transfer of leave balances from one agency to another. <span class="Italic">Okonski v.
