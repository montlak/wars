<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-87"><span class="space">g.</span> Pay Entitlement; Overtime; Allowances</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant is entitled to pay consistent with the grade and pay level held as a result of the initial decision, that is, the grade and pay level that was held at the time of the adverse action that was reversed or that is to be held as a result of mitigation effective on the date of the adverse action. The appellant is not entitled to the pay level he believes to would have received through promotion that might or could have occurred had the adverse action not occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tisdell v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 94 MSPR 44, 49 &#x00B6; 9 (2003). Interim relief involving restoration of the appellant to work need not place her pay at a level that, absent her separation, would have been attained pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Fernand v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> 100 MSPR 259, 263 &#x00B6; 7 (2005).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPR 192, 197-200 (1992), interim relief does not include overtime compensation unless the employee proves that he is entitled to overtime as a term or condition of employment by law, rule, regulation, collective bargaining agreement, or binding agency policy:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA provides that, when an agency makes the determination not to return an employee to the place of employment, "such employee shall receive pay, compensation, and <span id="Page_1679"></span>all other benefits as terms and conditions of employment pending the outcome of any petition for review...." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(B). The statute itself does not define either the words "pay, compensation, and...benefits," or the words "terms and conditions of employment," however. Related Federal regulations and statutory provisions nonetheless afford us some guidance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4), the term "pay" is defined as "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee." Further, according to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.202(i), an employee's basic rate of pay does not include "additional pay of any kind." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Keim v. USPS</span>, 19 MSPR 124, 126 (1984). Under the provisions of 5 CFR parts 870-73, 890, and 831-46, the term "benefits" reasonably includes life insurance, health insurance, and retirement benefits that an employee elects and that are attendant to the position he holds. There are, however, no definitions of the term "compensation" in any Title V provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An elementary rule of statutory construction requires that effect be given, if possible, to every word, clause, and sentence of a statute so that no provision will be rendered superfluous, inoperative, or insignificant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Radio Relay League v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 617 F.2d 875, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Ginocchi</span>, 53 MSPR at 68. Thus, interpreting the phrase "pay, compensation, and...benefits" so as to give meaning to each word compels us to find that "compensation" means something other than "pay" or "benefits."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the term "compensation" refers to those amounts by which an employee's "pay" is regularly augmented, including premium pay, night differential, and overtime pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> ELM &#x00A7; 434.13, which includes overtime pay under "Types of Compensation." The legislative history of the WPA supports this conclusion. It provides, by way of explanation, that an employee not returned to the workplace will nevertheless receive the pay and benefits he would receive if he were working. S. Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 35 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ginocchi</span>, 53 MSPR at 69-70. This interpretation is further supported by the legal definition of "compensation" which is "[r]emuneration for services rendered, whether in salary, fees, or commissions." Black's Law Dictionary 283 (6th ed. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question in each case then becomes whether overtime is awardable as part of an interim relief order because it is a term and condition of employment under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(B). We note that an agency's authority to assign overtime work to an employee is discretionary in nature. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), ch. 550, subch. 1-3 (May 7, 1981); FPM, ch. 610, subch. 1-1 (revised July 1969). No employee is guaranteed that overtime work will be available, and no employee is entitled to overtime assignments as a matter of right. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM, ch. 550, subch. 1-3; FPM, ch. 610, subch. 1-1. Management retains the discretion to assign overtime duties based on the circumstances of the workplace, such as the amount of work to be done, the human resources available, and budgetary concerns. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wells v. FAA</span>, 755 F.2d 804, 808 (11th Cir. 1985). Because no employee has an expectation of overtime, and we discern no law, rule, or regulation that limits an agency's authority to assign overtime, we conclude that, as a general matter, overtime is not payable as a term and condition of employment under law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Supreme Court, however, in <span class="Italic">Hishon v. King &#x0026; Spalding</span>, 467 U.S. 69, 104 S. Ct. 2229, 81 L. Ed.2d 59 (1984), considered the meaning of the words "terms, conditions, or privileges of employment" as used in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e. Where "the underlying employment relationship is contractual," the Court said, "'terms, conditions, or privileges of employment' clearly include benefits that are part of an employment contract." <span class="Italic">Hishon</span>, 467 U.S. at 74, 104 S. Ct. at 2233. On the other hand, an employer-provided benefit that is not "a contractual <span class="Italic">right</span> of employment, may qualify as a 'privileg[e]' of employment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 75, 104 S. Ct. at 2233 (original emphasis).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Federal employment is not contractual, <span class="Italic">Hishon</span> suggests that the phrase "terms and conditions of employment" should be construed to include compensation to which the appellant is entitled not only under law, rule, or regulation, but also under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement or binding agency policy, but not any that is wholly within the discretion of management. The Board has long held that it will enforce the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement to which an agency is a party in the same manner as it treats provisions of the agency's regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Giesler v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 3 MSPB 367, 3 MSPR 277, 280 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span>, <span class="Italic">Giesier v. MSPB</span>, 686 F.2d 844 (10th Cir. 1982). Thus, even though an agency may have complete control over whether any overtime is worked in a given period, a collective bargaining agreement or binding agency policy may control how available overtime is allocated among the employees. Where that is true, the overtime to which an employee would be entitled under the collective bargaining agreement or binding agency policy is compensation paid as a "term" or "condition" of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In enforcing a final Board decision, we will include overtime pay in our back pay order when the appellant proves that, during the time period that he was improperly separated from his position, he would have received overtime pay based on the average overtime pay received by similarly situated employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro v. FAA</span>, 807 F.2d 169, 173 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Blackmer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 624, 628 (1991); <span class="Italic">Bonacchi v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 531, 535 (1990); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Trinity Valley Iron &#x0026; Steel Co. v. NLRB</span>, 410 F.2d 1161, 1177 n.29 (5th Cir. 1969). We believe, however, that generally requiring an agency to provide an appellant with overtime pay to be deemed in compliance with an interim relief order would unduly complicate the interim relief process and may be deemed to interfere inordinately with the agency's on-going management of its work force, <span id="Page_1680"></span>particularly since the appellant can recoup any overtime pay to which he may be entitled, if and when we issue a final decision in his favor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore hold that, as a general rule, overtime pay is compensation that is not required to be provided under an interim relief order.[4] We also hold that, as an exception to the rule, in those instances in which an employee proves that he is entitled to overtime as a term or condition of employment by virtue of law, rule, regulation, collective bargaining agreement, or binding agency policy, the overtime that he would have worked had he been returned to duty is payable under an interim relief order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Board recognizes that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has recently issued regulations interpreting the interim relief provision of the WPA. 57 Fed. Reg. 3707, 3712-13 (1992) (to be codified at 5 CFR part 772, subpart A). It appears that OPM's interpretation may differ from that set forth in this opinion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board, however, is not required to defer to OPM's interpretation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ginocchi</span>, 53 MSPR at 71 n.7. In enacting the interim relief provision, Congress chose to codify it in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701, a section which authorizes only the Board to issue implementing regulations. 5 USCA &#x00A7; 7701(k) (West Supp. 1991). As a result, it is the Board, not OPM, that is the principal administrative agency charged with administering and interpreting the interim relief provision. Accordingly, OPM's interpretation of the interim relief provision is not entitled to deference where it conflicts with the Board's interpretation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ginocchi</span>, 53 MSPR at 71 n.7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the appellant asserts that he is entitled to approximately 15-20 hours of overtime pay per week because he worked an average of approximately 15-20 hours of overtime per week prior to his removal. He does not claim, nor does he present any evidence to show, that his purported entitlement to overtime pay stems from law, rule, or regulation, or from the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement or binding agency policy. We find that the appellant has failed to establish that entitlement to overtime is a term or condition of his employment requiring the agency to pay him for overtime he allegedly would have worked as part of the administrative judge's interim relief order and, thus, he is not entitled to overtime as part of the administrative judge's order of interim relief.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Archerda v.

While the appellant claims he was entitled to overtime pay pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, the provisions of the agreement he submitted do not guarantee overtime. Rather, they state that "overtime shall be assigned on a rotational basis" and that "[m]andatory overtime will be required anytime that a shift is below minimum staffing requirements and no other employee has volunteered to work the overtime." Accordingly, the appellant has not established that he is entitled to overtime pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tisdell</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 44, &#x00B6; 7 (finding that the appellant failed to establish that he was entitled to overtime pay where the relevant collective bargaining agreement did not guarantee overtime)."); <span class="Italic">Bahrke v.

Department of the Army</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 469 &#x00B6; 6 (1999). A mere assertion of entitlement to overtime pay, such as the appellant has made, is insufficient to show<span class="Italic"></span> that the agency is in noncompliance with the interim relief order. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The exception to <span class="Italic">McLaughlin</span>, overtime entitlement stemming from a provision of a negotiated agreement, was applied in <span class="Italic">Rios v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 77 MSPR 602, 605-07 (1998), defeating an agency's PFR because of its failure to provide interim relief when it denied a customs inspector overtime pay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The critical issue presented by the parties' argument and evidence on compliance is whether the agency failed to satisfy [the] interim relief requirements when it detailed the appellant to the Seaport but precluded him from earning the overtime pay there that he earned at LAX. The appellant asserts in his motion to dismiss and accompanying declaration that the agency failed to provide him overtime pay because it barred him from overtime work at LAX and relegated him to fourth rather than first pick of overtime assignments at the Seaport. Specifically, he claims that while assigned to LAX he earned an average of approximately $956 in overtime pay every two weeks. In support of his entitlement to that same overtime pay at the Seaport, he submits an affidavit from Lori Gray, Assistant Counsel for the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), who stated that the collective bargaining agreement with the agency provided that overtime was a condition of employment and that both the collective bargaining agreement and the National Inspectional Assignment Policy (NIAP) delineated the process for distributing overtime to customs inspectors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency responds that the appellant was not entitled to overtime because while the collective bargaining agreement used the term "condition of employment," it did not require the agency to assign overtime work at all; rather the agreement left the assignment of overtime within the agency's discretion with only the directive that the agency assign overtime in an equitable manner. In this regard, the agency asserts that it provided him Seaport overtime assignments on an equitable basis pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, that it did not restrict his overtime at the Seaport, and that he had not alleged that he was barred from overtime work at the Seaport.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the agency asserts that calculating and paying the appellant for overtime work would be unduly burdensome and impracticable because overtime work is largely voluntary, making it difficult to quantify per inspector on a pay period-to-pay period basis. In support of this argument it submits a declaration from Supervisory Customs Inspector Joanie Schoney, who stated that it was "virtually impossible" for her to predict the amount of overtime earned by a customs inspector largely due to the inconsistency in his or her willingness to volunteer for overtime work. The agency neither rebuts the appellant's estimation of his overtime earnings at LAX, nor offers evidence of the actual or estimated overtime earnings of customs inspectors currently at the Seaport or LAX.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 55 MSPR 192, 199-200 (1992), we held that overtime pay is compensation required to be provided under an interim relief order only in those instances in which an employee proves that he is entitled to it as a term or condition of employment by virtue of law, rule, regulation, collective bargaining agreement, or binding agency policy. In reaching this holding, we explained that even if an agency has complete control over whether overtime is worked, any overtime provided by a collective bargaining agreement or binding agency policy is compensation paid as a "term" or "condition" of employment when either agreement controls "how available overtime is allocated among the employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 199.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon reviewing the collective bargaining agreement and the pertinent portions of the NIAP submitted by the agency, we reject its assertion that overtime was not a condition of the appellant's employment. On its face, Article 22, Section 2.A of the collective bargaining agreement explicitly states that overtime is a condition of employment. Section 3.A. of Article 22, states that "[s]ubject to the needs and requirements of the Service for differing types, grades, skill and skill levels, and within the limits placed upon the permissible amount of overtime earnings of Customs employees, overtime earnings will be equalized to the maximum extent possible." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Read together, Sections 2.A and 3.A clearly satisfy our rule set forth in <span class="Italic">McLaughlin</span> for determining whether agency-controlled overtime is compensation which amounts to a term or condition of employment. Similarly, we find that the NIAP, Sections 3-6, which set forth the rules for allocating overtime, renders overtime a condition of employment by binding agency policy. Furthermore, as we implicitly did in <span class="Italic">McLaughlin,</span> we reject the agency's claim that the calculation of overtime pay would be so arduous and problematic as to relieve the agency of its statutory obligation to provide the appellant with overtime pay where such compensation is a term and condition of employment pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement or binding agency policy, as is the case here. 55 MSPR at 199-200.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, then, that while the agency acted within its discretion in assigning the appellant to the Seaport after making an undue disruption determination, it remained obligated to provide him the pay, compensation, and benefits of his previous position during the pendency of the petition for review. <span class="Italic">King v. Jerome,</span> 42 F.3d 1371, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 1994). From our review of the collective bargaining agreement, the compensation to which the appellant was entitled by statute necessarily included overtime pay, which in this case was undisputedly an average of $956 per pay period that the appellant earned at LAX. The agency's refusal to grant the appellant such overtime earnings amounts to a denial of the compensation of his former position. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Department of Justice,</span> 71 MSPR 59, 67 (1996) (agency could not avoid paying the appellant a differential, compensation that he would have received at his former duty station in Guam, by detailing him to another position in Washington, D.C.). Indeed, we note that consistent with our holding in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 71 MSPR at 67, the agency complied with interim relief requirements regarding the payment of night differential when, in response to the appellant's claim that it had failed to provide him with a 15% night differential, it promptly corrected that error. Accordingly, based on the foregoing evidence of the agency's noncompliance with interim relief because of its failure to provide the appellant with overtime pay, we grant the appellant's motion to dismiss the agency's petition for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Denial of overtime compensation mandated by a collective bargaining agreement caused another agency PFR to be dismissed in <span class="Italic">Rothschild v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 78 MSPR 93, 96-98 (1998), involving another customs inspector and apparently the same contract involved in <span class="Italic">Rios</span>, when the agency failed to pay overtime at the rate earned at the appellant's permanent location and instead <span id="Page_1681"></span>paid the rate at the location held through an "undue disruption" assignment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As part of her submission on interim relief, the appellant has presented a copy of the governing collective bargaining agreement. On its face, Article 22, Section 2.A of the collective bargaining agreement states that overtime is a condition of employment; section 3.A. of Article 22 states that "[s]ubject to the needs and requirements of the Service for differing types, grades, skill and skill levels, and within the limits placed upon the permissible amount of overtime earnings of Customs employees, overtime earnings will be equalized to the maximum extent possible." Section 3.B of Article 22 provides that overtime assignments shall be made and rotated in a fair and impartial manner. Taken together, these provisions of the collective bargaining agreement clearly satisfy our rule set forth in <span class="Italic">McLaughlin</span> for determining whether agency-controlled overtime is compensation which amounts to a term or condition of employment; we therefore find that overtime is a condition of employment by agreement and binding agency policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant and counsel from her union (Ms. Gray) have submitted declarations made under penalty of perjury that Customs Inspectors assigned to duty at LAX (as the appellant once was) received, on the average, approximately $17,000 to $18,000 annually from overtime earnings; the appellant herself averaged $17,000 annually in overtime earnings. Customs Inspectors assigned to the Seaport, by contrast, have averaged approximately $5,500 in overtime earnings. They argue that the agency has not complied with the interim-relief order by denying her the overtime earnings at LAX that she would have received but for her assignment to the Seaport. The agency concedes that it has denied the appellant the opportunity for overtime earnings that she would have received at LAX; it contends, however, that it properly assigned the appellant to the Seaport and barred her from working at LAX after making an undue disruption determination, and that she is only entitled to the overtime opportunities available at the Seaport.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the agency's position. While the agency properly assigned the appellant to the Seaport after making an undue disruption determination, it was still obligated to provide her the pay, compensation, and benefits of her previous position during the pendency of the petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Jerome,</span> 42 F.3d at 1375; <span class="Italic">Briley</span> <span class="Italic">v. National Archives &#x0026; Records Administration,</span> 71 MSPR 211, 216 (1996) (the purpose of interim relief is to grant the appellant the pay, compensation, and benefits of the position awarded in the initial decision while the petition for review is pending). From our review of the collective bargaining agreement and the undisputed evidence submitted by the appellant, it appears that she has received approximately $17,000 in annual overtime earnings from work at LAX as a term and condition of employment by virtue of the operation of the agency's binding overtime policy. The agency certainly had the discretion not to return the appellant to duty at LAX, but it could not use that discretion to avoid paying her all that she would have been entitled to had she remained working at LAX; overtime earnings at LAX were part of the compensation of the appellant's former position that the administrative judge awarded in the initial decision, and the agency's refusal to grant her such overtime earnings amounts to a denial of compensation of her former position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Justice,</span> 71 MSPR 59, 67 (1996) (agency could not avoid paying the appellant a differential, compensation that he would have received at his former duty station in Guam, by detailing him to another position in Washington, D.C.). Accordingly, we dismiss the agency's petition for review for failure to award the appellant interim relief to which she was entitled. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 67-68.</p>

Dept. of Army</span>, 81 MSPR 469, 473 &#x00B6; 6 (1999) (interim relief did not require an overtime payment based only on the appellant's assertion that he "usually worked 20-25 hours of overtime in Public Works"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Tisdell v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 94 MSPR 44, 49 &#x00B6; 7 (2003) (contract overtime was not denied when the appellant was not available for overtime assignments as a result of a medical condition).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other differentials, housing and cost of living allowances should have been included in interim relief, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DOJ</span>, 71 MSPR 59, 66-67 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, the appellant is entitled to all "pay, compensation, and all other benefits as terms and conditions of employment during the period pending the outcome of any petition for review...." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(B). The Board has held that the term "compensation" refers to those amounts by which an employee's "pay" is regularly augmented, including premium pay, night differential, and overtime pay. <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPR 192, 198 (1992). In <span class="Italic">McLaughlin</span>, the Board also considered the phrase "terms and conditions of employment" and construed it to include compensation to which the appellant is entitled not only under law, rule, or regulation, but also under the terms of an agency's collective bargaining agreement or binding agency policy, but not any that is wholly within the discretion of management. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 199. Allowances and differentials, as described in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 501.210, are clearly included both as compensation and as terms and conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See also Fox v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 62 MSPR 447, 453 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That such amounts are properly awardable is buttressed by the fact that, under the Back Pay Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596, an employee who is wrongfully dismissed is entitled to receive housing and cost-of-living allowances provided to compensate the employee for being assigned to a high cost area, even when the employee is not present at the high cost area during the period of wrongful dismissal. <span class="Italic">In re Raymond</span>, 59 Comp. Gen. 261, 1980 WL 17969 (1980); <span class="Italic">Urbina v. United States</span>, 428 F.2d 1280 (Ct. Cl. 1970).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wayne v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 322, 328 (1992), noted as to a claim for several pay premiums and differentials as part of interim relief:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...When an agency assigns an employee to duties other than those of his regular position, "such employee shall receive pay, compensation, and all other benefits as terms and conditions of employment pending the outcome of any petition for review...." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(B). We have held that the term "compensation" refers to those amounts by which an employee's "pay" is regularly augmented, including premium pay, night differential, and overtime pay. <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPB 192, 198 (1992). Such compensation is awardable as part of an interim relief order, however, only if it is a term and condition of employment under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(B). Overtime pay is compensation required to be provided under an interim relief order only in those instances in which an employee proves that he is entitled to it as a term or condition of employment by virtue of law, rule, regulation, collective bargaining agreement, or binding agency policy.... The appellant in the instant case has not provided evidence that he is entitled to night differential, Sunday premium, or holiday pay by virtue of law, rule, regulation, collective bargaining agreement, or binding agency policy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fox v. FDIC</span>, 62 MSPR 447, 453 (1994) (agency failed to provide interim relief when it failed to pay a rental differential allowance that the Board considered to be a regular augmentation of pay; the agency's defense that it suspected the employee of fraud was not accepted because that assertion constituted a challenge to the AJ's determination on the merits of the appeal from the adverse action based on a charge of an improper claim for the allowance).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board denied claimed benefits including overtime and differentials, and in reasoning that was not too clear, denied a claimed within grade increase as a component of interim relief, <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOD,</span> SF-0752-13-0336-C-1 (NP 5/15/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although the appellant argues on review that he is entitled to higher rates of pay, including additional overtime and night differentials, during the time he was on administrative leave following the reversal of his indefinite suspension, the Board has found that an employee may only receive such additional compensation as part of an order for interim relief when he proves that he is entitled to it as a term or condition of employment by virtue of law, rule, regulation, collective bargaining agreement, or binding agency policy. <span class="Italic">See Archerda v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 14 (2014). We find no evidence of such a guarantee of additional compensation in the record below, and we find that the agency complied with the order for interim relief by placing the appellant on administrative leave following the reversal of his indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, although the appellant separately alleges that the agency delayed processing his within-grade increase (WIGI) in August 2013 while he was on administrative leave, the Board has found that an employee cannot appeal a delay in the payment or processing of a WIGI under chapter 75, and we find no reason to conclude that the agency's delay in approving and processing the appellant's WIGI is evidence of the agency's noncompliance with the administrative judge's order for interim relief. <span class="Italic">See Caracciolo v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 663, &#x00B6; 10 (2007). An employee, moreover, does not have a <span class="Italic">per se</span> entitlement to a WIGI, and, under the principles explained in <span class="Italic">Archerda</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, we find that the appellant is not entitled to an automatic WIGI as part of the administrative judge's order for interim relief. <span class="Italic">See Jack v. Department of Commerce</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 354, &#x00B6; 9 (2005) (an employee under the General Schedule earns periodic increases in pay, or WIGI, so long as his performance is at an acceptable level of competence) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5335(a)). We also find that the appellant's argument that he was denied a possible promotion while on administrative leave does not demonstrate agency noncompliance with the order for interim relief. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 686, 697 (1991) (absent a law requiring a promotion or facts demonstrating a clear entitlement to a promotion, an employee is not automatically entitled to such a promotion upon reinstatement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The discussion in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> was limited to interim relief. The Board entertains compliance claims as to denied WIGIs following reversals of adverse actions under Chapter 75.
