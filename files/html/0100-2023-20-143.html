<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-138"><span class="space">a.</span> Degree of Significance of Change of Duties, Responsibilities, or Working Conditions</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Until 2022, neither the Board nor the Federal Circuit offered a comprehensive quantitative or qualitative test for the degree of significance in changes in working conditions that is required to secure an IRA remedy. The allegations were not to be completely conclusory, and the Board was to allow development of nonconclusory allegations through production of evidence, <span class="Italic">Holderfield v. MSPB</span>, 326 F.3d 1207, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 2003), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Holderfield v. MSPB</span>, 128 Fed. Appx. 109, 111 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he AJ did not explicitly analyze whether any of her allegations individually or collectively fall under category (xi) relating to a "significant change in...working conditions." Three of the allegations refer explicitly to "working conditions": "discriminatory working conditions biased in favor of a manager's roommate," "hostile work conditions for the appellant and others," and "knowingly allow[ing] the working conditions to be so poor that an occupational disease in the appellant became manifest." Others of the allegations do not recite the phrase "working conditions" but arguably relate to working conditions (e.g., denial of courteous treatment, office morale problems, and being subject to profanity, yelling, embarrassment, and harassment in the workplace). While some of these allegations are indeed generalized, others are sufficiently specific and concrete, e.g., profanity, yelling, and development of an occupational disease, to support an allegation relating to working conditions. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. Dep't of Air Force</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 298, 303 (1990) (stating that Board jurisdiction over an IRA appeal requires more than "generalized assertions and fears unsupported by reference to any specific matter" (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the Board did not address the "working conditions" definition of <span id="Page_3890"></span>a personnel action, and we are not able to review its decision without its analysis, we must vacate the Board's decision and remand for further proceedings. On remand the Board should determine whether the allegations relating to working conditions amount to a "significant" change, as the statute requires; whether they are non-frivolous....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Smith v. VA</span>, SF-1221-13-0090-W-1 (NP 7/17/2014) (Vice Chairman Wagner dissenting), considered <span class="Italic">Holderfield</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reiterates his contention that, in reprisal for his whistleblowing activities, the agency subjected him to "personnel actions" by: (1) giving him a verbal counseling; (2) threatening to take further disciplinary action against him; (3) giving him a negative 90-day progress report; and (4) subjecting him to change in working conditions by placing him in an entirely different position of housekeeper. As discussed above, the administrative judge considered whether these actions constituted personnel actions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). We discern no basis for disturbing the administrative judge's well-reasoned findings that the first three of these actions did not constitute personnel actions under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., King v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 133 F.3d 1450 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (a progress report is not a "personnel action" under the WPA because not every agency action is a "personnel action" under the WPA; an action must have practical consequences for the employee to constitute a personnel action); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 204, &#x00B6; 11 (2000) (a memorandum of oral counseling alone is not a formal disciplinary action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2), and thus, does not constitute a "personnel action" under the WPA); <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 298, 303 (1990) (the Board's jurisdiction under the WPA does not extend to an appellant's assertions of threatened personnel actions where those assertions are unsupported by reference to any specific matter).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's contention that the agency subjected him to a change in working conditions by assigning him to the position of housekeeper for a day, the appellant has not provided a reason for disturbing the administrative judge's findings that the appellant failed to exhaust this alleged personnel action before OSC. <span class="Italic">See Mason v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 135, &#x00B6; 8 (2011) (the Board may only consider those personnel actions that the appellant raised before OSC). Furthermore, we discern no reason for otherwise disturbing the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency subjected him to a personnel action. Accordingly, the administrative judge properly dismissed the IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the dissent that numerous agency actions may amount to a covered "significant change in working conditions" collectively even if they are not covered personnel actions individually. <span class="Italic">Holderfield v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 326 F.3d 1207, 1209-10 (Fed. Cir. 2003). However, we disagree that the actions at issue in this case collectively amount to a significant change in working conditions. In our view, in order to constitute a significant change in working conditions, a series of minor agency actions must be pervasive and occur over an extended period of time. In this case, we view the email from the Chief of Human Resources and the verbal counseling from the appellant's supervisors, both of which occurred on the same day, as relating to the same matter, i.e., that the appellant should not air his grievances directly to the Secretary of the DVA. This, coupled with the assignment of housekeeping duties for a single day, simply does not amount to a significant change in working conditions. We also disagree with the dissent that the appellant should be deemed to have raised the unfavorable progress review and the police report to OSC merely by making a nonspecific claim that he was subjected to a pattern of retaliatory harassment. <span class="Italic">See Costin v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 517, 530-31 (1994) (the Board will only consider personnel actions that the appellant specifically raised before OSC).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Manipulation or shifting of job responsibilities, or requiring the appellant to compete to fill his own position (with the implication that the appellant no longer would be performing those responsibilities) could constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency significantly changed the appellant's duties. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rice v. USDA</span>, 97 MSPR 501, 508 &#x00B6; 13 (2004).

On petition for review, the appellant argues that her exclusion from the FSDO building constituted such a change because she needed access to books and manuals kept in the FSDO in order to perform some of her duties, because it prevented her from consulting with union officials, and because it prevented her from visiting her immediate supervisor, whose office was located in the building.</p>

The appellant has not identified any effect the exclusion actually had on her duties, responsibilities, or working conditions.

Although it is unclear whether the appellant's job duties or job title changed when she was reassigned to Philadelphia, she has asserted under penalty of perjury that she was subjected to a significant change in working conditions because her commuting time increased at least three-fold and her wage taxes increased by 3.495%. Therefore, regardless of whether the appellant's relocation constituted a reassignment or transfer, we find it was a significant change in her working conditions, which is actionable in an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii) (defining a personnel action, in part, as "any...significant changes in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions"); <span class="Italic">see Shivaee v.

VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 17, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-29 (2022), evaluated allegations and proof (no hearing was requested by the appellant) to define the level that alleged hostile actions by supervisors must reach to constitute a significant change in duties, responsibilities, and working conditions to secure a remedy in a whistleblower's appeal. The Board was dismissive of interference with collateral job responsibilities not outlined in a position description. The Board determined that actions constituting harassment or discrimination include those that "have practical and significant effects on the overall nature and quality of an employee's working conditions, duties, or responsibilities." Not qualifying for whistleblower protection were allegations that a supervisor yelled at the appellant when he reported improper patient care to higher management, grabbed his arm to pull him into a room, and told him to shut up during a meeting. If those actions are not harassing, or if they do not have a chilling effect on whistleblowing or whistleblowers, it is hard to determine what supervisory conduct qualifies for protection. They were dismissed in <span class="Italic">Skarada</span> as "perhaps indicative of an unpleasant and unsupportive work environment":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At all times relevant to this appeal, the appellant has been employed as a GS-12 Supervisory Physical Therapist at the agency's Altoona, Pennsylvania Medical Center in the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Service (PM&RS). On or about August 1, 2014, he filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) alleging that the agency had retaliated against him for his protected whistleblowing disclosures to the Director and Chief of Staff regarding "unusual behavior" and deficient patient care on the part of his supervisor, the Chief of PM&RS (supervisor). The appellant informed OSC that he made these "impaired provider" disclosures between June 26, 2013, and June 20, 2014, and that, because of these disclosures, his chain of command, including the Director, the Chief of Staff, and his supervisor had stopped communicating with him, excluded him from meetings, subjected him to unfounded investigations, refused his request for a "Salary Market Review" of his position, removed his previous responsibilities, yelled at him during meetings, and subjected him to a hostile work environment.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), an employee is required to exhaust his administrative remedies with OSC before seeking corrective action from the Board in an IRA appeal.

The requirements are met when an appellant has provided OSC with sufficient basis to pursue an investigation. The Board's jurisdiction is limited to those issues that have been previously raised with OSC. However, an appellant may give a more detailed account of his whistleblowing activities before the Board than he did to OSC. An appellant may demonstrate exhaustion through his initial OSC complaint, evidence that he amended the original complaint, including but not limited to OSC's determination letter and other letters from OSC referencing any amended allegations, and the appellant's written responses to OSC referencing the amended allegations. An appellant may also establish exhaustion through other sufficiently reliable evidence, such as an affidavit or declaration attesting that the appellant raised with OSC the substance of the facts in the Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The legislative history of the 1994 amendment to the WPA indicates that the "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions" should be interpreted broadly, to include "any harassment or discrimination that could have a chilling effect on whistleblowing or otherwise undermine the merit system and should be determined on a case-by-case basis." 140 Cong. Rec. H11,419, H11,421 (daily ed. Oct. 7, 1994) (statement of Rep. McCloskey); <span class="Italic">see Savage v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the broad interpretation accorded to the term "significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions," not every agency action is a "personnel action" under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See King v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 133 F.3d 1450, 1453 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Rather, to constitute a covered personnel action under the WPA, an agency action must have practical consequences for the employee. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Therefore, we conclude that to amount to a "significant change" under section 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii), an agency action must have a significant impact on the overall nature or quality of an employee's working conditions, responsibilities, or duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an appellant has suffered a "significant change" in his duties, responsibilities, or working conditions, the Board must consider the alleged agency actions both collectively and individually. <span class="Italic">See Holderfield v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 326 F.3d 1207, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 2003). In <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, the Board stated that a hostile work environment itself may constitute a covered personnel action under the WPA. <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 23. Although the term "hostile work environment" has a particular meaning in other contexts, we take this opportunity to clarify that allegations of a hostile work environment may establish a personnel action under the WPA, as established by longstanding Board precedent covering whistleblowing claims raised in a civil service law context, only if they meet the statutory criteria, i.e., constitute a significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). Thus, as described above, although the "significant change" personnel action should be interpreted broadly to include harassment and discrimination that could have a chilling effect on whistleblowing or otherwise undermine the merit system, only agency actions that, individually or collectively, have practical and significant effects on the overall nature and quality of an employee's working conditions, duties, or responsibilities will be found to constitute a personnel action covered by section 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the appellant alleged that his chain of command directed him to stop attending leadership meetings and performing "extra duties." He also alleged that he was excluded from the interview and hiring process for two new hires to his service. We find that these allegations constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of a significant change in duties or responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant alleged that his chain of command harassed him and subjected him to a hostile work environment by, among other things, excluding him from meetings and conversations, subjecting him to multiple investigations,[4] accusing him of "fabricating data" and of a Privacy Act violation, refusing his request for a review of his position for possible upgrade, yelling at him on three occasions, and failing to provide him the support and guidance needed to successfully perform his duties. Although none of these allegations constitute a covered personnel action individually, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that the cumulative effect of these actions constituted a significant change in his working conditions. <span class="Italic">See Holderfield</span>, 326 F.3d at 1209 (suggesting that a number of minor agency actions relating to the appellant's working conditions may amount to a covered personnel action under section 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii) collectively, even if they are not covered personnel actions individually); <span class="Italic">Covarrubias v. Social Security Administration</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 583, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 15 n.4 (2010) (finding that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged a significant change in working conditions when she alleged that her supervisors harassed her about personal telephone calls, closely monitored her whereabouts, followed her to the bathroom, and denied her an accommodation for her spina bifida, which required her to self-catheterize), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Colbert v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 12 n.5 (2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although employee investigations generally are not personnel actions within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A), it is proper to consider evidence regarding an investigation if it is so closely related to an alleged personnel action that it would have been a pretext for gathering information to retaliate for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Mattil v. Department of State</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 21 (2012). Here, the appellant has not identified any specific personnel actions associated with the September 2013 and February 2015 investigations; rather, he admits that there was no follow-up to either investigation. Accordingly, we find that he has not nonfrivolously alleged that the investigations themselves constitute a covered personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that he was subjected to a significant change in duties or responsibilities and a significant change in working conditions, we proceed to the question of whether he nonfrivolously alleged that his protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take these alleged personnel actions. To satisfy the contributing factor criterion, an appellant only need raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the fact of, or content of, the protected disclosure was one factor that tended to affect the personnel action in any way. <span class="Italic">Ontivero v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6; 21 (2012). One way to establish this criterion is the knowledge-timing test, under which an employee may nonfrivolously allege that the disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure and that the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board has held that a personnel action taken within approximately 1 to 2 years of the appellant's disclosures satisfies the knowledge-timing test. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleged that, on June 26, 2013, he made his first disclosure regarding his supervisor's alleged impaired status to the Director and Chief of Staff. He further alleged that, less than 2 weeks later, the Chief of Staff instructed him to stop going to "other meetings" and "apparently informed" his supervisor of the disclosures because, beginning on July 26, 2013, his supervisor became hostile towards him. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 14. The appellant alleged that he continued to report his concerns about his supervisor's impaired status over the next 2 years and, as described above, alleged that his chain of command continued removing his previous duties and responsibilities and subjecting him to a hostile work environment during that time. We thus find that the appellant has satisfied the knowledge-timing test because he nonfrivolously alleged that his supervisor and the Chief of Staff were aware of his disclosures and that they commenced the alleged retaliatory acts within several weeks of his first disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Ontivero</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6; 23. In light of the foregoing, we find that the appellant has established Board jurisdiction over this IRA appeal by proving exhaustion of his OSC remedies and nonfrivolously alleging that he made at least one protected disclosure that was a contributing factor in at least one covered personnel action. <span class="Italic">Mastrullo</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 12.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3892"></span>When reviewing the merits of an IRA appeal, the Board must determine whether the appellant has established by preponderant evidence that he made a protected disclosure that was a contributing factor in an agency's personnel action. <span class="Italic">Aquino v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 35, &#x00B6; 10 (2014). A preponderance of the evidence is the degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering the record as a whole, would accept as sufficient to find that a contested fact is more likely to be true than untrue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(q). If the appellant makes such a showing, the Board must order corrective action unless the agency can establish by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the disclosure. <span class="Italic">Aquino</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 35, &#x00B6; 10. For the reasons discussed below, we find that the appellant failed to prove by preponderant evidence that the agency subjected him to a covered personnel action.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The Board may not order corrective action if, "after a finding that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor, the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence" of the disclosure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2). Because we find that the appellant failed to establish his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, we do not reach the question of whether the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions in the absence of the appellant's disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To meet his burden of proving that the agency subjected him to a "significant change" in his duties, responsibilities, or working conditions, the appellant must provide sufficient information and evidence to allow the Board to determine whether the agency's alleged action or actions were "significant." <span class="Italic">See Shivaee v. Department of the Navy</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 383, 388-89 (1997) (finding that an employee's relocation from a building on the naval base to a building located outside of the base did not constitute a personnel action because the employee failed to provide sufficient information for the Board to determine whether his move was "significant," such as whether other employees in his position worked outside the base and whether it is common for such employees to be moved from inside the base to outside and vice versa). As described above, only agency actions that, individually or collectively, have practical and significant effects on the overall nature and quality of an employee's working conditions, duties, or responsibilities, and are likely to have a chilling effect on whistleblowing or otherwise undermine the merit system will be found to constitute a covered personnel action under section 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as discussed above, the appellant alleged that, as a result of his protected disclosures, his chain of command removed some of his previous duties and responsibilities. Specifically, he alleged that: in July 2013, the Chief of Staff told him to stop attending his "other meetings" and to start attending meetings with his supervisor; in September 2013, the Chief of Staff directed him not to attend any more Leadership Development Institute (LDI) meetings after the appellant completed that program and to focus on helping his supervisor "get the department where it was when [he] started"; in July 2014, his supervisor directed him to stop attending the Multidisciplinary Pain Management Committee (MPMC) meetings; and, on unspecified dates, his supervisor and the Chief of Staff excluded him from participating in the interview and hiring process for two new hires in his service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's position description does not mention participation in LDI classes, MPMC meetings, or the interview and hiring process as part of his regular duties and responsibilities. Although the appellant submitted a copy of a memorandum regarding the MPMC, which lists his position as one of the members of the MPMC and states that the MPMC meets monthly, he has not described the nature of his prior participation in these monthly meetings or stated how many meetings per year he attended. Likewise, he has not described the nature and frequency of his prior participation in the interview and hiring process, the LDI meetings, or the "other meetings" he was told to stop attending. The record does not establish that these apparently collateral duties and responsibilities constituted a "significant" part of the appellant's duties and responsibilities. <span class="Italic">See Shivaee</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 388-89. Moreover, the record reflects that the appellant completed the LDI program in May 2014, and, thus, there would have been no basis for his continued participation thereafter. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has not established by preponderant evidence that his exclusion from these meetings and the interview and hiring process constituted a significant change in his duties or responsibilities under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleged that, as a result of his protected disclosures, his chain of command subjected him to a hostile work environment, i.e., subjected him to harassment that constituted a significant change in his working conditions. Specifically, he alleged that his supervisor avoided him or walked away from him on multiple occasions, often responded to his questions by stating that he did not know the answer, and failed to provide him adequate guidance. For example, he alleged that, in January 2014, he asked his supervisor for guidance regarding scheduling, but that his supervisor failed to provide any guidance over the course of 2 weeks and only responded by saying "I am going to take care of that." Furthermore, the appellant alleged that the Chief of Staff and his supervisor excluded him from meetings in which they discussed realigning audiology services under the appellant's supervision, and then his supervisor denied knowledge of the realignment and failed to provide him guidance on his new supervisory responsibilities. He also alleged that his supervisor told him that he would not support the appellant's request for a review of his position for possible upgrade, even though the Speech and Audiology Service had come under his supervision and his staff had grown to 21 employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the above allegations regarding the lack of communication, cooperation, and guidance from management, the appellant alleged that, as a result of his protected disclosures, his chain of command began treating him in a hostile manner. Specifically, he alleged that, on September 18, 2013, his supervisor came into his office, became visibly angry, walked around to stand behind the appellant's desk, and yelled at him that he needed to fix something. The appellant also alleged that, on April 2, 2014, his supervisor "grabbed [his] arm to pull [him] into a room" and yelled at him for reporting an incident of improper patient care to the Director and Chief of Staff. He further alleged that, on September 30, 2014, the Chief of Staff yelled at him, accused him of "making up our service data," and told him to "shut up" during a meeting.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant also alleged that the agency directed him to stop attending MPMC and LDI meetings, told him to stop performing "extra duties," and convened investigations against him in September 2013, concerning a billing issue and another investigation in or around February or March 2015, regarding an alleged Privacy Act violation. The appellant additionally alleged that he was excluded from an annual leadership retreat in 2014.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, to determine whether allegations of a hostile work environment establish a covered personnel action, we must consider whether the appellant has shown, by preponderant evidence, that the agency's actions, considered individually and collectively, had practical and significant effects on the overall nature and quality of his working conditions, duties, or responsibilities. Although the appellant submitted witness affidavits supporting many of his allegations, we find that he has failed to establish by preponderant evidence that the agency's actions constituted harassment to such a degree that his working conditions were significantly and practically impacted. His chain of command may have been unresponsive to his requests or untimely in providing guidance, but such deficiencies do not amount to harassment. In addition, the three alleged incidents involving yelling were spread out over the course of a year and, while unprofessional, were not sufficiently severe or pervasive to significantly impact the appellant's working conditions. The investigations, although likely inconvenient, were not overly time-consuming, did not result in any action against the appellant or follow-up investigation, and appear to have been routine workplace inquiries. The appellant's remaining allegations represent mere disagreements over workplace policy. In sum, the appellant's allegations, collectively and individually, while perhaps indicative of an unpleasant and unsupportive work environment, do not establish, by preponderant evidence, that he suffered a significant change in his working conditions under the WPA.</p>

Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 955 F.3d 948, 955 (Fed. Cir. 2020); <span class="Italic">Spivey v. Department of Justice</span>, 2022 MSPB 24, &#x00B6; 10. Thus, on remand, the administrative judge shall consider the appellant's investigation-related allegations in assessing the subject personnel action. Moreover, although the nature of the appellant's claims regarding her duties with the U.S. Army Reserves is unclear, to the extent any purported interference impacted the appellant's civilian Federal employment, such interference could similarly contribute towards a significant change in her working conditions.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), a "personnel action" is defined to include, among other enumerated actions, "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii). The legislative history of the 1994 amendment to the WPA indicates that "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions" should be interpreted broadly, to include "any harassment or discrimination that could have a chilling effect on whistleblowing or otherwise undermine the merit system and should be determined on a case-by-case basis." 140 Cong. Rec. H11,419, H11,421 (daily ed. Oct. 7, 1994) (statement of Rep. McCloskey); <span class="Italic">see Skarada v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2022 MSPB 17, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Savage v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">However, notwithstanding the broad interpretation accorded to the term "significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions," not every agency action is a "personnel action" under the WPA. <span class="Italic">Skarada</span>, 2022 MSPB 17, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">see King v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 133 F.3d 1450, 1452-53 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Rather, an agency action must have practical consequence for the employee to constitute a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Skarada</span>, 2022 MSPB 17, &#x00B6; 15. In determining whether an appellant has suffered a "significant change" in her duties, responsibilities, or working conditions, the Board must consider the alleged agency actions both collectively and individually. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 16; <span class="Italic">see Holderfield v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 326 F.3d 1207, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 2003). A number of agency actions may amount to a covered "significant change" personnel action collectively, even if they are not covered personnel actions individually. <span class="Italic">Skarada</span>, 2022 MSPB 17, &#x00B6; 18. In sum, only agency actions that, individually or collectively, have practical and significant effects on the overall nature and quality of an employee's working conditions, duties, or responsibilities will be found to constitute a personnel action covered by section 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii). <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Post-employment actions were not considered to fall within the coverage of significant changes in working conditions in <span class="Italic">Andersen v. DOD</span>, DC-1221-19-0058-W-1 (NP 11/17/2022) (reviewing enforcement proceedings involving a settlement):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserted that, after his employment with the agency ended, it continued to ban him from the NDU campus, impeded his ability to communicate with former colleagues using their agency email addresses, kept his academic work off the agency's website, did not permit him to attend NDU events, threatened him with a lawsuit, and accused him of violating the settlement agreement, and that the NDU Director made "offensive physical contact" with him at a seminar. The administrative judge did not specifically address these allegations, and therefore we do so in the first instance here <span class="Italic">See Parrish v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 485 F.3d 1359, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (finding that the Board is obligated "to determine its own jurisdiction over a particular appeal").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A "significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions...with respect to an employee in...a covered position in an agency," is an appealable personnel action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii). However, the above allegations all relate to actions that allegedly occurred after his employment with the agency ended. A former employee's appeal rights are limited to actions taken while they were in the status of being an employee or an applicant for employment. <span class="Italic">Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 11 (2010); <span class="Italic">Pasley v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 105, &#x00B6; 10 (2008). These actions do not, therefore, support a finding of a nonfrivolous allegation of a personnel action taken against an "employee" in a covered position in an agency.[11]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;Given this finding, we need not address the disclosures the appellant alleges were contributing factors in the actions taken after his employment ended. Even if we were to address these disclosures, however, they would not appear to be protected because the appellant alleges that they were made after his employment with the agency ended. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) (prohibiting reprisal because of any disclosure of information "by an employee or applicant"); <span class="Italic">Amarille v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 28 F. App'x 931, 932-33 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (agreeing with the Board that it lacked jurisdiction over an IRA appeal brought by a former Federal employee concerning the denial of a retirement annuity, reasoning that he was neither an employee nor an applicant at the time of the agency actions at issue).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction regarding any alleged personnel actions that are not covered by the waiver of Board appeal rights in the parties' settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some Board decisions consider post-employment bad references, i.e., blacklisting, as within IRA coverage. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Dept. of Labor</span>, AT-3443-13-7178-B-1 (NP 3/10/2016) ("As we remanded the matter for a hearing on the merits, we noted that the allegations could be construed as DOL blacklisting her from future employment, which could constitute a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A) (defining 'personnel action' for purposes of the Whistleblower Protection Act); <span class="Italic">Mattil v.

<p class="Body-Text">Without defining the limits of the nature of evidence of a change in duties when that evidence and related allegations are not first presented to OSC, <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, DC-1221-17-0088-W-1 (NP 8/12/2022), the Board suggested the information may serve as background and additional facts supporting her claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Because these actions postdate OSC's closure letter and were not raised to OSC, we find that they are not properly before the Board at this time for consideration as separate personnel actions. Nevertheless, the appellant's failure to raise these matters in her OSC complaint as separate personnel actions does not necessarily prevent her from introducing them in her Board appeal as background and additional facts in support of her claim that the agency subjected her to a significant change in duties, responsibilities, and working conditions, provided that she has otherwise exhausted her administrative remedies on that claim. <span class="Italic">See Delgado v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 800 F.3d 913, 924-27 (7th Cir. 2018) (holding that as long as an appellant has presented OSC with sufficient factual information to understand and investigate her claim of whistleblower reprisal, she is not prohibited from buttressing her claim in a subsequent IRA appeal with additional facts not raised before OSC); <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 2022 MSPB 8 (finding that an appellant may demonstrate exhaustion through her initial OSC complaint, correspondence with OSC, or other sufficiently reliable evidence such as an affidavit or declaration attesting that she raised with OSC the substance of the facts in the Board appeal).</p>
