<h5 class="h5" id="sec7-111"><span class="space">h.</span> Dissimilar Offense</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier disciplinary actions may be relied on by an agency to impose a harsher penalty in a subsequent action regardless of differences in the underlying charges. <span class="Italic">Henson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 14 MSPR 401, 403 (1983); <span class="Italic">see Davis v. Dept. <span id="Page_2422"></span>of Navy,</span> PH-0752-12-0073-B-1 (NP 7/27/2015) ("The Board has held that prior discipline will not be discounted on the basis that it is unrelated to the current disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of Justice</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 686, 699 (1994); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 475, 484 (1991); <span class="Italic">see Villela v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 727 F.2d 1574, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (removal for current offense of absence without leave reasonable in light of prior offense of fighting and intoxication); <span class="Italic">Kehrier v. Department of Justice</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 477, 480 n.1 (1985) (past disciplinary record was considered in assessing the reasonableness of penalty despite the fact that it was unrelated to current charge)."); <span class="Italic">Huettner v. Dept. of Army</span>, 54 MSPR 472, 475 (1992) ("The agency could consider the appellant's past 10-day suspension despite the fact that the charges resulting in that suspension only partially related to the current charge."); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR 475, 484 (1991) ("[t]he Board will not discount a prior action considered by an agency on the basis that the prior action was unrelated in nature to the action on appeal."); <span class="Italic">Major v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 14 MSPR 488, 489 (1983) (furnishing a false doctor's statement and unauthorized absences leading to removal with a consideration of a past suspension for possession of marijuana).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A problem with dissimilar offenses is assessing the weight to give to past discipline. The Board has no standards guiding the use of past discipline to enhance a current penalty. One observation was made by a reviewing court in <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1985), involving a supervisor whose past record consisted of two reprimands issued for failing to follow instructions and negligent workmanship. The appellant was later charged with one sustained incident of sexual harassment involving no physical contact or <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>. The court said of the removal penalty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since only one of five incidents has been established,...the penalty of removal would be excessive on that basis alone. Moreover, the past disciplinary actions taken against Mr. Jackson, on which the board relied, appear to have been minor and wholly unrelated to sexual harassment.... Thus, we do not believe that, as a factor affecting the magnitude of the penalty, his past record is a substantial consideration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit expressed its concern about dissimilarity of current charges and past offenses, <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 88-3020):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the second argument, Stephens asserts that the prior charges are dissimilar to the present charges of insubordination and should not have been used to justify the penalty of removal. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. VA</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (past record not a substantial consideration affecting magnitude of penalty when past disciplinary actions unrelated to charge sustained). Specifically, the Administrative Judge found that the present offense "is not the first time [Stephens] has had problems dealing with supervisory authority." Consequently, the AJ found it "obvious that the prior actions did not have a rehabilitative effect on [Stephens]." In affirming, the board also found that Stephens lacked rehabilitative potential as shown by his prior disciplinary record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Both prior disciplinary actions relate to poor workmanship, not insubordination, although the second incident was described as a "failure to comply with supervisory instructions." With respect to that incident, after receiving instruction from his supervisor on the proper use of a template, Stephens made incorrect hinge cut-outs on a landing gear door. In substance, that mistake bears no relationship to insubordination. Accordingly, there is no pattern of conduct which supports a finding that the prior discipline had no rehabilitative effect on Stephens' conduct or showed he lacked rehabilitative potential with respect to the misconduct here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A past record was again discounted by a reviewing court when that record had nothing to do with the current offense,<span class="Italic">Goldstein v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1570, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's analysis of Goldstein's potential for rehabilitation was also incorrect and inadequate. Goldstein had no prior disciplinary record for exercising excessive force--or any other misconduct toward civilians. Thus, it was error for the Board to conclude that prior citations or reprimands for minor and unrelated citations, mostly connected to Goldstein's problem with migraine headaches, had any material bearing on his potential for rehabilitation so as not to use excessive force in effecting arrests. If on remand the Board finds that Goldstein violated the agency Use-of-Force Policy, it will be his first disciplinary action for this conduct. Given the ambiguity as to the appropriate level of force in this situation, the Board should consider Goldstein's transgression less serious, especially considering that Goldstein's training officer, Officer Velasco, testified that one type of kick was used for stunning and that a suspect was not deemed under control until handcuffed, indicating Goldstein's behavior was consistent with his training.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Skates v. Dept. of Army</span>, 69 MSPR 366, 369 (1996) (comparing a current offense of <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> theft with a past offense of an altercation at work: "The nature of that misconduct is so different from the charge in this case that it significantly diminishes the weight of that prior discipline in the calculation of a proper penalty determination."); <span class="Italic">Ibarra v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 11 MSPR 110, 113 (1982) (agreeing with the AJ's conclusion that "little weight be given to the 1978 prior reprimand, which was remote in point of time and involves a different type of infraction").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Theisen v. VA</span>, 31 MSPR 277 (1986), considered an employee removed for an incident, characterized as verbal patient abuse, who had a prior suspension for what was characterized as sexually related misconduct. The AJ's decision to sustain the removal was reversed and the penalty was mitigated by the Board to a 30-day suspension. The record failed to demonstrate any similarity between the misconduct involved in the prior charge and that addressed in the action appealed. Left unsaid was whether that result was limited to the facts, including a settlement agreement concerning the prior action, or whether there was concern by the Board about the dissimilarity of infractions used to aggravate the sanction imposed for a current offense.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may determine that dissimilar offenses combine to outweigh mitigating factors, <span class="Italic">Slaughter v. USDA</span>, 56 MSPR 349, 356-58 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that the administrative judge supported her decision to mitigate the penalty by finding that the appellant was a principled person and that his potential for rehabilitation was good. In making this finding, the administrative judge reviewed the appellant's testimony and found that he was forthright and appreciated the wrongfulness of his conduct. She also found that the appellant's prior disciplinary record did not "bode poorly on the issue of the appellant's rehabilitation potential because [the prior offenses were] so totally unrelated to the instant charges and because of the unrebutted testimony that the instant offenses were uncharacteristic of the appellant."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant was forthright and appreciated the wrongfulness of his conduct, or in her consideration of the appellant's apparent remorse. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. VA</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 305 (1981) (employee's potential for rehabilitation a factor to be considered in reviewing penalty's reasonableness). For the reasons stated below, however, we find that the administrative judge erred in discounting the importance of the appellant's prior offenses on the ground that they were unrelated to the current offenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have consistently held that an employee's prior disciplinary record is a factor that may be considered in determining the appropriate penalty for misconduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Davis v. VA</span>, 792 F.2d 1111, 1113 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR 475, 484 (1991); <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 305 (1981). The Board also has held that prior discipline will not be discounted on the basis that it is unrelated to the current disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 51 MSPR at 484; <span class="Italic">see also Villela v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 727 F.2d 1574, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (court found removal for current offense of absence without leave reasonable in light of prior offenses of fighting and intoxication); <span class="Italic">Kehrier v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 27 MSPR 477, 480 n.1 (1985) (Board considered past disciplinary record in assessing reasonableness of penalty, despite fact that it was unrelated to current charge). Thus, the administrative judge erred in finding that, because the appellant's prior discipline was unrelated to the instant charges, it could be discounted.[13]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;To support her finding that the appellant's prior discipline could be discounted because it was unrelated to the instant charge, the administrative judge cited the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 768 F.2d 1325 (Fed. Cir. 1985). In <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, the court stated that the appellant's past record of minor and unrelated offenses was not a substantial factor in determining the appropriate penalty in that case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1332. The court did not state that a past record of minor and unrelated offenses could not be considered by the Board. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. We are unaware of any precedential decision in which either the Federal Circuit or the Board has held that the Board may not consider an employee's past record in determining the appropriateness of a penalty unless the prior offense is related to the current offense. We therefore need not address the agency's argument that the prior offenses are related to the current offenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's prior disciplinary record includes a demotion for erroneous omissions on an official document in 1989. As the agency has noted, this demotion was based on the appellant's incorrect responses to four questions on a "Questionnaire For Sensitive Positions." In those responses, the appellant failed to disclose that he had filed a petition for bankruptcy, that a certificate of delinquent tax had been issued against him, that there had been a judgment against him for a debt, and that he had been delinquent on loans for more than 90 days. The appellant also was suspended for 10 days in 1986 for unauthorized absence and neglect of duty. We agree with the agency that this evidence that the appellant has had a lengthy history of financial difficulties and misconduct arising from those difficulties casts serious doubt on the appellant's rehabilitative potential. In addition, as the administrative judge noted, the appellant's current offenses constitute a very serious breach of the employer-employee relationship. Finally, for the reasons stated above, we find that the deciding official's testimony regarding the penalty is entitled to considerable weight, and that the evidence of mitigating circumstances is entitled to only limited weight. Under the circumstances of this appeal, we find that the penalty of removal is not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2423"></span><span class="Italic">Banks v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 442, 444 (1981), noted the impact of a past history of absence on a currently charged, dissimilar offense of curtailment of mail:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A history of unauthorized absences with lesser disciplinary actions can be considered in connection with an adverse action. <span class="Italic">Rubin v. United States,</span> 150 Ct. Cl. 28 (1950); <span class="Italic">Chiriaco v. United States</span>, 235 F. Supp. 850 (N.D. Ala. 1963), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 339 F.2d 588 (5th Cir. 1964). This is especially so where, as here, the appellant's duties are such that his absence requires the agency to get someone else to perform his duties, either through overtime or by obtaining a replacement elsewhere. Moreover, the curtailment of mail has a serious effect on the agency's mission to deliver mail in an expeditious manner.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although not abandoning its theory that dissimilar offenses can support enhanced penalties, <span class="Italic">Taylor v. DOJ</span>, 60 MSPR 686, 694 (1994), stated that "[t]he deciding official was not required to 'discount' the conduct that led to the 1989 suspension because it was unrelated to the appellant's failure to file tax returns...but neither should he have ignored the fact that the two offenses were committed in different settings and implicated different government interests."</p>
