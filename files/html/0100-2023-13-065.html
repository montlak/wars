<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-66"><span class="space">D.</span> OFFICIAL TIME</h3>
<p class="noindent">Starting in 1986, FLRA considered official time proposals as an exception (a "carve out") to the management right to assign work. Changing course and basing negotiation determinations and arbitration awards concerning official time on an "excessive interference" test was <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, FCI Miami and AFGE Local 3690</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-236.html">71 FLRA 1247</a>, 1249--51 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting), eliminating the "carve-out" exception for official time:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The carve-out doctrine originated in <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Council of Locals No. 214 v. FLRA</span>[33] (<span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>), which considered whether a proposal concerning official time for representational activities impermissibly interfered with management's &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) right to elect to negotiate over the "numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty."[34] Applying a "direct effects test,"[35] the Authority held that "where [an] agency can show. . .that the use of official time will interfere with the accomplishment of the agency's work, the exercise of management's rights will take precedence."[36] On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected this holding. It noted that there were "ambiguities" between &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7106 and 7131, but found that the Authority's statutory interpretation would "effective[ly] repeal" &#x00A7; 7131(d) because it would "always make official[-]time proposals negotiable only at the agency's election" under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1).[37] The court further stated that "[u]nless [&#x00A7;] 7131(d) carves out an exception. . ., [&#x00A7;] 7106(a) would [also] preclude any negotiation of official time provisions, since official time always affects an agency's ability to assign work."[38]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;798 F.2d 1525 (D.C. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[34]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 1528.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[35]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 1528-29 (test which provides that a proposal that is "directly or integrally related to the numbers, types and grades of employees or positions assigned to a work project, organizational entity or tour of duty, so as to be determinative of such numbers, types and grades, is negotiable [only] at the election of the agency" (alteration in the original)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[36]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 1528 (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Council of Locals No. 214,</span> 19 FLRA 215, 219 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Local 214</span>), <span class="Italic">rev'd AFGE v. FLRA,</span> 798 F.2d 1525 (D.C. Cir. 1986)). </p>
<p class="noindent-2">[37]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 1529; <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> ("Any bargaining proposal concerning official time for representational activities necessarily reduces the number of person-hours available for performing the work of the agency, and therefore has a direct effect on agency staffing patterns.").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[38]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 1530 n.8. <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA,</span> and the Authority decision it reviewed, involved only whether an official-time proposal "directly affected" management's right to "determine staffing patterns" and thus was negotiable only at the election of the agency under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). The Authority's underlying decision held that any time an official-time proposal has a "direct effect" on staffing <span id="page_601"></span>patterns, it falls within &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) and the agency has no duty to bargain over it if it does not wish to do so. <span class="Italic">Local 214,</span> 19 FLRA at 222-223.

Circuit held that this interpretation would effectively read 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(d) out of the Statute, because "[a]ny bargaining proposal concerning official time for representational activities necessarily reduces the number of person-hours available for performing the work of the agency, and therefore has a direct effect on agency staffing patterns." <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA,</span> 798 F.2d at 1529. <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span> did not consider, however, whether official-time proposals are negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) as "appropriate arrangements," and the Authority has subsequently answered this question in the affirmative. Nor did <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span> consider whether application of an "excessive interference" test, the test we adopt today, is consistent with &#x00A7; 7131(d). It is important to note that an "appropriate arrangement" under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) is a mandatory subject of bargaining, notwithstanding &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Ky.

Thus, contrary to the dissent's contentions, our decision today does not effectively "void" &#x00A7; 7131(d), nor does our decision contravene the reasoning of <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority adopted this statutory interpretation in <span class="Italic">Military Entrance Processing Station, Los Angeles, California,</span> finding that an agency committed an unfair labor practice by failing to negotiate before changing the official-time schedule.[39] In rejecting an argument "based on management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)," the Authority held that &#x00A7; 7131(d) "'carves out an exception'" to management's right to assign work because, "otherwise, that right 'would preclude any negotiation of official[-]time provisions.'"[40] The Authority went on to announce that "the use of official time under &#x00A7; 7131(d)--that is, its amount, allocation and scheduling--is negotiable absent an emergency or other special circumstances."[41] </p>

<p class="noindent-1">For several years, the Authority continued to both apply the carve-out doctrine <span class="Italic">and</span> consider whether provisions concerning official time impermissibly interfered with &#x00A7; 7106--in one case, going so far as to conclude, incongruously, that two such provisions did not constitute appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) but were negotiable under carve-out doctrine.[53] Then, without directly overturning <span class="Italic">BATF</span> or providing an explanation, the Authority changed course and stopped considering whether a proposal, provision, or award impermissibly interfered with management rights when official time was involved.[54] In negotiability cases, the Authority considered only whether "emergency or other special circumstances" intervened to render an official time proposal nonnegotiable.[55] Similarly, in the arbitration context, the Authority found that awards upholding official time negotiated under &#x00A7; 7131(d) were not subject to exceptions concerning management's right to assign work.[56] Throughout this time, some Authority members questioned the viability and necessity of the carve-out exception.[57] </p>

<p class="noindent">In light of the foregoing inconsistencies, we believe it is necessary to bring clarity to Authority precedent by giving meaning to the plain wording of the Statute. As interpreted by the Court in <span class="Italic">IRS v.

Contrary to the fear expressed in <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, giving proper effect to &#x00A7; 7106(a) does not "effectively void" &#x00A7; 7131(d) any more than it does other statutory union rights that potentially impact management rights.[59] This is because of the balance that the courts and the Authority have established between the exercise of management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) and appropriate arrangements protecting union rights under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).[60] Reading the Statute in this way "effectuates rather than frustrates the major purpose of the legislative draft[ers],"[61] by accommodating <span class="Italic">both</span> the agency and union interests concerning the use of official time.[62] As it is not necessary to carve &#x00A7; 7131(d) out of &#x00A7; 7106(a) to give it effect, the Authority will no longer apply the carve-out doctrine. Where it is asserted that matters concerning the amount, allocation, or scheduling of official time under &#x00A7; 7131(d) affect a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a), we will consider whether the proposal, provision, or award excessively interferes with that right.[63]</p>

<p class="noindent">Before the 1994 <span class="Italic">PTO</span> decision, <span class="Italic">post</span>, FLRA operated on the theory that if negotiation of official time did not constitute a statutory exception ("carve out") to the right of management to assign work, official time bargaining could be conducted as an arrangement to protect employees against the exercise of management rights. FLRA explained, as to Provisions 2 and 6, in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, BATF</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v45/45-030.html">45 FLRA 339</a>, 344-52 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Military Entrance Processing Station,</span> the Authority reexamined the relationship between management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) and the authorization to negotiate official time for representational purposes under section 7131(d) of the Statute. The Authority noted that Congress provided in section 7131(d) that agencies and unions should jointly determine through negotiations the amount of official time that will be available to employees during any given time period that is "reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest." The Authority also noted that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had stated that "[u]nless section 7131(d) carves out an exception to section 7106(a), section 7106(a) would preclude any negotiation of official time provisions, since official time always affects an agency's ability to assign work." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Council of Locals No. 214 v. FLRA,</span> 798 F.2d 1525, 1530-31 n.8 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>). Therefore, the Authority held that "the use of official time under section 7131(d)--that is, its amount, allocation and scheduling--is negotiable absent an emergency or other special circumstances. . .." <span class="Italic">Military Entrance Processing Station,</span> 25 FLRA at 689.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on that theory, the Authority found negotiable provisions that, similar to Provisions 2 and 6, required agencies to grant requests by employees and union representatives to engage in representational activity on official time, absent certain work-related exceptions. <span class="Italic">For example, American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2354 and Department of the Air Force, HQ 90th Combat Support Group, F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming,</span> 30 FLRA 1130 (1988) (Provisions 1 and 2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More recently, the Supreme Court issued a decision that bears on the relationship between section 7106 and other portions of the Statute. In <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA,</span> 494 U.S. 922 (1990) (<span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>), the Court rejected the Authority's position that section 7106 did not supersede section 7121 of the Statute. In its decision the Court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The FLRA's position is flatly contradicted by the language of &#x00A7; 7106(a)'s command that <span class="Italic">'nothing in this entire chapter'</span>--i.e., nothing in the entire Act--shall affect the authority of agency officials to make contracting-out determinations in accordance with applicable laws. Section 7121 is among the provisions covered by that italicized language. [Emphasis in original.] 494 U.S. at 928.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, Congress intended by section 7131(d) of the Statute <span id="page_603"></span>to authorize unions to negotiate over the use of official time for representational activity. However, the breadth and effect that the Court has ascribed to the phase "nothing in this chapter," which appears in section 7106(a) of the Statute, requires us to reconsider our previous conclusion that section 7131(d) carves out an exception to section 7106(a). A strict reading of the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> leads to a conclusion that section 7131(d) does not override section 7106(a) of the Statute and, thus, that any proposals concerning official time that are negotiated under section 7131(d) are subject to section 7106(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are mindful, however, that an elementary rule of statutory construction is that effect must be given to every word, clause, and sentence of a statute so that no part is rendered inoperative or insignificant. <span class="Italic">See, for example, United States v. Menasche,</span> 348 U.S. 528, 538-39 (1955) ("It is our duty 'to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute,' <span class="Italic">Inhabitants of Montclair Tp. V. Ramsdell,</span> 107 U.S. 147, 152. . .rather than to emasculate an entire section, as the Government's interpretation requires."). As recognized by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA,</span> subordinating section 7131(d) to section 7106(a) of the Statute would effectively void section 7131(d). Accordingly, as the agency charged with the duty of enforcing the Statute, and of harmonizing its provisions, we read <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> to apply to situations where according predominance to the rights established by section 7106 can be achieved without eviscerating another provision of the Statute. Such was the case in IRS v. FLRA, which narrowed the scope of negotiation involving the grievance procedure but did not render section 7121 of the Statute inoperative. Sections 7106 and 7131(d) cannot be reconciled in such a manner. Therefore, we will continue to carve out an exception to section 7106 in order to maintain the negotiability, where otherwise warranted, of matters involving official time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues, as an alternative to carving out an exception to section 7106 of the Statute, that these provisions should be found negotiable as appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3). In view of the Union's argument and as the effect, if any, of <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> on the carve-out theory is one of first impression, we will consider the Union's argument that these provisions constitute appropriate arrangements. We note that section 7106(a) is itself subject to section 7106(b), which authorizes negotiations over procedures that management will observe in exercising its management rights and appropriate arrangements for employees affected by the exercise of management's rights. Therefore, under section 7106 as a whole, a provision or proposal that directly interferes with section 7106(a) may nevertheless be negotiable by operation of section 7106(b)(3), which addresses the negotiation of appropriate arrangements. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>, 702 F.2d 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>). Accordingly, until we receive further guidance from the courts on this issue, where it is asserted that a provision seeking to negotiate over official time under section 7131 is inconsistent with section 7106, we will analyze such provisions to determine whether the provision directly interferes with management's rights under section 7106 and whether it constitutes an appropriate arrangement that is negotiable pursuant to section 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The weight of our case law suggests that the need of an employee to meet with a union representative or of a union representative to perform representational functions generally will be related to some action taken, or proposed, by management in the context of its management rights. Thus, the representational activity generally will seek to ease the effect of such actions. It follows that the ability of employees and their union representatives to engage in such activities is essential to their ability to obtain some mollification of the adverse effects that can flow from the numerous management actions covered by section 7106 of the Statute. We conclude that these provisions are intended to enable employees to address the myriad adverse effects that foreseeably can flow from the exercise of the panoply of management rights that are set forth in section 7106. Accordingly, we find that under the analytical framework that was set forth in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, these provisions constitute arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights under section 7106 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we find that in those few circumstances where the need to engage in representational activity is not attributable to the exercise of a management right, these provisions serve as arrangements for employees whose ability to seek and obtain union representation would be curtailed by the Agency's exercise of its right to assign work. As discussed above, section 7131(d) of the Statute authorizes the parties to a collective bargaining agreement to negotiate over official time for labor-management relations activities. We can only conclude that the purpose of this authorization is to foster the ability of employees to exercise rights accorded them by section 7102 of the Statute to "form, join, or assist" unions and to promote the statutory purpose, as expressed in section 7101, of enabling employees to participate in decisions that affect them. When the Agency denies requests to use official time for a purpose that has been agreed to under section 7131(d), it undermines this statutory scheme with the foreseeable adverse effect on employees of diminishing their ability to pursue effectively and efficiently the avenues that are available to them under the Statute to protect their work-related interests....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As an alternative to finding Provision 6 negotiable based on application of the theory discussed above, the majority in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</span> (Member Armendariz concurring in part and dissenting in part) also analyzed that provision to determine whether it constituted an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute by applying the analytical framework that was set forth in <span class="Italic">KANG.</span> In applying that analytical framework in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,</span> we concluded that Provision 6 constituted an arrangement even though the provision could have required the granting of official time in circumstances where the need to engage in representational activity was not attributable to the exercise of a management right. 45 FLRA at 352. In view of the growing body of court precedent regarding the extent to which proposals that apply broadly to employees may constitute an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute as we discussed in conjunction with Provisions 1 and 2 above,we reevaluate this approach.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that in order for a proposal to constitute an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, it must address adverse effects that may be produced by an exercise of management's rights. We also recognize that not all representational activities for which official time is authorized under section 7131(d) of the Statute will be related to the exercise of a management right. For example, we recently concluded that representing Federal employees by visiting, phoning, and writing to elected representatives in support or opposition to pending or desired legislation that would impact the working conditions of employees constitutes a representational activity for which official time is authorized under section 7131(d) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs, Atlanta, Georgia</span>, 47 FLRA at 1118. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 2050 and</span> <span class="Italic">Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 45 FLRA 289, 294-98 (1992) (responding to parties, including journalistic media and members of the general public, who make inquiries of the union about issues affecting the terms and conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees constitutes representational activity for which official time is authorized under section 7131(d)). On further consideration, we conclude that we will no longer analyze as arrangements proposals that extend to circumstances in which the need to engage in representational activity for which the official time is sought is not related to the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that Provisions 8 and 9 are negotiable as appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. These two provisions are not limited to requiring the release of Union representatives from their assigned duties to perform representational activity relating to the exercise of a management right but apply broadly to all representational activities including such possible pursuits as lobbying elected representatives. We conclude that Provisions 8 and 9 do not constitute arrangements within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute because they are not limited to addressing harms suffered as a result of an exercise of management's rights. Nevertheless, based on our conclusion that section 7131(d) carves out an exception to section 7106, they are negotiable.</p>
