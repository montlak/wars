<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-80"><span class="space">a.</span> Incorrect Determination of Duration of Probation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The calculus for determining the last day for terminating a probationary period was summarized, <span class="Italic">Dressler v. Dept. of Navy</span>, PH-3443-14-0263-I-1 (NP 9/25/2014) (supervisory probationary period):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...However, the administrative judge failed to address Board precedent establishing that, in order to be effective before the completion of a probationary period, a removal from a supervisory position must occur prior to the end of the tour of duty on the last day before the anniversary date. <span class="Italic">See Hawkins v. Department of Treasury</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 686, 690 (1992).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In addition to Board precedent, <span class="Italic">Hawkins</span> cited the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) for the proposition that a probationary period is completed when an employee finishes his last tour of duty before his anniversary date. <span class="Italic">Hawkins</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. at 690. However, the FPM was abolished on December 31, 1993. <span class="Italic">See Honea v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 282, &#x00B6; 9 n.3 (2012), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 524 F. App'x 623 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Nevertheless, OPM's current Operating Manual, <span class="Italic">The Guide to Processing Personnel Actions</span>, continues to provide that an initial appointment probationary <span id="Page_111"></span>period ends at the end of the employee's tour of duty on the last work day of the probationary period. OPM, The Guide to Processing Personnel Actions, Chapter 31, section 5(b), <a href="http://www.opm.gov/feddata/gppa/gppa.asp">www.opm.gov/feddata/gppa/gppa.asp</a> [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/#url=Processing-Personnel-Actions">http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/#url=Processing-Personnel-Actions</a>] (last visited Sept. 17, 2014); <span class="Italic">see Honea</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 282, &#x00B6; 9 n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hawkins</span>, the employee began a 1-year supervisory probationary period on July 1, 1990, and his anniversary date, July 1, 1991, fell on a Monday. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The agency's notice and SF-50 both indicated that he was to be demoted, effective Saturday, June 29, 1991, but they did not state that the action was effective at a time prior to the completion of his tour of duty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board remanded the case, directing the administrative judge to take further evidence as to when the appellant completed his probationary period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 690-91. The Board noted that if, for example, the appellant had no tours of duty on Saturday or Sunday, then he would have completed his probationary period at the end of his tour of duty on Friday, June 28, 1991. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 690.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even in a leap year, probation ends on the day before the anniversary date of the initial appointment. The period of probation is not calculated based on 365 days. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Salahuddin v. MSPB</span>, 690 Fed. Appx. 668, 670 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-099.html#sec1-98">Probationary Supervisor</a>," for other decisions describing the calculus for completing the probationary period and tacking or completion of prior service as a supervisor or probationary supervisor.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency personnel offices typically send notices to supervisors before the completion of an employee's probation asking the supervisor if the employee should be retained. If the notices are sent out a month or two prior to the completion of probation, no problem with the timing of a termination should occur. But agencies may allow a probationer to work almost the full year of the initial appointment and then terminate the probationer on the last day of duty. This is a risky practice. If the agency incorrectly calculates the expiration of the probation period, the employee will be terminated without the procedural protections due a tenured employee. The removal may then be reversed if the termination lacks constitutional safeguards, <span class="Italic">Daniel v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 459, 461-62 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts as found by the administrative judge are not in dispute. The agency appointed the appellant to her position on January 23, 1994, subject to completion of a one-year probationary period. In a memorandum dated January 19, 1995, it notified the appellant that she would be discharged effective "at the end of your tour of duty that begins at 11 PM on January 21, 1995." The appellant's tour of duty ended at 7 <span class="small">A.M.</span> on January 22, 1995, and she was terminated at that time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that because the appellant had been scheduled to work the shift beginning at 11 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on January 22, 1995, and ending at 7 <span class="small">A.M.</span> on January 23, 1995, she had not completed her probationary period when she was terminated at 7 <span class="small">A.M.</span> on January 22, 1995. We find that the administrative judge incorrectly interpreted the relevant case law. A separation action must be effected prior to the end of the probationer's "tour of duty" on the last day of probation, which is the day before the anniversary date. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stanley v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 58 MSPR 354, 357 (1993); <span class="Italic">Burke v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 53 MSPR 372, 375 (1992). Here, the appellant's last day of probation was January 22, 1995, because her anniversary date was January 23, 1995. The end of the appellant's tour of duty on January 22, 1995, occurred at 7 <span class="small">A.M.</span> Because the agency effected her separation at 7 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, and not before that, she had completed her probationary period when she was removed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stanley</span>, 58 MSPR at 357. The fact that the appellant was scheduled to <span class="Italic">begin</span> another tour of duty on January 22, 1995, that would not end until January 23, 1995, is irrelevant. Thus, we find that the appellant's probationary period ended at the completion of her last full tour of duty ending on the day before her anniversary date, and the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant received a competitive service, career-conditional appointment to a GS-0501-07 Financial Management Specialist position with the agency on July 11, 2004. The appointment was subject to a 1-year probationary period beginning on July 11, 2004. On March 20, 2005, the agency placed the appellant on leave without pay (LWOP) for a period not to exceed 60 days. The appellant remained on LWOP for 60 days and returned to duty on May 20, 2005. The Notification of Personal Action, SF-50, returning the appellant to duty, stated that his probationary period had been extended until August 9, 2005, to reflect his excess time in nonpay status. By notice dated July 8, 2005, the agency informed the appellant that it was terminating his employment during his probationary period. The termination was effective on July 12, 2005.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge properly found, the appellant was serving his 1-year probationary period at the time of his termination. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802, the probationary period for an initial appointment to the competitive service is 1 year. Because the appellant's appointment began on July 11, 2004, his probationary period normally would have ended on July 10, 2005, if not for the fact that he was placed in a nonduty, nonpay status from March 20, 2005, until May 19, 2005. Because of this action, his probationary period was properly extended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Absence in a nonpay status while on the rolls (other than for compensable injury or military duty) is creditable up to a total of 22 workdays." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(c). However, "[n]onpay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the probationary period by an equal amount." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, the appellant was a probationer at the time he was terminated, and he failed to allege that he was terminated due to his marital status, for partisan political reasons, or for pre-appointment reasons. Under such circumstances, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(a)-(b) does not provide the Board with jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2002), <span class="Italic">pet. for reh'g en banc denied</span>, 329 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) determined that an appellant meets the definition of "employee" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) for purposes of appeal rights before the Board if the appellant is "an individual in the competitive service (i) who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or (ii) <span class="Italic">who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less</span>...." (emphasis added). In <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, the Federal Circuit found that subsections (A)(i) and (A)(ii) are alternative methods for meeting the definition of "employee," and held that the appellant had the right to appeal her termination to the Board because she met the definition of employee under subsection (A)(ii). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1343.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It does not appear that the precise issue before the Board here has been previously addressed--that is, whether an individual serving under a competitive service appointment whose appointment has lasted a little more than 1 year, but whose probationary period has been extended because of an extended period of time in LWOP status, can be considered to have "completed 1 year of current continuous service," thereby rendering him an "employee" with Board appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in <span class="Italic">Pollak v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 187 (2005), and <span class="Italic">Gutierrez</span>, the Board recently addressed a similar issue of how periods in a nonduty, nonpay status for seasonal employment should be counted in determining whether the "current continuous service" requirement under subsection (A)(ii) is satisfied. The Board noted that "current continuous service" is defined, in pertinent part, as "a period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action...without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b); <span class="Italic">Pollak</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 187, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Gutierrez</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 141, &#x00B6; 12. The Board held that periods in a nonpay status count fully toward <span id="Page_112"></span>satisfying the "current continuous service" requirement, even though they do not count fully toward satisfying the "probationary or trial period" requirement, since nonpay status while remaining on the rolls does not constitute a "break in service." <span class="Italic">Pollak</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 187, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we note that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), which is similar to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A), employees with a right to appeal to the Board include preference-eligible employees in the excepted service who have completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency or the U.S. Postal Service. In interpreting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), the Board has held that the appellant completed 1 year of current continuous service, thus satisfying the requirement for Board appeal rights, when she was separated after more than a year from the date on which she entered the position, notwithstanding the fact that she had been absent from work in a nonpay status since shortly after her first month of work. <span class="Italic">Campbell v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 546, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 7-8 (2001); <span class="Italic">see also Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 512, 514 n.2 (1997) (the Board found that it had jurisdiction over the appellant's constructive suspension and removal appeal beginning 1 year from the date of his entry into his position; the fact that the appellant was not present at work or in a pay status did not affect his completion of the 1-year current continuous service requirement), <span class="Italic">rev'd in part on other grounds on reopening,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 46 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching its conclusion in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, the Board noted that time in a nonpay status in excess of 22 workdays extended a competitive service employee's probationary period, but that OPM made no such provision for excepted service employees. Thus, the Board did not rely on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802 in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>. <span class="Italic">See Campbell</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 546, &#x00B6; 9. We note here that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(c) makes no provision for similarly affecting the computation of that person's current continuous service. Nor are we aware of any statute or regulation indicating that time in a nonpay status should not be counted toward current continuous service.[1] <span class="Italic">Gutierrez</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 141, &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In computing the period of service required for conversion of competitive service employees to career tenure, OPM does not credit time periods in nonpay status in excess of 30 days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.201(b)(4)(ii). However, in setting out this limitation, OPM uses the term "substantially continuous service," rather than "current continuous service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency does not argue that the appellant does not meet the definition of "employee" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii) by having served more than 1 year of current continuous service. Instead, the agency attempts to factually distinguish <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> from the appellant's case. However, the distinctions raised by the agency are not persuasive. In <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, the Federal Circuit stated that the question presented was whether an individual excluded from "employee" status under subsection (A)(i) is an "employee" if he meets the definition under subsection (A)(ii). <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, 307 F.3d at 1341. It appears that the method by which the employee met the 1-year service requirement was not critical, so long as the requirement had been met. Accordingly, we find that <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> is controlling in the instant case, and, therefore, the appellant satisfies the definition of an "employee" with Board appeal rights.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Under Board law prior to <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, the appellant would not have been deemed an "employee" with appeal rights because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii) would have been considered inapplicable to him as a probationer. <span class="Italic">Youngs v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 551, 555-57 (1997). However, in <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, the court held that a probationer with 1 year of current continuous non-temporary service has appeal rights under subsection (A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that, because he is an "employee," the agency's action violated his constitutional right to minimum due process of law. An agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives him of his property right in his employment constitutes an abridgment of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532 (1985). The record shows that the appellant received written notice of his termination on July 11 or 12, 2005, and he was not provided a right to reply to the termination notice. Therefore, the agency's procedures for effecting the appellant's removal did not comport with a tenured employee's constitutional right to minimum due process of law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The stay of a probationer's removal on the stay application of the Office of Special Counsel does not change the status of the individual even though the stay extends his employment past his anniversary date; the stay only preserves the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hardy v. MSPB</span>, 13 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1994), rejected an employee's argument that a period of annual leave commenced before the completion of a one-year period as a probationary supervisor impaired the agency's ability to demote the appellant as a probationer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, an employee's one year probationary period ends on the completion of the employee's tour of duty on the last day before the anniversary date of the employee's appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Ch. 315, &#x00A7; 8-4(d) (April 27, 1982). A "tour of duty" is an employee's regularly scheduled hours and days of duty. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Ch. 296-33, Subch. 35 (January 8, 1993). Although the last day before his anniversary date was May 4, 1992, and his regularly scheduled tour of duty ended at 5:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, Hardy attempts to demonstrate that his probationary period ended at or sometime prior to 4:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on May 4, 1992, the time at which the agency purported to demote him by the letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hardy first argues that the probationary period ended on May 4, 1992, at 10:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, when he went on approved annual leave. He analogizes his case to those in which the board has held that where an employee's anniversary date falls on a Monday, and the employee has no tours of duty on Saturday or Sunday, the probationary period ends at the close of his or her tour of duty on Friday. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Department of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 686 (1992); <span class="Italic">Ibrahim v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 51 MSPR 269 (1991). Without passing on the correctness of these cases, we reject Hardy's contention that annual leave is the same as weekend and holiday periods.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hardy does not dispute that his regularly scheduled duty hours were Monday through Friday from 8:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> to 5:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, with one hour for lunch from noon to 1:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> He was required to request annual leave for his absence on May 4 and 5, 1992, specifically because he was scheduled to work on those days. His taking of annual leave did not alter the fact that he was regularly scheduled to work until 5:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on May 4, the day before his anniversary date. We see no error in the board's determination that Hardy's annual leave did not alter the end of his probationary period.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">For a separation before completion of the probationary period to be effective, the separation action must occur prior to the end of the tour of duty on the last day before the anniversary date. If the anniversary date falls on a Monday and the employee is not scheduled to serve a tour of duty on the weekend, the probationary period ends on the last day of his tour of duty before the anniversary date. When the employee is terminated at the end of the tour of duty on the anniversary date, he completed his probationary period and his removal as a probationer is procedurally defective. <span class="Italic">Johnston v.

The employee is not a probationer if the probationary year ends on a weekend or a holiday and if the employee is separated on the immediately preceding workday. As the separation is effective at midnight; the employee completed his tour of duty. <span class="Italic">Hannon v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 19 MSPR 510, 511 (1984).

Language in the same FPM section stating that a probationer should be separated no later than the day before probation will have been completed (creating a conflict between what constitutes the end of a tour of duty and the beginning of the day prior to the day of completion of probation) was advisory rather than mandatory. Under <span class="Italic">Jeffery</span>, the agency may set a time earlier than midnight of the last day when the separation will be effective, allowing the probationer to be separated on the last day, before the end of her tour of duty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other decisions address the tour of duty formulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Steinhoff v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant received an appointment to the position of GS-11 Telecommunications Specialist, effective January 4, 2010. The appointment was subject to completion of a 1-year probationary period beginning on that date. On January 3, 2011, the agency notified the appellant that he was terminated effective that day, because a review of his performance revealed that he lacked the necessary technical skills and abilities, and because unapproved software was discovered on his agency provided thumb drive, in violation of agency policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for appeal, the appellant argued that he completed his probationary period on January 3, 2011, and, therefore, he was entitled to the due process rights of an employee. He requested a hearing. The agency asserted that the appellant was, in fact, terminated during his probationary period, and, because he had failed to allege discrimination based on marital status or partisan politics, his appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After considering submissions from both parties, the administrative judge issued an order in which he found that the appellant had made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him to a jurisdictional hearing. Subsequently the administrative judge determined, and the parties agreed, that there were no facts in dispute, and that, in lieu of testimony, the parties presented oral argument supporting their respective positions. After they did so telephonically, the administrative judge issued a bench decision. He found that agency personnel actions are generally effective at midnight on the effective date unless another time is specified; that the letter of termination, which indicated that the appellant would be terminated on January 3, 2011, did not specify a time of day when the action would be effective; and that, therefore, consistent with Board case law, the appellant's termination became effective at midnight[1] on January 3, 2011, at which time he had completed his probationary period. The administrative judge further found that, because the agency did not afford the appellant the minimum due process rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, the action must be reversed. The administrative judge subsequently issued an initial decision incorporating the bench decision. He ordered the agency to provide the appellant interim relief, if either party filed a petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;"Midnight" is generally defined as the beginning of a calendar day, i.e., 12:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> However, consistent with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guidance for processing personnel actions, the administrative judge found that the appellant's termination occurred at the end of the day, i.e., 11:59:59 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, on January 3, 2011; rather than nearly 24 hours earlier at 12:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> (midnight).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-settled that to terminate a person while that person is still a probationer, the separation action must be effected prior to the end of the probationer's tour of duty on the last day of probation, which is the day before the anniversary date of his appointment. <span class="Italic">See Scull v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 12 (2010). The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether the agency, in fact, terminated the appellant during his probationary appointment, as it intended. If it did, then the appellant has no statutory right to appeal the action, but only a limited regulatory right of review. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.801 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> Specifically, because he was terminated for post-appointment reasons, the appellant would be required to allege that his termination was based on partisan political or marital status reasons, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(a), (b) for the Board to exercise jurisdiction over his termination. However, if the agency did not terminate the appellant before he completed his probationary period, then he is an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(a), who is entitled to the due process protections of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, it is undisputed that the appellant's anniversary date was January 4, 2011; that his tour of duty on January 3, 2011, was from 6:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> to 2:30 <span class="small">P.M.</span>; that the agency notified him in writing on January 3, 2011, that his termination was effective that day without specifying a particular time of day; and that, upon such notification, he turned in all of his government-issued property, including his computer gear, radio and entry badge, and was escorted from the workplace by 8 <span class="small">A.M.</span> on January 3, 2011. The record establishes that the agency took all actions necessary to out-process the appellant from employment on January 3, 2011, and did not allow him to complete his tour of duty on his last day of probation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant had nevertheless completed his probationary period at the time of his termination, the administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672 (1991). In <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, the agency appointed the appellant to a Clerk-Typist position, effective July 29, 1985. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 676. The appellant received written notice that her termination would be effective on July 28, 1986, but neither the notice nor the SF-50 documenting the termination specified the time of day that it would go into effect. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 679. The record did not document any other actions that the agency took to effectuate the appellant's termination prior to the end of her tour of duty on July 28.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing the now defunct Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), Ch. 315, subch. 8-4(d) (Apr. 27, 1982)[3] for the general principles that a probationary separation must occur prior to the end of the tour of duty on the last day before the anniversary date and that separations otherwise generally occur at midnight--or more precisely at 11:59 <span class="small">P.M.</span>--on the date indicated, the Board concluded that the agency's notice of termination and the SF-50 supported the conclusion that the employee's termination was not effective before the end of her probationary period. <span class="Italic">Stephen,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. at 679. However, the Board in <span class="Italic">Stephen</span> did not hold that written notice identifying the precise time of separation is the <span class="Italic">only</span> way for an agency to effectuate a probationary termination on the last day of the probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The FPM was abolished on December 31, 1993. However, we recognize that OPM's current Operating Manual, The Guide to Processing Personnel Actions, <a href="http://www.opm.gov/feddata/gppa/gppa.asp">www.opm.gov/feddata/gppa/gppa.asp</a> [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/#url=Processing-Personnel-Actions">http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/personnel-documentation/#url=Processing-Personnel-Actions</a>], similarly provides that all separations are effective at the end of the day (midnight) unless an earlier time is indicated on the SF-50, Chapter 31, section 5, and it cautions that, if an agency decides to "terminate the employee during the probationary period, the SF-50 must be effective on a day prior to the last day of the probationary period, or at a specific time of day before the end of the employee's work day on the last day of the probationary period." Chapter 31, section 5(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that the undisputed record in this appeal supports the conclusion that the appellant was separated prior to the end of his tour of duty on his last day of probation. Specifically, where, as here, the evidence clearly establishes that the agency took all necessary actions prior to completion of the appellant's last probationary tour of duty to carry out his termination, its failure to identify in the notice letter the time at which the separation was to go into effect is not dispositive on the question of whether the appellant's termination was effected prior to the conclusion of his tour of duty. The agency has presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate that it completed the actions required to separate the appellant from employment prior to the completion of his tour of duty on January 3, 2011. We, therefore, find that the appellant was still serving his probationary period at the time that his termination became effective. Furthermore, the appellant has not alleged that his termination was based on partisan political or marital status reasons, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(a), (b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed, taking a pragmatic approach to the termination of the probationary appointment, <span class="Italic">Honea v. MSPB</span>, 524 Fed. Appx. 623, 624-27 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Honea was employed by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, part of DHS, as a Telecommunication Specialist, effective January 4, 2010. His position was a career conditional position in the competitive service, subject to a one-year probationary period. His normal tour of duty was from 6:00 <span class="small">A.M</span>. until 2:30 <span class="small">P.M.</span> On January 3, 2011, the last day of his one-year probationary period, Honea was terminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That day, Honea arrived at work at around 6:00 <span class="small">A.M</span>. His supervisor shortly thereafter informed him that he was being terminated and provided him with the agency's letter of termination, which noted that Honea was being terminated for a lack of technical skills and because of the presence of unapproved software on his agency-provided thumb drive. The letter, which Honea signed acknowledging receipt, stated that the effective date of termination was January 3, 2011, but did not specify a time, and <span id="Page_114"></span>advised him of his right to appeal. Honea was then taken through the out-processing procedures, including collecting his computer, radio, badge, and other property, and was then escorted from the facility by 9:00 <span class="small">A.M</span>. Honea was paid for a full 8 hour tour of duty for his last day. DHS later approved a Standard Form 50 Notification of Personnel Action ("SF-50") documenting the termination as effective January 3, 2011, but without mentioning a specific termination time. Honea appealed his termination to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge ("AJ") issued an Acknowledgment Order summarizing the appeal rights available to both probationers and employees who have completed an applicable probationary period. The AJ ordered Honea to show cause why his appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Honea responded, alleging that DHS failed to note a specific time of day on his termination paper work, thus terminating him effective at the end of the day. DHS moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that Honea was terminated during his probationary period and hence that he had no right to appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ issued an order finding that Honea had made a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction, entitling him to a hearing on the issue of jurisdiction. After reviewing additional submissions and oral argument, the AJ issued a bench decision. The AJ found that agency personnel actions are generally effective at midnight at the end of the effective date unless another time is specified. Because the letter of termination and the SF-50 did not specify a time, the AJ determined, consistent with <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672 (1991), that Honea's termination was effective at midnight on January 3, 2011, and thus he completed his probationary period before the effective date of the termination. The AJ accordingly found that the personnel action must be reversed because Honea was not afforded the minimum due process rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. The AJ then issued an initial decision, incorporating his bench decision. DHS petitioned for review by the full Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board vacated the AJ's initial decision and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The Board explained that <span class="Italic">Stephen</span> did not hold that a written notice must identify the time of separation to cause a probationary termination to be on the last day of the probationary period. Instead, the Board held that other evidence could be used to establish the time of termination. Given the undisputed facts, the Board concluded that Honea was terminated before the end of his tour of duty. Because Honea was a probationary employee at the time of termination, the Board dismissed Honea's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A probationary employee has a limited right of review granted by regulation. Where termination of a probationer is made for post-appointment reasons, the probationer is limited to seeking review of that termination on the grounds that it was based on partisan political or marital status reasons, none of which were alleged by Honea. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806. If an agency terminates an individual after he has completed that probationary period, that individual is entitled to the due process under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, including: a right of appeal; 30 days' advance notice of termination with an opportunity to respond; a right to representation by an attorney; and a written decision providing reasons for the personnel action. Thus the question on appeal is whether Honea was a probationary employee at the time of his termination. In other words, was he terminated prior to 2:30 <span class="small">P.M</span>. on January 3, 2011? If so, then the Board lacks jurisdiction over his appeal. If not, then the Board has jurisdiction, and DHS failed to afford Honea his due process rights under &#x00A7; 7513.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Honea alleges that he was terminated after completing his probationary period, and thus that the Board had jurisdiction to hear his appeal. In support of his position, Honea argues that under <span class="Italic">Stephen</span> and the Office of Personnel Management's Guide to Processing Personnel Actions (the "GPPA"), the lack of a termination time listed on either his SF-50 or the termination letter as well as the fact that DHS paid him for a full tour of duty, all support his position that he was terminated after his probationary period had ended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The primary case relied on by both Honea and the AJ is <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672. In <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, the employee was terminated on the last day of her probationary period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 679. The Federal Personnel Manual ("FPM") provided that an effective pre-probationary period separation must occur prior to the end of the tour of duty on the last day before the end of the probationary period, "since separations are otherwise effective at midnight." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As neither the termination notice nor the SF-50 in <span class="Italic">Stephen</span> noted a time of termination, the Board determined that the employee had been separated after she completed her probationary period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, neither the termination notice nor the SF-50 specified a termination time. In addition, the GPPA, like its predecessor, the FPM in <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, cautions that "[a]ll separations are effective at the end of the day (midnight) unless an earlier time is indicated on the Standard Form 50." OPM, Guide to Processing Personnel Actions 31-6 &#x00A7; 5 (RA 73). As a consequence, the GPPA states that, if an agency does "terminate the employee during the probationary period, the Standard Form 50 must be effective on a <span class="Italic">day prior</span> to the last day of the probationary period, or at a specific <span class="Italic">time of day</span> before the end of the employee's work day on the last day of the probationary period." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 31-6 &#x00A7; 5(b) (RA 73). While an agency must comply with the instructions issued by OPM in the GPPA, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 250.101, those regulations do not mandate a finding of Board jurisdiction due to a failure to adhere to the GPPA, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 250.103 (Failing to adhere to the GPPA can result in an order from OPM requiring the agency take corrective action.). The guidance given in the GPPA is only a relevant consideration in evaluating personnel actions, not a conclusive one. <span class="Italic">See Roman v. C.I.A</span>., 297 F.3d 1363, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (noting that internal handbooks are not given the same weight as regulations and citing the GPPA to define "nonpay status"); <span class="Italic">Clark v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 95 F.3d 1139, 1140, 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (citing the GPPA on how to calculate length of service for veterans).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that Honea was terminated before the end of his probationary period. It stands to reason that if an employee is terminated before he has completed his probationary period, he has been terminated during his probationary period. That is what occurred here. In this case, unlike in <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, the evidence is undisputed that DHS took all the steps required to terminate Honea prior to the end of his tour of duty: (1) the termination letter was delivered and signed; (2) the supervisor advised Honea of his termination; (3) Honea was taken through the out-processing procedures, including collection of his computer, radio, badge, and other property; and (4) he was escorted from the facility. The fact that the GPPA counsels otherwise is not binding, as it is merely cautionary guidance to the agencies from OPM, like the FPM. <span class="Italic">See Tuggle v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 100, 102 (1984) ("The FPM, insofar as it includes more than a restatement of statutory and regulatory requirements, constitutes only the Office of Personnel Management's official 'guidance' to agencies."). The failure to include the date on the SF-50 form or the termination letter was at worst an oversight. There is no doubt that, from an objective standpoint, Honea was terminated prior to the end of his tour of duty. The fact that Honea received a full-day's wages is also not relevant to whether the agency completed a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Hardy v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 13 F.3d 1571, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1994). It was just a decent gesture by the agency to pay Honea for a full day even though he only worked part of the day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All the facts evidence that Honea was terminated before his tour of duty ended at 2:30 <span class="small">P.M</span>.; thus, the Board properly determined that Honea was terminated before his probationary year ended. As Honea was removed during his probationary period, the Board was likewise correct to dismiss his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Distinguishing <span class="Italic">Honea</span>, in <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Dept. of Transp</span>, 2023 MSPB 18, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-19 (2023), involving a complex series of events undertaken to terminate a probationer right at the end of the probationary period, the Board found the agency's efforts insufficient and reversed the termination for lack of due process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the agency argues that this case is controlled by <span class="Italic">Honea v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 282 (2012), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 524 F. App'x 623 (Fed. Cir. 2013). In <span class="Italic">Honea</span>, the Board held that, when the evidence clearly establishes that the agency took all necessary actions prior to completion of the appellant's last probationary tour of duty to carry out his termination, its failure to identify in the notice letter the time at which the separation was to go into effect is not dispositive on the question of whether the appellant's termination was effected prior to the conclusion of his tour of duty. 118 M.S.P.R. 282, &#x00B6; 10. In <span class="Italic">Honea</span>, the agency delivered the appellant a termination notice on the last day of his probationary period, but it did not specify the time of day that the termination was to be effective. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 7. As discussed above, these situations normally activate the default rule that a separation will occur on midnight of the date specified. However, the agency in <span class="Italic">Honea</span> not only delivered the appellant his termination notice, but it also collected all of his agency-issued equipment and escorted him off the premises before the end of his tour of duty. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 7. The Board found that, notwithstanding the absence of a specific time in the termination notice, the agency's actions were sufficient to effect the termination before the end of the appellant's tour of duty. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that the instant appeal is unlike Honea because the termination notice in this case was not silent as to the effective time of the termination; rather, it specified that the termination was to be effective at the close of business. Even if the appellant turned in his agency-issued property as alleged, we find that the actions of the parties leading up to the termination were insufficient to overcome the specific language of the termination notice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Receipt of the notice of the termination of a probationer's appointment does not determine whether the agency acted within the probationary year, <span class="Italic">Lopez v. Dept. of Army,</span> DC-315H-11-0107-I-1 (NP 5/25/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_115"></span>The administrative judge dismissed this appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the agency terminated the appellant before she completed her probationary period. The appellant asserts on review that she should have been granted a hearing and that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.804(b) applies in this case. She also claims that the agency improperly charged her with absence without leave (AWOL) for part of the days of October 8-9, 2010, that she did not receive the termination notice until October 12, 2010, which was after her last scheduled tour of duty before her anniversary date, and that she followed proper leave procedures by calling in sick on October 9-10, 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.804(b), a probationary period ends when the employee completes her scheduled tour of duty on the day before the anniversary date of the employee's appointment. The appellant asserted that her last tour of duty before her anniversary date of October 13, 2010, was on October 10, 2010. The agency's action terminating the appellant at 7:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> on October 9, 2010, occurred before she completed her last tour of duty before her anniversary date, and thus before she completed her probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although an agency must effect the termination of a probationer before the end of the probationer's tour of duty on the last day of probation, which is the day before the anniversary date, it is not a requirement that a probationary employee actually receive a termination notice prior to the effective date of the termination if the agency acted diligently and reasonably in attempting to afford the employee prior notification. <span class="Italic">See Scull v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 12 (2010). The record reflects that a supervisor telephoned the appellant on October 5 and October 6, 2010, and left voicemail messages requesting that she come into the office on October 7, 2010, but the appellant did not return those calls and did not show up for work on October 7 or October 8, 2010. The agency then mailed the termination notice to her on October 8, 2010, by certified and regular mail. The appellant never claimed the notice sent to her by certified mail. On October 9 and 10, 2010, the appellant left voicemail messages indicating that she was calling in sick and would not show up for work. The appellant has not challenged this evidence on review. Under these circumstances, the agency acted diligently and reasonably in attempting to afford the appellant prior notification. <span class="Italic">See Scull</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14.</p>
