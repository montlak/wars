<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-4"><span class="space">1.</span> Impact on Service Efficiency</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">AWOL and leave abuse are not well received in the federal service, <span class="Italic">Davis v. VA</span>, 792 F.2d 1111, 1113 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Davis' argument that an employee's AWOL has no effect on the efficiency of the service is frivolous. An essential element of employment is to be on the job when one is expected to be there. To permit employees to remain away from work without leave would seriously impede the function of an agency. <span class="Italic">Rubin v. United States</span>, 150 Ct. Cl. 28, 38 (1960). An unexcused absence imposes burdens on other employees and, if tolerated, destroys the morale of those who meet their obligations<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Moreover, absence without leave is not excused by acceptable performance when an employee does choose to appear. Acceptable performance is a separate element of one's obligations to an employer. For these reasons, we hold that any sustained charge of AWOL is inherently connected to the efficiency of the service....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">More succinctly, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 429 Fed. Appx. 964, 967 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Regarding the nexus element, "the nexus between the charged offense and the efficiency of the service is automatic when the charged offense is AWOL." <span class="Italic">Bryant v. Nat'l Sci. Found.</span>, 105 F.3d 1414, 1417 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The theme was reiterated, <span class="Italic">Ross v. USPS</span>, AT-0752-13-0151-I-1 (NP 4/29/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding nexus, we reject the appellant's suggestion that the agency must establish the actual effect that his repeated unscheduled absences <span id="Page_2426"></span>had on its operations. It is well-settled that one of the essential functions of almost every government job is coming to work regularly. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stevens v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 619, 625 (1997). Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Law v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 852 F.2d 1278, 1279-80 (Fed. Cir. 1988), our reviewing court rejected the petitioner's argument challenging the required nexus between his misconduct (multiple approved unscheduled absences and one instance of AWOL) and the efficiency of the service. The Federal Circuit noted that "an agency is inherently entitled to require an employee to be present during scheduled work times and, unless an agency is notified in advance, an employee's absence is disruptive to the agency's efficient operation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Taylor v. USPS</span>, 393 Fed. Appx. 717, 719-20 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), noted of AWOL:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"In order to prove a charge of AWOL, an agency must show by preponderant evidence that the employee was absent, and that his absence was not authorized or that his request for leave was properly denied." <span class="Italic">Wesley v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 277, 283 (2003). An AWOL charge automatically satisfies the nexus requirement because "any sustained charge of AWOL is inherently connected to the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Davis v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 792 F.2d 1111, 1113 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the penalty of removal, the Board properly balanced the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. It credited Taylor's fifteen years of service and clean disciplinary record, but noted testimony by Service officials that a letter carrier's absence creates serious hardships, and that Taylor could not be rehabilitated. We discern no clear error in the Board's review of the Service's penalty. <span class="Italic">Cf. Law v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 852 F.2d 1278, 1279 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (affirming the Service's removal of a mailhandler for "for irregular attendance and for an instance of AWOL").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Noble v. USPS</span>, (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">The Postal Service, a big agency with a big mission, produces lots of Board appeals from employees who are discharged for AWOL, extensive LWOP, or irregular attendance. <span class="Italic">Burks v. USPS</span>, 593 Fed. Appx. 988, 990-91 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP), summed up some decisions involving Postal employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service has the burden to prove its charge of "failure to be regular in attendance" by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Vaughn v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 469, 476 (2008). It must also establish that any disciplinary action "promotes the efficiency of the service and that the imposed penalty is reasonable." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 476-77.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To take disciplinary action against an employee for absences, the Postal Service must show each absence "was not requested and approved in advance...." <span class="Italic">Stratton v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 337, 342 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 150, 156 (1995)). The Board found, and Ms. Thomas does not contest, that Ms. Thomas was absent for approximately six weeks from February 26, 2012 until April 6, 2012, when the Postal Service issued its Notice of Proposed Removal. There is no evidence in the record that Ms. Thomas's absences were specifically requested or approved in advance. To the contrary, the record shows the Postal Service repeatedly instructed Ms. Thomas, by mail and by phone, to justify her continued absence. The Postal Service warned that failure to do so would result in disciplinary action. Ms. Thomas failed to respond to these requests or to otherwise communicate with the Postal Service. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that Ms. Thomas's absences were actionable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously held that "numerous instances of absence and tardiness" constitute a failure to be regular in attendance. <span class="Italic">Brin v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 549 (1991). It has relied on fewer than six weeks of absences in previous cases. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jones v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 674, 675 (2009) (eleven unscheduled absences during a three-month period); <span class="Italic">Stratton</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. at &#x00B6; 10 (sixteen incidents of absence and tardiness); <span class="Italic">Byers v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 456, 458, 463-64 (1998) (nine or fewer incidents of unscheduled leave during a four-month period, in addition to a prior disciplinary record based on attendance). Here, we find that Ms. Thomas's absence for at least six weeks provides substantial evidence to support the Board's finding that she failed to be regular in attendance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Thomas suggests that even if she failed to be regular in attendance, the penalty of removal was unreasonable. She notes the Administrative Judge misstated her length of service, one of the factors used to determine the appropriate penalty. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305 (1981). The Administrative Judge found that Ms. Thomas had twelve years of government service. In fact, Ms. Thomas had approximately twenty eight years of combined civilian and military service in the government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this error was harmless. "In assessing the appropriateness of the agency's penalty selection, the most important factor is the nature and seriousness of the misconduct...." <span class="Italic">Jinks v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 627, 635 (2007). The Administrative Judge properly found that Ms. Thomas's failure to be regular in attendance without any justification for her absences was a serious offense that merits removal. An additional sixteen years to an already long period of service would not have altered this conclusion. Accordingly, we find the Board's affirmance of the penalty of removal was not an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Absence without leave and related attendance problems are valid reasons for removal. <span class="Italic">Huston v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 6 MSPR 260, 264, 6 MSPB 223 (1981) (13-day absence was sufficient for removal; "existence of drug dependency does not excuse his admitted failure to call his supervisor during his period of absence"); <span class="Italic">Clemmons v. USPS</span>, 5 MSPR 363, 365, 5 MSPB 383 (1981) ("The Board agrees with the agency that AWOL and related attendance problems are valid reasons for removal"; mitigating removal based on lengthy service and documented disability). Courts reaffirm the right of an agency to dismiss employees who are AWOL or who take frequent, unscheduled absences and disrupt agency operations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baltz v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 99-3129) ("Being absent without leave is a basis for removal without consideration of how essential the employee is to the agency."); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Burnley</span>, 887 F.2d 471, 481 (4th Cir. 1989) ("Most telling is the fact that many of her unexcused absences followed closely on the heels of Johnson's reprimands and suspensions for prior attendance problems. The undisputed evidence shows that Johnson had numerous unexcused absences and had flouted clear warnings about prompt attendance."); <span class="Italic">Law v. USPS</span>, 852 F.2d 1278, 1279-80 (Fed. Cir. 1988) ("First, the record shows that the board considered testimony from agency witnesses stating that it was important that Law be present, on time, and avoid unscheduled absences. The agency provided more than a mere conclusory statement. In any event, an agency is inherently entitled to require an employee to be present during scheduled work times and, unless an agency is notified in advance, an employee's absence is disruptive to the agency's efficient operation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Washington v. Department of the Army</span>, 813 F.2d 390, 394 (Fed. Cir.) (even prior approved leave may show unreliable attendance and render employee "of marginal value to agency");&#8197;...Second, we have held that 'any sustained charge of AWOL is inherently connected to the efficiency of the service.' <span class="Italic">Davis v. Veterans Admin.,</span> 792 F.2d 1111, 1113 (Fed. Cir. 1986).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the charge is AWOL over a number of days, the Board will uphold discipline if a portion of the charged AWOL is proved, even if a portion is not sustained, depending on the severity of the offense. <span class="Italic">Foreman v. USPS</span>, 89 MSPR 328, 332 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2001); <span class="Italic">see</span> Crawford v.
