<p class="Body-Text">Agencies have long taken action against employees for false responses to employment-related inquiries. Discharge for operating a vehicle in an unsafe and improper manner and submitting a false accident report was sustained as to a Postal Service tractor trailer driver. <span class="Italic">Turks v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 87-3536). An appellant who responds to a suspension proposal may find himself removed if, during his defense of the suspension, he supplies false statements to the agency. <span class="Italic">Williams v. DLA</span>, 34 MSPR 54, 59 (1987). Misrepresentations during an investigation into an appellant's worthiness for a security clearance furnish a basis for adverse action. <span class="Italic">Benoist v. DOD</span>, 40 MSPR 418, 426-27 (1989); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Executive Office of President</span>, 54 MSPR 196, 199 (1992) (erroneous responses on a SF-86, coupled with the failure to correct those misstatements sufficiently quickly, led to the removal of a contract specialist, a position that required "great trust"). The D.C. Circuit finds security investigations unobjectionable on constitutional grounds (including privacy objections) in the absence of a specific Fifth Amendment objection. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE v. Greenberg</span>, 983 F.2d 286 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (on review of a grant of preliminary injunction precluding the use of certain questions in security investigations; not deciding when Fifth Amendment objections could be raised and whether disclosures could be compelled without a specific grant of immunity).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The extent that false statements in the course of EEO proceedings are privileged appears to be an open question. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vasconcelos v. Meese</span>, 907 F.2d 111 (9th Cir. 1990). But in <span class="Italic">Castellanos v. Dept. of Army</span>, 62 MSPR 315, 320-21 (1994), suspension was appropriate for an individual who attempted to obtain a false statement from a coworker for the purpose of influencing an EEO investigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant did not merely press Mr. Dovalina for a statement: He pressed Mr. Dovalina for a false statement, as the agency charged and which we find does rise to the level of misconduct. <span class="Italic">Cf. Taylor v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 49 MSPR 155, 160 (1991) (a supervisor's improper advice to his subordinate that she need not answer any of the questions posed by a postal inspector constituted interference with a postal investigation, amounting to misconduct).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the administrative judge found that the agency failed to establish that the appellant solicited the statement to "influence the outcome of an official EEO investigation." The administrative judge reasoned that, although the appellant had admittedly filed an informal EEO complaint against Mr. Canales prior to his solicitation of the statement from Mr. Dovalina, there was no record evidence that the EEO complaint had been accepted for a formal investigation, and it appeared that the complaint was "still at an informal counseling stage" at the time of the solicitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the status of the appellant's EEO complaint at the time he solicited the statement from Mr. Dovalina is not determinative of whether he intended to use any statement obtained for the purpose of influencing an official EEO investigation. Under the applicable Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations in effect prior to October 1, 1992, the filing of an informal EEO complaint was a necessary prerequisite to the filing of a formal EEO complaint<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.213. Upon receiving an informal complaint, an EEO Counselor was required to make whatever "inquiry" he or she believed necessary to resolve the matter. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.213(a). We note that <span class="Italic">Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary</span> 624 (1990 ed.) defines "inquiry," in relevant part, as "a systematic investigation often of a matter of public interest." We further note that, although the EEOC regulations used the term "investigation" in referring to an investigation following the acceptance of a formal EEO complaint, 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.216, the regulations do not specifically limit the term in such a manner, and the record evidence does not show that the agency used the term in such a limited manner. We therefore find that the informal counseling stage did involve an investigation under the applicable regulations. In addition, whether the investigation was at the informal or the formal level, it was "official" because it was authorized, indeed required, by the EEOC regulations<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.213(a).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Although the deciding official may consider the appellant's denial of misconduct as a component of the appellant's potential, or lack of potential, for rehabilitation, the denial should not serve as a separate but unstated charge in support of the adverse action, <span class="Italic">Talavera v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that, in making his penalty determination, Blackshaw improperly relied upon his determination that the appellant's response to the notice of proposed removal contained false statements. Blackshaw did testify that he considered the false statements in the appellant's written reply to the notice of proposed removal in making his penalty determination. However, it was not necessarily improper for him to do so. Clearly, it would have been improper for Blackshaw to consider the false statements in the appellant's response to the notice of proposed removal as a separate charge justifying her removal without providing her with notice of that additional charge and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">See Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 1999). However, it is also clear that an employee's potential for rehabilitation is a relevant consideration in making a penalty determination. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305 (1981). In assessing the appellant's potential for rehabilitation, it would have been entirely appropriate for Blackshaw to consider the fact that the appellant refused to take responsibility for her actions and made false statements in response to the notice of proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even if Blackshaw erred by considering misconduct that was not included in the notice of proposed removal, such an error would not be a denial of due process. <span class="Italic">See Biniak v. Social Security Administration</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 682, &#x00B6; 10 (2002). The Board has held that it can remedy such an error by doing its own analysis of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to determine whether the chosen penalty is within the tolerable limits of reasonableness for the proven misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>

<p class="Body-Text">In 1998 the Supreme Court laid to rest a controversy that arose from decisions of the Board and the Federal Circuit holding that employees may deny misconduct when questioned during investigations and avoid discipline when agencies determined the denials to be false. Employees must respond truthfully in agency investigations, even if they are not under oath, or suffer discipline for prevarication, <span class="Italic">LaChance v. Erickson</span>, 118 S. Ct. 753, 754-57 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question presented by this case is whether either the Due Process Clause or the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), 5 USC 1101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, precludes a federal agency from sanctioning an employee for making false statements to the agency regarding alleged employment-related misconduct on the part of the employee. We hold that they do not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondents Walsh, Erickson, Kye, Barrett, Roberts, and McManus are government employees who were the subject of adverse actions by the various agencies for which they worked. Each employee made false statements to agency investigators with respect to the misconduct with which they were charged. In each case, the agency additionally charged the false statement as a ground for adverse action, and the action taken in each was based in part on the added charge. The employees separately appealed the actions taken against them to the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board). The Board upheld that portion of the penalty based on the underlying charge in each case, but overturned the false statement charge. The Board further held that an employee's false statements could not be used for purposes of impeaching the employee's credibility, nor could they be considered in setting the appropriate punishment for the employee's underlying misconduct. Finally, the Board held that an agency may not charge an employee with failure to report an act of fraud <span id="Page_2774"></span>when reporting such fraud would tend to implicate the employee in employment-related misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director of the Office of Personnel Management appealed each of these decisions by the Board to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In a consolidated appeal involving the cases of Walsh, Erickson, Kye, Barrett, and Roberts, that court agreed with the Board that no penalty could be based on a false denial of the underlying claim. <span class="Italic">King v. Erickson,</span> 89 F.3d 1575 (1996). Citing the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the court held that "an agency may not charge an employee with falsification or a similar charge on the ground of the employee's denial of another charge or of underlying facts relating to that other charge," nor may "[d]enials of charges and related facts...be considered in determining a penalty." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 1585. In a separate unpublished decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Board's reversal of the false statement charge against McManus as well as the Board's conclusion that an employee's "false statements...may not be considered" even for purposes of impeachment. <span class="Italic">McManus v. Dept. of Justice,</span> 66 MSPR 564, 568 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in both cases, 521 U.S. __ (1997), and now reverse. In <span class="Italic">Bryson v. United States</span>, 396 U.S. 64 (1969), we said: "Our legal system provides methods for challenging the Government's right to ask questions--lying is not one of them. A citizen may decline to answer the question, or answer it honestly, but he cannot with impunity knowingly and willfully answer with a falsehood." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 72 (footnote omitted). We find it impossible to square the result reached by the Court of Appeals in the present case with our holding in <span class="Italic">Bryson</span> and in other cases of similar import.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5 USC 7513(a) provides that an agency may impose the sort of penalties involved here "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." It then sets forth four procedural rights accorded to the employee against whom adverse action is proposed. The agency must:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;give the employee "at least 30 days' advance written notice";</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;allow the employee "a reasonable time, but not less than 7 days, to answer orally and in writing and to furnish...evidence in support of the answer";</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;permit the employee to "be represented by an attorney or other representative"; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;provide the employee with "a written decision and the specific reasons therefor."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 USC 7513(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In these carefully delineated rights there is no hint of any right to "put the government to its proof" by falsely denying the charged conduct. Such a right, then, if it exists at all, must come from the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Fifth Amendment provides that "[n]o person shall...be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law...." U.S. Const., Amend. V. The Court of Appeals stated that "it is undisputed that the government employees here had a protected property interest in their employment," 89 F.3d at 1581, and we assume that to be the case for purposes of our decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The core of due process is the right to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard<span class="Italic">. Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 542 (1985). But we reject, on the basis of both precedent and principle, the view expressed by the Court of Appeals in this case that a "meaningful opportunity to be heard" includes a right to make false statements with respect to the charged conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that a criminal defendant's right to testify does not include the right to commit perjury. <span class="Italic">Nix v. Whiteside</span>, 475 U.S. 157, 173 (1986); <span class="Italic">United States v. Havens</span>, 446 U.S. 620, 626 (1980); <span class="Italic">United States v. Grayson</span>, 438 U.S. 41, 54 (1978). Indeed, in <span class="Italic">United States v. Dunnigan</span>, 507 U.S. 87, 97 (1993), we held that a court could, consistent with the Constitution, enhance a criminal defendant's sentence based on a finding that he perjured himself at trial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Witnesses appearing before a grand jury under oath are likewise required to testify truthfully, on pain of being prosecuted for perjury. <span class="Italic">United States v. Wong</span>, 431 U.S. 174 (1977). There we said that "the predicament of being forced to choose between incriminatory truth and falsehood...does not justify perjury." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 178. Similarly, one who files a false affidavit required by statute may be fined and imprisoned. <span class="Italic">Dennis v. United States</span>, 384 U.S. 855 (1966).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Appeals sought to distinguish these cases on the ground that the defendants in them had been under oath, while here the respondents were not. The fact that respondents were not under oath, of course, negates a charge of perjury, but that is not the charge brought against them. They were charged with making false statements during the course of an agency investigation, a charge that does not require that the statements be made under oath. While the Court of Appeals would apparently permit the imposition of punishment for the former but not the latter, we fail to see how the presence or absence of an oath is material to the due process inquiry.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Appeals also relied on its fear that if employees were not allowed to make false statements, they might "be coerced into admitting the misconduct, whether they believe that they are guilty or not, in order to avoid the more severe penalty of removal possibly resulting from a falsification charge." But we rejected a similar claim in <span class="Italic">United States v. Grayson</span>, 438 U.S. 41 (1978). There a sentencing judge took into consideration his belief that the defendant had testified falsely at his trial. The defendant argued before us that such a practice would inhibit the exercise of the right to testify truthfully in the proceeding. We described that contention as "entirely frivolous." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 55.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If answering an agency's investigatory question could expose an employee to a criminal prosecution, he may exercise his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. <span class="Italic">See Hale v. Henkel</span>, 201 U.S. 43, 67 (1906); <span class="Italic">United States v. Ward</span>, 448 U.S. 242, 248 (1980). It may well be that an agency, in ascertaining the truth or falsity of the charge, would take into consideration the failure of the employee to respond. <span class="Italic">See Baxter v. Palmigiano</span>, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976) (discussing the "prevailing rule that the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify"). But there is nothing inherently irrational about such an investigative posture. <span class="Italic">See Konigsberg v. State Bar of Cal.</span>, 366 U.S. 36 (1961).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we hold that a government agency may take adverse action against an employee because the employee made false statements in response to an underlying charge of misconduct. The judgments of the Court of Appeals are therefore <span class="Italic">Reversed.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before review of the practice by the Supreme Court, for many years agencies charged employees with both misconduct and the failure to admit the misconduct during agency investigations leading to adverse action proposals. <span class="Italic">Grubka v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 858 F.2d 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1988), discouraged agencies from charging employees with falsification or misrepresentation when they denied allegations of misconduct during investigations and permitted those employees an "exculpatory no." The Board, not enamored with <span class="Italic">Grubka,</span> at first resisted its holding, but finally accepted the result in <span class="Italic">Walsh v. VA</span>, 62 MSPR 586 (1994). For other decisions accepting and rejecting the "exculpatory no" defense to a misstatement charge, refer to <span class="Italic">Kane v. VA</span>, 46 MSPR 203, 212 (1990) (mitigating removal to a 90-day suspension for making a false statement to an investigator), <span class="Italic">Sterling v. DOD</span>, 46 MSPR 177, 185-86 (1990); <span class="Italic">Hill v. Dept. of Army</span>, 44 MSPR 607, 612-13 (1990) (a false statement on a travel voucher was a matter of official interest; the denials occurred before and during an investigation and not only after charges were developed; the appellant's representations were affirmative statements that the travel voucher correctly reflected his travel); <span class="Italic">Allen v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 43 MSPR 192, 195-96 (1990); <span class="Italic">Greer v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 180, 184-85 (1990), <span class="Italic">overruled by</span> <span class="Italic">Walsh v.

DOJ</span>, 70 MSPR 443, 445-46 (1996) (on motion of OPM to intervene relative to the question of whether an agency can charge both misconduct and false statements about the misconduct).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's ruling on "exculpatory no" responses in <span class="Italic">Walsh v. VA</span>, 62 MSPR 586 (1994), extended to denials contained in written, sworn statements obtained during agency investigations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shane v. Dept. of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 269, 272 (1994); <span class="Italic">Lowe v. DOJ</span>, 63 MSPR 73, 76 (1994) (rejecting a charge of an allegedly false statement concerning conduct in the nature of sexual harassment). <span class="Italic">Walsh</span> precluded an agency from considering as an aggravating factor (for purposes of calculation of discipline) the making of false statements in response to an investigatory interview targeting the appellant as a suspect in misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gunn v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 513, 519 (1994); <span class="Italic">Erickson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 63 MSPR 80, 82 (1994) (rejecting a charge alleging that the appellant falsely failed to admit that he was involved in conduct under investigation). <span class="Italic">Walsh</span> applies when the false statement concerns the underlying matter giving rise to the investigative misrepresentation. In <span class="Italic">Washington v. Dept. of Army</span>, 68 MSPR 251, 253 (1995), the appellant was charged with operating a GOV while his driver's license was suspended and lying to a supervisor concerning the suspension. <span class="Italic">Walsh</span> foiled the charge of false statement. <span class="Italic">Walsh</span> prevented the agency or the Board from relying on an investigative misrepresentation to support an argument about the credibility of the appellant's testimony concerning another matter, e.g., separately charged misconduct. <span class="Italic">McManus v. DOJ</span>, 66 MSPR 564, 567 (1995). <span class="Italic">Kirkpatrick v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 583, 586-87 (1997), affirmed the distinction between an "exculpatory no" and an affirmative misrepresentation. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Brogan v. United States</span>, 118 S. Ct. 805 (1998) (disavowing "exculpatory no" as defense to false statement charge under 18 USC 1001); <span class="Italic">Hylick v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 85 MSPR 145, 151 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2000) (removal of a supervisor was sustained for investigative misrepresentation; the privilege against self-incrimination barred compelled testimony as to past crimes, but it did not shelter new perjury).</p>
