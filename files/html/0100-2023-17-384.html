<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-382"><span class="space">7.</span> Adherence to Precedent; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Res Judicata</span></span>; Collateral Estoppel</h4>
<p class="noindent">Arbitrators are generally free to accept, or reject, prior federal sector awards. <span class="Italic">See VA Denver Reg'l Office and AFGE Local 1557</span>, 60 FLRA 235, 236 (2004). The same is true with private sector awards, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, BEP Ft. Worth and IAM Local 2135</span>, 58 FLRA 397, 398-99 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency further contends that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator considered private sector law and his rulings in two private sector arbitration awards related to the issue of the instant case.&#x2003;However, nothing in &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1), which provides the grounds upon which a party may file exceptions to an arbitration award, precludes an arbitrator from considering private sector case law in rendering an award, and the Agency has not cited any other law with which this action conflicts. Moreover, while awards involving private sector disputes are not controlling in the Federal sector, those awards may provide guidance. <span class="Italic">See United</span> <span class="Italic">States Dept of the Treasury, IRS,</span> 51 FLRA 310, 319 (1995). Here, the Arbitrator looked to private sector awards for guidance, and did not consider it controlling. In this regard, the Arbitrator acknowledged that the private sector practice may not be valid in the public sector or under the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs and UPTO</span>, 65 FLRA 131, 134 (2010) (overruled as to scope of the remedy, <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 3571</span>, <span class="blue">71 FLRA 798</span> (2020) (Members Abbott and DuBester dissenting in part)), noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority generally has held that an arbitrator is not bound by another arbitrator's award. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dep't of Agric., </span>57 FLRA at 6 <span class="Italic">(</span>citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2459</span>, 51 FLRA 1602, 1606 (1996)). In this regard, the Authority has found that arbitrators are required to exercise independent and impartial judgment on issues before them. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 6 (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1273</span>, 44 FLRA 707, 712 (1992)). However, arbitrators may consider reasoning and conclusions in other arbitration awards. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, contrary to the Agency's contention, the record shows that the Arbitrator exercised independent judgment in deciding to give preclusive effect to the Hauck Award. In evaluating the disputed issue, the Arbitrator reviewed the hearing transcript in the Hauck Award and found that "there was a full and fair hearing before Arbitrator Hauck." Additionally, the Arbitrator stated that she had "carefully examined Arbitrator Hauck's reasoning and conclusions and [found] that his award [was] not 'logically flawed or erroneous in its interpretation of the parties' [CBA]." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Only after this examination did the Arbitrator decide to give preclusive effect to the Hauck Award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These findings show that the Arbitrator exercised independent judgment concerning the issue before her.&#x2003;Consequently, we find that the award is not contrary to Authority precedent, and we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">NLRBPA and NLRB</span>, 68 FLRA 552, 556 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]rbitration awards are not precedential, so even if the <span class="Italic">Ables</span> opinion involved similar issues or the "interpretation of the same...contract provision[&#8197;],"[61] the Arbitrator was not bound by it.[62]...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[61]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex, Robins Air Force Base, Ga</span>., 68 FLRA 102, 106 (2014).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...We refuse the Union's invitation to reconsider the Authority's precedent that arbitration awards are not precedential. The Authority's approach is based on the longstanding practice in private sector labor relations cases. In our view, the approach serves the purposes of arbitration and to change the approach would not effectuate the policies of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As developed in the private sector, the principle that arbitration awards are not precedential recognizes that arbitrators must not abdicate their function of independent judgment....&#8197;As part of the process of arbitration, it is the responsibility of arbitrators to exercise independent and impartial judgment on the issues before them. Certainly, they should consider the reasoning and conclusions that led to the result in another arbitration award, but it is the selected arbitrator whom the parties have commissioned to bring an "informed judgment to bear in order to reach a fair solution of [the] problem." <span class="Italic">Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel and Car Corp</span>., 363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960). Thus, it is the duty of the selected arbitrator to resolve the matter consistent with how he or she views the equities in the case which is to be decided. In addition, the informality of arbitration, which is one of its greatest advantages, would be lost if an arbitrator is bound by precedent.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Relying on Frank Elkouri and Edna Elkouri, <span class="Italic">How Arbitration Works,</span> 422 n.35 (4th ed. 1985) (Elkouri and Elkouri), the Agency argues that the "issuance of an arbitration award generally bars any subsequent court or arbitration action on the merits of the same event." In this regard, the Agency claims that it presented documentary evidence to the Arbitrator to support its argument that a settlement agreement rendered the grievance in the instant case nonarbitrable. The Agency argues that the settlement agreement was negotiated by the same parties in this case, and that it resolved an earlier grievance challenging management's decision to change SRIs' workweeks to include Sundays within the basic 40-hour workweek. The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator relied solely on the testimony of one Union witness to reject the Agency's argument and that the testimony was inconsistent with documentary evidence submitted by the Agency concerning the earlier grievance. According to the Agency, the "interpretation and application of Article 29.A(2) regarding the scope of management's contractual commitment to schedule workweeks so as to exclude Sundays was as pertinent regarding the resolution of the [earlier] grievance as it was...to the resolution of the grievance leading to the instant award." The Agency contends that, as the award is based on a violation of Article 29A (2), it is deficient because: (1) the Arbitrator has revisited and reopened an issue that had been raised and settled by the parties in the prior grievance; and (2) the award does not draw its essence from the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's reliance on Elkouri and Elkouri is misplaced. Although it is stated therein that arbitrators may refuse to permit relitigation of the merits of the same incident which was the subject of a prior award, nothing in the cited section of Elkouri and Elkouri stands for the proposition that arbitrators are bound to follow prior awards. <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1273</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center</span>, <span class="Italic">Boise, Idaho</span>, 44 FLRA 707, 712-13 (1992). Moreover, in this case there is no prior award, just a settlement agreement. In addition, the Arbitrator's determination that the grievance was not barred by the previous settlement agreement immediately followed his quotation of the Union's assertion that the settlement agreement concerned a different issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's contention, the documents it submitted in support of its exception do not establish that the settlement agreement resolving the prior grievance over the change in SRI workweeks renders the grievance in this case nonarbitrable. Specifically, the documents submitted establish that the prior grievance concerned, among other things, the Agency's noncompliance with a different article of the parties' agreement than the one involved in this case when the Agency failed to notify the Union of the Agency's decision to change work schedules to include Sundays within the 40-hour basic workweek. The settlement provided, among other things, that the Agency would compensate SRIs an additional 10 percent of regular pay for Sundays they worked in 1993. The additional 10 percent of pay was intended as a full settlement of any premium pay SRIs otherwise would have earned for performing noninspection work on Sundays had the Agency not changed work schedules to include Sunday within the 40-hour basic workweek. In contrast, the grievance in this case concerns the payment of 8 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1353a overtime for the performance of inspection work on the Sunday in question.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">A review of the Arbitrator's award reveals that the dispute before the Arbitrator concerned the time frame for implementation of the reorganization.

By contrast, the dispute before the Judge concerned the extent to which additional bargaining obligations remained after the reorganization was initiated. Further, while the Arbitrator declined to consider Provision 31 on timeliness grounds, the Judge found the interpretation of that provision was "pivotal" to deciding the statutory issue before him. As such, the "same issue" was not litigated before both the Arbitrator and the Judge.

<p class="noindent-1">Authority decisions do not explicitly set forth what standard of review should be applied to an arbitrator's determination that an earlier award has binding effect. We now conclude that, in cases such as the one before us, we will accord such a determination the same deference we accord an arbitrator's decision regarding the procedural arbitrability of a grievance under the parties' collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2921 and U.S. Department of the Army, Army &#x0026; Air Force Exchange Service, Dallas, Texas</span>, 50 FLRA 184, 185 (1995) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2921</span>) (an arbitrator's determination of the procedural arbitrability of a grievance is not subject to challenge). <span class="Italic">See also John Wiley &#x0026; Sons v.

<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator's determination that an earlier award has binding effect is akin to an arbitrator's determination of procedural arbitrability under the parties' collective bargaining agreement because both dispose of a grievance, in whole or in part, procedurally and not on the merits. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Tinker</span>, 41 FLRA at 305 (arbitrator found a grievance not arbitrable based on a prior award involving the same parties and resolving the same issue) <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1594 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 51 FLRA 518 (1995) (arbitrator found a grievance not arbitrable based on a party's failure to comply with the procedural requirements of the negotiated grievance procedure).

<p class="noindent-1">Because arbitration awards generally do not bind future arbitrators, an arbitrator who determines whether a prior award has preclusive effect is not obligated to do so in the same manner that a court or the Authority would decide a similar issue.[5] Rather, the arbitrator is making determinations that constitute factual findings and reasoning to which the Authority normally accords deference. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Honolulu District Office, Honolulu, Hawaii</span>, 41 FLRA 207, 211-12 (1991) (<span class="Italic">INS</span>) (arbitrator's misapplication of the harmful-error rule when he was not required to apply that rule constituted, among other things, the arbitrator's reasoning and did not provide a basis for finding the award deficient). The Authority accords deference to an arbitrator's factual findings because the parties have bargained for the facts to be found by an arbitrator chosen by them. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, Colorado and</span> <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1497</span>, 48 FLRA 589, 593 (1993), <span class="Italic">quoting United Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc.</span>, 484 U.S. 29, 45 (1987) ("[t]he parties did not bargain for the facts to be found by a court, but by an arbitrator chosen by them who had more opportunity to observe" the grievant and the witnesses and who was familiar with the case). In addition, the Authority accords deference to an arbitrator's reasoning to encourage arbitrators to provide adequate support for their decisions. <span class="Italic">See INS</span>, 41 FLRA at 212-13, <span class="Italic">quoting Steelworkers v.

<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We note that <span class="Italic">Scott Air Force Base</span> applies only to determinations as to whether the Authority must give preclusive effect to previous Authority decisions. If an arbitrator bases an award on principles of issue preclusion under a mistaken belief that <span class="Italic">Scott Air Force Base</span> applies to arbitration awards, that would not be grounds for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 916</span>, 47 FLRA 776, 779 (1993) (Authority found no basis for finding deficient an arbitrator's determination to apply the substantive standards for determining just cause that are applied by the MSPB, even though he was under the mistaken belief that he was required to do so); <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 41 FLRA at 211-12 (Authority found no basis for finding deficient an arbitrator's determination to apply the harmful-error rule, even though he was not required to do so).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's contention that the Arbitrator misapplied the requirements for issue preclusion set forth in <span class="Italic">Scott Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force Base</span> directly challenges the Arbitrator's findings and reasons for concluding that the grievance was not arbitrable. Accordingly, based on the foregoing, it provides no basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2921</span>, 50 FLRA at 186.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Union's argument that the first arbitrator's finding denying backpay could not have preclusive effect because it was not part of his award. Although that finding was not contained in the section of the Arbitrator's decision entitled "award," it was a finding that was necessary for the arbitrator to decide the issue before him of whether a remedy was appropriate. In contrast, the comments found to be separate from the award in <span class="Italic">Warner Robins</span> were not necessary to the disposition of the grievance in that case.</p>

<p class="noindent">If an arbitrator adopts another arbitrator's award, and if the first award is not the subject of exceptions, the first award is not collaterally challengeable through exceptions to the subsequent award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DODEAA, Arlington and FEA</span>, 56 FLRA 996, 999-1000 (2000). Although one arbitrator need not be bound by another's prior award, if an award is reviewed by FLRA on exceptions, a later award by the same arbitrator in remand proceedings will not be revisited by <span id="page_2414"></span>FLRA on exceptions if the basis for the exceptions was raised in the earlier exceptions to the earlier award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 4052 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, MDC, Guaynabo</span>, 68 FLRA 38, 41 (2014) (Member Pizzella dissenting) ("In this regard, collateral estoppel (also known as 'issue preclusion') 'prevents a second litigation of the same issues of fact or law even in connection with a different claim or cause of action.'

<p class="noindent">An FLRA decision in a ULP case involving the right of a bargaining unit employee to complain about the conduct of the union did not collaterally estop an arbitrator from assessing whether the unit employee acted inappropriately toward a union official, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2258 v.

<p class="noindent-1">Collateral estoppel (also known as "issue preclusion") prevents a second litigation of the same issues of fact or law even in connection with a different claim or cause of action.[15] The doctrine applies to bar subsequent litigation when: (1) the same issue was involved in an earlier proceeding; (2) the issue was actually litigated in that proceeding; (3) the resolution of the issue was necessary to the decision in the first case; (4) the decision in the first case--on the issue to be precluded--was final; and (5) the party attempting to re-raise the issue was fully represented in the first case.[16]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In the ULP decision, the central issue was whether <span class="Italic">the Union</span> violated &#x00A7; 7116(b) of the Statute when it sought to have the Agency discipline the BUE for protected activity--criticism of the Union officer's effectiveness.[19] Here, in contrast, the central issue is whether <span class="Italic">the BUE</span> herself violated Article 3, Section 2A of the parties' agreement by engaging in discourteous behavior towards her coworkers. The Authority has previously treated two concurrent issues--discrimination against an employee for protected activity, and whether or not that employee committed misconduct while exercising that protected activity--as distinct questions that may be addressed separately.[20]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, because the issue before the Authority in this case was not fully litigated in the ULP decision, and because the resolution of the issues in the ULP decision was not necessary to the decision in this case, the elements of the doctrine of collateral estoppel are not satisfied.[21] We therefore deny the Agency's argument that the Union's exceptions are barred and that the Authority is estopped from issuing a decision on this matter.</p>
