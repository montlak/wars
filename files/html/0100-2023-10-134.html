<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-135"><span class="space">d.</span> Stays of Representation Proceedings</h5>
<p class="noindent">An election is not automatically stayed pending FLRA's decision on an application for review of a regional director's determination concerning an election. <span class="Italic">DOD, Pentagon Force Protection Agency and AFGE</span>, 68 FLRA 761, 763 (2015) (citing 5 CFR 2422.31(f)). Under 5 CFR 2422.31(f) (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Authority grant of review and stay</span>. The Authority may rule on the issue(s) in an application for review in its order granting the application for review. Neither filing nor granting an application for review will stay any action ordered by the Regional Director unless specifically ordered by the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Aviation Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal and AFGE Local 1858</span>, 55 FLRA 640, 643-45 (1999), considered the use of a stay to prevent an election during adjudication of a disputed regional ruling bearing on the necessity of an election following a reorganization. FLRA decided (over Member Wasserman's dissent) that it had the administrative discretion to stay the election, but that it would permit the election to proceed and impound the ballots pending the its determination of the propriety of the regional determination that an election was necessary:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note at the outset that a stay of an election order is unusual. Moreover an application for review does not automatically stay an election, and the moving party has a burden to establish the propriety of such an action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's Regulations are silent regarding standards for evaluating requests for stays of regional directors' decisions, and the Authority has not previously addressed the subject. For this and future cases, we will be guided by the standards used by appellate courts to evaluate requests to stay district court orders.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standards as set out in the D.C. Circuit's Rule 8(a)(1) are as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The likelihood that the moving party will prevail on the merits;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The prospect of irreparable injury to the moving party if relief is withheld;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;The possibility of harm to other parties if relief is granted; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_115"></span>4.&#x2003;The public interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that the moving party must satisfy all four requirements to justify a stay.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See General Carbon Company, A Division of St. Mary's Carbon Company v. Occupational Safety &#x0026; Health Commission</span>, 854 F.2d 1329 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (motion for stay fails because moving party failed to address two of the four factors); <span class="Italic">Wisconsin Gas. Co. v. F.E.R.C., </span>758 F.2d 669 (D.C. Cir. 1985) <span class="Italic">(Washington Gas) </span>(court rejects motion for stay on the ground that irreparable harm was not established, and did not evaluate the remaining three factors).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons set forth below, we deny the stay, conditioned upon the impoundment of the ballots if an election occurs prior to issuance of our final adjudication of this matter. This approach "will ensure that the vote reflects the wishes of the bargaining unit at a time sufficiently proximate to the filing of the petition to preserve the rights of the employees under section 7102[.]," <span class="Italic">Division of Military and Naval Affairs (New York</span> <span class="Italic">National Guard), Latham, New York, </span>53 FLRA 111, 123-24 n.14 (1997). In addition, as discussed below, impounding the ballots will ensure that neither AFGE nor NFFE will suffer irreparable harm as a result of our action on the stay request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Irreparable Injury</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of its request to stay the election, AFGE asserts that it would suffer irreparable injury because it would lose "thousands of dollars in lost dues" if the election goes forward (and presumably AFGE loses the election). It also argues that "employees will lose AFGE-only benefits such as dental insurance<span class="Italic">." Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, if NFFE won an election that was set aside, AFGE contends that it would be at a disadvantage "since its bargaining unit will have been absorbed by NFFE's bargaining unit. In effect, NFFE will have had access to our bargaining unit as the incumbent union." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the foregoing demonstrates, all the irreparable harm alleged by AFGE assumes that: (1) the election would be conducted; (2) NFFE would win the election; and (3) NFFE would be effectively certified as the new exclusive representative before review of an application for review of the election were completed; and (4) the Authority ultimately would reverse the election. These assumptions appear both speculative and unwarranted. Section 2422.32 of the Authority's Regulations, provides that if an application for review is filed of a Regional Director's decision requiring a certification, then the RD's action is not effective unless it becomes the action of the Authority. In addition, section 2422.34 provides that during the pendency of any representation proceeding, parties are obligated to adhere to the terms of existing contract. Moreover, apart from these regulations, the alleged irreparable harm is completely eliminated if the ballots are impounded. Simply put, the irreparable harm alleged by AFGE does not exist, and we do not understand our dissenting colleague's conclusion to the contrary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Possibility of Harm to Other Parties If Relief Is Granted</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">NFFE argues that its members "should have the opportunity to vote for the union of their choice without delay." While it may be that the smaller of the two unions would be put at a disadvantage if the election were delayed, NFFE has not offered any arguments pertaining to this factor. In any event, holding the election and impounding the ballots safeguards both unions' interests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Public Interest</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">AFGE makes no arguments with respect to the impact of holding the election on the public interest. Among other things, the record is devoid of information concerning the costs associated with the running of an election in a 6,000 person unit. It is certainly possible--and perhaps, likely--that they will not be insignificant. However, other public interests, including allowing employees to vote for the representative of their choice, without undue delay or the possible influence of extraneous factors caused by the passage of time, cannot be ignored. In any event, we are not aware of any situations in which a stay was granted based on the public interest factor alone....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Likelihood of Success on the Merits</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the petitioner to prevail, the Authority would need to create a new doctrine on which to rule that in cases where a new organization is created, and accretion is not recognized because preexisting units are no longer appropriate, an election is unnecessary under certain circumstances. In addition to adopting this new doctrine, the parameters of such a doctrine would need to be developed and the Petitioner would have to meet the new standard as defined. These are considerable hurdles.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is not a situation where a well-developed private sector doctrine exists, and we are considering only whether it is appropriate to import that doctrine, in whole or in part, to the federal sector. Indeed, differences between the statutory provisions applicable in the private and federal sectors may preclude its adoption here. Moreover, even if we adopted such doctrine, we would have to determine how such a change, if adopted, would apply to the facts of this case. Given the extent to which the doctrine which the Petitioner seeks to adopt would be written on what is largely a "blank page," there is no basis on which to conclude that Petitioner is <span class="Italic">likely </span>to prevail on the merits of its claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The questionable likelihood of success on the merits, added to the complete absence of irreparable harm, leads us to deny the request for a stay. <span class="Italic">See Washington</span> <span class="Italic">Gas. </span>If an election is conducted prior to the issuance of our decision in this matter, then the ballots shall be impounded.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRBU</span>, 62 FLRA 25, 25 (2007), noted as to the use of a stay during FLRA's processing of a representation case and a pending application for review of a regional director's determination of the appropriateness of a nationwide unit:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 5, 2007, the Authority granted the Agency's application for review on the ground that the application raised an issue for which there is an absence of precedent, pursuant to &#x00A7; 2422.31(c)(1) of the Authority's Regulations. The Authority also denied the Agency's request for a stay. Relying on <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army, United States Army Aviation Missile Command, (AMCOM) Redstone Arsenal, Ala.</span>, 55 FLRA 640 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Redstone</span>), the Authority explained that the certification ordered by the RD does not become effective until after the application for review is resolved, thus obviating the harm that the Agency alleged would occur absent a stay. The Authority also ordered that, if the RD conducted the election he had found necessary while the application was pending before the Authority, then the RD should impound the ballots until after the application is resolved. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Redstone,</span> 55 FLRA at 643-44.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAAE and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 61 FLRA 545, 546-48 (2006), outlined the criteria for a stay of representation proceedings when a union seeks judicial review:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its motion, NAAE states that it has appealed the Authority's denial of its application for review in <span class="Italic">Customs and Border Protection</span> insofar as it concerns the unit status of Agriculture Specialists under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15) to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (court). In light of that appeal, NAAE requests that the Authority grant a stay of the RD's order directing an election in the unit found to be appropriate in <span class="Italic">Customs and Border Protection</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The moving party has the burden of establishing that a stay of an election is appropriate.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Army, United States Army Aviation Missile Command (AMCOM), Redstone Arsenal, Ala.</span>, 55 FLRA 640, 643 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Redstone Arsenal</span>). In assessing the appropriateness of granting a stay, the Authority is "guided by the standards used by appellate courts to evaluate requests to stay district court orders." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, we apply the following standards, which are consistent with those applied by Federal appellate courts,[2] and under which a stay is granted if all the standards are satisfied:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The likelihood or probability that the moving party will prevail on the merits;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The prospect of irreparable injury to the moving party if relief is denied;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;The possibility of harm to other parties if relief is granted, balanced against the injury to the moving party if relief is denied;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;The public interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 644.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Landi v. Phelps</span>, 740 F.2d 710, 712 (9th Cir. 1984) (court looks to whether: (1) the moving party will suffer irreparable injury if injunctive relief is denied; (2) the moving party will probably prevail on the merits; (3) in balancing the equities, the non-moving party will be harmed more than the moving party is helped by granting the injunction; and (4) granting the injunction is in the public interest); <span class="Italic">Wisconsin Gas</span>, 758 F.2d at 673-74 ("The factors to be considered in determining whether a stay is warranted are: (1) the likelihood that the party seeking the stay will prevail on the merits of the appeal; (2) the likelihood that the moving party will be irreparably harmed absent a stay; (3) the prospect that others will be harmed if the court grants the stay; and (4) the public interest in granting the stay."). <span class="Italic">See also Redstone Arsenal</span>, 55 FLRA at 644-45, where we applied the criteria of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAAE's motion for a stay fails under the first requirement outlined above because NAAE has not demonstrated that success of its court appeal is likely or probable. Specifically, &#x00A7; 7123(a)(2) of the Statute precludes judicial review of appropriate unit determinations under &#x00A7; 7112. <span class="Italic">ACT, Inc. v. FLRA</span>, 283 F.3d 339, 341 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (<span class="Italic">ACT v. FLRA</span>) (holding the APA does not apply where statutes preclude judicial review and thus APA does not provide court jurisdiction to review Authority unit determination). NAAE specifically states that its appeal to the court concerns only the Authority's determination that Agriculture Specialists are not professional employees within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15) of the Statute. Under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(5) of the Statute, a bargaining unit shall not "be determined to be appropriate...if it includes...both professional <span id="page_116"></span>employees and other employees, unless a majority of the professional employees vote for inclusion in the unit[.]" In this regard, the Authority has held that the definition of "professional employee" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(15) "'is relevant primarily to the determination of appropriate bargaining units under [&#x00A7;] 7112.'" <span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local 25</span>, 13 FLRA 433, 438 (1983) (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 95-1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 41 (1978)). Consequently, the Authority's determination that Agriculture Specialists are not professional employees constitutes a determination as to their status for inclusion in the bargaining unit whose representation is at issue in the election that NAAE seeks to stay. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3529</span>, 57 FLRA 633, 636 (2001). Thus, under &#x00A7; 7123(a)(2), judicial review of the Authority's determination is not available.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to NAAE's contentions on the merits of the Authority's decision, its arguments with respect to the legal effect of a prior certification of exclusive representation are unsupported. NAAE cites no precedent, either from the public sector or the private sector that would substantiate its position. Its contentions as to the Authority's treatment of <span class="Italic">Army Safeguard</span> are similarly unsupported. It is a "well-settled principle that the Authority examines the facts and circumstances of each case individually in determining whether a unit meets the [&#x00A7;] 7112(a) criteria." <span class="Italic">SSA, Dist. Office, Valdosta, Ga.</span>, 52 FLRA 1084, 1089 (1997). Moreover, "[t]he Authority has held that decisions regarding unit determinations must reflect the conditions of employment that existed at the time of the hearing[.]" <span class="Italic">United States Air Force, 82nd Training Wing, Sheppard AFB, Wichita Falls, Tex.</span>, 61 FLRA 443, 445 (2006). NAAE has not demonstrated that the legal principles that the RD drew from <span class="Italic">Army Safeguard</span>, and on which the RD relied, are either erroneous or inapposite.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the possibility of irreparable harm to NAAE or the Agriculture Specialists, NAAE's claims concerning the decline in the quality of representation that would result from Agriculture Specialists being included in a non-professional unit represented by AFGE and NTEU are completely speculative. NAAE's contentions as to the effect of the loss of dues are similarly speculative. NAAE provides no evidence as to the amount of dues that would be lost, the amount of dues to be received from, or the costs to be expected from representing, the employees that remain in its unit. NAAE's contentions as to the absence of harm to other parties, or non-parties, as a result of granting a stay, compared to the harm it would suffer if a stay is denied, are similarly unsupported and speculative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, as to the public interest involved, the Authority has noted that even though the costs of an election may not be "insignificant," "other public interests, including allowing employees to vote for the representative of their choice, without undue delay or the possible influence of extraneous factors caused by the passage of time, cannot be ignored." <span class="Italic">Redstone Arsenal</span>, 55 FLRA at 645. It has been nearly two years since CBP filed its representation petition seeking clarification of the appropriate unit for employees transferred to CBP. <span class="Italic">Customs and Border Protection</span>, 61 FLRA at 486. Consequently, as there is no likelihood or probability that NAAE will prevail on the merits of its appeal, the public interest would be better served by allowing employees expeditiously to choose their exclusive representative.</p>
