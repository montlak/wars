<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-4"><span class="space">1.</span> Appointment</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Preliminarily, unless there are allegations of violations of the WPA, USERRA, or VEOA [discussed in <a href="0100-2023-17-102.html#sec10-103">Chapter 1</a> and in <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a>], the failure to hire an individual is not a matter within the Board's appellate jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 620, 623 (1989). [Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-204.html#sec1-202">Position Change</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once an individual is hired, due process protections may be required to cancel an erroneous appointment. The form of those due process protections varies depending on the length of the individual's employment (probationary or nonprobationary), or type of appointment (excepted service or competitive service), or the agency taking or directing action against the employee (the employing agency or OPM). A critical first step is to determine whether the hiring violated a specific statutory prohibition and can be canceled without due process, <span class="Italic">Hope v. Dept. of Army</span>, 108 MSPR 6, 9 &#x00B6; 5, 2008 MSPB 13 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although the agency labeled its action a cancellation of appointment, if an individual is appointed to a position by an agency and enters onto duty under all the criteria of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a), he is an "employee" for the purposes of section 2105(a) with all the attendant procedural rights, unless the appointment was made in violation of an absolute statutory prohibition such that the appointee is not qualified for appointment in the civil service. <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Department of Commerce,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 23, &#x00B6; 9 (2007); <span class="Italic">Lovoy v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 571, &#x00B6; 29 (2003); <span class="Italic">Harrington v. Department of the Army,</span> 19 M.S.P.R. 571, 574-75 (1984); <span class="Italic">Travaglini v. Department of Education,</span> 18 M.S.P.R. 127, 137-38 (1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Devine v. Sutermeister</span>, 724 F.2d 1558, 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1983) ("OPM's contention that an appointment obtained through material misrepresentation is void or voidable borders on the whimsical. Nowhere in the CSRA can we find the statement or implication that a removal based upon an appointment obtained through material misrepresentation is to be treated differently from any other basis for an adverse action. The attenuated analogies offered by OPM provide scant basis for the conclusion that once the fact of material misrepresentation is proven, no review of the penalty imposed is possible."); <span class="Italic">Berryman v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 558, 562 &#x00B6; 11, 2010 MSPB 243 (2010) ("In any event, the agency has failed to establish that the appellant's appointment was illegal because, as the appellant asserts, it referenced only its handbook to support its argument. An appointment is illegal only if it is made in violation of an absolute statutory prohibition and the appointee is not qualified for appointment in the civil service.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The jurisdictional analysis governing appeals challenging the cancelation of an appointment was summarized, <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Dept. of Army,</span> SF-3443-13-4809-I-1 (NP 4/11/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish the Board's jurisdiction over cancellation of an appointment, the appellant must show that: (1) the authorized appointing official was aware that he or she was making an appointment; (2) the appellant took some action denoting acceptance; and (3) the appointment was not revoked before the appellant actually performed in the position. <span class="Italic">Sapla v. Department of the Navy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 551, &#x00B6; 9 (2012). Otherwise, the Board generally lacks jurisdiction to consider an applicant's non-selection for a vacant position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8. As the administrative judge properly found, the record contained no evidence that an authorized appointing official was aware that he or she was making an appointment. Moreover, the appellant has neither alleged nor presented any evidence that he actually performed the position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weiser v. Dept. of Labor</span>, DC-0752-14-0240-I-1 (NP 8/25/2015), explained that an appeal right from the cancelation of an appointment depends on whether the Board has jurisdiction over the employee under 5 USC 7511 (even then appeal rights may be negated if the appointment is in violation of an absolute statutory prohibition):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has caselaw more directly on point that was applicable in the appellant's case, namely <span class="Italic">Travaglini v. Department of Education</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 127, 137-38 (1983), which established the rule that an employee who is removed from his position because his appointment was determined to be illegal still has chapter 75 rights, including the right to appeal to the Board <span class="Italic">if</span> he otherwise has appeal rights unless "the appointment is made in violation of an absolute statutory prohibition so that the appointee is not qualified for appointment in the civil service; or...the appointee has committed fraud in regard to the appointment or has misrepresented or concealed a matter material to the appointment." Another way of phrasing this test is:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An appellant against whom an agency takes an action based on an allegedly unlawful appointment is not deprived of the procedural rights to which he would otherwise be entitled unless the appointment violates an absolute statutory prohibition so that the appointee is not qualified for appointment in the civil service.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether an appointment was actually illegal and rightfully terminated is not a matter of jurisdiction, as the administrative judge found.

<p class="Body-Text">Issues involving appointments can become complicated. The discussion that follows explores some complexities of the appointment process affecting Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Travaglini v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 18 MSPR 127, 137-38 (1983), <span class="Italic">modified</span>, 23 MSPR 417 (1984), <span class="Italic">post</span>, considered the appeal of an individual who was not required to <span id="Page_1871"></span>serve a probationary period because of prior service in the legislative branch, and who then appealed from a demotion caused by an agency determination that her appointment was unlawful. The agency opposed the appeal, contending that because it was correcting an appointment error, the case was not disciplinary and was not within the jurisdiction of the Board. After extensive statutory analysis concerning void and voidable appointments, under the 1983 decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board holds that where an individual shows that he or she has been appointed to a position by an agency and entered onto duty[13] under all the criteria of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) upon his or her certification as eligible for appointment by 0PM, and where the appointment is subsequently found to have been improper or erroneous under law, rule or regulation, the appointee is an "employee" for the purpose of &#x00A7; 2105(a) unless:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;the appointment is made in violation of an absolute statutory prohibition so that the appointee is not qualified for appointment in the civil service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;the appointee has committed fraud in regard to the appointment o: has misrepresented or concealed a matter material to the appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13] Where an appointee has entered onto duty, he or she attains the status of an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) and the appointment may not be revoked. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan</span>, 663 F.2d 239, 248 (D.C. Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of the Navy</span>, 7 MSPB 741, 745 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the modification, <span class="Italic">Travaglini v. Dept. of Educ</span>., 23 MSPR 417, 419-20 (1984), the Board recognized some intervening law from the Federal Circuit that precluded an agency from voiding an appointment based on material misrepresentation or fraud:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequent to the Board's decision, the Federal Circuit decided <span class="Italic">Devine v. Sutermeister,</span> 724 F.2d 1558 (1983). In that case, the Court rejected OPM's arguments that an appointment obtained through material misrepresentation is void or voidable and held that an adverse action based on such an appointment cannot be taken against an employee covered by &#x00A7; 7513 without providing him the adverse action procedures contained in that section. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1564. In accordance with the Federal Circuit's decision in Sutermeister, the Board hereby MODIFIES its decision in this case. The Board holds that an agency must use &#x00A7; 7513 procedures to take adverse action against an individual on the basis of material misrepresentation in his appointment as long as that individual is otherwise covered by &#x00A7; 7513.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Torres v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 47 MSPR 421, 422 (1991), interpreted <span class="Italic">Travaglini</span> to mean:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]n individual who shows that he is otherwise entitled to adverse action procedures does not lose that protection merely because the agency's action was based on an unlawful appointment. The only clear exception to this rule is an appointment that violates an absolute statutory prohibition so that the appointee is not qualified for appointment in the civil service....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Travaglini</span> was the subject of Federal Circuit commentary, distinguishing appointments that are irregular from those that are statutorily barred, in <span class="Italic">Avalos v. DHUD</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200626188">963 F.3d 1360</a>, 1365-68 (Fed. Cir. 2020):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government contends that Mr. Avalos's appointment was barred by law, and therefore that Mr. Avalos has no right to appeal his removal to the Board. In the government's view, "because HUD could not certify that [Mr. Avalos's appointment] was not free from political influence or in accordance with statutory merit system principles," OPM "did not and never could have approved Mr. Avalos's appointment." Under the government's first theory, OPM's failure to approve the appointment renders his appointment invalid under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105, and without a valid appointment, Mr. Avalos has no appeal rights. This theory could be interchangeably described as Mr. Avalos having nothing to appeal because he cannot be removed from a position he never rightfully had.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, persuaded by opinions from the Attorney General and Government Accountability Office, resolved these arguments in <span class="Italic">Travaglini v. Department of Education</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 127, 137-38 (1983), holding that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">where an individual shows that he or she has been appointed to a position by an agency and entered onto duty under all the criteria of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) upon his or her certification as eligible for appointment by OPM, and where the appointment is subsequently found to have been improper or erroneous under law, rule or regulation, the appointee is an "employee" for the purpose of &#x00A7; 2105(a) unless--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;the appointment is made in violation of an absolute statutory prohibition so that the appointee is not qualified for appointment in the civil service, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;the appointee has committed fraud in regard to the appointment or has misrepresented or concealed a matter material to the appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. The government adopts <span class="Italic">Travaglini's</span> rule in the alternative to its broader argument that <span class="Italic">Travaglini</span> itself rejected, arguing that OPM's failure to approve Mr. Avalos's appointment acts as "an absolute prohibition" on Mr. Avalos's appointment that would divest Mr. Avalos of his appeal rights under <span class="Italic">Travaglini</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have "occasionally noted but not endorsed" the Board's resolution of this issue. <span class="Italic">Elgin v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 641 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 2011) (examining Federal Circuit precedent regarding the Board's jurisdiction over the removal of illegally appointed employees in deciding whether the Board had exclusive jurisdiction over plaintiff's claims), <span class="Italic">aff'd on other grounds,</span> 567 U.S. 1 (2012); <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 10 n.3 (summarizing our limited discussion of the Board's "absolute statutory prohibition" doctrine). We need not adopt or reject the Board's jurisprudence in this case--it is enough to say that, assuming the Board's rule is correct, such an "absolute statutory prohibition" does not exist here. An absolute prohibition exists when an appointee could <span class="Italic">never</span> be eligible for a position in the civil service, not for decisions made on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hope v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 6, 9 (2008) ("[Q]ualification requirements may prohibit an appointment under a certain set of circumstances (i.e., the lack of a particular qualification), but they necessarily cannot act as an absolute bar to the appellant's appointment in the civil service in all circumstances."); <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 23, 30 (2007) ("There is no evidence in the record to support a finding that Martin was not qualified for appointment in the civil service or that, in the absence of nepotism, she was not qualified for appointment to the particular position to which the agency appointed her.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Avalos's status as a former political appointee cannot fairly be considered an absolute statutory bar to his selection. We can only speculate about whether Mr. Avalos would have been appointed as HUD's Albuquerque Field Office Director had HUD strictly followed the correct competitive hiring practices. But the government does not dispute that Mr. Avalos would have been eligible for the position under proper hiring practices. <span class="Italic">See</span> Resp. Br. 29 (arguing merely that Mr. Avalos was subject to an absolute statutory prohibition because OPM could not certify that his appointment was free from political influence). The government correctly notes that Mr. Avalos's appointment violated several statutory prohibitions, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 24-25, but these prohibitions on Mr. Avalos's selection because of improper selection practices do not rise to the level of an "absolute statutory prohibition" barring his appointment. OPM did not refuse to approve Mr. Avalos's appointment because he was categorically ineligible to be HUD's Albuquerque Field Office Director. It refused to approve his appointment because HUD could not certify that his selection was free from political influence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject the government's broader argument--that Mr. Avalos cannot appeal because his appointment was invalid, and he is thus not an employee for the purposes of appealing his separation from his HUD position. "Section 7511 defines what 'employee' means for [appeals under &#x00A7; 7513(d)]....[because its] definition modifies, for adverse actions, the general definition of a federal civil-service 'employee' set out in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105." <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 741 F.3d 81, 83 (Fed. Cir. 2014). <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii) ("For the purpose of this subchapter[,] 'employee' means an individual in the competitive service...who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less...." (subsection notations omitted)); &#x00A7; 2105(a)(1) ("For the purpose of this title, 'employee,' except as otherwise provided by this section or when specifically modified, means an officer and an individual who is appointed in the civil service by [,among others, 'an individual who is an employee under this section,'] acting in an official capacity...." (subsection notations omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7511 does not implicitly abrogate the requirements of &#x00A7; 2105. We do not today hold that an employee who plainly does not hold a federal position, or who was appointed by someone without even the color of authority to appoint an employee has Board appeal rights. But in light of the considerations underlying &#x00A7; 7511, when defining "employee" for &#x00A7; 7511 we must relax the severity of our construction of "appointed" under &#x00A7; 2105. We have "strictly applied" the test for federal employment under &#x00A7; 2105, <span class="Italic">Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687, 691 (Fed. Cir. 1986), in light of concerns that to do otherwise "could easily bring about chaos in government personnel management." <span class="Italic">Goutos v. United States</span>, 552 F.2d 922, 925 (Ct. Cl. 1976). However, these requirements have been applied in cases where our finding an appointment would confer substantive benefits, not the mere procedural rights at issue here. <span class="Italic">E.g., Bevans v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 900 F.2d 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (determining whether an employee of a proprietary corporation of the CIA met the definition of &#x00A7; 2105 to establish entitlement to survivorship benefits); <span class="Italic">Baker v. United States</span>, 614 F.2d 263 (Ct. Cl. 1980) (deciding whether an employee of a state agency participating in a federal-state cooperative program funded by the Department of Labor met &#x00A7; 2105 to be entitled to creditable service for a retirement annuity).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have more generously defined the scope of appointment for appeal rights where our refusal to void an appointment would confer only <span id="Page_1872"></span>the ability to contest the petitioner's entitlement to an appointment before the Board, rather than conferring that entitlement. In <span class="Italic">Devine v. Sutermeister</span>, 724 F.2d 1558, 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1983), we refused to hold that "an appointment obtained through material misrepresentation is void or voidable," describing this argument as "border[ing] on the whimsical" because "[n]owhere in the [Civil Service Reform Act] can we find the statement or implication that a removal based upon an appointment obtained through material misrepresentation is to be treated differently from any other basis for an adverse action." Distinguishing the substantive from the procedural, we explained that "[i]t involves a quantum leap of logic to start with the premise that misrepresentation may properly form the basis for removal, a position that no one disputes, and then conclude that review of the penalty imposed is therefore barred." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1564.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If a petitioner's deliberate nondisclosure of criminal convictions does not render his appointment to a sensitive position voidable and prevent review of the petitioner's removal, <span class="Italic">Sutermeister</span>, 724 F.2d at 1561, it would be unreasonable to hold that an agency's blunders during the selection process--prior to the appointment, and through no fault of the appointee--would do so. Holding that Mr. Avalos has no appeal rights would put someone who was indisputably acting as a member of the competitive service for nearly a year in the same position as someone who had never stepped foot in a federal building. It would do so in a manner that begs the question, too--Mr. Avalos would lose his appeal rights based on the very facts that he disputes in the appeal, without any post-termination process to dispute those facts. We cannot agree that Congress intended the "removal" of "employees" to be construed in such a stilted manner when it passed the Civil Service Reform Act.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Our sister circuits agree that the Civil Service Reform Act does not so narrowly limit the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Elgin</span>, 641 F.3d at 11 (noting, in the course of finding that the Board had exclusive jurisdiction over a challenge to the constitutionality of plaintiff's removal, that "[t]he plaintiffs in this case were hired by the federal government, served (in some cases for many years) as its employees, exercised official authority, and were then terminated. The idea that Congress would implicitly exclude them from the category of former 'employees' entitled to seek redress under the [Civil Service Reform Act]...beggars belief."); <span class="Italic">Miller v. United States</span>, 717 F.2d 109, 113 (3d Cir. 1983) (reviewing a Board decision before the Federal Circuit took exclusive jurisdiction and finding that it "would not serve the putative purpose of section 7511 to deny [petitioner] review of the subsequent decision to revoke" his conversion from a temporary appointment to a permanent appointment for which he was not eligible).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Travaglini,</span> failure of the agency to follow the procedural requirements concerning adverse actions impairs the appellant's ability to defend the action and constitutes harmful error, warranting reversal of the action. The Board cautioned that its holding did not affect the authority of OPM to evaluate and certify as eligible for appointment an applicant for appointment or an appointee; to revoke the appointment of an erroneously certified appointee who has not entered onto duty or who holds a conditional appointment subject to OPM approval; or to investigate and order an agency to take "corrective action" of an improper appointment. It is immaterial that OPM conducts oversight of the hiring authority delegated to agencies. If through that oversight OPM directs the agency to cancel an appointment, the cancelation must occur, except for the limited circumstances described pursuant to adverse action procedures. If the employee is a probationer, the agency must follow preappointment procedures under 5 CFR 315.805 (2022) or suffer reversal for harmful error. <span class="Italic">Harrington v. Dept. of Army</span>, 19 MSPR 571, 576 (1984). If OPM does not intercede following its investigation, the agency may still take action against the employee following completion of probation, albeit its action is judged under the "efficiency of the service" standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dew v. Halaby</span>, 317 F.2d 582 (D.C. Cir. 1963); <span class="Italic">Padilla v. EEOC</span>, 18 MSPR 121, 124-26 (1983) (invalidating the removal of appellant from a position obtained through a register after the agency employer arguably erred in administering its selection process to dissuade a preference eligible from accepting the position; the appointment of appellant violated no absolute statutory prohibition and her termination was in violation of minimum due process protections provided to probationary employees).

<p class="Body-Text">The impact of <span class="Italic">Sutermeister</span> and <span class="Italic">Travaglini</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> was apparent for a Veterans Readjustment Act employee who understated his level of education to obtain a job that he otherwise would not have received. The individual eventually was placed into the competitive service. The misstatement of qualifications did not strip the Board of jurisdiction to hear his appeal when the misstatement occurred some years before the removal, the employee made some efforts to bring the misstatement to the attention of the agency, and the employee was by then converted to a competitive service appointment, <span class="Italic">Perry v. VA</span>, 32 MSPR 81, 83 n.2 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official found that "[t]he Board would not have jurisdiction in this case if appellant had been terminated while serving his initial VRA appointment," citing <span class="Italic">Sankov v. Department of the Navy,</span> 24 MSPR 510 (1984), <span class="Italic">and Garcia v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 18 MSPR 142 (1983). We note, however, that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held in <span class="Italic">Devine v. Sutermeister</span>, 724 F.2d 1558, 1564 (Fed. Cir. 1983), that a nonprobationary employee whose appointment under the VRA was obtained through material misrepresentation was entitled to the same procedural safeguards and review as any other employee subject to adverse action under Civil Service Reform Act, including review of appropriateness of the penalty. Subsequent to <span class="Italic">Sutermeister,</span> the Board held that an agency must use &#x00A7; 7513 procedures to take adverse action against an individual on the basis of material misrepresentation in his appointment as long as that individual is otherwise covered by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513. <span class="Italic">Travaglini v. Department of Education.</span>, 23 MSPR 417, 419-20 (1984). Thus, had appellant, a preference eligible, been terminated under his VRA appointment before completing one year of service, he would have been entitled to the limited appeal rights afforded probationers under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.804-.805<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 307.105(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Perry</span> continued, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 84-85:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that appellant may not be considered an individual in the competitive service under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) and thus is not entitled to appeal rights under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513. Although appellant was removed from a position in the competitive service, the agency and OPM argue, in effect, that he may not be considered an employee under &#x00A7; 7511 because his appointment to the competitive service was invalid, based as it was on his invalid VRA appointment.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The record does not indicate whether the agency considered correcting the appointment or if it contacted the Office of Personnel Management for direction on corrective action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 315 Federal Personnel Manual 1-5 (1981) ("An erroneous noncompetitive appointment may be corrected by the agency if the employee is eligible for appointment under some other authority. If he/she is not eligible for appointment under another authority, and no evidence of bad faith or fraud on the part of the employee is found, the case must be submitted to the normal servicing office of the Office of Personnel Management for direction on corrective action.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's initial appointment was made under the Veterans Readjustment Program, pursuant to 38 USC &#x00A7; 2014, which grants veterans of the Vietnam War era eligibility for excepted service appointments to positions otherwise in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR Part 307; <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Navy,</span> 4 MSPB 113, 4 MSPR 20 (1981). VRA appointments shall be converted to career or career-conditional appointments within 30 days after completion of two years of substantially continuous, satisfactory service. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.705(a)(2); Federal Personnel Manual Ch. 307 at A-7 (May 3, 1985). Consequently, appellant automatically received competitive service status as a function of his completion of two years of satisfactory service in a VRA appointment, without open competitive examination. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.705(c); Federal Personnel Manual Ch. 307 at A-7 (May 3, 1985). Furthermore, we note that after his original appointment to the competitive service, appellant was promoted to a GS-5 Program Clerk position in the competitive service. Accordingly, we find that appellant was an employee in the competitive service who was not serving a probationary or trial period and therefore that he is entitled to the appeal rights afforded by 5 USC Chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See Jakes v. Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Administration,</span> 793 F.2d 293, 295 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Devine v. Sutermeister,</span> 724 F.2d 1558, 1564 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In another appeal involving an appointment under the Veterans Readjustment Act, a statute permitting agencies to hire individuals with no more than 14 years of education (38 USC 2014(b)(1)(c) [now modified and recodified generally 38 USC 4214 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>]), the removal was reversed as procedurally defective when the agency incorrectly calculated the employee's education and, in so doing, discharged the employee without adverse action rights. <span class="Italic">Sankov v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 24 MSPR 510, 512-13 (1984). An earlier, pre-<span class="Italic">Travaglini</span>, decision determined that if VRA statutory appointment requirements are not met, the appointment is "void <span class="Italic">ab initio</span>" if made by an individual who, because of the lack of statutory appointment authority, is not "a federal employee acting in an official capacity, with lawful authority to so act" under 5 USC 2105(a)(1)(D). <span class="Italic">Green v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 11 MSPR 291, 294 (1982) (recognizing that the appellant was blameless, but continued retention of the position would violate statutory requirements and could constitute a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC 2302(b)(7) by granting the appellant a preference or advantage not authorized by law for the purpose of improving his prospects for employment); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jakes v. VA</span>, 793 F.2d 293 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (reversing the removal of an individual with too much education for a VRA appointment; the agency should have submitted the case to OPM for direction or corrective action if there was no evidence of bad faith or fraud on the part of the employee, citing FPM Ch. 315, &#x00A7; 1-5 (1981)); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Army</span>, 12 MSPR 587, 589 (1982) (VRA appointment was void because the appointee had in excess of 14 years of education; the Board lacked jurisdiction to consider an appeal from dismissal from the position "to which he was never officially appointed").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1874"></span><span class="Italic">Miller</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was reversed when an appellate court determined that the appellant was a preference eligible with a Board appeal right. Avoiding the "metaphysical question whether one who is appointed <span class="Italic">ultra vires</span> can attain the status of employee," <span class="Italic">Miller v. United States</span>, 717 F.2d 109 (3d Cir. 1983), concluded that Mr. Miller's right to appeal could not be divested by characterizing his appointment as void:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We simply cannot accept this argument. On November 9, 1980, Miller was working as an Army electrician, as he had been doing for two years; on November 10, 1980, the Army told him he no longer had a job. It is hard for us to imagine action against an individual that could be more "adverse." Moreover, section 7512 makes clear that the adverse action procedures apply to "removals" and whatever the reason, Miller certainly was removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Army's second objection is that it is inconsistent with the intent of section 7511(a) to allow it to supersede section 2105(a) and thereby to broaden the class of employees entitled to the protections of section 7513. "The evident purpose of 7511(a)," the Army contends, "is to narrow the general definition of employee at 2105(a) by withholding the right to appeal from those employees who have completed a probationary period in the same or similar positions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Army's observation that the one-year requirements of subsections 7511(a)(1)(A) and (B) were probably intended to insure that probationary employees do not acquire the full panoply of procedural protection possessed by permanent employees under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513. But the accuracy <span class="Italic">vel non</span> of this observation is not determinative; while the statute narrows the definition of employee contained in section 2105, it broadens it as well. For example, section 2105(e) declares: "Except as otherwise provided by law, an employee of the United States Postal Service or of the Postal Rate Commission is deemed not an employee for purposes of this title." 5 USC &#x00A7; 2105(e) (1976). Section 7511(a)(1)(B), however, includes some postal workers in its definition of employee, and thus confers on them protection they would otherwise be denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More importantly, assuming that the intent of Congress in enacting section 7511 was to enable the government to discharge probationary employees without elaborate procedural safeguards, Miller effectively was not such an employee. The government converted Miller's second temporary appointment into a permanent one--and not even at his behest. It therefore would not serve the putative purpose of section 7511 to deny Miller review of the subsequent decision to revoke that conversion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand, Mr. Miller's removal was reversed because it lacked the procedural safeguards required by 5 USC 7513. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Army</span>, 20 MSPR 18, 19-20 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assume the difficulty is not with the certification of the appointee or the validity of the initial appointment, but instead involves the cancelation of a job offer otherwise valid after the individual appears to have entered on duty. If the validity or duration of an appointment is in question, it is the appellant's burden to show that the requisite approval of the appointment was made or that the person who approved the form documenting the appointment took the last act required by a person with approval authority to effect the appointment. <span class="Italic">Deans v. Dept. of Labor</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 83-1279); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Vandewall v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 55 MSPR 561, 563-64 (1992) (noting that in a termination case the Board will look to actions taken with knowledge of the official with termination authority; the identity of the individual signing the paperwork is not determinative); <span class="Italic">Collazo v. Community Services Admin.</span>, 15 MSPR 188, 190 (1983) (individual who established a reporting date was empowered to cancel the reporting date for the appellant; since the appellant did not enter on duty with the agency, the appointment had not become effective and the appellant did not meet the statutory definition of "employee").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reviewed the problem of jurisdiction concerning cancelation of an appointment in <span class="Italic">McCarley v. MSPB</span>, 757 F.2d 278, 280-81 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The appellant was selected for a GS-3 position in Korea and reported for duty as directed on March 7. Before the reporting date, but after the selection, the agency learned of infractions of ration control and customs regulations. The agency then withdrew the selection, but it did not tell the appellant of the agency action until the date he reported for work. When he was told that he would not be permitted to assume any duties, the appellant left the agency. On appeal from the Board's declination of jurisdiction, McCarley asserted that he entered on duty and that he at least had the procedural rights of a probationary employee. The Board lacked jurisdiction because McCarley failed to establish that he engaged in a federal function and he failed to establish that he was supervised by a federal employee while performing his duties under 5 USC 2105:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is a clear difference between being an appointee and an employee, and the lines are drawn by section 2105. One may be an appointee and never achieve the status of employee. There are three elements to the statute and all must be complied with to achieve the status of an employee....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is interesting that McCarley does not dispute that he was required to satisfy all three criteria of the statute. He argues that under the common law he is an employee and that the statute merely adds the requirement of appointment by an authorized federal official. This is not a viable argument. Under common law the determination of a master-servant relationship is based solely upon the degree of control exercised over the individual. But common law does not govern federal employee relationships. The federal statute, 5 USC 2105, expressly rejects the common law test.... Back pay therefore cannot be awarded to an appointee who has not qualified as an employee by performing a federal function subject to the supervision of a federal employee. Such payment for work he did not perform, because the appointment was revoked before he did any supervised work, would be illegal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...In [<span class="Italic">Beacom v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 500 F. Supp. 428 (D. Ariz. 1980)], the petitioner, an attorney, was promised a government position and was told that a prospective hiring freeze would not affect his selection. On this assurance he gave up his practice of 16 years, but when he reported for duty two weeks later he was told that he had not been hired. Upon the narrow facts before it, the district court held that Beacom had received an appointment prior to issuance of the government job freeze and that the government was estopped from denying the appointment because of its affirmative misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case now appealed, the MSPB expressly found that McCarley failed to introduce any evidence of misconduct by government officials. In the absence of such evidence, it is presumed that the government officials acted in good faith.... It is further important to note that the <span class="Italic">Beacom</span> court did not find compliance with the requirements of 5 USC 2105(a), which issue is now before us.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCarley</span> was followed when an employee was selected for a job at a higher grade and at a different agency than he had worked with prior to the selection. The selection was canceled before the appellant reported for duty. "Similarly, petitioner Miller never became an employee of the SEC, the only agency accused of taking an adverse action." <span class="Italic">Miller v. MSPB</span>, 794 F.2d 660, 661 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Horner v. Acosta</span>, this court said that all three elements of 5 USC 2105(a) must be met for an individual to be a federal employee.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board reaffirmed the reasoning of <span class="Italic">McCarley</span> in <span class="Italic">Testart v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 42 MSPR 21, 23 (1989). The appellant alleged he was offered a position at the Oakland Naval Supply Center and that his current employer, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, furnished derogatory information that resulted in withdrawal of the employment offer. The Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A federal appointment occurs when the appointing authority has performed the last act to effect the appointment. <span class="Italic">Dardis v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 9 MSPR 411 (1982). The appointment may be revoked by an appointing official at any time before it becomes effective. <span class="Italic">Furneybough v. Dept. of Army</span>, 9 MSPR 132 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accepting the appellant's assertion as true, he was offered the GS-5 position but had not been appointed nor allowed to enter onto duty prior to the time the offer was revoked. The Board does not have jurisdiction over the withdrawal of an offer of employment prior to entrance on duty....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also correctly held that even if the appellant could establish that the employing agency improperly interfered with his employment opportunities, it would not confer appellate jurisdiction on the Board. <span class="Italic">Grigg v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 5 MSPR 439, 441 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Testart</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Diamond v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 448, 450 (1991), declining jurisdiction over the appellant's claim that his nonselection for appointment violated an unfiled settlement agreement resolving an appeal from an allegedly involuntary resignation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to an employee who entered on duty before receiving notice that her appointment was canceled, <span class="Italic">Scott v. DOJ</span>, 105 MSPR 482, 487-88 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8, 2007 MSPB 113 (2007), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, the appointing official, apparently the warden, signed an SF-52, which clearly shows that he knew that he was making a civil service appointment. The appellant served in the position for a considerable period of time, which clearly denotes her acceptance. We would be hard-pressed to reach any conclusion other than that the appellant was appointed to the position and the appointment was later cancelled. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Riley v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 505, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (1998) (remanding because the AJ failed to identify and apply precedent for cancelation of a promotion, and instead, applied <span id="Page_1875"></span>precedent for handling an administrative error made in setting a within-grade increase).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, as the AJ also noted, the appellant suffered no actual loss in pay or grade when she was moved back to her previous position. Any loss that she claims would be based on speculative future earnings, rather than an immediate loss of basic pay. The Board thus lacks jurisdiction over this appeal as an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Burrell v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 427, &#x00B6; 12 (1999) (reassignment from a position with known promotion potential to one without such expectancy does not constitute an appealable reduction in grade). Accordingly, to the extent that the appellant is challenging the AJ's finding regarding Chapter 75 jurisdiction, we deny the PFR and affirm the ID as modified.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The decisions just discussed assume administrative action that results in a failure to appoint or upon the cancelation of an appointment. If an individual secures an appointment or promotion as a result of an order of a federal district court, adverse action procedures need not be followed if that court's decision is vacated or reversed on appeal and the individual is then removed from the job through the district court order. The action taking the individual out of the job is essentially a judicial function, not subject to MSPB appeals processes. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Diamond v. AID</span>, 108 F.3d 312 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The cases also assume, or do not address, the service requirements necessary to appeal to the Board under 5 USC 7511 or to appeal to the Board under OPM regulations governing probationary or trial appointments.
