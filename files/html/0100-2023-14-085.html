<h5 class="h5" id="sec7-84"><span class="space">i.</span> Comparable Arbitration Awards; Other MSPB Decisions</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Proof of disparity may include, in addition to an examination of penalties imposed by the employer, a review of penalties sustained or imposed by the Board or by arbitrators who review appeals from adverse actions imposed by the agency-employer.<span class="Italic"> See Newman v. USPS</span>, 24 MSPR 463, 465 (1984) (issued following remand from <span class="Italic">Newman v. USPS</span>, 746 F.2d 1489 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (Board mitigated a removal to suspension based on a comparable arbitration award involving another employee); <span class="Italic">Schoemer v. Dept. of Army</span>, 81 MSPR 363, 367<span id="Page_2399"></span> &#x00B6; 10 (1999) ("[O]ne of the criteria the Board generally uses to evaluate the reasonableness of an agency-imposed penalty is its consistency with previous Board case law."); <span class="Italic">Seas v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 569, 573-74 (1998) (comparing another USPS Board decision to ascertain a penalty for falsification); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 484, 492 n.33 (1994) (considering other Board decisions involving falsification charges); <span class="Italic">Knight v. USPS</span>, 23 MSPR 679, 681 (1984) (considering an arbitration award resolving the discipline of an employee situated comparably to the appellant). Disparate treatment analysis may compare a penalty imposed by the agency on one employee and reversed in arbitration with the penalty imposed by the agency on another employee and reviewed by the Board for essentially the same misconduct--fighting. Evidence of the arbitration award favoring the one employee is relevant even if the award was issued after the Board case was submitted on a PFR. <span class="Italic">Mosley v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 86-815), <span class="Italic">on remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Mosley v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 24 (1986). <span class="Italic">Mosley</span>, on remand, sustained removal of one employee in an altercation between two employees even though the other employee involved in the altercation pursued his case to arbitration and avoided removal. On the basis of the arbitrator's decision, the disparity in penalties was justified because the appellant's conduct was more egregious than that of the other employee. <span class="Italic">But see Hankins v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-0752-13-0423-I-1 n.8 (NP 9/8/2014) ("As the appellant points out on review, the other employees' removals were mitigated during the grievance process. We find, however, that the outcome of proceedings in another forum has no bearing on whether the agency imposed disparate penalties."). [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-138.html#sec5-137">Disparate Treatment</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-12-125.html#sec5-124">Review of New Evidence</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without mention of <span class="Italic">Newman, Knight,</span> or <span class="Italic">Mosley,</span> but with reliance on <span class="Italic">Hankins,</span> in <span class="Italic">Holmes v. USPS</span>, 987 F.3d 1042, 1047-49 (Fed. Cir 2021) (Judge Newman dissenting), the court discounted a mitigation argument based on arbitrators' reversals and the Board's decision sustaining of dismissals of a group of postal workers who had engaged in purchases or marijuana while on duty. The outcomes of similar charges in arbitration was of little or no significance to the result reached by the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Holmes also asks this court to mitigate the agency's penalty and restore him to service because five other USPS employees who admitted to purchasing marijuana from Mr. Baxter were reinstated following grievance arbitration. Mr. Holmes's contention appears to be that the sixth <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor, which asks whether the penalty is consistent with the penalty "imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses," requires that he receive the same penalty as these other employees. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 MSPB at 332.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is required to determine "whether the agency has responsibly balanced the factors delineated in" <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. <span class="Italic">Guirguess v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 32 Fed. App'x 555, 559 (Fed. Cir. 2002). "The determination of which <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors apply in a particular case and the weight to be given the relevant factors lies primarily within the agency's broad discretion to determine the appropriate penalty for a particular case." <span class="Italic">Zingg v. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 388 F.3d 839, 844 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Holmes's outcome does appear facially different than the outcome of the five employees who pursued arbitration, but this difference is not relevant to the Board's determination. Mr. Holmes did not make a disparate treatment argument before the Board, despite the fact that all five arbitration decisions occurred before the April 2019 initial decision in this case. Because Mr. Holmes could have, but did not, raise this issue before the Board, he is precluded from raising it here. <span class="Italic">See Oshiver v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 896 F.2d 540, 542 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ("Our precedent clearly establishes the impropriety of seeking a reversal of the board's decision on the basis of assertions never presented to the presiding official or to the board." (quoting <span class="Italic">Rockwell v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 789 F.2d 908, 913 (Fed. Cir. 1986))).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the issue had been presented, the agency issued removals to all employees charged with purchasing marijuana from Mr. Baxter. At the time of the removal decision here, all the employees implicated in the OIG investigation were treated equally. That this penalty was later mitigated by arbitrators for five employees who pursued grievance arbitration does not reflect any disparate treatment by the agency itself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitration decisions were not binding on the Board. We have previously held that the Board is not required to defer to arbitration decisions in other cases. <span class="Italic">See Horner v. Schuck</span>, 843 F.2d 1368, 1377-78 (Fed. Cir. 1988) ("To require the board to defer to arbitration decisions involving other employees or other union contracts would nullify the individual right of each respondent to appeal to the board."); <span class="Italic">see also Hankins v. Dep't of Army</span>, DA-0752-13-0423-I-1, 2014 WL 5421566, at *1, *7 n.8 (2014) (denying a petition for review of an AJ's initial decision affirming removal despite the fact that "the other employees' removals were mitigated during the grievance process" because "the outcome of proceedings in another forum has no bearing on whether the agency imposed disparate penalties"). These decisions make clear that the Board's decision need not be consistent with arbitration decisions in other cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other contexts, too, a difference in outcome resulting from adjudication by separate tribunals does not warrant reversal. Indeed, it is a common feature of the criminal justice system that similarly situated persons before different fact finders may properly receive different outcomes. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Getsy v. Mitchell</span>, 495 F.3d 295, 307 (6th Cir. 2007) (discussing different convictions received by co-conspirators tried before separate juries and noting that "the common-law rule of consistency has no application to conflicting verdicts returned by different juries in <span class="Italic">separate trials</span>" (emphasis in original)); <span class="Italic">Cortis v. Kenney</span>, 995 F.2d 838, 840 (8th Cir. 1993) (noting that several circuits have recognized that the rule of consistency "applies only where all coconspirators are tried jointly and does not apply where coconspirators are tried separately"); <span class="Italic">see also In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litig</span>., 361 F.3d 439, 441 (7th Cir. 2004) (determining that separate juries could be used to try co-conspirators in a civil trial because while separate juries "may render different verdicts, which may be inconsistent," the inconsistency would be the permissible result of the juries hearing different evidence).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, even if the Board were required to consider the mitigated sentences of the other USPS employees, there was a rationale for treating Mr. Holmes differently. While the dissent contends that the evidence before the Board was identical to the evidence presented in the five arbitration proceedings, this is not the case. The other employees all admitted to purchasing marijuana from Mr. Baxter. As Ms. Bush determined, Mr. Holmes "failed to take responsibility for [his] actions during [his] interview with OIG" and characterized his conduct as a "little mistake." Thus, it would have been reasonable for the Board to uphold Mr. Holmes's removal as warranted by his unique failure to take responsibility for his actions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Camaj v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., NY-0752-11-0048-I-1, 2012 WL 11893816 (M.S.P.B. 2012) ("On petition for review, the appellant asserts that there were four other employees who were treated differently with respect to the penalty imposed. However, the deciding official consistently explained that the appellant was different from these employees, particularly because the appellant failed to recognize the magnitude of his actions." (citation omitted)), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 542 Fed. App'x 933 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Therefore, Ms. Bush properly evaluated the sixth <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor in determining that the agency itself treated consistently all employees charged with purchasing marijuana from Mr. Baxter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent characterizes our conclusion as "sustain[ing] the harsher penalty on the ground that Mr. Holmes exercised his constitutional right not to confess to commission of a crime." However, our determination that Mr. Holmes failed to take responsibility for his actions is not premised solely on his decision to exercise his Fifth Amendment Rights. Rather, as Ms. Bush explained, he also "denied certain facts that were proven false" and characterized his conduct as a "little mistake." This behavior alone sufficiently establishes Mr. Holmes's unwillingness to take responsibility for his actions. Further, while an employee is permitted to invoke his or her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, "an agency may still take into consideration and make an adverse inference from the failure of the employee to respond." <span class="Italic">Brewer v. Dep't of Def</span>., 249 Fed. App'x 174, 176 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">see also LaChance v. Erickson</span>, 522 U.S. 262, 267-68 (1998) (stating that an agency "may well...take into consideration" its employee's invocation of his or her Fifth Amendment right).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the dissent's assertions, the Board also properly considered the other <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. Specifically, the Board expressly evaluated whether Ms. Bush appropriately weighed the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. First, the Board concluded that Ms. Bush considered the nature and severity of the allegations against Mr. Holmes and determined that the conduct was particularly egregious because mail carriers are expected to work with minimal supervision. The Board further found that Ms. Bush considered the potential for rehabilitation but determined rehabilitation was unlikely given the severity of the conduct and in light of Mr. Holmes's characterization of his actions as a "little mistake." The Board also determined that Ms. Bush evaluated the mitigating factors, such as the duration of Mr. Holmes's employment with USPS, his lack of a disciplinary record, and his good job performance. However, the Board found that Ms. Bush "credibly testified that these factors could not outweigh the significant loss of trust placed in him as a letter carrier to follow USPS rules and regulations regarding performance of employees' duties in a drug-free environment."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Horner v. Schuck,</span> 843 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1988), cited in <span class="Italic">Holmes,</span> involved a jurisdictional issue relating to placement of employees in nonduty or limited duty status. The concern was that those employees taking their cases to the Board should not be deprived of independent review because of other outcomes reached in arbitration. <span class="Italic">Horner</span> had nothing to do with a disciplinary mitigation analysis based on comparable penalties. The dissenter in <span class="Italic">Holmes,</span> Judge Newman, framed the issue well:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Statute and precedent require consistency of the penalty imposed on employees for comparable offenses. However, the court today holds that Mr. Holmes has no right to consideration of the penalty that was imposed on his fellow marijuana-purchasers, who were restored to employment, while he remains fired--although all of the offenders committed the identical offense in identical circumstances and on identical evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2400"></span>The majority holds that Mr. Holmes has no recourse. That is incorrect, for this court is charged to assure that federal agencies conform to statute and implement legislative policy in their employment practices. In <span class="Italic">Wilburn v. Department of Transportation</span>, this court recognized that "the linchpin of federal personnel management is fairness, i.e., employees who are similarly situated are entitled to similar treatment." 757 F.2d 260, 262 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court is charged to assure that federal employment law is respected. The disparate treatment imposed on Mr. Holmes is contrary to law. From my colleagues' endorsement of this improper action, I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On occasion the Board searches among its published, final decisions involving comparable situations, but different agencies, to establish the reasonableness of a penalty. <span class="Italic">See O'Keefe v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 475, 479 &#x00B6; 9 (2001) (considering an "analogous case" involving a different agency), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">O'Keefe v. USPS</span>, 318 F.3d 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (requiring reanalysis of facts and charges); <span class="Italic">Cantu v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 88 MSPR 253, 258 &#x00B6; 9 (2001) (reviewing cases involving removal for the misuse of government vehicles); <span class="Italic">Hylick v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 85 MSPR 145, 156 &#x00B6; 24 (2000) (investigative misrepresentation); <span class="Italic">Blake v. DOJ</span>, 81 MSPR 394, 419 &#x00B6; 48 (1999) (poor managerial judgment); <span class="Italic">Chatman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 73 MSPR 582, 589 (1997) (threats); <span class="Italic">Devall v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 500, 504 (1997) (comparison of decisions imposing penalties for sexual harassment). The Board may also consider cases involving comparable charges on appeal from the same agency. <span class="Italic">See Byers v. VA</span>, 89 MSPR 655, 666 &#x00B6; 26 (2001) (patient abuse). In OSC disciplinary cases, the Board may compare conduct and penalties in cases involving employees of different agencies but arguably comparable misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Ferro</span>, 90 MSPR 575, 580-81 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (2002). In an unusual result, considering the Board's oft-proclaimed insistence that its initial decisions lack precedential value, <span class="Italic">Holt v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 198, 202-03 (1994), determined that initial decisions may be employed to demonstrate comparable (or, presumably, disparate) penalties within the same agency. Assuming they have become final, the initial decisions are, according to the Board, reliable statements of the facts of a particular case.</p>
