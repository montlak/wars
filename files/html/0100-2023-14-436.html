<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-437"><span class="space">2.</span> Pay and Pay Practices</h4>
<p class="noindent">What is involved in the labyrinth of case law that follows are the attempts of unions to negotiate "pay" and "pay practices." For purposes of analysis, the term "pay" encompasses the rate of basic pay for a position held by an employee covered by the provisions of &#x00A7; 704 of the Civil Service Reform Act. The term "pay practices" encompasses matters historically considered part of an employee's compensation package, including: (1) adjustments to an employee's basic rate of pay; (2) matters concerning the payment of differentials, overtime, and premiums; and (3) any other general compensation policies that were entered into and became a part of the employee's total compensation package. For those matters to be negotiable, proposals must: (1) concern a subject matter that was the subject of negotiations in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972; and (2) be in accordance with current prevailing rates and practices. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1487 and Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Reg'l Office, Yuma Project Office</span>, 44 FLRA 945, 946 (1992) (ruling nonnegotiable several proposals concerning a shift differential, retained pay, and Sunday pay) (relying upon <span class="Italic">USIA, Voice of Am. and NFFE Local 1418</span>, 37 FLRA 849, 859 (1990)). The record must reflect the conditions of negotiability. If there is nothing in the record establishing that a proposal is "in accordance with the current prevailing rates and practices," the proposal is nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-143 and Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Reg'l Office</span>, 47 FLRA 103, 105 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">Section 704 of the CSRA, codified at 5 USC 5343 note ("Negotiating Requirements for Labor Contracts, Etc."), provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Those terms and conditions of employment and other employment benefits with respect to Government prevailing rate employees to whom section 9(b) of Public Law 92-392 applies which were the subject of negotiation in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972, shall be negotiated on and after the date of the enactment of this Act (Oct. 13, 1978) in accordance with the provisions of section 9(b) of Public Law 92-392 without regard to any provision of chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code (as amended by this title), to the extent that any such provision is inconsistent with this paragraph.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;The pay and pay practices relating to employees referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be negotiated in accordance with prevailing rates and pay practices without regard to any provision of--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code (as amended by this title), to the extent that any such provision is inconsistent with this paragraph;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;subchapter IV of chapter 53 and subchapter V of chapter 55 of title 5, United States Code; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;any rule, regulation, decision, or order relating to rates of pay or pay practices under subchapter IV of chapter 53 or subchapter V of chapter 55 of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under Section 9(b) of the Prevailing Rate Systems Act, Pub. L. No. 92-392, codified at 5 USC 5343 note ("Labor Contracts Pertaining to Wages, Terms and Conditions of Employment, and Other Employment Benefits"):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The amendments made by this Act...shall not be construed to--</p>

Proposal 2-3b provides for compensation at twice the normal rate for all emergency and unscheduled overtime. Proposal 2-3c limits the application of the double time rate provision in Proposal 2-3b, by describing certain circumstances when overtime will be paid at the time-and-one half rate instead of the double time rate. Proposal 2-4b <span id="page_934"></span>provides that when an employee is called in to work for an overtime assignment, he or she will be paid from the time the employee leaves home up until the time the employee returns home after completing the assignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties, Lake Mead National Recreation Area and the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), Local 3062, have negotiated collective bargaining agreements since 1971. The parties have historically bargained pay and pay practices in accordance with section 9(b) of the Prevailing Rate Systems Act (PRSA), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5343 note, and section 704 of the CSRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to August 19, 1972, the parties entered into a Basic Agreement and numerous Supplemental Agreements. Through these agreements the parties established matters such as the relevant industry for pay rates, the basic workweek and hours of work, and various overtime payment provisions. The parties also agreed to adopt the pay rates, rules and practices established by the Bureau of Reclamation and AFGE, Local 1978 covering Hoover Dam employees (Reclamation agreement). However, as will be developed later, not all of the practices agreed to in the Reclamation agreements were adopted by the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before addressing the proposals in this case, we clarify the framework for analyzing cases that arise under section 704. In this regard, we discuss the purpose of section 704, its interrelationship with the Statute, and the requirements of section 704(a) and section 704(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Purpose of Section 704</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[S]ection 704 was intended to 'grandfather' collective bargaining agreements between prevailing rate employees and federal employers that were in effect at the time the Civil Service Reform Act was enacted...[and] preserve[ ] for future negotiations those pay practices that had previously [prior to August 19, 1972] been the subject of negotiation..." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dept. of Interior v. FLRA</span>, 908 F.2d 570, 574 (10th Cir. 1990). <span class="Italic">See also Columbia Power Trades Council </span>v. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dept. of Energy</span>, 671 F.2d 325, 328 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">Columbia Power</span>) ("&#x00A7; 704 was aimed at any inconsistency in provisions of the [Statute] which would limit the areas about which these employees could collectively bargain"). In enacting the Civil Service Reform Act, rather than alter certain historical bargaining patterns and relationships, Congress chose, in section 704, to "provide[ ] certain savings clauses for employees...who have traditionally negotiated contracts in accordance with prevailing rates in the private sector...." <span class="Italic">Conference Report, reprinted</span> in Subcommittee on Postal Personnel and Modernization of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 96th Congress, 1st Sess., <span class="Italic">Legislative History of the Federal Service Labor-Management</span> <span class="Italic">Relations Statute, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act</span> <span class="Italic">of 1978</span>, at 827.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Interrelationship Between the Statute and</span> <span class="Italic">Section 704</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 704 does not operate to exempt prevailing rate employees from the provisions of the Statute.&#x2003;Rather, "[t]he collective bargaining rights of prevailing rate employees are preserved while keeping them within the framework envisioned by Congress for public employees." <span class="Italic">Columbia Power</span>, 671 F.2d at 328 n.11. The Authority has previously concluded that section 704 permits bargaining in accordance with the Statute while preserving the right of prevailing rate employees to bargain over certain historically negotiated terms and conditions of employment even when inconsistent with the Statute or specified provisions of Title 5, United States Code. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Region, Yuma, Arizona and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1487</span>, 41 FLRA 3, 15-16 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Lower Colorado Region, Yuma</span>) ("It would, of course, be unnecessary to provide 'grandfather' or 'savings' clauses if, in fact, affected employees were not otherwise subject to the Statute.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a result, both the Statute in the first instance, and, where appropriate, section 704 thereafter, must be analyzed to determine whether a proposal or provision is negotiable. In this regard, if the parties disagree concerning the negotiability of a proposal under the Statute, as in other negotiability cases, "the parties bear the burden of creating a factual record sufficient for the Authority to resolve the negotiability dispute." <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1167 v. FLRA</span>, 681 F.2d 886, 891 (D.C. Cir. 1982). The agency must provide record support and demonstrate its assertion that the proposal is nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, National Border Patrol Council and U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, U.S. Border Patrol Western Region</span>, 39 FLRA 675, 688 (1991). If the disputed proposal is negotiable under the Statute, there is, of course, no reason to analyze the proposal under section 704 because "section 704 does not limit employees' bargaining rights under the Statute." <span class="Italic">Lower Colorado Region, Yuma</span>, 41 FLRA at 15. On the other hand, where we determine, either as a result of positions of the parties or for reasons apparent to the Authority, that a proposal is not negotiable under the Statute, we will then proceed to analyze the proposal to determine if it is preserved for bargaining under section 704<span class="Italic">. United States Information Agency v. FLRA</span>, 895 F.2d 1449, 1451 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">USIA</span>) ("[S]ections 9(b) and 704 serve to 'grandfather-in' bargaining rights for prevailing rate employees with respect to subjects that might otherwise be <span class="Italic">non-negotiable</span>...") (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In performing our analysis under section 704, we first examine the proposal under section 704(a). Those proposals meeting the requirements of section 704(a), which pertain to pay and pay practices, must thereafter be analyzed under section 704(b) to determine if the proposal is consistent with current prevailing rates and pay practices. As in negotiability cases under the Statute, the parties bear the burden of creating a record upon which the Authority can make a determination over whether the matter is preserved for bargaining under section 704, and act at their peril if they fail to meet this burden. For example, the union must establish that a proposal is in accord with prevailing rates and pay practices in the relevant industry. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1916 and U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, Pittsburgh Research Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</span>, 43 FLRA 1469, 1474 (1992) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1916</span>); <span class="Italic">International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1245 and U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Mid-Pacific Regional Office, Sacramento, California</span>, 43 FLRA 1155, 1163 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Mid-Pacific</span> <span class="Italic">Regional Office</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Requirements of Section 704(a</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Determining whether section 704(a) applies to preserve bargaining entails a three-part inquiry: (1) Are the unit employees Government prevailing rate employees to whom section 9(b) applies?; (2) Does the proposal in dispute pertain to "terms and conditions of employment and other employment benefits" within the meaning of section 704(a)?; and (3) Does the proposal concern a matter that was a "subject of negotiation" in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Prevailing Rate Employees to Whom Section 9(b</span>) <span class="Italic">Applies</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A "prevailing rate employee" is defined as "an individual employed in or under an agency in a recognized trade or craft, or other skilled mechanical craft, or in an unskilled, semiskilled, or skilled manual labor occupation, and any other individual,...in a position having trade, craft, or laboring experience and knowledge as the paramount requirement." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5342(a)(2)(A). Wages of prevailing rate employees "are determined by the wages prevailing in the industry in which they work, pursuant to a wage survey mechanism" rather than by the Federal General Schedule. <span class="Italic">USIA</span>, 895 F.2d at 1451 (<span class="Italic">quoting United States Dept. of Energy </span>v. <span class="Italic">FLRA</span>, 880 F.2d 1163, 1164 n.2 (10th Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Terms and Conditions of Employment and Other</span> <span class="Italic">Employment Benefits</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The phrase "terms and conditions of employment" in section 704(a) includes but is broader than those matters that constitute "conditions of employment" within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy</span>, 880 F.2d at 1169. In addition to "[terms and] conditions of employment," the scope of bargaining under section 704(a) encompasses "other employment benefits."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Subject of Negotiation in Accordance with</span> <span class="Italic">Prevailing Rates and Practices</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third criterion of section 704(a)--whether the proposal concerns a matter that was a "subject of negotiation in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972"--contains two distinct components.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Subject of Negotiation</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 704(a) authorizes negotiations only over specific matters that were the subject of negotiations prior to August 19, 1972. The subject of a collective bargaining proposal or provision is the specific term and condition of employment or other employment benefit that the proposal or provision addresses. <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1418 and United States Information Agency, Voice of America and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1812</span>, 49 FLRA 1262, 1290 (1994) (<span class="Italic">NFFE and</span> <span class="Italic">VOA</span>). Courts of Appeals have narrowly construed this provision of section 704(a) in determining whether a specific matter was previously the subject of negotiation. <span class="Italic">See U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Rio Grande</span> <span class="Italic">Project v. FLRA</span>, 908 F.2d 570, 573-75 (10th Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">Bureau</span> <span class="Italic">of Reclamation</span>) (although premium pay had been negotiated between the parties prior to August 19, 1972, "Sunday premium pay" had not, and thus was not preserved for negotiation); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs v. FLRA</span>, 887 F.2d 172, 176 (9th Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">BIA</span>) (reversing Authority's determination that a "save pay" provision, although not previously negotiated, was sufficiently related to the subject matter of wages to be preserved for bargaining).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining the subject that a current proposal or provision addresses, the Authority considers all pertinent factors, including, as appropriate: (1) the text of any relevant proposal or provision; (2) evidence, including bargaining history, relating to the intent of any relevant proposal or provision; (3) <span id="page_935"></span>evidence as to the current and pre-1972 work situations of the unit (for example, the agency's structure and functions and the employees, duties); and (4) the parties' contentions as to whether Congress has expressed any intent through legislation as to the scope of a subject matter, as it did with respect to the subject matters concerning pay in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation</span> and <span class="Italic">BIA</span>. <span class="Italic">NFFE and</span> <span class="Italic">VOA</span>, 49 FLRA at 1290-91. If, based on consideration of the pertinent factors, the Authority finds that a current proposal concerns the specific matter that was the subject of negotiations prior to August 19, 1972, then the subject-matter requirement of section 704(a) will have been met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">In</span> <span class="Italic">Accordance with Prevailing Rates and</span> <span class="Italic">Practices</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">"The phrase 'in accordance with prevailing rates and practices'...defines which terms and conditions are subject to bargaining. Those terms and conditions of employment that were the subject of negotiations in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972, shall now be negotiated in accordance with the provisions of section 9(b) of the Prevailing Rate Systems Act." [6] <span class="Italic">USIA</span>, 895 F.2d at 1453 (emphasis in original). Terms and conditions of employment negotiated prior to August 19, 1972, are preserved for bargaining irrespective of current industry practices.[7] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1453-54.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Pursuant to section 9(b) of the PRSA, certain provisions in contracts and agreements in effect on August 19, 1972, the date of enactment of the PRSA, are shielded from the other provisions of the PRSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;However, pursuant to section 704(b), discussed in Section D., <span class="Italic">infra</span>, those terms and conditions of employment involving "pay" or "pay practices," are only negotiable if consistent with current prevailing rates and practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Requirements Under Section 704(b</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Section 704(b) modifies the scope of bargaining established in subsection 704(a) with respect to the specific category of terms and conditions of employment described as 'pay and pay practices.'" <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Dams Project Office, Parker and Davis Dams and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers</span>, Local 640, 41 FLRA 119, 127 (1991). Pay and pay practice proposals must not only meet the section 704(a) requirements, but must also be in accord with the current prevailing rates and practices. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1916</span>, 43 FLRA at 1473. As a result, "[t]he scope of bargaining concerning pay and pay practices under section 704(b) is narrower than the scope of bargaining concerning 'terms and conditions of employment' under section 704(a)." <span class="Italic">Mid-Pacific Regional</span> <span class="Italic">Office</span>, 43 FLRA at 1159.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining if a matter, preserved for bargaining under section 704(a), is negotiable under section 704(b), the Authority determines whether: (1) the matter involves a pay or pay practice; and (2) the proposal attempts to negotiate in accordance with current prevailing rates and pay practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Pay and Pay Practices</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[T]he term 'pay' means the rate of basic pay for a position held by an employee covered by the provisions of section 704." <span class="Italic">United States Information Agency, Voice of</span> <span class="Italic">America and National Federation of Federal Employees</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 1418</span>, 37 FLRA 849, 859 (1990). The term "pay practices" means "matters historically considered part of an employees compensation package, such as: (1) adjustments to an employees basic rate of pay; (2) matters concerning the payment of differentials, overtime, and premiums; and (3) any other general compensation policies that entered into and became a part of the employee's total compensation package<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 861.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Negotiation in Accordance with Current</span> <span class="Italic">Prevailing Rates and Pay Practices</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 704(b) negotiations must be consistent with current industry practices: "if a pay practice is not among the current practices in the industry, the parties may not negotiate over that subject." <span class="Italic">USIA</span>, 895 F.2d at 1455. If "a party seeks to negotiate over a pay practice that is not a current practice in the industry, the 'in accordance with prevailing rates and pay practices' clause of section 704(b)" renders the proposal nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The parties may negotiate a methodology for determining current prevailing rates and practices and thereafter utilize and apply the factual data obtained. <span class="Italic">BIA</span>, 887 F.2d at 176. However, when the parties disagree on this question, "and hence whether the subject is negotiable, the FLRA must decide the negotiability question...." <span class="Italic">USIA</span>, 895 F.2d at 1455. This provision in section 704(b) thus "defines the permissible range of outcomes of negotiations--not which subjects may be negotiated<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1454.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA moved on in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3062</span> to the parties' proposals, 51 FLRA at 237-44:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 2-2d</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">When scheduled overtime is canceled less than four hours from the end of the last regularly scheduled shift, compensation payment equivalent to 2 hours at the appropriate overtime rate shall be paid.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties disagree over whether any of the disputed proposals concern matters that were subjects of negotiation prior to August 19, 1972, and thus whether the proposals are preserved for negotiation under section 704.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Article IV and the proposal are similar in that they both address overtime, overtime scheduling, and pay for overtime work not actually performed, Article IV <span class="Italic">does not</span> <span class="Italic">demonstrate</span> that the parties negotiated on the specific term and condition of employment that is addressed by Proposal 2-2d. Article IV authorized overtime pay for work not actually performed when the employee was <span class="Italic">called</span> <span class="Italic">in</span> outside his scheduled hours to perform <span class="Italic">unscheduled</span> overtime and could not be utilized for the full two hours. As such, Article IV did not address the specific subject of Proposal 2-2d--payment for scheduled overtime canceled on less than 4 hours' notice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument that Article IV demonstrates that the parties negotiated over the subject matter of Proposal 2-2d is analogous to the arguments presented in <span class="Italic">Bureau of</span> <span class="Italic">Reclamation</span> and <span class="Italic">BIA</span>. As noted earlier in section III.C.3.a., <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the 10th and 9th Circuits rejected such arguments and held that section 704(a) required prior negotiation of the same specific subject matter. The fact that the parties in those cases had previously negotiated premium pay and wages in general, respectively, was held insufficient to preserve "Sunday premium pay" and "saved pay" for negotiation. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation</span>, 908 F.2d at 575-76; <span class="Italic">BIA</span>, 887 F.2d at 176.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Proposal 2-2d addresses a matter that was not a subject of negotiation prior to August 19, 1972, and it is therefore not preserved for bargaining under section 704(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposals 2-3b and 2-3c</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Proposal 2-3b</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">Employees shall receive, in addition to other compensation, two times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked. [proposal stipulated to concern only overtime payment]</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Proposal 2-3c</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">Exception to subsection 2-3(b) above: Employees who work unscheduled and/or Emergency Overtime other than Holidays, Sundays, lieu or call-ins, shall receive, in addition to other compensation, one and one half times their regular rate of pay for the first two hours of overtime that would require continued work past their normally scheduled hours of work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposals 2-3b and 2-3c Are Preserved for</span> <span class="Italic">Bargaining Under Section 704(a</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 2 shows that prior to August 19, 1972, the parties negotiated concerning the rate of pay for overtime and negotiated different rates for specific categories of overtime. Article IV demonstrates that the parties understood the term overtime to include both scheduled and unscheduled or emergency overtime. Contrary to the Agency's claim, Article 2 and Article IV reflect that in their Supplementary Agreements the parties did distinguish between payment for scheduled and unscheduled overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We thus find that unlike Proposal 2-2d, analyzed in section IV.B., <span class="Italic">supra</span>, Proposals 2-3b and 2-3c address terms and conditions of employment that were the subject of negotiation prior to August 19, 1972. Accordingly, Proposals 2-3b and 2-3c are preserved for negotiation under section 704(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion we recognize that Proposal 2-3b operates to do two things expressly authorized by section 9b of the PRSA: First, the proposal improves the benefits that were established prior to August 19, 1972, in that the rate of pay for emergency and unscheduled overtime in Proposal 2-3b is higher than the rate of pay established in Article 2. In addition, the proposal extends the double time rate of pay, which, prior to August 19, 1972, was only paid for Sunday overtime, to emergency and unscheduled overtime. Such "improvements" and "extensions" are expressly authorized under section 9(b)(2) of the PRSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, by providing certain exceptions to Proposal 2-3b, Proposal 2-3c renews the specific terms of the parties' current agreement by maintaining the overtime rate of pay currently applicable under that agreement for the first 2 hours of overtime occurring after an employee's regularly scheduled shift. Sections 704 and 9(b) operate to permit parties to bargain over a current proposal that renews the specific matter that was the subject of negotiations prior to August 19, 1972.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposals 2-3b and 2-3c Are Negotiable Under Section 704(b</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that the proposals involve pay and pay practices under section 704(b). Accordingly, the sole question we must address to determine if the proposals are negotiable under section 704(b) is whether the proposals are in accordance with current pay rates and practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted earlier, the parties are entitled to negotiate over what industry to adopt in determining whether or not a proposal is in accordance with current pay rates and practices. <span class="Italic">See</span>, Section III.D.2. These parties agreed <span id="page_936"></span>that the Boulder City area would serve as the relevant industry. Further, and more specifically, the parties agreed to adopt the pay rates, rules, and practices established by the Bureau of Reclamation and AFGE, Local 1978. We find that these proposals are analogous to provisions in Article 2, Section 2 of the Reclamation agreement. Accordingly, we conclude that the pay rates and practices addressed in Proposals 2-3b and 2-3c have, at a minimum, "some place in current industry practice" and, therefore, are negotiable under section 704(b). <span class="Italic">USIA</span>, 895 F.2d at 1455 (emphasis in original).[14]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;In the preceding section where the proposals were analyzed under section 704(a), we noted the irrelevance of the 1991 Reclamation agreement, in light of the parties having negotiated their own overtime provisions and because, in any event, only a pre-August 19, 1972 Reclamation agreement could preserve a subject matter for negotiation under section 704(a). A different inquiry--which properly implicates a more recent version of the Reclamation agreement--is required for the purposes of section 704(b). Specifically, under section 704(b), we determine whether the pay practice in the disputed proposals is a current practice in the industry. We conclude, based upon negotiations adopting the Reclamation agreement as indicative of the relevant industry, that it is.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">VI.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 2-4b</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">The employee's time shall commence when the employee receives the call at his/her home or is otherwise notified, and shall conclude when the employee returns home.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article IV provides a minimum of 2 hours of overtime pay for an employee who is called in to work at a time outside his or her regular schedule.&#x2003;Article IV makes no provision for time spent driving to and from the work site. On the contrary, the Article specifically provides that "[a]n employee will be paid for all overtime required to be worked" and does not mention compensation for time spent in a travel status. Accordingly, Article IV does not demonstrate that "portal to portal" pay was a subject matter of negotiation between the parties prior to August 19, 1972.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union is correct that Article 18, Section 1 of the Reclamation agreement contains an analogous "portal to portal" provision. However, the Union may not rely on the 1991 Reclamation agreement to preserve this matter for negotiation under section 704(a). As we noted with respect to Proposals 2-3b and 2-3c, the 1991 Reclamation agreement does not establish the pay practice followed by the Bureau of Reclamation and AFGE, Local 1978 prior to August 19, 1972. More importantly, and as we noted in the previous section, the record does not establish that the parties adopted the Reclamation agreement concerning this particular overtime pay practice. Instead, in Article IV, the parties negotiated an overtime arrangement that is different from the provision to which the Union adverts in the 1991 Reclamation agreement. Accordingly, we find that the "portal to portal" provision in the Reclamation agreement does not preserve this subject matter for negotiation under section 704(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record does not establish that the subject of Proposal 2-4b was a subject of negotiation prior to August 19, 1972. Consequently, the subject of Proposal 2-4b is not preserved for bargaining under section 704(a).</p>

The court identified three conditions of continued negotiability of pay rates under the 1972 Government Employees Prevailing Rate Systems Act (PSRA) following enactment of the 1978 CSRA and, in particular, &#x00A7; 704 of the Reform Act. Under &#x00A7; 704(a) of that Act, the terms and conditions of employment and other benefits must have been the subject of negotiations prior to August 19, 1972. The negotiations must have been in accordance with rates and practices prevailing prior to that date. Under &#x00A7; 704(b) of the Reform Act, the pay practice is not negotiable if no one in the industry currently engages in the practice. The court determined that although employees were paid Sunday premium pay prior to August 19, 1972, there was no evidence that the parties discussed or negotiated the premium. The statutory purpose, permitting employees to retain bargaining positions secured prior to 1972, was not met by a nonnegotiated grant of Sunday premium pay that depended upon an agency perception that the premium was a statutory requirement. The court reversed FLRA's decision.

<p class="noindent-1">The employees to whom the proposals in this case apply engage in collective bargaining pursuant to section 704 of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, 1218, codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5343 (Amendments) (1988 ed.) and section 9(b) of the Prevailing Rate Systems Act, Pub. L. No. 92-392, codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5343 (Amendments note) (1988 ed.).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 704 of the CSRA establishes certain bargaining rights for prevailing rate employees "to whom section 9(b) of Public Law 92-392 applies." Section 704(a) provides in relevant part that the terms and conditions of employment for these prevailing rate employees that were the subject of negotiation in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972, shall be negotiated after the enactment of the CSRA without regard to the provisions of the Statute. The Authority has concluded that, taken together, the language of sections 704(a) and 9(b), supported by the legislative history of those provisions, authorizes parties who had negotiated over a subject matter prior to August 19, 1972, to continue existing contractual terms concerning that subject matter or to modify or improve them when negotiating a new agreement, without regard to any restrictions contained in the Statute. <span class="Italic">See National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1418 and United States Information Agency, Voice of America</span>, 37 FLRA 1385 (1990)...(<span class="Italic">USIA I</span>); <span class="Italic">Columbia Power Trades Council and United States Department of Energy, Bonneville Power Administration</span>, 22 FLRA 998 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Bonneville</span>).

<p class="noindent-1">Under section 704(b), prevailing rate employees who negotiated rates of pay and pay practices in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972, may negotiate current pay and pay practices only in accordance with current prevailing rates and practices in the industry. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 128.

<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 6</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Amend SLA [Supplemental Labor Agreement] 1, Art. 5, Sec. 1 to read:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Employees shall not be required to perform work outside their classification, except for small amounts of related incidental work associated with the primary work assignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">For the purposes of this section the term "related incidental" shall be defined as work not in excess of 1/2 hour.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, section 704(a) applies to negotiation of terms and conditions of employment while section 704(b) applies to the more specific category of terms and conditions of employment described as pay and pay practices. The scope of bargaining concerning pay and pay practices under section 704(b) is narrower than the scope of bargaining concerning "terms and conditions of employment" under section 704(a). Therefore, we initially must determine whether this proposal concerns a matter that is governed by subsection 704(a) or (b). For purposes of section 704(b), we have defined the term "pay" as the rate of basic pay for a position held by an employee covered by the provisions of section 704 of the CSRA. <span class="Italic">United States Information Agency, Voice of America</span>, 37 FLRA 849, 859 (1990) (<span class="Italic">USIA II</span>). We interpret "pay practices," within the context of section 704(b), to mean matters historically considered part of an employee's compensation package, such as: (1) adjustments to an employee's basic rate of pay; (2) matters concerning the payment of differentials, overtime, and premiums; and (3) any other general compensation policies that entered into and became a part of the employee's total compensation package. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 861.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 6 concerns limitations on the amount of work outside of an <span id="page_937"></span>employee's classification that an employee can be required to perform. This proposal does not concern the employee's right to compensation or the Agency's pay practices. Therefore, we need not analyze the proposal under section 704(b). It relates to the terms and conditions of employment of employees because it concerns their work assignments.... The relevant standard for determining whether this proposal is negotiable under section 704(a) is whether it concerns a matter that was the subject of negotiation in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Union, the language contained in the first sentence, or substantially similar language, has existed in contracts between the parties since 1959. As noted above, the Agency's statement of position was untimely filed and has not been considered.... Based on the record in this case, the Union's claim is unrebutted and we accept it as fact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not interpret section 704 as limited to preserving for negotiations only matters that have been incorporated in a negotiated agreement prior to August 19, 1972, but as extending to matters that were the "subject of negotiation in accordance with prevailing rates and practices" prior to that date. <span class="Italic">USIA I</span>, 37 FLRA at 1399-1400. Consistent with this approach, we have construed section 704 of the CSRA and section 9(b) of the Prevailing Rate Act as permitting the parties to negotiate modifications and improvements of provisions of a contract<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Bonneville</span>, 22 FLRA at 1008.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, we conclude that a subject of negotiation prior to August 19, 1972, concerned limitations on the amount of work outside of an employee's classification that the employee can be required to perform. There is no claim in the record that those earlier negotiations were not in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to 1972. Therefore, we find that Proposal 6 concerns a matter that was the subject of negotiation prior to August 19, 1972, and constitutes a modification or improvement of a contractual provision that was negotiated prior to that date.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that restrict an agency's ability to assign work directly interfere with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.... However, the Authority has held that "[t]he plain meaning of [section 704(a)] is that it exempts provisions of specified collective bargaining agreements from the limitations on the scope of bargaining set forth in the Statute, including the management rights provisions of section 7106." <span class="Italic">Bonneville</span>, 22 FLRA at 1005. Consequently, where, as here, the parties are covered by section 704 and have negotiated matters that conflict with the management rights provision of the Statute, section 704 preserves the parties' right to continue to negotiate on those matters. <span class="Italic">USIA I</span>, 37 FLRA at 1402.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, we find that the subject of limitations on the amount of work outside of an employee's classification that the employee can be required to perform was negotiated by the parties in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972. Therefore, the subject matter is a term and condition of employment preserved for bargaining under section 704(a) and negotiation of Proposal 6 is not barred by section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. We conclude that the Agency is obligated to bargain concerning Proposal 6 under section 704(a) of the CSRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 11</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">After the general wage increase, the U.S.B.R. [the Agency] will grant all bargaining unit positions a 7.75% inequity increase.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that this proposal seeks an adjustment to the employees' basic rate of pay to compensate for a demonstrated disparity between the level of their "total compensation" and that of employees in the survey area from which the prevailing rates and practices referred to in section 704 of the CSRA are ascertained. An adjustment to basic rate of pay constitutes a "pay practice" within the meaning of section 704(b) of the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">USIA II</span>, 37 FLRA at 861. Therefore, we find that Proposal 11 concerns "pay practices" and is governed by section 704(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for us to find that a proposal that concerns "pay practices" is negotiable under section 704(b), it must (1) concern a subject matter that was the subject of negotiations in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972, and (2) be in accordance with the current prevailing rates and practices in the industry. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">USIA v. FLRA</span>, 895 F.2d at 1454; <span class="Italic">Parker and Davis Dams</span>. Here, there is nothing in the record to support a conclusion that there is a current prevailing practice in industry of adjusting employees' rates of pay to afford them "total compensation" parity or that any other payments are provided to achieve such an objective. In this regard, the Union argues only that the concept of total compensation is consistent with accepted compensation survey principles and methodology as well as the principle of prevailing practices. However, it offers nothing to show that the industries in the survey area actually employ a practice of adjusting pay based on comparative levels of total compensation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because this proposal does not satisfy the requirement of section 704(b) that it be in accordance with the current industry practice, it is unnecessary to address whether it meets the additional requirement that it concern a subject matter that was the subject of negotiations prior to August 19, 1972. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Proposal 11 does not involve a prevailing pay practice within the meaning of section 704(b) of the CSRA, and that, therefore, the proposal is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Columbia Power Trades Council and Dept. of Energy, Bonneville Power Admin.</span>, 54 FLRA 189, 191-203 (1998), also discussed the elements of negotiability concerning a pay adjustment, a component of pay and pay practices for prevailing rate employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Meaning of the Proposal</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By its terms, the proposal would require the Agency to grant bargaining unit employees a wage increase in addition to the general wage increase. The amount of the additional wage increase would be determined by an industry survey and would be equivalent, or substantially equivalent, to the overall percentage difference between the value of the surveyed benefits for the Agency's employees and the average value of the same benefits provided by the surveyed utilities. Although the proposal does not further describe the method by which the percentage difference would translate into a dollar amount, the absence of any explanation is not critical to our inquiry as to whether the proposal is within the duty to bargain. According to the Union, the intent and function of its proposal is to increase wages to account for a deficiency in the value of the fringe benefits provided to employees. As the Union's explanation is consistent with the wording of the proposal, we adopt it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1900 and U.S. Department of the Army, Headquarters, Forces Command, Fort McPherson, Georgia</span>, 51 FLRA 133, 138-39 (1995). We also note that the intent and function of the proposal is consistent with the Agency's view of it as "boosting wages to balance deficiencies in the perceived value of benefits...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addressing the meaning of the proposal, we are aware that both parties have referred to it as involving "total compensation." Based on the language of the proposal and the parties' contentions, it is clear to us that the proposal is a process to "offset," or balance wages and fringe benefits in arriving at the level of total compensation for unit employees. Specifically, the proposal would increase wages to account for a shortfall in the value of fringe benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analytic Framework to Be Applied in Determining Whether the Proposal Is Within the Duty to Bargain</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 704 of the CSRA provides generally that those terms and conditions of employment and other employment benefits, with respect to prevailing rate employees to whom section 9(b) of the PRSA applies and which were the subject of negotiations in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972 (hereinafter pre-1972), shall be negotiated on and after October 13, 1978, in accordance with the provisions of section 9(b), without regard to the provisions of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1418 and United States Information Agency, Voice of America and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1812</span>, 49 FLRA 1262, 1264 (1994) (<span class="Italic">VOA</span>). The legislative history of section 704 makes it clear that section 704(a) "may not be construed to nullify, curtail, or otherwise impair the right or duty of any party to negotiate for the renewal, extension, modification, or improvements of benefits negotiated." Conf. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 159 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> <span class="Italic">Legislative History of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute of 1978</span>, Committee Print No. 95-1717 at 827 (1979).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3062 and U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Boulder City, Nevada</span>, 51 FLRA 229 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Boulder City</span>), the Authority clarified the framework for analyzing cases that arise under section 704. In such cases, both the Statute, in the first instance, and section 704, thereafter, are relevant in determining whether a disputed proposal is within the duty to bargain. However, where there is apparent agreement between the parties that a proposal is outside the duty to bargain under the Statute, and the parties' arguments go only to section 704, the Authority examines only the elements of section 704, including section 9(b), which is expressly incorporated therein.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis Under Section 9(b)(2)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 9(b)(2) of the PRSA expressly authorizes negotiations for the renewal, extension, modification, or improvement of provisions of a contract that were in effect prior to August 19, 1972. That section does not contemplate the negotiation of <span class="Italic">new</span> terms and conditions of employment. As stated above, the legislative history of section 704 makes clear that it was not intended to nullify the rights of parties to negotiate the extension, modification, or improvements of benefits that were negotiated pre-1972.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The terms "extension," "modification," and "improvement" are not defined in section 9(b)(2) or the legislative history of the PRSA. In the absence of <span id="page_938"></span>statutory definitions, it is appropriate to refer to the normally accepted meanings of terms as reflected in the dictionary. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 52 FLRA 1265, 1283-84 (1997). As relevant here, the dictionary provides the following as examples of "extension": "lengthening, furthering, developing,...expansion, enlargement, augmentation, increase." The dictionary defines "modification" as "the act or action of changing something without fundamentally altering it"; and defines "improvement" to mean "the enhancement or augmentation of value or quality; an increasing of profitableness, excellence, or desirability." Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1986) (unabridged).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the precise contours of section 9(b)(2) have not been examined or identified by the Authority or the courts, the Authority's application of this section in specific bargaining contexts is instructive. For example, in <span class="Italic">Boulder City</span>, 51 FLRA at 241-42, proposals that increased overtime rates and extended overtime pay to additional situations were found to constitute improvements and extensions to matters that had been negotiated pre-1972. In <span class="Italic">VOA</span>, 49 FLRA at 1311-12, the Authority found that a section of a proposal that defined the work of employees to include duties in broadcasting studios that did not exist in 1972, merely modified and improved upon a specific subject, namely, jurisdiction over the technical functions in the agency's studios, that had been negotiated pre-1972. Additionally, in <span class="Italic">Mid-Pacific Regional Office</span>, 43 FLRA at 1160, the Authority found that a proposal establishing a specific time limit on the amount of work outside an employee's classification that the employee could be required to perform, constituted a modification or improvement of a contractual provision that had been negotiated pre-1972, but that did not specify a particular time limit. In these cases, the proposals were deemed to be within the duty to bargain because they extended the terms of previously negotiated provisions to include additional or changed circumstances, provided greater specificity for previously negotiated terms, or increased existing benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis Under Section 704(a)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Determining whether section 704(a) applies to preserve bargaining entails a three-part inquiry: (1) Are the unit employees Government prevailing rate employees to whom section 9(b) applies; (2) Does the proposal in dispute pertain to "terms and conditions of employment and other employment benefits" within the meaning of section 704(a); and (3) Does the proposal concern a matter that was a "subject of negotiation" in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More particularly with regard to the third criterion, which is relevant to this case, the Authority has adopted the view that section 704(a) authorizes negotiations only over specific matters that were the subject of negotiations prior to August 19, 1972. The subject of a collective bargaining proposal is the specific term and condition of employment or other employment benefit that the proposal addresses. The Authority reached this decision in <span class="Italic">VOA</span>, 49 FLRA at 1290, a decision on remand from the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">U.S. Information Agency v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 165 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">USIA v. FLRA</span>). In <span class="Italic">USIA v. FLRA</span>, the court instructed the Authority to consider other circuit court decisions in addressing the "thorny interpretive question of how squarely a current proposal must fit within the corners of a pre-1972 subject of negotiation for the former to be grandfathered by &#x00A7; 704(a)." <span class="Italic">USIA v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d at 169.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decisions to which the D.C. Circuit directed the Authority's attention were <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Rio Grande Project v. FLRA</span>, 908 F.2d 570 (10th Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">Rio Grande v. FLRA</span>) and <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs v. FLRA</span>, 887 F.2d 172, 176 (9th Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">BIA v. FLRA</span>). In the former case, the Tenth Circuit reversed the Authority's conclusion that Sunday premium pay, which had not been a subject of pre-1972 bargaining, was within the duty to bargain because it was encompassed within the pay practices negotiated by the parties pre-1972. The court found that the Authority had essentially taken too expansive a view of the scope of bargaining under sections 9(b) and 704 to include matters that had not been specifically included in a pre-1972 collective bargaining agreement. In the court's view, "the legislative history demonstrates that Congress enacted Sections 9(b) and 704 in order to preserve the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, not to expand the scope of the bargaining obligations between federal employers and prevailing rate employees." 908 F.2d at 574. The court determined that, given the various types of premium pay Congress has defined, "it would be a misinterpretation of Section 704(a) to conclude that negotiation of any type of premium pay operated to preserve the negotiability of all others. What is of importance is the exact kind of premium pay that was the subject of previous bargaining." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 575.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">BIA v. FLRA</span>, the court reversed the Authority's conclusion that a proposal calling for "save pay" was preserved for bargaining under section 704. The Authority had reasoned that the save pay provision "relate[d] to the same subject matter, pay and pay practices, which ha[d] been negotiated previously." <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 341 and U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Yakima Agency and the Wapato Irrigation Project</span>, 30 FLRA 783, 787 (1987). On the contrary, finding that Congress had not treated wages "as a simple uniform topic[,]" the court stated that the critical inquiry under section 704(a) focused on the kind of wages that were the subject of pre-1972 bargaining. 887 F.2d at 176. As save pay provisions had not been the subject of prior bargaining between the parties, the proposal was not within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taking these judicial decisions into account, the Authority, in <span class="Italic">VOA</span>, distinguished between a "general subject matter" negotiated by parties and a "specific term or condition of employment, or other employment benefit," finding that only the latter could satisfy the requirement of section 704(a). 49 FLRA at 1295. The Authority found, for example, with regard to proposals seeking to preserve work for bargaining unit employees, that the operation of technical equipment was the general subject matter of negotiation and that the specific terms and condition of employment concerning which the parties had bargained focused on the employee's exclusive right to perform particular functions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1300-03. The evidence relied on in reaching this determination consisted of the union's meeting notes from negotiations held in 1966 and 1967 and employee job descriptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also in <span class="Italic">VOA</span>, the Authority stated that in order to assess the subject that a bargaining proposal addresses, the Authority considers all pertinent factors, including, as appropriate: (1) the text of any relevant proposal; (2) evidence, including bargaining history, relating to the intent of any relevant proposal; (3) evidence as to the current and pre-1972 work situations of the unit (for example, the agency's structure and functions and the employees' duties); and (4) the parties' contentions as to whether Congress has expressed any intent through legislation as to the scope of a subject matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis Under Section 704(b)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 704(b) modifies the scope of bargaining under section 704(a) with respect to "pay and pay practices." "Pay and pay practices" refer to matters that are historically considered part of an employee's compensation package, such as: (1) adjustments to an employee's basic rate of pay; (2) matters concerning the payment of differentials, overtime, and premiums; and (3) any other general compensation policies that entered into and became a part of the employee's total compensation package. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Information Agency, Voice of America</span>, 37 FLRA 849, 861 (1990). A "pay and pay practice" must not only meet the criteria of section 704(a), but must also be in accord with current prevailing rates and practices. Unions bear the burden of establishing that their proposals are in accord with prevailing rates and practices in the relevant industry. <span class="Italic">Boulder City</span>, 51 FLRA at 233.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Issues Presented in This Case</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case presents issues involving an application of section 9(b)(2) of the PRSA and sections 704(a) and 704(b) of the CSRA. Specifically, we must decide whether the disputed proposal: (1) constitutes an "extension, modification, or improvement" of a subject of negotiations prior to August 19, 1972; and (2) is in accord with a current prevailing practice in the industry.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of the Framework to the Issues Presented</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Proposal Constitutes an "Extension, Modification, or Improvement" of a Subject of Negotiations Prior to August 19, 1972</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties' sole disagreement with respect to the requirements of section 704(a) is whether the proposal involves the same subject of negotiation that existed prior to August 19, 1972.[7] Resolving this dispute requires an examination of the evidence presented by the Union to support its claim of pre-1972 negotiations. We note at the outset, and find it significant, that the Agency does not contest the veracity of the documentary evidence submitted by the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The parties do not dispute that unit employees are Government prevailing rate employees to whom section 9(b) of the Prevailing Rate Systems Act applies and that the proposal pertains to "terms and conditions of employment and other employment benefits." Therefore, we do not address those elements of section 704(a) further.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Previously, the Authority has relied on agreement provisions and bargaining notes to assess whether a proposal concerns the same specific subject that had been negotiated pre-1972.[8] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VOA</span>. Here, the evidence shows that, prior to August 19, 1972, provisions that sought to balance wages and fringe benefits by boosting wages to account for a deficiency in fringe benefits that were prevailing in the industry, had been a specific subject of negotiation. These offset provisions were bargained on both an individualized fringe benefit basis, as evidenced by the parties' 1969 and 1970 negotiations, and on an aggregated fringe benefit basis, as evidenced by a 1967 compensation award. For example, the 1970 negotiations establish that: (1) the practice in the industry was to provide 9 paid holidays; (2) unit employees were given 8 paid <span id="page_939"></span>holidays; and (3) the parties agreed to increase the pay of employees to compensate for the disparity in the number of paid holidays that existed in the industry.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The Authority also has stated that it will look to evidence of the current and pre-1972 work situations of the unit and evidence of congressional intent with regard to the scope of bargaining. The former type of evidence is not pertinent to this case and will not be discussed further. The latter is discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evidence from the parties' 1969 negotiations shows that the parties bargained over Union proposals that would have required the Agency to pay each employee an additional $20.00 per month in lieu of paying the full cost of medical insurance because the "Government's contribution to the cost of medical insurance has left the [Agency] far behind the great majority of the Utility Industry." Other evidence in the record demonstrates that the parties bargained in 1970, without apparently concluding an agreement, with regard to extra pay to eliminate other disparities between the fringe benefits provided to unit employees and the fringe benefits provided to employees in the industry.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the record reveals that, in 1967, the parties agreed to have a panel of arbitrators establish wage rates for 45 job classifications for the contract year ending June 30, 1968.[9] Bargaining with regard to pay rates was authorized by law, with the rates established in accordance with prevailing rates ascertained through the use of fact-finding surveys in the industry. The award indicates that the arbitration panel considered, but rejected in a majority opinion, an increase in the wage rates that would have taken into account the fringe benefits paid by other utilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;As this interest arbitration award stemmed from the parties' wage bargaining, it can be used as evidence of their pre-1972 negotiations. By analogy, we note that the resolution of bargaining disputes by the Federal Service Impasses Panel is also considered part of the negotiation process. <span class="Italic">See e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 35 FLRA 296, 304 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">From the foregoing, we find that the record contains sufficient evidence to establish that the specific subject of increasing pay to offset reduced levels of fringe benefits for unit employees was a subject of negotiations between the parties prior to August 19, 1972.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that the evidence concerning the parties' 1969 and 1970 negotiations presented above involved additional pay for individual benefits that were not made available to unit employees. The instant proposal, on the other hand, groups together, or aggregates, individual fringe benefits for purposes of determining the additional wage increase that employees will receive to offset the deficiency in total fringe benefits. Consistent with section 9(b)(2), and the approach taken by the Authority in such cases as <span class="Italic">Boulder City</span>, <span class="Italic">VOA</span>, and <span class="Italic">Mid-Pacific Regional Office</span>, we find that the proposal constitutes an extension, modification, or improvement of a pre-1972 subject of negotiation, namely, the balancing of wages and fringe benefits. Specifically, by including more than one fringe benefit, the proposal would likely improve the overall wage increase. In seeking to augment employees' compensation, this proposal is to the same effect as a proposal in <span class="Italic">Boulder City</span>, that extended the types of situations for which overtime was payable and increased the rate of pay in overtime situations and that the Authority found to be preserved for bargaining under section 704(a). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boulder City</span>, 51 FLRA at 241-42.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Rio Grande v. FLRA</span> and <span class="Italic">BIA v. FLRA</span>, in which the courts found that the unions were essentially attempting to preserve for bargaining "new" subjects, rather than those that had been the subject of pre-1972 negotiations. First, in <span class="Italic">Rio Grande v. FLRA</span>, it was undisputed that the matter of Sunday pay had never been a specific subject of bargaining between the parties prior to August 19, 1972. Instead, the agency had a practice of providing such pay to employees. 908 F.2d at 571. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">BIA v. FLRA</span>, there was nothing in the record to show that a save pay provision had ever been included in an agreement between the parties. 887 F.2d at 174-75. In contrast, in this case, the proposal is simply an extension, modification or improvement of a pre-1972 subject of negotiation. Like the parties' pre-1972 bargaining, which focused on additional pay to balance against a reduced fringe benefits, the current proposal seeks to provide an additional wage increase for unit employees based on a disparity in fringe benefits provided to employees in the industry. The proposal does not concern a new subject of negotiation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, as to both <span class="Italic">Rio Grande v. FLRA</span> and <span class="Italic">BIA v. FLRA</span>, the courts found particularly significant the fact that Congress had legislated for different kinds of pay and had not viewed pay as a uniform or generic matter. In <span class="Italic">BIA v. FLRA</span>, the court stated that Congress had not treated federal employees' wages as a uniform topic but, instead, had specifically treated various wages, such as merit pay, Sunday and holiday pay, as separate subjects. In <span class="Italic">Rio Grande v. FLRA</span>, the court held that "[l]ike the court in [<span class="Italic">BIA v. FLRA</span>], we conclude that, given the various types of premium pay Congress has defined by statute, it would be a misinterpretation of Section 704(a) to conclude that negotiation of any type of premium pay operated to preserve the negotiability of all others." 908 F.2d at 575. Here, no party has pointed to, and we are unaware of, any indication that Congress has spoken to the issue of providing additional pay to account for a deficiency in fringe benefits. Instead, as a subject that is purely a creation of contract negotiations, the constraints imposed by legislative action do not exist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are mindful of the court's cautionary statement in <span class="Italic">Rio Grande v. FLRA</span> that "[i]f viewed broadly enough, almost any subject of negotiations could somehow be connected to one which was previously the subject of negotiations so as to qualify as a 'modification' or an 'item[ ] of subject matter' previously negotiated." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 574. However, we are unaware of any requirement for an <span class="Italic">exact</span> congruence between the language of a proposal and subjects that had been previously negotiated. By authorizing negotiations over the extension, modification, or improvement of provisions negotiated pre-1972, it is apparent that section 9(b)(2) was not designed to "freeze" bargaining in its precise pre-1972 contours. There must be some latitude to enable parties to tailor their bargaining to account for changing work situations and economic conditions. We believe that in enacting section 9(b), Congress must have contemplated that the workplace would not remain static and that collective bargaining would have to be dynamic in order to address changing conditions. For example, the facts in <span class="Italic">VOA</span> amply demonstrate how parties have been able to negotiate in the face of technology that has evolved since the PRSA was enacted. At the same time, we recognize, consonant with the court's further statement in <span class="Italic">Rio Grande v. FLRA</span>, that "Congress enacted Sections 9(b) and 704 in order to preserve the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, not to expand the scope of the bargaining obligations[,]" <span class="Italic">id.</span>, and that there are limits on the permissible range of negotiated extensions, modifications and improvements. The proposal in this case, in our view, falls within that permissible range because it builds upon the parties' negotiation over additional wage increases to offset a disparity in fringe benefits to account for changed economic conditions, without constituting a departure from prior negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, and for the reasons fully set forth above, we find that the proposal satisfies all of the requirements of sections 704(a) and 9(b)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Proposal Is in Accord with a Current Prevailing Practice in the Industry</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that the proposal in this case concerns a pay practice within the meaning of section 704(b). The parties disagree, however, over whether the pay practice is a prevailing practice in the industry, which is comprised of eight Pacific Northwest utilities. "[I]f a pay practice is not among the current practices in the industry, the parties may not negotiate over that subject." <span class="Italic">United States Information Agency v. FLRA</span>, 895 F.2d 1449, 1455 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">USIA</span>). However, if the pay practice "has <span class="Italic">some</span> place in current industry practice, then the parties must negotiate over the subject...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1455 (emphasis in original). As we stated earlier, the Union bears the burden of establishing that its proposal is in accord with a prevailing practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence submitted by the Union consists of statements by five of the eight utilities that establish that these industry employers and unions all negotiate using a process that offsets wages and fringe benefits in arriving at their total compensation.&#x2003;By way of example, the director of labor relations for one of the utilities stated that if the union were to request, and the company were to grant, an additional holiday, the wage offer would be reduced by a percentage amount. Likewise, the manager of human resources operations for a different utility stated that, in negotiations, wages and benefits "are offset by each other." The business representative negotiating for a union with another utility stated that, in negotiations, "any increase in [fringe benefits]...in the last seven years of collective bargaining ha[s] been an offset in the wage proportion."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This evidence establishes that there is an industry practice of offsetting wages and fringe benefits.&#x2003;While the examples stated above refer to an increase in the value of fringe benefits and proportional decreases in wages, they actually operate conversely as well--an increase in wages is accompanied by a proportional decrease in the value of fringe benefits. Both situations reflect the parties' attempt at balancing wages and fringe benefits to achieve their desired level of total compensation. This is precisely the intent and function of the Union's proposal. <span class="Italic">See</span> Part IV.A. Accordingly, we find that the subject of the Union's proposal "has <span class="Italic">some</span> place in current industry practice[.]" <span class="Italic">USIA</span>, 895 F.2d at 1455 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this result, we reject the Agency's reliance on a survey that it conducted that purportedly showed "an absence of any respondent indicating a pay practice of boosting wages to balance below-market values in their benefits programs." The Agency has presented no evidence of this survey, other than a bare assertion as to its results. More significantly, however, the evidence that has been presented clearly shows, to the contrary, that parties in the relevant industry negotiate in such a way that balances wages and fringe benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that this case is distinguishable from a proposal in <span class="Italic">Mid-Pacific Regional Office</span>, 43 FLRA at 1161-63, that required the agency to <span id="page_940"></span>"grant all bargaining unit positions a 7.75% inequity increase" following a general wage increase. The union had argued that it was seeking to adjust wages to achieve "total compensation parity." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1163. Addressing solely the requirement of section 704(b) that the disputed pay practice must be in accordance with current prevailing practices, the Authority found nothing in the record to show that there was a current prevailing industry practice of adjusting employees' rates of pay to provide total compensation parity or that any other payments were provided to achieve that objective. While noting the union's argument that "the concept of total compensation [was] consistent with accepted compensation survey principles and methodology as well as the principle of prevailing practices[,]" the Authority found that the union failed to show that the surveyed industries employed a practice of adjusting pay based on comparative levels of total compensation. In contrast, the Union here has presented evidence to show that its proposal is in accord with a prevailing industry practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, and for the reasons explained above, we find that the proposal satisfies the requirements of section 704(b).</p>
<p class="noindent">According to <span class="Italic">IBEW Local 1245</span>, if a pay practice is not among the current practices in the industry, the parties may not negotiate over that subject<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">IBEW Local 532 and Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Billings</span>, 39 FLRA 1376, 1379 (1991) (concerning policy applied to proposal for base pay to include bonus paid by one of four companies included in prevailing rate survey); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Colorado River Storage Project and IBEW Local 2159</span>, 36 FLRA 283, 287 (1990) (analysis applied to overturn arbitration award that restored premium pay), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">IBEW and Dept. of Energy, WAPA</span>, 57 FLRA 7, 9 (2001) (requiring remand of arbitration award to determine whether award was based on 5 USC 5343(d) or whether, as required by 5 USC 704, award was based on current prevailing rates and pay practices in industry).</p>
<p class="noindent">A controversy over the negotiability of Sunday premium pay that surfaced in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Reg'l Office and AFGE Local 1978</span>, 33 FLRA 671 (1988), resurfaced in the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1978 v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 838, 839-42 (9th Cir. 1992), affirming FLRA on the point that if a pay practice is not current within the industry it is not negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The American Federation of Government Employees ("AFGE" or "the Union") appeals the Federal Labor Relations Authority's ("the FLRA" or "the Authority") determination that the Bureau of Reclamation ("the Bureau") did not commit an unfair labor practice by refusing to bargain over Sunday premium pay. The Bureau has intervened in support of the Authority's decision. We have jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a) (1988), and we affirm the Authority's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The AFGE has been the exclusive representative of all wage board employees up to and including Foreman 1 at the Boulder Canyon Project, Bureau of Reclamation, located in Boulder City, Nevada ("the Regional Office"). These employees are prevailing rate employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5342(a)(2) (1988). They have received a 25% premium for regularly-scheduled nonovertime Sunday work since prior to August 19, 1972.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On April 2, 1987, the Regional Office notified the Union that it would discontinue paying Sunday premium pay on June 7, 1987. The Regional Office subsequently agreed to delay the change until June 21, 1987. At a meeting on June 10, 1987, the Union argued that Sunday premium pay was subject to substantive bargaining. On July 9, 1987, the Regional Office informed the Union that it would not engage in substantive bargaining. On July 19, 1987, under the direction of the Bureau of Reclamation, the Regional Office stopped paying Sunday premium pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the Bureau's refusal to negotiate, the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge against the Bureau and the Regional Office. In its original decision, issued October 31, 1988, the FLRA concluded that the Bureau had committed an unfair labor practice by ordering the Regional Office to discontinue Sunday premium pay without negotiations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior, Bur. of Reclam'n, Washington D.C., and Dep't of the Interior, Sur. of Reclam'n, Lower Colorado Res'l Office, Boulder City, Nevada, and Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 1978, AFL-CIO</span>, 33 FLRA No. 82 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Bureau filed a motion for reconsideration.&#x2003;The FLRA granted the motion, and on June 4, 1990 the FLRA reversed its original decision, holding that the Bureau did not commit an unfair labor practice by refusing to negotiate the termination of Sunday premium pay because Sunday premium pay was not negotiable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior, Bur. of Reclam'n, Washington, D.C. and Dep't of the Interior, Bur. of Reclam'n, Lower Colorado Res'l Office, Boulder City, Nevada, and Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 1978, AFL-CIO</span>, 36 F.L.R.A. No. 1 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the Bureau committed an unfair labor practice, in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116 (1988), when it refused to negotiate over Sunday premium pay. Under section 7116(a)(5), it is an unfair labor practice for an agency "to refuse to consult or negotiate in good faith with a labor organization as required by this chapter." The central issue, therefore, is whether the Bureau was required to negotiate Sunday premium pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general rule, the pay for most prevailing rate employees is fixed administratively under the Prevailing Rate Systems Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5343. The pay is not negotiable. Section 9(b) of the Prevailing Rate Systems Act, however, provides the following exception to that rule:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The amendments made by this Act...shall not be construed to--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;abrogate, modify, or otherwise affect in any way the provisions of any contract in effect on the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 19, 1972] pertaining to the wages, the terms and conditions of employment, and other employment benefits, or any of the foregoing matters, for Government prevailing rate employees and resulting from negotiations between Government agencies and organizations of Government employees;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;nullify, curtail, or otherwise impair in any way the right of any party to such contract to enter into negotiations after the date of enactment of this Act [Aug. 19, 1972] for the renewal, extension, modification, or improvement of the provisions of such contract or for the replacement of such contract with a new contract; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(3)&#x2003;nullify, change, or otherwise affect in any way after such date of enactment [Aug. 19, 1972] any agreement, arrangement, or understanding in effect on such date [Aug. 19, 1972] with respect to the various items of subject matter of the negotiations on which any such contract in effect on such date is based or prevent the inclusion of such items of subject matter in connection with the renegotiation of any such contract, or the replacement of such contract with a new contract, after such date.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5343 note (1988) (Labor Contracts Pertaining to Wages, Terms and Conditions of Employment, and Other Employment Benefits).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress modified section 9(b) in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Public Law 95-454. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5343 note (1988) (Negotiating Requirements). Section 704(a) of the Civil Service Reform Act provides for the negotiation of the terms and conditions of employment of prevailing rate employees. It states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Those terms and conditions of employment and other employment benefits with respect to Government prevailing rate employees to whom section 9(b) of Public Law 92-392...applies which were the subject of negotiation in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972, shall be negotiated on and after the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 13, 1978] in accordance with the provisions of section 9(b)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5343 note (Negotiating Requirements).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, under section 704(a), terms and conditions of employment and other employment benefits must be negotiated if two requirements are met. First, the terms and conditions and other employment benefits must have been the subject of negotiations prior to August 19, 1972. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Interior, Bur. of Indian Affairs, Yakima Agency and the Wapato Irrigation Project v. FLRA</span>, 887 F.2d 172, 175-76 (9th Cir. 1989) ("<span class="Italic">Yakima</span>"). Second, these prior negotiations must have been in accordance with the rates and practices prevailing prior to August 19, 1972. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Interior, Bur. of Reclam'n, Rio Grande Project v. FLRA</span>, 908 F.2d 570, 575 (10th Cir. 1990) ("<span class="Italic">Rio Grande</span>"). For purposes of section 704(a), the current prevailing practice in the industry is irrelevant. <span class="Italic">United States Info. Agency, Voice of Am. v. FLRA</span>, 895 F.2d 1449, 1455 (D.C. Cir. 1990) ("<span class="Italic">VOA</span>").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pay and pay practices are "one type of the 'terms and conditions of employment' referred to in subsection (a)." <span class="Italic">Yakima</span>, 887 F.2d at 174. Therefore, to be negotiable, pay and pay practices must meet the requirements of section 704(a). In addition to those requirements, however, to be negotiable, pay and pay practices must also meet the requirements of section 704(b). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rio Grande</span>, 908 F.2d at 576-77. Section 704(b) provides: "The pay and pay practices relating to employees referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be negotiated in accordance with prevailing rates and pay practices." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5343 note (Negotiating Requirements). Thus, under section 704(b), a pay practice is not negotiable if nobody in the industry currently engages in the practice. However, "if the pay practice has <span class="Italic">some</span> place in current industry practice, then the parties must negotiate over the subject." <span class="Italic">VOA</span>, 895 F.2d at 1455 (emphasis in original). Prevailing rates and practices are questions of fact for the FLRA to determine. <span class="Italic">Yakima</span>, 887 F.2d at 176.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties dispute whether Sunday premium pay is a pay practice.&#x2003;The FLRA and the Bureau contend that Sunday premium pay is a pay practice. Therefore, they contend, to be negotiable, Sunday premium pay must be a currently prevailing practice. The Union argues that Sunday premium pay does not have to be a currently prevailing practice to be negotiable because it is not a pay or pay practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its decision on reconsideration, the FLRA implicitly determined that Sunday premium pay is a pay practice. The FLRA concluded that "section 704(b) precludes negotiations over matters relating to pay and pay <span id="page_941"></span>practices if those matters are not among current industry practices." 36 F.L.R.A. No. 1 at 5. The Authority then found that "Sunday premium pay is not among the current practices in the industry[ ]' for purposes of Section 704(b)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 6. Therefore, the Authority held that the Bureau was not required to negotiate Sunday premium pay. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the Authority implicitly determined Sunday premium pay to be a pay practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Authority that Sunday premium pay is a pay practice.&#x2003;Although section 704 does not provide any guidelines for determining when a practice is a pay practice, it seems obvious that Sunday premium pay, a practice which increases a worker's pay by 25%, is a pay practice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rio Grande</span>, 908 F.2d at 576.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since Sunday premium pay is a pay practice, and under section 704(b) a pay practice is negotiable only if the practice is a currently prevailing pay practice, Sunday premium pay is not negotiable unless it is a currently prevailing practice. The Union contends that the Authority erred in finding that Sunday premium pay is not currently a prevailing practice. The Union argues that the Authority should not have relied solely upon the pay practices of Southern California Edison ("SCE") and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power ("LADWP") in determining whether Sunday premium pay is a currently prevailing practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Yakima</span>, 887 F.2d at 176, we explained that the "determination of prevailing rates and practices involves the negotiation of ground rules and methodology for determining prevailing rates and practices. Once these negotiations are concluded and the data obtained, the prevailing rates and practices are a matter of factual inquiry." The Authority is responsible for making that factual inquiry. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union and the Bureau agreed to use the LADWP's and SCE's practices as bases for determining prevailing rates and practices. Neither LADWP nor SCE currently provides Sunday premium pay. The Authority therefore concluded that "Sunday premium pay is not 'among the current practices in the industry[ ]' for purposes of section 704(b)." 36 F.L.R.A. No. 1 at 6. This finding was made in the manner specified in <span class="Italic">Yakima</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since Sunday premium pay is a pay practice that is not a currently prevailing pay practice, it is not negotiable. Therefore, we hold that the Bureau did not commit an unfair labor practice when it refused to negotiate Sunday premium pay.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the 1992 <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1978</span> decision, FLRA attempted to summarize some of the burgeoning law concerning the interpretation of &#x00A7; 704 in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Dams Project Office and IBEW Local 640</span>, 41 FLRA 119, 127-32 (1991), allowing enforcement in arbitration of a negotiated provision concerning Sunday premium pay and ruling unlawful an agency's unilateral termination of a pay premium:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 704(b) "serves to 'grandfather-in' bargaining rights for prevailing rate employees with respect to...non-negotiable pay provisions reserved to agency regulation." <span class="Italic">United States Information Agency v. FLRA</span>, 895 F.2d 1449, 1451 (D.C. Cir. 1990).... Section 704(b) modifies the scope of bargaining established in subsection 704(a) with respect to the specific category of terms and conditions of employment described as "pay and pay practices." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA</span>, 110 S. Ct. 2043, 2045-49 (1990) (matters concerning the pay and benefits of employees are related to "conditions of employment" within the meaning of the Statute). Section 704(b) sets the parameters for bargaining on pay and pay practices for agencies and prevailing rate employees covered by section 704.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">USIA v. FLRA</span>, the court held that "[w]hen the subject of negotiation is 'pay and pay practices,'...negotiability may depend on current prevailing practices in the industry." <span class="Italic">USIA v. FLRA</span>, 895 F.2d at 1454 (emphasis omitted). The court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[I]f a pay practice is not among the current industry practices in the industry, the parties may not negotiate over that subject.... But if the pay practice has <span class="Italic">some</span> place in current industry practice, then the parties must negotiate over the subject and subsection 704(b) functions as a restriction on the permissible outcome of negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1455 (emphasis in original). We adopted the court's interpretation of section 704(b) in <span class="Italic">Boulder City</span>, 36 FLRA at 7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 704(b), prevailing rate employees who negotiated rates of pay and pay practices in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972, may negotiate current pay and pay practices only in accordance with current prevailing rates and practices in the industry. That is, under section 704(b), current prevailing practices in the industry determine whether and the extent to which section 704 prevailing rate employees may bargain concerning a specific pay practice....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For purposes of section 704(b), "pay practices" are matters historically considered to be part of an employee's compensation package, such as: (1) adjustments to an employee's basic rate of pay; (2) matters concerning the payment of differentials, overtime, and premiums; and (3) any other general compensation policies that entered into and became a part of the employee's total compensation package....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency states that under section 704, "[i]f the pay practice is not currently prevailing in the industry, the parties may not negotiate over that pay practice."... The Agency argues that because the parties have stipulated that Sunday premium pay is not currently prevailing among the five companies listed in the parties' agreement, it is not prevailing in the industry and, therefore, "Sunday premium pay is not authorized or valid under section 704."... The Agency asserts that it was required to terminate the payment of Sunday premium pay because Sunday premium pay is not a currently prevailing practice in the industry.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we understand it, the Agency's position is that the Sunday premium pay provision in the parties' agreement is unenforceable because the provision does not reflect the prevailing practice which currently exists in the industry. The question raised by the Agency's contention is whether section 704 renders the pay and pay practice provisions of a collective bargaining agreement unenforceable if those provisions are not consistent with "current" prevailing practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties' stipulation that the five companies used for determining prevailing rates and practices do not currently pay Sunday premium pay does not relieve the Agency of its obligation to pay Sunday premium pay in accordance with the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Although the current prevailing practices are relevant to determine whether parties "shall" <span class="Italic">negotiate</span> pay and pay practices under section 704(b), they have no effect on the pay and pay practice provisions of an existing collective bargaining agreement. Once the parties have negotiated a lawful agreement concerning pay and pay practices, the parties are bound by the terms of their agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find nothing in section 704(b) or the Statute as a whole to support the proposition that section 704 either requires or permits agencies to unilaterally terminate an existing agreed-upon pay practice under section 704 because of an alleged change in prevailing industry practices. Section 704(b) does not operate to void a provision of a collective bargaining agreement that is not in accordance with current prevailing practices.... Rather, section 704 qualifies the obligation to bargain over provisions in the first instance. A provision is not rendered unlawful by a change in the prevailing rates and practices during the life of a collective bargaining agreement, however.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our conclusion in this regard is consistent with the long established principle in labor law that a party to a valid collective bargaining agreement, as a general rule, cannot make unilateral mid-term alterations to that agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at hand, there is a currently existing contract provision covering Sunday premium pay for these grievants which the Agency is seeking to terminate. Therefore, <span class="Italic">Boulder City</span> provides no support for the Agency's unilateral mid-term termination of the Sunday premium pay provision in the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Statute Does Not Render the Award Deficient</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">"The plain meaning of [section 704(a) of the CSRA] is that it exempts provisions of specified collective bargaining agreements from the limitations on the scope of bargaining set forth in the Statute[.]"... Further, section 704(b) specifically provides for the negotiation of the pay and pay practices of prevailing rate employees without regard to any provision of chapter 71 of title 5 (the Statute) "to the extent that any such provision is inconsistent with [section 704]." Thus, parties who negotiate under section 704 may agree to contract provisions concerning terms and conditions of employment and pay and pay practices, notwithstanding that such provisions might otherwise conflict with the Statute. Because section 704 preserves the parties' right to negotiate on certain matters that might otherwise be in conflict with the Statute, a provision in a collective bargaining agreement that was negotiated consistent with section 704 is enforceable in arbitration despite any inconsistency with the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that although the subsections of section 7103 of the Statute cited by the Agency are applicable to the parties' collective bargaining relationship, those subsections do not render the award deficient. Under section 704 of the CSRA, the Sunday premium pay provision of the collective bargaining agreement is enforceable in arbitration despite any inconsistency with the Statute. We conclude that the Agency's contention that the award is inconsistent with certain subsections of section 7103 of the Statute provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Arbitrator found that the parties negotiated over the subject of Sunday premium pay and that the parties executed the Supplementary Wage Schedules that included a provision for Sunday premium pay.&#x2003;In our opinion, those negotiations constituted "collective bargaining" within the meaning of section 7103(a)(12) and the Supplementary Wage Schedules executed by the parties constitute a "collective bargaining agreement" within the meaning of section 7103(a)(8). Further, the Agency's argument that proposals concerning <span id="page_942"></span>the benefits of Federal employees who are not provided those benefits under statute do not relate to "conditions of employment" within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute, is without merit. The Authority has consistently held that, to the extent matters concerning employee compensation are not provided for by statute, those matters are related to conditions of employment and, therefore, are within the duty to bargain....</p>
<p class="noindent">As to coverage of the Reform Act provision permitting negotiation of wage rates that could be negotiated before enactment of that statute, continuing negotiation of prevailing rate employees' wages was made more difficult by <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior v. FLRA</span>, 870 F.2d 554, 555-57 (9th Cir. 1989), commenting on the "savings clause" of the Reform Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This statutory scheme for the payment of prevailing wage employees is intersected by the...Reform Act.... This comprehensive statute...provides at &#x00A7; 704(a) for the negotiation of the terms and conditions of employment of prevailing rate employees in the following language:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Those terms and conditions of employment and other employment benefits with respect to Government prevailing rate employees to whom section 9(b) of Public Law 92-392 applies which were the subject of negotiation in accordance with prevailing rates and practices prior to August 19, 1972, shall be negotiated on and after the date of the enactment of this Act in accordance with the provisions of section 9(b)...without regard to any provision of chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code (as amended by this title), to the extent that any such provision is inconsistent with this paragraph.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 704(b) goes on to state that negotiation of "pay and pay practices"--one type of the "terms and conditions of employment" referred to in subsection (a)--is exempted from the operation of certain statutes and regulations governing employees whose pay is fixed administratively....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The central question is this: When the Civil Service Reform Act &#x00A7; 704(a) says that a matter is negotiable if it has been "the subject of negotiations," does the statute mean that if wages had been negotiated in the past <span class="Italic">any</span> matter relating to wages is negotiable in the future?...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An untutored layman might think that wages were the subject matter in this way and so this result would be appropriate.&#x2003;Congress, however, has not treated the wages of federal employees as a simple uniform topic. A variety of federal wages exist that are specifically treated as separate subjects by Congress, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, merit pay, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5402; Sunday and holiday pay, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5547; retroactive pay, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5349. Given this way of legislating, it is a perversion of the statute to interpret it as saying that since wages were once negotiated, any and all wage increases are open to negotiation in the future. What is critical is the kind of wages that were the subject of previous bargaining. Save pay provisions were not such a subject for these parties. For this reason, the Authority's order was arbitrary and not in accordance with the law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition the Authority acted contrary to law in determining the parties were to negotiate what the prevailing rates are.&#x2003;The prevailing rates are a matter of factual inquiry. This is the assumption of the statute creating the Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5347(e). It is a Pickwickian or Alice in Wonderland idea that what is a factual matter should be negotiated--somewhat like the idea that you negotiate the sum of two and two. It is the job of the Authority to provide leadership, not to give up its role and turn over to bargaining an issue the Authority must determine factually....</p>

A pay cap was found inapplicable to these employees. Members of crews of vessels were exempted from statutory pay provisions. The pay scheme called for private sector comparability if the agency head determined that comparability is in the public interest. The discretion vested in the agency head made the matter negotiable. 5 USC 5348(a). FLRA distinguished its earlier holding in <span class="Italic">Nat'l Maritime Union and Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, Rockville</span>, 15 FLRA 576, 576-77 (1984). <span class="Italic">Nat'l Maritime Union and Dept. of Navy, Military Sealift Command</span>, 25 FLRA 105, 109 (1987), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Military Sealift Command v. FLRA</span>, 836 F.2d 1409, 1414-15 (3d Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">post</span>. A union could require negotiations as to a proposal that the agency exercise its discretion under the former FPM Chapter 531 to set the rate of basic pay for prevailing rate employees in a fair and even-handed manner when rehiring former employees. Proposals relating to pay concern conditions of employment when they benefit former employees only if and when they are reemployed in unit positions. <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 4 and Dept. of Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span>, 15 FLRA 802, 802-03 (1984). A proposal involving a prevailing rate employer that required payment of employees at a higher rate if a work crew was reduced below a set number was nonnegotiable. The proposal interfered with the discretion of the agency to determine the numbers and types of employees to assign to a work project or tour of duty. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Maritime Union and Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, Rockville</span>, 15 FLRA 576, 579 (1984).</p>
