<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-157"><span class="space">A.</span> SENIOR EXECUTIVE SERVICE</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board adjudicates few Senior Executive Service (SES) cases. Some early appeals involving individuals who had a regulatory right to secure MSPB review of nonconversion to SES are in Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-211.html#sec1-209">Pay System Conversion; Grade Reduction.</a>" Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-055.html#sec8-56">SES Employee</a>," includes decisions involving refusals of SES members to accept their reassignments . Appeal rights for SES members depend upon career status, prior civil service tenure, and other conditions described by statute and regulations. [Refer to Broida and Davis's <span class="Italic">Senior Executive Service Legal Guide</span> (Dewey Publications, Inc. 2009), and refer to OPM <span class="Italic">Guide to the Senior Executive Service</span> (March 2017_ <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive-service/reference-materials/guidesesservices.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive-service/reference-materials/guidesesservices.pdf</a>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Esparraguera v. Dept. of Army,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20201204139">981 F.3d 1328</a>, 1329-31 (Fed. Cir. 2020), described the SES:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The federal civil service is divided into three parts: the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service ("SES"). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2101a, 2102, 2103; <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 441 n.1 (1988). This case concerns whether the Board can review the performance-based removal of employees from the SES.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because SES cases are rare, a brief background on the SES itself is useful.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ("CSRA") reformed the federal civil service and "established a comprehensive system for reviewing personnel action[s] taken against federal employees." <span class="Italic">Elgin v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 567 U.S. 1, 5 (2012) (quoting <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 455); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111. The SES was designed to "provide the flexibility needed by agencies to recruit and retain the highly competent and qualified executives needed to provide more effective management of agencies and their functions, and the more expeditious administration of the public business." CSRA, sec. 3(6), 92 Stat. at 1113. The statutory framework governing the SES is meant to "ensure that the executive management of the Government of the United States is responsive to the needs, policies, and goals of the Nation and otherwise is of the highest quality." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3131. And its administration is meant to "enable the head of an agency to reassign senior executives to best accomplish the agency's mission," to "maintain a merit personnel system free of prohibited personnel practices," and to "ensure accountability for honest, economical, and efficient Government." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 3131(5), (9), (10).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Senior executives are high-level federal employees who do not require presidential appointment but who nonetheless exercise significant responsibility--including directing organizational units, supervising work, and determining policy--and who may be held accountable for their projects or programs. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 3132(a)(2); <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 441 n.1. Occupying significant positions of trust, senior executives are selected, in no small part, for their leadership abilities.[1] The SES is but a small arm of the federal civil service: about 8,000 federal employees are among the SES, whereas more than 1.8 million are not.[2]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">There are two relevant mechanisms by which senior executives may be removed from the SES. First, senior executives may be removed--not only from the SES but from federal employment entirely--for "misconduct, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or failure to accept a directed reassignment or to accompany a position in a transfer of function." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7543(a). This pathway to removal includes procedural protections like those available for covered employees in the competitive and excepted services. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7543(b), (d); <span class="Italic">cf. id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512, 7513. Second, senior executives may be removed from the SES under another set of procedures for "unsatisfactory" or "less than fully successful" performance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3592(a), 4314(a)(3). Senior executives with "career" status who are removed in this way are guaranteed continued federal employment at the same pay grade. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 3594. The loss of SES status, however, is accompanied by the loss of other benefits--and, of course, prestige. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3131(1), 5384, 6304(f).</p>

The appointee shall submit the request for an informal hearing to the Board. This request may be made at any time after the appointee has received the notice described in paragraph (a) of this section, but no later than 15 days before the effective date of action.

<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;The appointee, the appointee's representative, or both may appear and present arguments in an informal hearing before the judge. A verbatim record of the proceeding will be made. The appointee has no other procedural rights before the judge or the Board.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">There are not many informal SES MSPB hearings. No decisions guide the process. The AJ allows the (former) SES member to make a statement or testify on the record. Comments may be made by the representative. There is nothing to prevent examination or cross-examination of witnesses, but there is nothing in the regulation requiring a formal hearing process. Probably the reason there are so few informal hearings is because there is no adjudication, only a record provided to the appellant, to the employing agency, OSC and OPM. There is no decision showing that OSC or OPM took action following an informal hearing. Why go through the trouble of an informal hearing? It gives the former SES member an opportunity to have his official say on his performance. The informal hearing request places the matter before an AJ, and that may open up the opportunity for discussion among the AJ, counsel, agency management, and the former SES member concerning settlement (there may be, in addition to the informal hearing request, an EEO complaint or an OSC complaint).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 752.602 <span class="Italic">Definitions.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this subpart--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Career appointee, limited term appointee, and limited emergency appointee</span> have the meaning given in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Day</span> means calendar day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Suspension</span> has the meaning given in 5 U.S.C. 7501(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 752.603 <span class="Italic">Standard for action and penalty determination</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An agency may take an adverse action under this subpart only for reasons of misconduct, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or failure to accept a directed reassignment or to accompany a position in a transfer of function.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An agency may not take an adverse action under this subpart on the basis of any reason prohibited by 5 U.S.C. 2302.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;An agency is not required to use progressive discipline under this subpart. The penalty for an instance of misconduct should be tailored to the facts and circumstances. In making a determination regarding the appropriate penalty for an instance of misconduct, an agency shall adhere to the standard of proposing and imposing a penalty that is within the bounds of tolerable reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Employees should be treated equitably. Conduct that justifies discipline of one employee at one time does not necessarily justify similar discipline of a different employee at a different time. An agency should consider appropriate comparators as the agency evaluates a potential disciplinary action. Appropriate comparators to be considered are primarily individuals in the same work unit, with the same supervisor, who engaged in the same or similar misconduct. Proposing and deciding officials are not bound by previous decisions in earlier similar cases, but should, as they deem appropriate, consider such decisions consonant with their own managerial authority and responsibilities and independent judgment. For example, a supervisor is not bound by his or her predecessor whenever there is similar conduct. A minor indiscretion for one supervisor based on a particular set of facts can amount to a more serious offense under a different supervisor. Nevertheless, they should be able to articulate why a more or less severe penalty is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;Among other relevant factors, agencies should consider an employee's disciplinary record and past work record, including all applicable prior misconduct, when taking an action under this subpart.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;A suspension or reduction in grade or pay should not be a substitute for removal in circumstances in which removal would be appropriate. Agencies should not require that an employee have previously been suspended or reduced in pay or grade before a proposing official may propose removal, except as may be appropriate under applicable facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 752.604 <span class="Italic">Procedures</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Statutory entitlements.</span> An appointee against whom action is proposed under this subpart is entitled to the procedures provided in 5 U.S.C. 7543(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Notice of proposed action.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;An appointee against whom an action is proposed is entitled to at least 30 days' advance written notice unless there is an exception pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section. The notice must state the specific reason(s) for the proposed action and inform the appointee of his or her right to review the material that is relied on to support the reasons for action given in the notice. The notice must further include detailed information with respect to any right to appeal the action pursuant to section 1097(b)(2)(A) of Public Law 115-91, the forums in which the employee may file an appeal, and any limitations on the rights of the employee that would apply because of the forum in which the employee decides to file.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Under ordinary circumstances, an appointee whose removal has been proposed will remain in a duty status in his or her regular position during the advance notice period. In those rare circumstances where the agency determines that the appointee's continued presence in the work place during the notice period may pose a threat to the appointee or others, result in loss of or damage to Government property, or otherwise jeopardize legitimate Government interests, the agency may elect one or a combination of the following alternatives:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;Assigning the appointee to duties where he or she is no longer a threat to safety, the agency mission, or Government property;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Allowing the appointee to take leave, or carrying him or her in an appropriate leave status (annual, sick, leave without pay, or absence without leave) if the appointee has absented himself or herself from the worksite without requesting leave;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;Curtailing the notice period when the agency can invoke the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iv)&#x2003;Placing the appointee in a paid, no duty status for such time as is necessary to effect the action. After publication of regulations for 5 U.S.C. 6329b, and the subsequent agency implementation period in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 6329b, an agency may place the employee in a notice leave status when applicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appointee's answer.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The appointee may answer orally and in writing except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The agency must give the appointee a reasonable amount of official time to review the material relied on to support its proposed action, to prepare an answer orally and in writing, and to secure affidavits, if the appointee is in an active duty status. The agency may require the appointee to furnish any answer to the proposed action, and affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer, within such time as would be reasonable, but not less than 7 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The agency will designate an official to hear the appointee's oral answer who has authority either to make or to recommend a final decision on the proposed adverse action. The right to answer orally in person does not include the right to a formal hearing with examination of witnesses unless the agency provides for such hearing in its regulations. Under 5 U.S.C. 7543(c), the agency may in its regulations provide a hearing in place of or in addition to the opportunity for written and oral answer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;If the appointee wishes the agency to consider any medical condition that may have affected the basis for the adverse action, the appointee must be given reasonable time to furnish medical documentation (as defined in &#x00A7; 339.104 of this chapter) of the condition. Whenever possible, the appointee will supply such documentation within the time limits allowed for an answer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exception</span>. Section 7543(b)(1) of title 5, U.S. Code, authorizes an exception to the 30 days' advance written notice when the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the appointee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed and is proposing a removal or suspension. This notice exception is commonly referred to as the "crime provision." This provision may be invoked even in the absence of judicial action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Representation</span>. Section 7543(b)(3) of title 5, U.S. Code, provides that an appointee covered by this part is entitled to be represented <span id="Page_2219"></span>by an attorney or other representative. An agency may disallow as an appointee's representative an individual whose activities as representative would cause a conflict of interest or position, or an employee of the agency whose release from his or her official position would give rise to unreasonable costs or whose priority work assignments preclude his or her release.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Agency review of medical information</span>. When medical information is supplied by the appointee pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the agency may, if authorized, require a medical examination under the criteria of &#x00A7; 339.301 of this chapter, or otherwise, at its option, offer a medical examination in accordance with the criteria of &#x00A7; 339.302 of this chapter. If the appointee has the requisite years of service under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees' Retirement System, the agency must provide information concerning disability retirement. The agency must be aware of the affirmative obligations of the provisions of 29 CFR 1614.203, which require reasonable accommodation of a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Agency decision</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;In arriving at its decision, the agency will consider only the reasons specified in the notice of proposed action and any answer of the appointee or the appointee's representative, or both, made to a designated official and any medical documentation reviewed under paragraph (f) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The notice must specify in writing the reasons for the decision and advise the appointee of any appeal rights under &#x00A7; 752.605 of this part. The agency must deliver the notice of decision to the appointee on or before the effective date of the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(h)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Applications for disability retirement</span>. Section 831.1204(e) of this chapter provides that an appointee's application for disability retirement need not delay any other appropriate personnel action. Section 831.1205 and &#x00A7; 844.202 of this chapter set forth the basis under which an agency must file an application for disability retirement on behalf of an appointee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 752.605 <span class="Italic">Appeal rights</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Under 5 U.S.C. 7543(d), a career appointee against whom an action is taken under this subpart is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A limited term or limited emergency appointee who is covered under &#x00A7; 752.601(c)(2) also may appeal an action taken under this subpart to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Under statutory provisions in effect before 2003, if an SES member was removed for failure to be recertified, the Board appeal was conducted in accordance with 5 CFR 359.304 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Removal under this subpart is appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board under 5 USC 7701. Under 5 USC 7701(c)(1)(A), the decision of the agency shall be sustained if it is supported by substantial evidence, which is defined in the Board's regulations at 5 CFR 1201.56(c) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(p)]. The burden is on the agency to show that there is substantial evidence to support its action. Once such substantial evidence is demonstrated, the burden shifts to the appellant to refute the agency's case that there was substantial evidence or to make a demonstration under 5 USC 7701(c)(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ordinarily, the nature of the Board's jurisdiction over actions against SES members depends on whether the action is for poor performance or for misconduct, a distinction alluded to in <span class="Italic">Foster v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 21 MSPR 197, 198-200 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the presiding official noted that two separate statutory subchapters cover agency actions against SES employees. Title 5 USC &#x00A7; 3592 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> with its implementing regulations at 5 CFR Part 359, applies to actions based on unsatisfactory performance. It does not provide for appellate review by the Board but guarantees placement in a civil service position of at least a grade GS-15 and makes provision for an informal hearing before the Board. Title 5 USC &#x00A7; 7541 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> with its implementing regulations at 5 CFR Part 752, Subpart F, applies to actions based on misconduct. It provides for the Board's appellate review of the agency's action but does not contain a provision guaranteeing placement in another non-SES civil service position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he record shows that the agency was not unaware of the performance-based requirements but rather that it consciously structured appellant's removal as based on alleged misconduct and accordingly followed the statutory and regulatory procedures for such a misconduct-based action.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Further, as the parties point out in these petitions, performance-based actions against career SES executives may be taken only for less than fully successful executive performance as determined under Subchapter II of Chapter 43 of Title 5 of the United States Code, with 5 USC &#x00A7; 4314(b)(3) and (4) providing for the discretionary removal of any SES executive who has received an unsatisfactory performance rating and the mandatory removal of any executive who has received two unsatisfactory ratings in any period of five consecutive years or two performance ratings of less than fully successful in any period of three consecutive years. As the parties note, appellant never received a performance rating of unsatisfactory or minimally satisfactory and his ratings for 1980 and 1981 were fully successful or higher.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we find the agency's actions are misconduct-based and subject to the Board's appellate jurisdiction.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In so holding, we note that a determination of whether such misconduct actually occurred cannot be made prior to adjudication on the merits. Further, by finding the charges are misconduct-based, we do not limit any argument that appellant may wish to make concerning past actions by the agency showing that it viewed the charged conduct as representing only an aspect of appellant's performance which did not rise to the level of actionable misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2220"></span><span class="Italic">Berube v. GSA</span>, 30 MSPR 581, 584-85 (1986) (remanded, Berube v. GSA, 820 F.2d 396 (Fed. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">post</span>), described the evolution of the SES and the nature of removal actions affecting SES employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...One of the major purposes of the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) was the creation of the SES corps of elite senior executives whose mission was to improve the management of the Federal government. Because Congress saw a critical need to recruit and develop the highest quality of Federal executives, it created a government-wide system "for selecting, preparing, advancing, and managing the men and women who administer the programs that affect every person in the Nation."... Under that system, most senior positions in grades GS-16 through Executive Grade IV were assigned to the newly created SES, for which Congress provided evaluation procedures and bonus and removal provisions separate from those applying to other government employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the removal provisions, Congress drew a clear distinction between the effects of removals taken for poor performance and removals accomplished through disciplinary procedures. By virtue of 5 USC 3594, senior executives removed for poor performance were guaranteed placement in continuing positions at the GS-15 level, or higher, of the General Schedule. Conversely, senior executives who were subject to disciplinary actions, taken in accordance with 5 USC 7543, could be removed from the civil service and were not guaranteed placement in General Schedule positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Congress, in 1981, enacted special RIF protections for career senior executives which provided them with an entitlement to mandatory consideration for available and appropriate SES positions through the Government. 5 USC 3395 (1981). In 1984 Congress further provided that, if no such reassignment were possible, career senior executives affected by a RIF would be guaranteed placement in General Schedule positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In discussing the 1981 changes, the House Committee on the Budget stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Legal arguments aside, common sense leads to the conclusion that a career executive should not be removed from Government service simply because his or her agency suffered a reduction in force or reorganization. If this were the case, there would be a system under which a marginal or poor performer is guaranteed a job as a result of "fall back rights," but an outstanding performer caught in a reorganization could be forced to leave Government service. This is an absurdity....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the same time that Congress enacted specific RIF protections to avoid that "absurdity," it amended section 7543 in order "to insure compliance with the congressional intent" that the adverse action procedures were to be used solely for disciplinary actions.... Congress replaced the "efficiency of the service" standard originally contained in that section with a provision that an SES member could be removed under Chapter 75 procedures only for "misconduct, neglect of duty or malfeasance." In 1984, that new standard, which is <span class="Italic">sui generis</span> to the SES and not found elsewhere in Chapter 75, was further amended to allow removals for failure to accept a directed reassignment or to accompany a position in a transfer of function.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The question presented in <span class="Italic">Berube</span> was whether, if ever, a case involving poor performance can be handled as a misconduct case, allowing removal rather than demotion of the appellant. Following the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (discussed under <a href="0100-2023-16-080.html#sec9-79"><span class="Italic">"Lovshin</span>; Combined Action Under Chapters 75 and 43</a>" in Chapter 9), the Board determined, by analogy to <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span>, 30 MSPR at 587:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Ordinarily, a senior executive's poor performance should be handled under the provisions of Chapters 43 and 35, which provide senior executives with guaranteed "fall back" rights. However, where performance-related charges can correctly be characterized as misconduct or malfeasance in performance--such as situations involving insubordination or actions intended to adversely affect performance--agencies are not precluded from proceeding under section 7543. We discern no intent in the CSRA, even as amended, to protect a senior executive from the consequences of performance-related misconduct. However, since sustained charges under section 7543 can support removal of senior executives from the civil service, while actions taken under Chapter 43 cannot, the Board will, in order to enforce the protections provided by Congress, carefully examine whether the agency was justified in treating a performance-related offense as actionable misconduct, neglect of duty or malfeasance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Returning to the facts of <span class="Italic">Berube</span>, the Board noted that the appellant was acting regional administrator of the GSA in Washington and that his removal was essentially for insubordination, deliberate disruption, and neglect of duties. The Board considered that although the appellant was contentious and had an aggressive style of management, and although he resisted policy changes, e.g., personnel reductions, he did not refuse to do his work. The Board felt that "responsible management requires that senior executives not be discouraged from voicing objections to policies they view as unwise." But during the time that the appellant was on a detail as Assistant Commissioner of Buildings Management, the appellant's resistance to his new position and related assignments were intentionally disruptive; in essence, the Board concluded he did little productive work and instead delegated his principal job responsibilities. This the Board characterized as wrongful neglect of duties: "An employee may not, out of anger or disagreement over a manager's decision, willfully fail to perform his official duties."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After considering other charges and a whistleblowing defense [discussed concerning the <span class="Italic">Berube</span> case at greater length in Chapter 13 under "<a href="0100-2023-20-222.html#sec13-214">Severity of Charged Misconduct</a>"], the Board sustained the discharge of Mr. Berube. As to mitigation, the Board reviewed various <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and found the long service to be outweighed by the established misconduct. The Vice Chairman of the Board, Ms. Johnson, dissented, arguing that there was sufficient evidence of reprisal against Berube's protected speech to warrant a finding that his removal amounted to a prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Berube</span> was reviewed by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Berube v. GSA</span>, 820 F.2d 396, 398-99 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The Board's position on the performance/misconduct issue was sustained by the court, although the case was ultimately remanded to the Board for further consideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When it amended section 7543, Congress limited the bases for removal under the section. Prior to the amendment, an agency could remove an <span id="Page_2221"></span>employee under section 7543 for "such cause as [would] promote the efficiency of the service." After the amendment, an agency may remove an employee "only for misconduct, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or failure to accept a directed reassignment or to accompany a position in a transfer of function." Berube argues that the amendment effectively eliminates from the scope of employee acts covered by section 7543 <span class="Italic">all</span> performance related acts that could serve as a basis for removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Berube's argument simply goes too far. It seems obvious that an employee's actions or inaction related to his job performance may or may not amount to misconduct, neglect of duty, or malfeasance depending on the circumstance. When they do not, the agency must proceed under section 3592. When they do, the agency may proceed under section 7543. Even the MSPB, when it, in <span class="Italic">Gende</span>, found an implied limitation on the grounds for removal under section 7513, did not go so far as to say that a performance based action could <span class="Italic">never</span> serve as the basis for removal under Chapter 75. Rather, it recognized that an agency could bring such cases under Chapter 75 when the employee's conduct amounted to misconduct (which included misconduct on the job) or insubordination.... Nothing in the plain language of the statutes suggests that Congress intended to restrict the meaning of "misconduct, neglect of duty, [or] malfeasance" by excluding from the ordinary meaning of those terms acts related to an employee's job performance. Such a limitation is absurd, for it would sanction the most egregious misconduct by making the maximum allowable penalty removal from the SES to the civil service. While Congress intended such a limitation of penalty for simple inability to perform, it certainly did not so limit an agency's choice of penalties in response to the conduct described in section 7543. The statutes do not insulate an employee from the penalties provided in Chapter 75 because his acts of misconduct, neglect of duty, or malfeasance occurred in the context of performing his job. Thus, we hold that the Board did not err in concluding that GSA could remove Berube under Chapter 75 for conduct that was related to his job performance because the conduct rose to the level of misconduct, neglect of duty or malfeasance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Berube</span>, the court provided some guidance as to penalty selection for SES members accused under a misconduct statute that did not then permit the Board to mitigate a penalty (a result changed through statutory amendment, discussed in the next section), 820 F.2d at 399-400:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]t was also the Board's responsibility to determine whether the agency's decision was supported by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 USC 7701(c)(1)(B). The Board may not discharge that responsibility merely by finding that the individual charges were proved by a preponderance of the evidence, nor by determining that the agency "could have" brought a removal action under section 7543 based upon the sustained charges. We hold that the Board must determine whether the agency has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that it "would have" brought the action under section 7543 based upon the sustained charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a non-SES employee is removed under section 7513 for misconduct, the Board considers whether the agency has proved the charges. It next considers whether the penalty of removal is appropriate in the sense that the penalty is not arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion and that the penalty is reasonably calculated to promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 326-30 (1981). As an aid to determining the appropriateness of the penalty selected by the agency, the Board considers the relevant factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. If, in light of the relevant factors, the Board determines that the sustained charges warrant the penalty imposed, the Board concludes that the agency's decision with respect to both charges and penalty is supported by a preponderance of the evidence as required by 5 USC 7701(c)(1)(B)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Determining that an agency's decision to remove or suspend an SES employee under section 7543 is supported by a preponderance of the evidence requires a different procedure. Unlike section 7513, section 7543 no longer contains the requirement that the agency may take adverse action "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." Congress apparently substituted a misconduct standard for the efficiency of the service standard with the intent of restricting the availability of removal under section 7543 in the event of a reduction-in-force affecting SES employees.... In <span class="Italic">Lisiecki v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 769 F.2d 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1985), this court compared the Board's procedures for reviewing removal actions against non-SES employees taken under Chapter 43 and Chapter 75. The court held that in Chapter 43 cases the Board lacked the authority to mitigate the penalty selected by the agency.... Because section 7543 does not incorporate an efficiency of the service standard, the Board may not mitigate the penalty selected by the agency in adverse actions under this section. There is no possibility of the Board reducing the penalty if some of the charges against the employee are not sustained. Consequently, if only some of the charges against the employee are sustained, it may be that although the sustained charges could have been the basis for removal under section 7543, the agency would not have sought removal under section 7543 based on those charges alone. In such cases, the decision to remove the employee under section 7543 would not be supported by a preponderance of the evidence as required by 5 USC 7701(c)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nowhere in the Board's opinion does it address or apply this legal standard. Thus, we remand this case to the Board to determine, based on the existing record, whether the agency has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have removed Berube under section 7543 based solely on the sustained charges.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the history of the <span class="Italic">Berube</span> litigation on remand, and Berube's eventual victory, refer to <span class="Italic">Berube v. GSA</span>, 37 MSPR 448, 449-51 (1988). The court reemphasized that considerations pertaining to penalties against SES members do not necessarily apply to individuals who are not in the SES. <span class="Italic">Chapman v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3239).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Foster v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 31 MSPR 74, 79 (1986), involved an SES regional administrator charged with misconduct in performance stemming from his hiring of four construction specialists. The agency charged that the appellant abused his delegated appointment authority and that he breached his fiduciary responsibilities as to the travel and per diem expenses that he approved for the specialists prior to their reassignments to the appellant's office. The Board noted the <span class="Italic">Berube</span> holding: ordinarily agencies should handle performance problems of SES members to protect the fall back rights of the employee. The charge against the appellant involved an accusation that he had circumvented competitive hiring procedures to quickly bring on board the construction specialists whose services were badly needed in his region. Appellant received prior assurance from the agency personnel staff that it would be proper to hire the employees in the manner he used. The problem was noted in the appellant's performance evaluation and, the Board concluded, should have been treated as a performance rather than a disciplinary problem. The charge concerning travel and per diem expenses was related to training ordered for the newly hired employees. The Board found no dishonest motive or misconduct in the expenses incurred as to training and concluded that "a senior executive's errors in judgment which resulted from a legitimate misunderstanding of personnel requirements do not warrant the imposition of disciplinary measures under 5 USC 7543."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Misconduct charges against SES members will be treated with regard to the interpretation of what constitutes actionable misconduct for General Schedule or Wage Grade (prevailing rate) employees. The statute does not require that misconduct by an SES member be intentional to be actionable, as with charges involving misuse of a government credit card, <span class="Italic">Baracker v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 70 MSPR 594, 598-602 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to its amendment in 1981, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7543(a) provided that "an agency may take an action...against an [SES] employee only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7543(a) (West 1980). In 1981, Congress amended the above provision to state "an agency may take an action...against an [SES] employee only for misconduct, neglect of duty, [or] malfeasance...." Pub. L. No. 97-35, 95 Stat. 757, 758 (1981). At the time of the 1981 amendment, Congress also created certain reduction in force (RIF) and reinstatement rights for SES employees that had not previously existed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3593, 3595.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Berube v. General Services Administration</span>, 30 MSPR 581, 584-85 (1986), <span class="Italic">vacated on other grounds</span>, 820 F.2d 396 (Fed. Cir. 1987), we summarized some of the legislative history behind the 1981 amendment. Congress created the SES as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, providing for both SES adverse actions accomplished through disciplinary procedures and for SES performance actions<span class="Italic">. Berube,</span> 30 MSPR at 584; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3594, 7543. In order to avoid the issuance of regulations proposed by the Office of Personnel Management which would have permitted SES employees affected by a RIF to be separated from Federal service under the "efficiency of the service" standard set forth in the adverse action statute, in 1981, Congress enacted special RIF rights for career SES employees. The House Committee on the Budget stated with regard to the 1981 statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[Congress] amended section 7543 in order "to insure compliance with the congressional intent" that the adverse action procedures were to be used solely for disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Berube,</span> 30 MSPR at 585, quoting H.R. Rep. No. 158, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 54 (1981), USCCAN 396, 444. The House Conference Committee that discussed the amendment only briefly mentioned the changes to section 7543, stating that the changes were "to ensure the procedures therein relating to removal or suspension of career appointees are limited to cases involving disciplinary action." H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 208, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 653, 915 (1981), <span class="Italic">reprinted</span> in 1981 USCCAN 1010, 1277.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is thus apparent from the legislative history that the amendment to section 7543 was part of Congress's stated intent to provide specific statutory RIF rights for SES employees. By amending section 7543 to provide for removals or suspensions of SES employees only for "misconduct, neglect of duty, or malfeasance...," Congress clarified that the SES adverse action procedures set forth in chapter 75 would be applied only to disciplinary action cases, and not to RIF cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress did not define the terms "discipline" or "disciplinary action." However, nothing in the statute or in the legislative history indicates that Congress intended to depart from the existing notion of the term "discipline" as it had been understood. Since its inception, the Board has upheld disciplinary actions of employees for both intentional and unintentional misconduct. Whether an agency must prove intent as part of its case in chief depends, not on the status of the employee being disciplined, but on the nature of the charge. If an agency charges an employee with willful or intentional misconduct, then the agency must prove willfulness or intent for its charge to be sustained.[1] Some charges, such as falsification, require proof of intent by virtue of the nature of the charge itself.[2] Other charges do not require proof of intent to be sustained.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Corley v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 4 MSPR 338, 341, 344 (1980) (where the agency charged the employee with "willful misconduct" in the Performance of his Air Traffic Control Specialist duties, the agency was required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee acted with intentional disregard for the safety of others by one who has a duty to protect that safety).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Cadena v. Department of Justice</span>, 3 MSPR 304, 308 (1980) (a charge of falsification can only be sustained upon a finding of intent to deceive or mislead).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Murray v. Department of the Army</span>, 40 MSPR 250, 255 (1989) (charge of creating a disturbance in the workplace through rude remarks and impolite acts does not require a showing of intent); <span class="Italic">Ayers v. Department of Transportation</span>, 17 MSPR 251, 255-56 (1983) (<span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of strike participation does not require proof of intent under <span class="Italic">Schapansky v. Department of Transportation</span>, 13 MSPR 589, 593 n.2 (1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 735 F.2d 477 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 469 U.S. 1018, 105 S. Ct. 432, 83 L. Ed.2d 358 (1984)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These principles held true prior to the June 1, 1981 effective date of the amendment to section 7543, and they continue to hold true today. Therefore, the terms "discipline" and "disciplinary action" refer to an agency's authority under chapter 75 to punish an employee for his job-related wrongdoing, whether intentional or unintentional.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, this was the meaning of those terms in 1981 at the time Congress was considering its amendment to section 7543. In the 1981 amendments, Congress declined to articulate any intent to limit the application of section 7543 to intentional misconduct. Neither the statute nor the legislative history of the 1981 amendment reveals any indication that Congress intended to prohibit adverse actions against SES employees based on unintentional misconduct. Congress is certainly aware of the distinction between actions that are intentional and unintentional, and has not hesitated to include language limiting the applicability of statutes to willful or intentional behavior. That Congress elected not to include an explicit reference to intentional misconduct in amending section 7543 is telling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has, in the past, sustained charges of <span id="Page_2222"></span>misconduct brought against SES employees where that misconduct was intentional. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Berube,</span> 30 MSPR at 592-95, where one of the charges brought against the SES employee, was that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">instead of "carrying out...[his] assigned duties and responsibilities," [the employee] spent his time on such matters as challenging the operations of the office and his position description, thereby wasting valuable employee time in a disruptive fashion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 592. In sustaining the charge, the Board found that the employee's conduct was "deliberate[ ]" and "intentionally disruptive." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 594.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has also, however, sustained charges of unintentional misconduct brought against SES employees. In <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 66 MSPR 68 (1994), the Board sustained charges of sexual harassment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A charge of sexual harassment under Title VII based on hostile environment does not require a finding that the alleged harasser acted with intent. <span class="Italic">Hillen</span>, 66 MSPR at 74.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant argues that <span class="Italic">Foster v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Labor,</span> 31 MSPR 74, 77 (1986), stands for the proposition that 5 USC &#x00A7; 7543(a) requires a finding of intent or willfulness. In <span class="Italic">Foster,</span> 31 MSPR at 75-77, the Board found that the employee's erroneous interpretation of hiring regulations and policy did not rise to the level of actionable misconduct and should have been treated as a performance problem under chapter 43 rather than a disciplinary problem under chapter 75. In contrast, the appellant's misconduct in this case involves a rather straightforward misuse of his government credit card, not conduct that could even arguably be characterized as a performance deficiency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant's assertion that permitting SES employees to be disciplined for unintentional misconduct would mean that agencies could "successfully prosecute any employee for even the most trivial violations of rules" is simply wrong. If the violation is truly trivial, then it would not constitute actionable "misconduct, neglect of duty, or malfeasance" under section 7543(a) and the Board would not sustain an action of that nature brought under section 7543(a). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Foster,</span> 31 MSPR at 79 (an SES employee's errors in judgment which resulted from a legitimate misunderstanding of personnel requirements do not warrant the imposition of disciplinary measures under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7543).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, if we were to interpret section 7543(a) to require a showing of intent, then SES employees would be insulated from discipline for behavior that would constitute actionable misconduct if committed by a lower-graded employee, who can be disciplined for any conduct affecting the efficiency of the service, whether intentional or otherwise, under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(a). Such a reading of the statute is inconsistent with the legislative history and contrary to the notion that the SES is a corps of elite Federal managers held to a very high standard of conduct. <span class="Italic">See Gores v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 68 MSPR 100, 121 (1995); <span class="Italic">Dolezal v. Department of the Army</span>, 58 MSPR 64, 71 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 22 F.3d 1104 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). Accordingly, we find that 5 USC &#x00A7; 7543(a) does not require that SES employees can only be disciplined for<span class="Italic"> intentional</span> "misconduct, neglect of duty, [or] malfeasance." Rather than the status of the employee being charged, it is the nature of the charge brought against an employee that determines whether the agency must prove intent. Here, the agency was not required to prove intent to sustain the charge of misuse of a government credit card. <span class="Italic">Rogers v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Justice,</span> 60 MSPR 377, 389 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although SES members are responsible for correcting the known misconduct of subordinates, and they have a duty of reasonable inquiry upon information they learn that suggests problems at lower levels of the organization or with its personnel, the SES member is not absolutely liable for unknown lower level errors. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Prouty &#x0026; Weller v. GSA</span>, 122 MSPR 117, 2014 MSPB 90 (2014) (setting aside discipline of SES members as to whom the agency did not prove knowledge of mismanagement of a regional conference that attracted national publicity because of its extravagance). [<span class="Italic">Prouty &#x0026; Weller</span> is discussed in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-001.html#sec1-1"><span class="Italic">Respondeat Superior</span></a>."] [Refer to Chapter 10, "<a href="0100-2023-17-020.html#sec10-21">Senior Executive Service</a>," for RIF rights for SES members.]</p>
