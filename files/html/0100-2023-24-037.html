<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-37"><span class="space">4.</span> Substantial Evidence; Factual Dispute</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board determines facts; the Federal Circuit provides limited review of those factual determinations. <span class="Italic">McMillan v. DOJ</span>, 812 F.3d 1364, 1371 (Fed. Cir. <span id="Page_5198"></span>2016), summarized cases defining the scope of appellate review of Board factual findings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Underlying factual determinations are reviewed for substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Bolton v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 154 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">see also Parker v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 819 F.2d 1113, 1115 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (The correct "standard is not what the court would decide in a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> appraisal, but whether the administrative determination is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole."). This Court "will not overturn an agency decision if it is supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." <span class="Italic">Hogan v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 218 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <span class="Italic">Brewer v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 647 F.2d 1093, 1096 (Ct. Cl. 1981)). "It is not for this court to reweigh the evidence before the Board." <span class="Italic">Henry v. Dep't of</span> <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 902 F.2d 949, 951 (Fed. Cir. 1990). We have jurisdiction to review the final order of the MSPB pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A reviewing court sustains the Board's factual determinations if they are supported by substantial evidence of record. 5 USC 7703(c)(3); <span class="Italic">Dunning v. NASA</span>, 718 F.2d 1170, 1174 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Under <span class="Italic">Brenner v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210309172">990 F.3d 1313</a>, 1325 n.7 (Fed. Cir. 2021):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">..."The statutory phrase 'substantial evidence' is a 'term of art' in administrative law that describes how 'an administrative record is to be judged by a reviewing court.'" <span class="Italic">T-Mobile S., LLC v. City of Roswell</span>, 574 U.S. 293, 301 (2015) (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. Carlo Bianchi &#x0026; Co</span>., 373 U.S. 709, 715 (1963)). "Th[e] [substantial evidence] standard goes to the reasonableness of what the agency did on the basis of the evidence before it." <span class="Italic">Carlo Bianchi</span>, 373 U.S. at 715. It asks "whether the evidence relied upon by the trier of fact was of sufficient quality and substantiality to support the rationality of [its] judgment." <span class="Italic">Woodby v. Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv</span>., 385 U.S. 276, 282 (1966); <span class="Italic">see Burlington</span>, 371 U.S. at 168 (providing that, under the substantial evidence standard, "[t]he agency must make findings that support its decision" and "articulate [a] rational connection between the facts found and the choice made," particularly where the agency chooses between "vastly different remedies with vastly different consequences").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"The Board necessarily abuses its discretion when it rests its decision on factual findings unsupported by substantial evidence." <span class="Italic">Pyles v. MSPB</span>, 45 F.3d 411, 414 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Pak v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20201222171">840 Fed. Appx. 533</a> (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that our decision in <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 809 F.3d 1365 (Fed.

More particularly, the government quotes <span class="Italic">McCarthy's</span> statement that this court may "affirm the agency on grounds other than those relied upon in rendering its decision, when upholding the agency's decision does not depend upon making a determination of fact not previously made by the agency." <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span>, 809 F.3d at 1373 (quoting <span class="Italic">In re Comiskey</span>, 554 F.3d 967, 974 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the government's suggestion, <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span> does not endorse appellate fact finding in this case. In <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span> we considered whether the MSPB correctly denied a motion to reopen. <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span>, 809 F.3d at 1373. Though the Board had not explained its bases for denying the motion, on appeal, we concluded that we were able to identify sufficient legal bases, which did not require additional fact finding, to affirm the Board's denial. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1373-75. Critically, therefore, the central question in <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span> was a question of law that was based on undisputed facts. This case in contrast, as the government agrees, involves a question of <span id="Page_5199"></span>fact that the administrative judge never considered--namely, whether the agency would have taken the same November 2015 personnel action absent the second protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we do not agree with the government that the administrative judge's fact finding related to whether Ms. Potter established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case was sufficient to resolve the present question. The administrative judge's fact finding considered whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, Ms. Potter had shown that her protected disclosure contributed to the agency's alleged reprisal. It does not resolve the separate question of whether, by clear and convincing evidence, the agency established that it would have taken the November 2015 personnel action regardless of Ms. Potter's second protected disclosure. Accordingly, unlike in <span class="Italic">McCarthy</span>, we may not resolve the outstanding question with respect to the November 2015 failure to hire.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Application of the substantial evidence test to Board decisions is peculiar. Under 5 USC 7701(c), the Board cannot sustain an agency adverse action unless it is supported by a preponderance of the evidence (the Board's standard of review for a performance case is substantial evidence; for a whistleblower case, the agency may need to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action without regard to protected activity). A court of appeals reviewing the Board's factual findings looks for substantial evidence to support those findings. <span class="Italic">Soulios v. Dept. of Energy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1983 NP No. 83-1061). 5 USC 7703(c) calls on the reviewing court to set aside agency action unsupported by substantial evidence or action that is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. Because it is the <span class="Italic">agency</span> action that is being reviewed under the statute, there is an ambiguity as to where and how the substantial evidence test is to be applied. This difficulty was recognized and addressed in <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court reviews factual determinations of the board under the "substantial evidence" standard.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The statute in 5 USC 7703(c) refers ambiguously to this court's review of "agency action" to determine if it is supported by "substantial evidence." In view of the <span class="Italic">de novo</span> nature of the proceeding before the MSPB, this court has concluded that it must review the agency action based on the record made to the MSPB and the MSPB findings, rather than review the agency action solely on the basis of the agency's record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hayes v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> noted that the ultimate review function of the court as to factual determinations is to determine whether, considering the record as a whole, the agency's evidence is sufficient to be found by a reasonable factfinder to meet the evidentiary burden applicable to the particular case. This analysis presents the usual problem for an appellate court: review of a record on a substantial evidence test to ascertain whether the factfinder reasonably could have concluded that there existed a preponderance of evidence. The difficulty created by this approach is generally resolved by a much simpler determination of whether the record reflects substantial evidence of the charged conduct. The court occasionally searches the record to determine whether substantial evidence supported a Board conclusion that preponderant evidence supported the Board's factual conclusion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. DOJ</span>, 35 F.3d 1543, 1547 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">Substantial evidence was defined by one court reviewing factual allegations and proof in a Board case as "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." <span class="Italic">Borsari v.

The proper standard for determining substantial evidence is not whether it is more than a scintilla of evidence. The correct standard is higher than that minimal one.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As <span class="Italic">Universal Camera</span> and its progeny make clear, whether evidence is substantial is not an abstract question but a contextual one.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Olson v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 60 Fed. Appx. 818, 821 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP), reemphasized the Federal Circuit's disinclination to reweigh facts determined by the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, we note that Mr. Olson does not challenge the substantiality of the evidence or dispute the facts on which the Administrative Judge based his factual conclusions. Rather, Mr. Olson requests this court to adopt an alternative view of the evidence. We cannot provide such relief, however, because as a reviewing court it is not our duty to make factual determinations by re-weighing the evidence or re-evaluating witness testimony, but only to review the record to determine whether in the absence of legal error the Board's decision is supported by substantial evidence. Generally the Board's evidentiary findings are not disturbed on review. <span class="Italic">Bevans v. OPM</span>, 900 F.2d 1558, 1564-65 (Fed. Cir. 1990), suggested: To a considerable extent, many of the petitioner's arguments in effect ask the court to substitute its judgment for that of the Board and to draw factual inferences from the record that the Board declined to draw.

<p class="Body-Text">The compiled Federal Circuit opinions contain hundreds of nonprecedential decisions and summary affirmations against civil servants who attempted to show that Board factual findings were in error. The reviewing court does not sit as a reviewer of facts; it will not reweigh evidence. Taking a case to the circuit court to obtain factual review is usually a waste of time and resources. Lacking very specific objections to the evidentiary review, the court will likely conclude, <span class="Italic">Mathis v. Spears</span>, 857 F.2d 749, 755 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (patent case): "[I]t wastes the time of all concerned when an appellant misstates the record and cites only its mere disagreement with findings as support for its burden of showing them clearly erroneous."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite the substantial evidence test, the reviewing court may find that a factual conclusion is insufficiently supported, even though there is some evidence in the record relating to the conclusion drawn by the Board. In <span class="Italic">Wade v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 829 F.2d 1106, 1108-09 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the court said of some medical testimony offered by an agency to show that the appellant (whose doctors supplied extensive evidence of his disability) could actually do his job and was not entitled to sick leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Government based its charge entirely on the testimony of Dr. Whitelock as to Wade's illness and capacity for work and offered no other evidence in that regard. After a careful review of the record, we have concluded that her testimony is insufficient to support the decision of the administrative judge and the Board in this case. She had no first-hand information about Wade's physical condition, as she had never examined him, and, as far as the record shows, she had never even seen him before the trial. Her testimony was based wholly on hearsay medical reports that others had prepared. Furthermore, her testimony was conflicting.... &#8197;[O]n cross-examination she admitted that she did not know what his job was nor the work that it required. Under all of these circumstances, her testimony as to Wade's physical condition and his capacity to work at his job had very little, if any, probative force and did not rise to the level of substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Holmes v. VA</span>, 58 F.3d 628 (Fed. Cir. 1995), remanded a case involving a disputed settlement agreement for lack of adequate factfinding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, there is conflicting evidence regarding the key issue before the Board--whether Mr. McLean provided a neutral reference to Ms. Sturm as required by paragraph 8 of the settlement agreement. Under these circumstances, the Board erred as a matter of law in ruling in the VA's favor after crediting the Sturm report as support for the McLean affidavit without taking into account all the evidence of record. Put another way, <span id="Page_5201"></span>the Board erred by not undertaking the task of addressing and coming to grips with the conflicting evidence in the record, and then deciding the case after having done so. "[O]n balance, th[e] record presents a legitimate factual issue of whether there was a breach" of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. United States Postal Service,</span> 926 F.2d 1146, 1149 (Fed. Cir. 1991). For the reason just stated, we hold that further Board proceedings are required in order to resolve this factual issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Spurlock v. DOJ</span>, 894 F.2d 1328, 1330, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1990), reversed the critical factual finding of the Board that sustained adverse action against a border patrol agent who allegedly should have known that an alien sought political asylum. Reviewing the factual accounts of record, the court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to determine whether the board's finding is supported by substantial evidence, it was necessary for the court to "canvas" the entire record, because "[t]he substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight." <span class="Italic">Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Bd.</span>, 340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951). Exaggeration, inherent improbability, self-contradiction, omissions in a purportedly complete account, imprecision, and errors detract from the weight to be accorded the evidence upon which an administrative board bases its decision. <span class="Italic">Sternberger v. United States</span>, 401 F.2d 1012, 1016, 185 Ct. Cl. 528 (1968).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its ultimate finding, the board relied heavily on the statement in the report filed by Spurlock, that Medvid had jumped ship for moral and political reasons. However, we find there is much in the record which detracts from the weight that was given to that statement by the board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From a study of the entire record, we are convinced that the overwhelming weight of the evidence is contrary to the board's finding. Therefore, the board's decision that the agency had satisfied its evidentiary burden was unreasonable....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We "cannot conscientiously find that the evidence supporting [the board's] decision is substantial, when viewed in the light that the record in its entirety furnishes, including the body of evidence opposed to the Board's view." <span class="Italic">Universal Camera</span>, 340 U.S. at 488. Therefore, the Board's decision is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions that Spurlock's suspension be cancelled....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tudor v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 639 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (reflecting close analysis of testimony concerning condonation of some actions relied upon to discipline the appellant and finding insufficient evidence to support the findings of the AJ sustaining the discipline; remanding for further consideration of other elements of the case).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The substantial evidence test applies when the court reviews awards of labor arbitrators who decide adverse actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith-Nwagwu v. VA</span>, 446 Fed. Appx. 294 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP) (applying the substantial evidence test to an arbitrator's factual findings); <span class="Italic">Powell v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3079) ("[T]he arbitrator's credibility determinations are virtually unreviewable on appeal, and we will not upset the arbitrator's decision when it is supported by substantial evidence."). But in <span class="Italic">Dixon v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 8 F.3d 798, 803-04 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the court set aside an arbitrator's award sustaining removal of an appellant accused of altering a urine sample during a random drug test. As it sifted through the evidence, including the transcript and exhibits considered by the arbitrator, the court explained what its review did and did not entail:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The critical issue in this case is whether the arbitrator's conclusion that the agency proved the charge against petitioner by a preponderance of the evidence is supported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bradley v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 900 F.2d 233, 234 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1330-32 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Envirotech Corp. v. Al George, Inc.</span>, 730 F.2d 753, 758, 221 USPQ 473, 477 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The Supreme Court has defined the "substantial evidence" standard as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"[s]ubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." <span class="Italic">Consolidated Edison Co. v. Labor Board</span>, 305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S. Ct. 206, 216, 83 L. Ed. 126] . Accordingly, it "must do more than create a suspicion of the existence of the fact to be established... it must be enough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury." <span class="Italic">Labor Board v. Columbian Enameling &#x0026; Stamping Co.</span>, 306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S. Ct. 501, 505, 83 L. Ed. 660.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Whether or not it was ever permissible for courts to determine the substantiality of evidence supporting a Labor Board decision merely on the basis of evidence which in and of itself justified it, without taking into account contradictory evidence or evidence from which conflicting inferences could be drawn, the new legislation definitely precludes such a theory of review and bars its practice. The substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 340 U.S. 474, 477, 487-88, 71 S. Ct. 456, 459, 463-64, 95 L. Ed. 456 (1951).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because "[t]he substantiality of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight," we must canvass the entire record. <span class="Italic">Spurlock v. Department of Justice</span>, 894 F.2d 1328, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 1990)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It also is important to recognize what our substantial evidence standard of review does not involve. Specifically, we do not make a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> decision on the weight of the evidence. <span class="Italic">De Cicco v. United States</span>, 677 F.2d 66, 70 (Ct. Cl. 1982). Rather, we look at the evidence which supports the arbitrator's award and then review the entire record to determine whether factors such as "[e]xaggeration, inherent improbability, self-contradiction, omissions in a purportedly complete account, imprecision, and errors" detract from the weight of that particular evidence. <span class="Italic">Spurlock</span>, 894 F.2d at 1330. Only if such factors so detract from the weight of the evidence which supports the arbitrator's award, or the agency's evidence is so sparse, that a reasonable fact-finder would not find the charge proved by a preponderance of the evidence may we reverse. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 768 F.2d at 1330.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some factual determinations are known as "mixed" issues of fact and law because the factual analysis depends upon a legal analysis. The issue arose in <span class="Italic">Campbell v. MSPB</span>, 27 F.3d 1560, 1564-67 (Fed. Cir. 1994), whether the reviewing court would defer to a mixed issue determination by the Board under a substantial evidence approach, or whether the court would examine the issue <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">novo</span> as a reviewer of law. The result was that if the application of law requires Board expertise, the mixed legal and factual determinations are likely to receive judicial deference:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The power of courts to disturb the actions of administrative agencies is generally quite limited. In appeals from the Board, Congress has directed this court to review the record and set aside only those</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">agency action[s], findings, or conclusions found to be--(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c) (1988). Precisely which of these standards applies to a particular issue on appeal depends on the nature of both the agency action and the question presented.... &#8197;Conclusions of fact in agency adjudications are generally governed by the substantial evidence test.... &#8197;That test requires courts to defer as long as the record contains evidence from which one reasonably could draw the challenged inference--even though there is other evidence which, if believed, would permit the contrary inference... .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Conclusions of law, by contrast, are reviewed <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, it being, "emphatically, the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is." <span class="Italic">Marbury v. Madison</span>, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803). The threshold question in this appeal is whether the Board's determination that Mr. Campbell was not an "independent candidate" is, for purposes of judicial review, properly characterized as a finding of fact, or, as appellant would have it, a conclusion of law.... &#8197;This is a question of first impression in this court. Selection of the proper standard of review being, self-evidently, a matter of law, we conduct our examination <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is often difficult to distinguish factual inferences from legal conclusions.... &#8197;Indeed, this case reveals the falseness of the fact-law dichotomy, since the determination at issue, involving as it does the application of a general legal standard to particular facts, is probably most realistically described as neither of fact nor law, but mixed.... &#8197;Mixed questions sometimes are impossible to categorize through sheer logic.... &#8197;Somewhere near the middle of the fact-law spectrum, a "finding of fact shades imperceptibly into a conclusion of law." Louis L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 546-50 (1965). The mixed questions in this zone of logical overlap fairly can be conceptualized as either essentially factual or essentially legal because they have a substantial normative element, yet are case-specific....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The mixed question at issue here... is not sufficiently close to one end of the spectrum or another to permit an easy answer based on logic alone. Characterization therefore must follow from an <span class="Italic">a</span> <span class="Italic">priori</span> decision as to whether deferring to the Board's application of the "independent candidate" exception to the facts of cases before it is sound judicial policy. We would be less than candid to suggest otherwise. The question thus arises, exactly which policies properly inform the analysis and to what extent?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts in such situations typically have balanced considerations of judicial economy, comparative institutional advantage (e.g., the relative expertise of agencies and relative <span class="Italic">non</span>-expertise of juries <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> judges), and constitutional concerns (e.g., the separation of powers in administrative appeals, and the right of trial by jury in actions at law) against the effect of appellate deference on consistency and uniformity in the law.... &#8197;We turn now to consider the nature of the determination at <span id="Page_5202"></span>issue here in light of the policies underlying standards of review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the record before us is any indication, most of the Hatch Act cases will be <span class="Italic">sui generis</span>, presenting unique combinations of numerous specific episodes that shed light on the question of political independence <span class="Italic">vel non</span>. The ultimate conclusion is simply the net impression created by this totality of circumstances. Such case-specificity severely limits the scope of any one decision's precedential relevance. Few cases will be so factually indistinguishable that apparently divergent results would not be seen best as a function of the peculiarities of the case rather than some deeper normative conflict. This at once minimizes the adverse effect that a deferential standard of review might have on uniformity and maximizes judicial economy by avoiding a rule that would tend to encourage entirely fact-bound appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for considerations of comparative institutional advantage, the trier is in a better position to make an overall assessment than a court of appeals, because demeanor evidence--invisible to us--ordinarily will be an important ingredient in the mix. Moreover, while the Board is perhaps more akin to a lower court than the typical agency (since Congress assigned it an essentially adjudicatory function)... its determinations nevertheless represent the actions of an independent branch of government for which Congress prescribed the same standards of review. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c) <span class="Italic">with</span> &#x00A7; 706(2). This suggests the Board is entitled to the same deference typically accorded agencies resolving fact-intensive mixed questions--that is, questions involving the straight application of a rule in need of no further elaboration to highly particularized facts. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NLRB v. Hearst Publications</span>, Inc., 322 U.S. 111, 64 S. Ct. 851, 88 L. Ed. 1170 (1944) (question whether person is an "employee" or a manager within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, the factor of relative expertise as between the Board and this court is not dispositive as to whether the standard of review should be deferential. Because we alone review the Board's decisions under the Hatch Act as they affect federal employees, we are as well versed in the applicable law as is the Board. The Board, however, hears and decides also those Hatch Act cases that are not appealed here, which involve employees of state agencies that receive federal funds. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1502-1503, 1508 (1988). Consequently, the Board has broad exposure to the many varied fact settings in which Hatch Act cases may arise. To the extent that familiarity with factual underpinnings of Hatch Act cases may lead to expertise in deciding such cases, the Board's experience tilts in the direction of according a measure of deference to their conclusions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, there are no countervailing constitutional concerns that might outweigh the separation of powers and other considerations favor deference to the agency here.... &#8197;Congress unquestionably has the power to forbid federal employees absolutely from running for elective office, for while Mr. Campbell "may have a constitutional right to [run for elective office], he has no constitutional right to be a [federal employee]." <span class="Italic">McAuliffe v. Mayor of New Bedford</span>, 155 Mass. 216, 220, 29 N.E. 517 (1892) (Holmes, J.).... &#8197;It follows that if Congress can forbid federal employees absolutely from running for elective office, <span class="Italic">a</span> <span class="Italic">fortiori</span> it can permit them to do so subject to non-arbitrary restrictions. The greater power subsumes the lesser.... &#8197;Applying the minimal scrutiny of rationality review to Board determinations under the "independent candidate" exception does not fairly implicate the First Amendment, much less raise a serious constitutional question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the mixed question of "independent candidate" must be placed in the category of fact for purposes of judicial review. We now turn to the merits of this appeal and whether the record contains "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support [the Board's] conclusion" that candidate Campbell was not really independent of a political party....</p>
