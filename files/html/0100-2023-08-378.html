<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-370"><span class="space">a.</span> Competitive Appointment Procedures; Exceptions to Competitive Requirements; Expedited Hiring for Acquisitions Positions</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency decides to use an open competitive process, allowing applicants from outside the agency to compete for positions, then the preference eligible who applies from within the agency but through the open competitive process must be given the statutory preference, <span class="Italic">Perkins v. USPS</span>, 100 MSPR 48, 49-59 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-22 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After exhausting the Department of Labor process, the appellant, an EAS-23 Human Resource Analyst at the agency, filed an appeal with the Board under the VEOA. He asserted that he was denied his right to veterans' preference in "open competitive announcement[s]" for two vacancies at the agency....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the AJ notified the parties of the applicable standards and burdens of proof regarding the appellant's VEOA claim and afforded them an opportunity to submit evidence and argument. The AJ then found that the appellant was not entitled to his requested hearing because there were no material facts in dispute, and he issued a remand initial decision based on the record evidence. He found that the Board has VEOA jurisdiction over the appeal but that the appellant failed to state a VEOA claim for which relief may be granted because current employees, like the appellant, are never entitled to veterans' preference in seeking a<span class="Italic"> reassignment or promotion</span> within the same agency, even if he is participating in an open competitive examination process in which external applicants may be given veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a petition for review, arguing that the AJ erred by failing to distinguish between the "open competitive" selection process and the "internal merit promotion" process. He concedes that he is not entitled to veterans' preference under the latter process, but reiterates his argument below that he is entitled to veterans' preference under the former process. He contends that he should have been considered under the open competitive selection process since the vacancy announcements specified that they were open to all sources. The agency has responded in opposition to the appellant's petition, arguing that substantial case law supports the AJ's finding that a current employee is never entitled to veterans' preference for any intra-agency movement and further arguing that, even assuming the rule were otherwise for employees in the competitive service, the Postal Service is not bound by most of the rules and regulations applicable to the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, preliminarily, that there are two primary types of selection processes in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> Although, as noted above, the Postal Service is generally exempt from the rules governing the competitive service, we must discuss the selection processes in the competitive service since the appellant, as a <span id="Page_696"></span>preference eligible Postal employee, is entitled to veterans' preference "in the same manner and under the same conditions as if [he] were subject to the competitive service...." 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(2). One type of selection process is the <span class="Italic">"</span>merit promotion" process, which is used when an agency announces a position only to those already employed in the agency or in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See Abell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2003). As the appellant has acknowledged, an employee is not entitled to veterans' preference in the merit promotion process. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The other selection process is the competitive examination process,[3] which is generally required for entry into the competitive service. On review, the appellant contends, and the agency does not dispute, "that each vacancy announcement that he applied for was an open competitive announcement soliciting applications from 'all sources'"; "that there were no separate internal (i.e., merit promotion) vacancy announcements for these positions"; "that he applied under the competitive examining procedures"; and that he "responded directly to an open competitive announcement for which 'all sources' of applicants were eligible to apply." He argues on review that he was therefore entitled to veterans' preference, which the agency denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;A competitive "examination may consist of a written test, but it might instead consist of a work sample assessment, a structured interview, rating and ranking according to job-related competencies, verification of a professional certification recognized by a general professional community, or a combination of these or other formal evaluation devices." <span class="Italic">Sherwood</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 208 &#x00B6; 7 n.1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The pertinent statutory provisions are not crystal clear as to whether veterans' preference must be granted to an individual only upon his initial entry into an agency (or into the competitive service) or upon his participation in any open competitive examination process. Section 3309, 5 U.S.C., states: "A preference eligible who receives a passing grade in an examination for entrance into the competitive service is entitled to additional points...." Section 3309 could be interpreted either as limiting veterans' preference to "entrance into the competitive service," or as granting veterans' preference any time a preference eligible receives a passing score in the specified type of examination: "examination for entrance into the competitive service," <span class="Italic">viz.</span>, the competitive examination process. Related provisions within 5 U.S.C. ch. 33 state that veterans' preference is granted to those who qualify in "examinations for the competitive service," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3311, 3313, without mentioning "entrance into" the competitive service, as section 3309 states. Another provision permits only preference eligibles to participate in "examinations for [certain] positions...in the competitive service," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3310, without mentioning that the examinations are for "entrance into" the competitive service. These statutory provisions, read together, appear to grant veterans' preference any time the competitive examination process is used, and nothing in these provisions suggests prohibiting veterans' preference to current employees who participate in a competitive examination process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that these statutory provisions may be deemed ambiguous, the interpretation by the agency responsible for implementation of the statute may be entitled to significant deference. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rosete v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 48 F.3d 514, 517 (Fed. Cir. 1995). OPM is responsible for implementing the statutory provisions governing administration of the competitive service, including those pertaining to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1103(a)(5), (a)(7), (b), 1104. As the appellant has pointed out below and on review, OPM has interpreted these statutory provisions as granting veterans' preference to all preference eligibles who receive a passing grade (or qualify) in a competitive examination process, including preference eligible internal applicants. Specifically, OPM's <span class="Italic">Delegated Examining Operations Handbook, A Guide for Federal Agency Examining Offices</span> (1999) ("OPM Handbook") provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">6.1.K.&#x2003; <span class="Italic">Accepting Concurrent Applications from Preference Eligibles</span>.... In instances when an agency issues two announcements--a competitive and an internal announcement--for the same position,...candidates should be considered for the specific announcement(s) they apply under. A preference eligible who files one application without specifying which vehicle, should be considered as a candidate for the open competitive examination. If an agency is using a single notice to announce joint solicitation for external and internal applications, it must include language to clarify the appropriate procedures, e.g., the necessity to file two applications for dual consideration. <span class="Italic">In the absence of that clarifying language, a preference eligible must be considered for both processes.</span> Under the competitive (external) process, the veteran is given veterans preference. However, under the merit promotion (internal) process, veterans preference is not used for status applicants. [Emphasis in the original.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, according to this OPM Handbook, a preference-eligible internal candidate, like the appellant, is entitled to veterans' preference when participating in an open competitive examination process.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;OPM's regulatory definition of "preference eligibles" comments broadly that "[p]reference does not apply...to inservice placement actions such as promotions." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 211.102(c). We find this regulatory comment not particularly significant because: It is made in the course of defining "preference eligibles," rather than in specifying how veterans' preference must be granted in employment; it is inconsistent with more specific OPM instructions addressing how and when to grant veterans preference, as discussed in the text above; it seems to simply track the broad language of <span class="Italic">Glenn</span>, 939 F.2d at 1521, and similar cases which, as discussed in the text <span class="Italic">infra</span>, are distinguishable or unpersuasive; and it states generally that preference does not apply "to inservice placement actions such as promotions," but does not explicitly state whether it applies to open competitive examination processes. The regulatory history behind 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 211.102(c) includes no explanation for this comment. 60 Fed. Reg. 3055 (1995); 60 Fed. Reg. 6595 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, as the appellant has pointed out, OPM's Optional Form 510, entitled <span class="Italic">Applying for a Federal Job</span>, provides that "[v]eterans' preference is <span class="Italic">not</span> a factor...when competition is limited to status candidates (current or former Federal career or career-conditional employees)," thus implying that veterans' preference may be a factor when competition is not "limited to status candidates," i.e., when a vacancy is made open to the competitive examination process. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Scharein v. Department of the Army</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 329 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6, 8 (2002) (current employee who applied for a higher-graded position at the same agency, under an open competitive examination process, was granted veterans' preference and placed at the top of the certificate of eligibles), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 02-3270 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (NP). Thus, OPM has interpreted the veterans' preference laws as granting veterans' preference to internal applicants participating in a competitive examination process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Congress has "explicitly left a gap for an agency to fill, there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation, and any ensuing regulation is binding in the courts unless procedurally defective, arbitrary or capricious in substance, or manifestly contrary to the statute." <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A.

It is true that the OPM Handbook here is not based on formal rulemaking and, as such, may not warrant <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>-type deference. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh v. Department of Justice</span>, 336 F.3d 1332, 1340-41 (Fed. Cir. 2003);<span class="Italic"> cf. Barnhart v. Walton,</span> 535 U.S. 212, 221-22 (2002) ("the fact that the Agency...reached its interpretation through means less formal than 'notice and comment' rulemaking...does not automatically deprive that interpretation of [<span class="Italic">Chevron</span>] judicial deference..."). That <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference may not be warranted here does not mean, however, that no deference is due. <span class="Italic">See Mead</span>, 533 U.S. at 234. "<span class="Italic">Chevon</span> did nothing to eliminate <span class="Italic">Skidmore's</span> [<span class="Italic">Skidmore v. Swift &#x0026; Co.,</span> 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944)] holding that an agency's interpretation may merit some deference whatever its form, given the 'specialized experience and broader investigations and information' available to the agency, and given the value of uniformity in its administrative and judicial understandings of what a national law required." <span class="Italic">Mead,</span> 533 U.S. at 234.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The weight [accorded to an administrative] judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Skidmore,</span> 323 U.S. at 140). In determining the level of weight to be accorded OPM's interpretation, factors such as the degree of the agency's care, its consistency, formality, relative expertness, and persuasiveness of the agency's position may be considered. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 228. Here, OPM's degree of care in formulating the interpretation in its OPM Handbook is not evident from the record, but it appears that the interpretation has been consistent, since no contrary interpretation has been presented or is evident. The interpretation was not formally promulgated, but was formally publicized as guidance to other agencies beyond OPM; that is, the interpretation was not merely an internal memorandum. As the agency entrusted to administer the civil service rules, OPM's relative expertise is obvious. Finally, as to the persuasiveness of the agency's position, the OPM Handbook states, regarding "Simultaneous Recruitment Through Open Competitive Examining and Merit Promotion," that "important cautions...should be observed to protect the open competitive merit principle," OPM Handbook, V-6.G, and that "[a]ll applicants, including status applicants, must be allowed to file through competitive procedures for job vacancies opened for non-status candidates," <span class="Italic">id.</span>, V-6.G.2. OPM's rationale, albeit brief, is consistent with the statutory provisions mandatorily including veterans' preference as an integral part of the competitive examination process. <span class="Italic">Cf. Seth-Morris</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 166 &#x00B6; 13 (2003) ("[t]he power to persuade is lacking...since the CSRS/FERS Handbook provides no insight into OPM's reason for interpreting the statute in such a way..."). We find that OPM's interpretation that specifically and explicitly addresses the <span id="Page_697"></span>particular issue before us is a reasonable resolution of any ambiguity in the statutory language and is entitled to our deference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of the contrary argument that an internal applicant is never entitled to veterans' preference, the agency cites the legislative history discussed in <span class="Italic">Glenn</span>, 939 F.2d at 1521-22, and <span class="Italic">Hunt v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 154 F. Supp.2d 1047, 1053 (E.D. Mich. 2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 30 Fed. Appx. 567 (6th Cir. 2002). <span class="Italic">Glenn</span> and <span class="Italic">Hunt</span> discuss the legislative history behind the VEOA, specifically 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f), which reflects Congressional concern that "often...Federal agencies will only allow current civilian employees to apply for vacancies" and that "[v]eterans who do not work for the Federal Government are barred from even competing on their merits for these jobs." 144 Cong. Rec. H10185-02 (daily ed. Oct. 8, 1998) (statement of Rep. Mica), <span class="Italic">cited in Hunt,</span> 154 F. Supp.2d at 1053. Such concerns are addressed in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1),[7] which is not implicated here because the appellant is a current employee and has not claimed that he was denied the opportunity to apply for any position. <span class="Italic">Hunt</span> and <span class="Italic">Glenn</span>, and the legislative history discussed therein, simply do not involve or address internal applicants' right to veterans' preference in an open competitive examination process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Section 3304(f)(1), 5 U.S.C., provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Preference eligibles or veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In agreeing with the agency's position, the AJ primarily relied on <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 247 F.3d 1222 (Fed. Cir. 2001), to find that a preference-eligible internal applicant, like the appellant, is never entitled to veterans' preference when applying for another position at the same agency. <span class="Italic">Brown</span> involved internal applicants for promotions, and the court stated broadly "that veterans are not accorded any preference under the VPA [Veterans Preference Act] when seeking promotion or intra-agency transfers." <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 247 F.3d at 1224. <span class="Italic">Brown</span> simply did not involve an internal applicant's right to veterans' preference in an open competitive examination process, however, and, in making its broad statement, relied on cases like <span class="Italic">Glenn</span> which are distinguishable, as further discussed below. Indeed, the Board has relied on <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 247 F.3d 1222, only for the limited proposition that "veterans <span class="Italic">usually</span> are not entitled to any preference when seeking promotions or intra-agency transfers." <span class="Italic">Wooten v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 671 &#x00B6; 11 (2004) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">accord Hamner v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 84 &#x00B6; 20 (2002). We therefore find that <span class="Italic">Brown</span> is not binding here. <span class="Italic">See McCormick</span>, 307 F.3d at 1342 n.3 (the court found it was not bound by its prior decision that reached a contrary result based on materially similar facts because the prior decision did not mention or address the particular legal issue in question).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, <span class="Italic">Brown</span> relied on <span class="Italic">Glenn,</span> an Eleventh Circuit decision. There, a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) gave substitute rural carriers superior bid rights for regular rural carrier (RRC) positions and exempted them from the competitive examination required of other Postal employees applying for the RRC positions. 939 F.2d at 1517-18. Preference-eligible city carriers seeking the RRC positions claimed that such preferential treatment of substitute rural carriers deprived them of their veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1518. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stated broadly in <span class="Italic">Glenn</span> that "veterans' preference only applies to initial employment, not to movement of an incumbent employee from one job to another within an agency" and that "[t]he scope of veterans' preference cannot be enlarged by the fiction of treating within-agency movement as initial employment." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1523. <span class="Italic">Glenn</span> is inapposite because it did not involve the issue involved in this case--whether an internal applicant is entitled to veterans' preference within an open competitive examination process. The plaintiffs in <span class="Italic">Glenn</span> did not claim that they were deprived of veterans' preference when they participated in the competitive examination process; they claimed instead that substitute rural carriers were improperly exempted from the competitive examination process. <span class="Italic">See generally Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 39 (although decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit are controlling authority for the Board, other circuit courts' decisions are persuasive, but not controlling, authority)<span class="Italic">, aff'd</span>, 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Brown</span> also relied on the following additional cases: <span class="Italic">Crowley v. United States</span>, 527 F.2d 1176 (Ct. Cl. 1975), <span class="Italic">Champion v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 561 (1984), <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Coleman,</span> 712 F. Supp. 1571 (N.D. Ga. 1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 901 F.2d 1571 (11th Cir. 1990), and <span class="Italic">Bates v. Runyon</span>, 97 F.3d 1464 (10th Cir. 1996) (Table). None of these cases involved the issue of an internal applicant's right to veterans' preference in an open competitive examination process, however. <span class="Italic">Crowley</span>, 527 F.2d at 1177, involved the termination of temporary promotions, and the court stated generally that veterans are not entitled to "unconditional preference in promotions," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1183. The court then stated that the "promotion and nonpromotion of employees within a department or agency of Government is a matter of supervisory discretion not ordinarily subject to judicial review." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1184. <span class="Italic">Champion</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. at 562, involved a removal "for failure to accept a directed transfer," and the issue was whether veterans' preference or the applicable CBA should take precedence in the agency's selection of its employees for intra-agency "transfers." In rejecting the appellant's argument that the CBA "violated the Veterans Preference Act because it gave union members (rather than veterans) preference over non-union members for transfer purposes," the Board stated generally that "promotion and non-promotion, transfer and non-transfer of employees within a department of government is a matter of supervisory discretion and not ordinarily subject to judicial review." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 562. <span class="Italic">Stephens</span>, 712 F. Supp. at 1581, involved a claim of veterans' preference for promotion purposes, and the court relied on <span class="Italic">Crowley</span>, 527 F.2d 1176, and <span class="Italic">Qualls v. United States</span>, 678 F.2d 190 (Ct. Cl. 1982), for its broad comment that "employees seeking a different position within the agency are not entitled to a veterans' preference when the position sought would constitute an internal agency promotion." <span class="Italic">Crowley</span>, as discussed above, provides scant legal support for the broad comment in <span class="Italic">Stephens,</span> and <span class="Italic">Qualls</span>, 678 F.2d at 196, is similarly inconsequential because it involved an internal merit promotion of a current employee over another current employee that apparently did not involve a competitive examination process. Finally, <span class="Italic">Bates,</span> 97 F.3d 1464, involved "an internal agency reassignment," and the Tenth Circuit broadly stated, in a nonprecedential decision, that the Postal employee was not entitled to veterans' preference in an internal reassignment, citing <span class="Italic">Glenn, Qualls</span>, and <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> for the proposition that "veterans' preference does not apply to an employee's transfer or other intra-agency movement." 97 F.3d at 1464.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cases described above cite each other for the broad propositions that promotions are generally beyond administrative or judicial review and that veterans' preference is not applicable in internal promotions, but none of them specifically addresses the issue before us of an internal applicant's right to veterans' preference <span class="Italic">in an open competitive examination process</span>. Nor do they include any persuasive rationale that would apply to the issue before us, in explaining why a preference-eligible <span class="Italic">internal</span> applicant should be denied veterans' preference that is granted to preference-eligible <span class="Italic">external</span> applicants participating in the same competitive examination process. We therefore find that our reviewing court's decision in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> and the cases cited therein are not apposite or otherwise persuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed, OPM's interpretation in its OPM Handbook is consistent with the language of the pertinent statutory provisions, apparently granting veterans' preference to preference eligibles who qualify in a competitive examination process, regardless of whether they are internal applicants who are currently employed at the same agency. Moreover, OPM's interpretation is the only one that specifically addresses the particular issue before us. For the reasons discussed here and more fully above, we conclude that OPM's reasonable interpretation is entitled to our deference and that preference-eligible current employees in the competitive service or the Postal Service are entitled to veterans' preference when participating in an open competitive examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that agencies are not required to use an open competitive examination process for all vacancies. Where an agency decides to use a competitive examination process to fill a vacancy, we do not decide here whether an internal applicant must be allowed to participate in such a process, in addition to participating in a merit promotion process.[9] We further note the appellant's argument that the Postal Service has no pass-over authority, so that it was required to select him because he would have been at the top of the list of eligibles had he been granted veterans' preference. Contrary to this argument, it appears that the Postal Service does have the authority to pass over a preference eligible, with OPM approval. <span class="Italic">See Wilmes v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 810 F.2d 130, 133 n.2 (7th Cir. 1987) (noting then-Postal regulation stating that the Postal Service may pass over a preference eligible under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318); <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 662 F.2d 311 (5th Cir. 1981) (noting that, in 1981, the Postal Service "acquiesced in OPM's interpretation" that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b) applies to the Postal Service, and "issued internal regulations establishing a procedure for OPM review of adverse determinations concerning preference eligible veterans").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The OPM Handbook quoted in the text above states that an agency must allow a preference eligible internal applicant to participate in an open competitive examination process if the agency is using such a process to fill a position. We nevertheless find that this issue has been insufficiently briefed to be decided here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency opens competition for a position, it may not impose a geographical or organizational limitation that precludes some but not all individuals who are not already agency employees from applying for the position if the applicants have veterans preference status, <span class="Italic">Jolley v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/JOLLEY_WILLIAM_B_AT_3443_06_0447_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_DISSENT_248537.pdf">105 MSPR 104</a>, 106-112 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-21, 2007 MSPB 51 (2007) (overruled as to VEOA right to compete claim for merit <span id="Page_698"></span>promotion positions sought by federal employees, <span class="Italic">Oram v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In August 2005, the agency issued a vacancy announcement for the position of Supervisory Law Enforcement Specialist (Instruction), GS-15, in its Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia. In its "merit promotion" announcement, it stated that it would accept applications from "[c]areer and career-conditional competitive service employees of the FLETC and on-site partner organizations." It also stated that it would accept applications from certain other categories of applicants, including those with "VEOA eligibility," i.e., "[v]eterans who are preference eligible or who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of continuous active service...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, an Operations Specialist with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in Jacksonville, Florida, applied for the position. The agency declined to consider the appellant's application, however, on the ground that the appellant was "not within the area of consideration specified on the announcement." The appellant then filed a complaint with the Department of Labor (DoL), arguing that the agency violated VEOA by not considering his application....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Area of Consideration</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraph (f)(1) of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304, which was enacted as part of VEOA, provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Preference eligibles or veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">VEOA, &#x00A7; 2, Pub. L. No. 105-339, 112 Stat. 3182 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record indicates, and the agency does not deny, that the appellant is a preference eligible. He therefore would appear to be entitled to compete under merit promotion procedures for a vacant position for which the employing agency would accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1); <span class="Italic">Brandt v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 671 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the vacancy announcement at issue here indicates that the agency would accept applications from "employees of the FLETC and on-site partner organizations." FLETC evidently is administratively operated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the agency in this case. The appellant asserts, however, and the agency appears to acknowledge, that the "partner organizations" to which the announcement refers are components of non-DHS agencies. <span class="Italic">See</span> (affidavit, submitted by the agency, asserting that the "term 'on-site partner organizations' means Federal agencies, apart from the FLETC, which are co-located <span class="Italic">on</span> a FLETC site"); (submission of April 17, 2006, in which the appellant refers to FLETC's website describing the organization as "an interagency law enforcement training organization").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has argued that, despite the circumstances described above, the appellant was not entitled to compete for the position at issue here. In support of this argument, it asserts that it limited the area of consideration to "employees who were <span class="Italic">physically located</span> at a FLETC facility." While it does not deny the appellant's assertion that his employing agency, HUD, had employees stationed at FLETC facilities, it asserts that the appellant's duty station was not located at an FLETC site, and that the appellant therefore was not within the area of consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge assigned to this case concurred in this reasoning, and he cited two Board decisions in support of his finding regarding this issue. Neither of the decisions he cited, however, addresses the issue raised here, i.e., the entitlement of a VEOA candidate to be considered when the agency accepts applications from individuals outside its own workforce. In fact, neither decision even refers to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) or indicates that the employee in the case applied pursuant to that provision. <span class="Italic">See Olson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 169, &#x00B6; 16 (2002); <span class="Italic">Villamarzo v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 159 (2002). We therefore find no support in those decisions for the agency's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, has addressed a situation somewhat similar to that at issue here. In that case, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) refused to score an application that a preference-eligible veteran had submitted under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). <span class="Italic">See O'Brien v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 118 Fed. Appx. 484, 485-86 (Fed. Cir. 2004). It based this refusal on the fact that the agency had limited its announcement to applicants in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, and on the fact that the applicant resided in South Carolina. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The court noted that an administrative judge of the Board, in an initial decision that later became the final decision of the Board, found that OPM had the right, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(2), to limit a vacancy announcement as long as the area of consideration was sufficiently broad to ensure the availability of high quality candidates. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 486. It then stated that it "agree[d] with the Board that OPM has the authority to geographically limit a vacancy announcement so long as the regulation's criterion is met." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court's decision in <span class="Italic">O'Brien</span> would appear to support the agency's position in the present case. Moreover, that decision is based in part on a regulatory provision promulgated by OPM, i.e., 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(2); OPM has express statutory authority to prescribe regulations necessary for the administration of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304; and regulations promulgated by an agency with such authority are entitled to deference when the statute at issue is ambiguous. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(5); <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984). We note, however, that <span class="Italic">O'Brien</span>, like the initial decision the court was reviewing, is nonprecedential; that it therefore does not constitute authority binding on the Board; and that its persuasive value is limited by the absence of any stated reasons for the court's concurrence in the Board's initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Worley v.

Furthermore, the regulatory provision to which the <span class="Italic">O'Brien</span> court referred predates the enactment of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), and it therefore cannot properly be regarded as an interpretation of that statutory provision that is entitled to special deference. In addition, even if OPM's failure to modify 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(2) following the enactment of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) could be regarded as a reflection of that agency's considered views regarding the effects of the statutory enactment, the regulatory provision would not appear to support the proposition that an agency may exclude from competition, on the basis of geographical or similar considerations, candidates covered by section 3304(f)(1). The relevant part of the regulatory provision addresses only the agency's responsibility to ensure that the area of competition meets certain minimum standards. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(2). It therefore indicates only indirectly--by prescribing minimum competition standards--that an agency may limit the area of consideration, and it includes no information about the circumstances under which any such implied authority may or may not be exercised. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has submitted a copy of a publication, the <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span>, that OPM posted on its website. That publication includes the following statement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The VEOA does not exempt Federal employees who happen to be veterans from the provisions of law and regulation that apply to all employees. Such an employee remains subject to the agency's Merit Promotion Plan--which means that he or she is also subject to the area of consideration and eligibility criteria such as time in grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Office of Personnel Management, <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span>, &#x00A7; 6, <a href="https://http://www.opm.gov/employ/veterans/html/vetguide.asp">http://www.opm.gov/employ/veterans/html/vetguide.asp</a> [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/">http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/veterans-services/vet-guide-for-hr-professionals/"</a>] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have noted above that, to the extent the statutory provision at issue here is ambiguous, OPM regulations interpreting the provision may be entitled to deference. The <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span> does not appear to have been issued under the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures used in promulgating regulations, however, and it therefore is not entitled to the deference accorded to regulations. <span class="Italic">Brandt</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">see Christensen v. Harris County</span>, 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000). While positions expressed in issuances such as these may be entitled to some weight, the amount of weight to be given depends in part on factors such as the consistency of the agency's position on the subject, the formality with which the position is expressed, and the persuasiveness of the position. <span class="Italic">United States v. Mead Corp.</span>, 533 U.S. 218, 227-28 (2001). The <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span> is a formal document, published on the internet with the apparent expectation that agencies and members of the public would rely on it. <span class="Italic">See Brandt</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 15. Moreover, we are aware of no instance in which OPM has taken a position contrary to the one indicated in the material quoted above. As explained below, however, the position expressed is not persuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we note that the <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span> includes no explanation for its interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), and it refers to no supporting authority. In the absence of any such explanation, the most likely basis for the interpretation appears to be the language and legislative history of an earlier version of this provision that was considered by Congress. This version, as it was reported by the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, would have provided as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">No [covered individual] shall be denied the opportunity to compete for an announced vacant position within an agency, in the competitive service or the excepted service, by reason of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; not having acquired competitive status; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; not being an employee of such agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">H. Rep. No. 105-40 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language quoted above would appear to have left an agency free to <span id="Page_699"></span>limit its consideration of any applicant--including one applying under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1)--on bases other than those described in paragraphs (A) and (B). Arguably, under that version of the legislation, the agency would have been free to exclude applicants not employed at FLETC. As indicated above, however, the version of section 3304(f)(1) that became law is not limited to ensuring competition by those covered individuals who have not acquired competitive status or who are not currently employed by the hiring agency. Instead, the plain language of the enacted version provides that any covered individual--i.e., any preference eligible or individual whose military service and conditions of discharge bring him within the scope of section 3304(f)(1)--may compete for a vacancy whenever the hiring agency will accept applications from outside its own workforce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we find that the <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span> interpretation described above, under which individuals covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) would not be permitted to compete when they are outside the "area of consideration" stated in the vacancy announcement, is not entitled to deference. Because the agency in this case indicated in its vacancy announcement that it would accept applications from individuals not employed by DHS, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) prohibited it from declining to consider the appellant on the ground that he was not currently employed at FLETC.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note further that permitting agencies to exclude VEOA applicants who are outside the "area of consideration" could make 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) meaningless. While the agency in this case has defined the term "area of consideration" as "the geographical and/or organizational area from which applicants are being sought," agencies arguably could define the term much more broadly. OPM's regulations do not appear to include a definition of "area of consideration," and the term has been used to refer to language restricting consideration on the basis of factors such as civilian and competitive status, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Brown v. Department of the Navy</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 9, <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 199 Fed. Appx. 949 (Fed. Cir. 2006). If an agency were free to exclude VEOA candidates on the basis of any factor used in the vacancy announcement to limit sources of applicants, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) would permit covered individuals to compete only for those vacancies for which they would be permitted to compete even in the absence of that provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Initial Appointment</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues that the appellant is not entitled to compete as a VEOA candidate because "VEOA was specifically intended to open up opportunities for veterans that would otherwise be closed to them because the agency was limiting its [vacancy announcement] to...candidates" with competitive status. In support of this argument, the agency notes that DoL took the same position in its decision on the appellant's complaint. As noted above, it also has submitted a copy of OPM's <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span>. That issuance includes the following statements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The VEOA was specifically intended to open up opportunities for veterans that would OTHERWISE be closed to them because the agency was limiting its announcement to so-called "status" candidates.... The VEOA is not a noncompetitive-entry authority like the VRA where an employee could be given a new appointment at a higher grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">VetGuide</span>, &#x00A7; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the statements quoted above reflect the views of OPM, the agency responsible for implementing this provision, and while they support the position taken by the agency in this case, we find that they, like the other <span class="Italic">VetGuide</span> statements quoted above, are not entitled to any special deference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we note that the statements quoted above are not supported by any explanation or by reference to any authority. They appear likely, moreover, to have been based on the same version of section 3304(f)(1) that was the subject of the House report cited above. We have noted previously that this earlier version specifically prohibited excluding covered individuals from competition "by reason of...(A) not having acquired competitive status; or (B) not being an employee of" the hiring agency. H. Rep. No. 105-40 (1997). This language appears to have been prompted by a concern that veterans were being denied an opportunity to enter federal employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., id.</span> (some veterans were being "excluded from competition for many government jobs" because "agencies frequently restrict competition for positions to 'status' candidates (primarily those who are already Federal civilian employees) or, more narrowly, to those in the agency's own workforce")[4] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The committee report cited above also referred to a statement, by an official of the Disabled American Veterans, that "the legislation appropriately prevents agencies from barring many veterans from competing for civilian jobs simply because they are not currently civilian employees"; and it stated that the proposed "provision would result in agencies adding to the Federal Job Opportunities List positions that otherwise would be filled by employees who work for the agency or elsewhere in the federal government." H. Rep. 105-40 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have noted above, however, that the language approved by the House committee was not included in the enacted version of section 3304(f)(1), and that the enacted version instead provided broader rights to covered individuals. Under the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), all covered individuals must be permitted to compete when applications will be accepted from persons outside the hiring agency's workforce. We hold, therefore, that section 3304(f)(1) covers current employees along with those seeking initial federal appointments. Accordingly, the appellant was entitled to compete under the vacancy announcement at issue here despite the fact that he was a federal employee at the time of his application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">VEOA Remedy</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a), an agency may be required to award an individual compensation for any loss of wages or benefits the individual suffered as a result of the violation of his veteran preference rights. The record provides an insufficient basis, however, for determining whether the appellant suffered any such loss. That is, it does not show whether the appellant met the qualification requirements for the position for which he applied or whether, if he did meet those requirements and if he had received the consideration to which he was entitled under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), he would have been appointed to that position. Under these circumstances, the appropriate remedy is to order the agency to determine whether the appellant was qualified for the position in question, and, if he is found qualified, to reconstruct the selection process for that position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a); <span class="Italic">Deems v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-19 (2005).</p>

Also remanded for consideration in <span class="Italic">Montee</span> was the question of whether the position sought by the appellant was covered by 10 USC 1601(b), allowing appointment of individuals in the Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System without regard to 5 USC 3304(f)(1), the predicate of the appellant's VEOA claim.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2003, Congress authorized creating an advisory panel "to review laws and regulations regarding the use of commercial practices, performance-based contracting, the performance of acquisition functions across agency lines of responsibility, and the use of Governmentwide contracts." National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-136, &#x00A7; 1423, 117 Stat. 1392, 1669 (2003). Subsequently, the panel issued a more than 400-page report, finding that the "existing federal acquisition workforce falls seriously short of the capacity needed to meet the demands that have been placed on it." <span class="Italic">Report of the Acquisition Advisory Panel to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and the U.S. Congress</span> (January 2007), at 372-73, <a href="https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/page_file_uploads/ACQUISITION-ADVISORY-PANEL-2007-Report_final.pdf">https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/page_file_uploads/ACQUISITION-ADVISORY-PANEL-2007-Report_final.pdf</a>. In that report, the panel recommended, among other things, that the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and agencies "need to identify and eliminate obstacles to speedy hiring of acquisition workforce personnel." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 339.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based in part on the panel's findings and recommendations, Congress created the Department of Defense (DOD) Acquisition Workforce Development Fund in 2008 "to provide funds, in addition to other funds that may be available, for the recruitment, training, and retention of acquisition personnel" and "to ensure that the [DOD] acquisition workforce has the capacity, in both personnel and skills, needed to properly perform its mission, provide appropriate oversight of contractor performance, and ensure that [DOD] receives the best value for the expenditure of public resources." National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, &#x00A7; 852, 122 Stat. 3 (2008) (codified at 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(a)-(b)); <span class="Italic">see</span> 153 Cong. Rec. S12365-67 (daily ed. Oct. 1, 2007) (statement of Sen. Levin). Congress subsequently amended 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705 to add subsection (h), which created an expedited hiring authority to allow the Secretary of Defense to designate any category of acquisition positions within DOD as "shortage category positions" and to "recruit and appoint highly qualified persons directly to such designated positions." Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, Pub. L. No. 110-417, &#x00A7; 833, 122 Stat. 4356 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant version of the expedited hiring authority, found at 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f),[5] states that, for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304 (and other statutes that are not implicated in this matter), the Secretary of Defense "<span id="Page_700"></span>may...designate any category of positions in the acquisition workforce as positions for which there exists a shortage of candidates or there is a critical hiring need" and "utilize the authorities in such sections to recruit and appoint qualified persons directly to positions so designated." 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f)(1)-(2). In turn, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(3) provides that the President may prescribe rules providing agencies with authority "without regard to the provisions of sections 3309 through 3318,"[6] to appoint candidates directly to positions for which "public notice has been given" and OPM has determined that there exists "a severe shortage of candidates" or that there is "a critical hiring need." Therefore, if properly invoked, the agency's use of the expedited hiring authority at 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f) would allow it to recruit and appoint individuals to categories of positions in the acquisition workforce that the Secretary of Defense has designated as having a shortage of candidates or a critical hiring need without regard to the veterans' preference rights and benefits identified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309 through 3318.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Subsection (h) of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705 was later redesignated as section 1705(g) in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, Pub. L. No. 112-239, &#x00A7; 803, 126 Stat. 1632, 1825 (2013), and then as subsection (f) by the NDAA of 2018, as indicated above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Sections 3309 through 3318 of title 5 concern examinations, registers, certifications, and selections of individuals in the competitive service and the additional benefits provided to preference eligibles competing for such positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;In its implementation procedures for the expedited hiring authority, the agency stated that it would "[m]ake employment offers to qualified candidates with veterans' preference whenever practicable." The certificate of eligibles reflects that the selectee was entitled to veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends on review that the agency did not give notice of its use of the expedited hiring authority found at 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f), nor did OPM make any of the requisite determinations pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(3); therefore, he asserts that the agency could not have properly used the expedited hiring authority to fill the position at issue. These arguments are not persuasive. The administrative judge found, and the appellant does not dispute, that the vacancy announcement for the Safety and Occupational Health Specialist position was publicly advertised and posted on USAJOBS. On review, the appellant references a DCMA webpage, which he included below, that provides public notice for expedited hiring authority for acquisition positions. The appellant contends that, because the webpage does not list the position at issue or the 0018 series, the agency did not intend to include the position at issue in its public notice. The appellant's reference to a single DCMA webpage, which appears to have been updated in February 2014, after the relevant events in this matter, does not warrant a different outcome in this case. Instead, we find that the agency's posting the vacancy announcement for the Safety and Occupational Health Specialist position on USAJOBS, coupled with its announcing that it would use the expedited hiring authority to fill the position and designating the position as an acquisition position, constitutes sufficient public notice pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(3). We modify the initial decision accordingly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also addressed the absence of a determination by OPM that there was a shortage of candidates or a critical hiring need. In pertinent part, the administrative judge noted that he was not aware of, nor did the parties cite, any binding precedent that addressed the interaction of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705 and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304. The administrative judge further noted that the Board relies on precedent from the U.S. Supreme Court, which states that a court being confronted with statutes capable of coexistence has a duty to regard each as effective. <span class="Italic">Isabella v. Department of State</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 12 (2008) (citing <span class="Italic">Morton v. Mancari</span>, 417 U.S. 535, 551 (1974)). Applying this precedent, the administrative judge found that lacking an OPM determination in this regard was not dispositive because Congress specifically gave the Secretary of Defense, through 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705, direct authority to make determinations about the agency's acquisition workforce. We supplement the administrative judge's analysis because the statutory provision at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(3) became effective several years before the expedited hiring authority at 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f) was created. <span class="Italic">See Dean v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 15 n.4 (2006). Congress is presumed to be knowledgeable about existing laws pertinent to the legislation it enacts. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Mahnke</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 13, 17 n.5 (1992); <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 420, 431 (1980). Accordingly, we presume that when Congress enacted 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f), it was aware of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(3) and intended to depart from its general requirements. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that OPM need not determine if there exists a shortage of candidates or a critical hiring need before the Secretary of Defense can use the expedited hiring authority at 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f) to recruit and appoint qualified persons to fill certain positions in the acquisition workforce for which there exists a shortage of candidates or a critical hiring need.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also have considered the appellant's assertion that the authority to designate acquisition workforce positions was not properly delegated and that the Safety and Occupational Health Specialist position at issue was not an "acquisition workforce" position. The record reflects that the Secretary of Defense delegated the authority of the statute at 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f) to DOD Component Heads, Directors of the Defense Agencies, and Directors of the DOD Field Activities "with independent appointing authority for themselves and their serviced organizations," and the authority may be further redelegated. Moreover, the Director of the DCMA Contract Safety Group (Director) declared, under penalty of perjury, that guidance from the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in 1994 advised that Safety and Occupational Health Specialist positions were to be included in the acquisition workforce.[8] He further declared there was a "critical hiring need and a shortage of qualified candidates" for the Safety and Occupational Health position at issue because it required a specific set of skills with a background in aviation ground safety, munitions and explosives, and industrial safety, and those skills were difficult to find in Utah, the geographic area where the agency was filling the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The Director in his declaration explained that the DCMA was part of the DLA prior to 2000. <span class="Italic">See O'Connor v. United States</span>, 308 F.3d 1233, 1236 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (noting that the DCMA was once part of the DLA). The appellant has not persuaded us that there was any error in the agency's reliance on this guidance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the administrative judge that the position at issue was properly designated as an "acquisition workforce" position. The term "acquisition workforce" is defined in 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(g) as, among other things, "[p]ersonnel in positions designated under section 1721 of this title as acquisition positions." The statute at 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1721(b)(3) identifies several categories of acquisition-related positions, including in the areas of "[p]rocurement, including contracting." The Director declared that the position at issue was in the Contract Safety Group, the mission of which is to perform safety assessments and surveillance of defense contractors; that employees of the Group act as agents of the Administrative Contracting Officer and are responsible for ensuring that Government contractors comply with contractual requirements; and that the duties of contract administration surveillance fall within the acquisition category of "Production, Quality, and [Manufacturing (PQM)]." The agency's implementation procedures for the expedited hiring authority indicate that the PQM category was designated as a category of acquisition positions pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1721. Moreover, the position description for the Safety and Occupational Health position at issue and the job announcement both explicitly state that the position is an acquisition position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find that the authority to designate positions in the acquisition workforce was properly delegated, the Safety and Occupational Health position in question was in the "acquisition workforce," and the agency determined that there was a critical need and a shortage of candidates for the position, the agency properly utilized the expedited hiring authority found at 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f) to fill the vacancy. The agency's properly invoking the expedited hiring authority means that the position in question was not subject to the veterans' preference statutes that the appellant claims were violated. Thus, we find that the appellant did not prove by preponderant evidence that the agency violated a statute or regulation related to veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Expedited hiring authority, and associated direct hire authority, were validly employed, with no VEOA violation, in <span class="Italic">Williams v. DOD</span>, 2022 MSPB 29, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-12 (2022) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP), post):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 14, 2018, the agency announced seven competitive service vacancies for GS-9 Logistics Management Specialists in its Missile Defense Agency. The vacancies were open to the public, and the announcement provided that "this position is being filled under the Acquisition Expedited Hiring Authority...using [the Office of Personnel Management's] Direct Hire Authority."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a preference-eligible veteran with a 30% service-connected disability, applied for the position. The agency found the appellant qualified for the position, but after scoring his application, it found him not among the best qualified applicants, so he was not selected for an interview....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue in this appeal is whether the agency's recruitment and selection process for Logistics Management Specialists violated any law related to veterans' preference. Specifically, the appellant appears to argue that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3308, 3309, 3311, 3318, and 3313 or 3317.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3308 of title 5 of the United States Code is a law relating to veterans' preference that, with certain exceptions, prohibits the prescription of minimum educational requirements for competitive service positions. <span class="Italic">See Dean v. Department of Labor</span>, 808 F.3d 497, 503-05 (Fed. Cir. 2015). Although the appellant in this case appears to have alleged a violation of this section for the first time on review, we nevertheless exercise our <span id="Page_701"></span>discretion to address it. <span class="Italic">Cf. Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980) (stating that the Board will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence). The appellant argues that the agency violated this provision by assessing the applicants' educational history in its selection process. The record is clear that the agency considered education in evaluating the applications. However, we find that considering education as one factor among many in assessing qualified applicants is not the same as prescribing a "minimum educational requirement." In fact, the vacancy announcement itself explained that applicants may qualify through either education or experience. We therefore find that the agency did not prescribe a minimum education requirement for the Logistics Management Specialist position, and we modify the initial decision to find that the agency did not violate the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3308 by considering education as a factor in rating and ranking the applicants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the remainder of the claimed veterans' preference violations, it appears to be undisputed that the agency did not generally adhere to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309-3318 in the selection process at issue. Whether the agency failed to follow any of these particular requirements or whether such requirements were invoked by the facts of the case is secondary to the primary issue of whether the agency was exempted from following those requirements at all. The administrative judge found that the hiring process at issue was exempted because the Logistics Management Specialists were appointed pursuant to the Direct Hire Authority provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(3) via the agency's Expedited Hiring Authority of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f). Section 3304(a)(3) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;The President may prescribe rules which shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;authority for agencies to appoint, without regard to the provisions of sections 3309 through 3318, candidates directly to positions for which-</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(A)&#x2003;public notice has been given; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(B)&#x2003;the Office of Personnel Management has determined that there exists a severe shortage of candidates...or that there is a critical hiring need.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(3). The agency in this case has special statutory authorization to determine for itself any category of positions within its acquisition workforce for which there exists a severe shortage of candidates or for which there is a critical hiring need and to use the Direct Hire Authority of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(3) to fill such positions.[1] 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f). This is known as the agency's "Expedited Hiring Authority." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;It would appear that the Logistics Management Specialist is an acquisition position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1705(g)(1), 1721(b)(5).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge found that the agency properly invoked its Expedited Hiring Authority to fill the Logistics Management Specialist positions by direct hire and that the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309-3318 therefore did not apply. The appellant does not dispute that the agency's Expedited Hiring Authority was properly invoked, but he argues that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309-3318 nevertheless apply. First, he argues that the agency's Expedited Hiring Authority is distinct from its Direct Hire Authority and that the agency used the former to fill the positions and not the latter. However, it would be misleading to think of the Expedited Hiring Authority and the Direct Hire Authority as two distinct and mutually exclusive hiring authorities. Rather, as explained above, the Expedited Hiring Authority provisions of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f) merely authorize the agency to invoke, under certain circumstances, the Direct Hire Authority provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(3) without first seeking permission from the Office of Personnel Management. This is precisely what the agency did in this case, as reflected in the vacancy announcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the appellant cites to agency guidance concerning expedited hiring in the acquisition workforce, agency guidance concerning the expedited hiring of healthcare professionals, and Department of the Navy guidance concerning expedited hiring in select acquisition positions. He argues that these documents show that the agency intended for veterans' preference to apply under its Expedited Hiring Authority. Regarding the agency's acquisition workforce guidance, the appellant argues that it states "[q]ualified candidates with veterans' preference should be considered for appointments when they are found to best meet mission requirements," thereby indicating that the Secretary of Defense intended for veterans' preference to apply in expedited hiring. We disagree. Requiring that qualified preference eligibles be considered for appointment is not the same as requiring veterans' preference, much less that the agency follow the specific statutory provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309-3318. Rather, we find that the requirement to consider preference-eligible applicants is analogous to the right to compete in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), which mandates that covered veterans be allowed to compete on equal footing with other candidates in the merit promotion process. <span class="Italic">See Downs v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 139, &#x00B6; 13 (2008) (finding that the right to compete does not entail point preferences when it comes to ranking applicants). Regarding the guidance that the appellant has submitted on review, we find that it does not apply to his situation because a Logistics Management Specialist is not a healthcare position, and the appellant was not applying for a position within the Department of the Navy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, the appellant disputes the accuracy of testimony provided by an agency Human Resources Specialist, who testified that no delegated examining authority was used to fill the positions at issue. We find, however, that this testimony was accurate. As explained above, the agency filled these positions under its 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f) statutory authority, which was conferred directly to the agency by Congress and not delegated to it by the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fourth and finally, the appellant disputes the administrative judge's ruling to disallow testimony about whether the agency followed the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309-3318. The appellant's objection is based, however, on the premise that these sections applied to the selection process at issue, which as explained above, they did not. We find that the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to hear such testimony because it would have been immaterial to the outcome of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Grubb v. Department of the Interior</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 361, &#x00B6; 27 (2004); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(8), (10).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Affirming the Board, <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), a preference-eligible veteran "may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions." The Navy did not deny Mr. Williams the right to compete for the contract specialist position. He had the opportunity to apply for the position, and the Navy considered his application. The Navy simply elected not to forward Mr. Williams' application to the hiring manager because he was not among the "best qualified" candidates as compared to other preference-eligible veterans. Veterans' preference rights do not confer entitlement to a position, only the right to compete. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(3) (providing that &#x00A7; 3304(f) does not "confer an entitlement to veterans' preference that is not otherwise required by law"), &#x00A7; 3304(f)(2) (noting that "<span class="Italic">if selected</span>, a preference eligible...shall receive a career or career-conditional appointment" (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor did the Navy violate Mr. Williams' rights by closing the position and filling it under its EHA procedures. Section 3304(a)(3) permits the Navy to cancel a vacancy listing and fill the position without regard to veterans' preference rights. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(a)(3); <span class="Italic">see</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1705(f) (establishing EHA); <span class="Italic">see also Abell v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (holding veterans' preference rights do not require agency to hire from certificate and fill vacancies). The Navy, therefore, did not violate Mr. Williams' rights by closing the listing without hiring him and then hiring someone else pursuant to EHA procedures. Moreover, because &#x00A7; 3304(a)(3) permits filling vacancies pursuant to EHA procedures without regard to veterans' preference rights, the Navy did not violate Mr. Williams' pass-over rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318.</p>
