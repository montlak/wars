<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-37"><span class="space">1.</span> Agreement Challenged as Invalid; Use of PFR</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Once a settlement is accepted by the AJ, the appeal is ordinarily dismissed as settled through an initial decision. The appellant may file a petition for review from that initial decision if he believes that the settlement is the product of fraud, duress, or mutual mistake, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Keith v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 668, 669-70 (1993), or if he believes it to be unlawful or otherwise involuntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pugh v. USPS</span>, 91 MSPR 578, 581 &#x00B6; 5 (2002). Added to the usual bases for challenges to settlements claimed to be obtained by fraud or mutual mistake, is the challenge that the agreement provides nothing of value to the appellant. "For a waiver of Board appeal rights to be enforceable, the agency must provide some consideration to the appellant in exchange for the waiver." <span class="Italic">Swidecki v. USPS</span>, 101 MSPR 110, 120 &#x00B6; 23, 2006 MSPB 21 (2006). Another possible challenge may be the improper pressure or bias of an AJ. <span class="Italic">Woo v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 317, 320 (1987) (finding no impropriety). The challenge must be substantial. <span class="Italic">Tucker v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 376, 378 (1987), determined to be insufficient unelaborated allegations that an appellant who tried to set aside a settlement was not adequately represented and that the agreement was not freely entered or lawful. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McNamee</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Alphonse v. Dept. of Army</span>, 71 MSPR 241, 243 (1996) ("The appellant's bare assertion of coercion in his petition for review is insufficient to overcome the evidence that he voluntarily entered into the agreement."). "Even if invalidity was not apparent at the time of settlement, the agreement must be set aside if it is subsequently shown by new evidence that the agreement was tainted with invalidity by fraud or misrepresentation." <span class="Italic">Garcia v. DOD,</span> DE-0432-11-0414-I-1 (NP 4/30/2012) (citing <span class="Italic">Wofford v. DOJ</span>, 115 MSPR 468, 471 &#x00B6; 6 (2010)). [Refer in Chapter 5 to "Challenges to Settlement."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The challenge should not be collateral. If an appellant settles an adverse action by resigning or retiring, he should not then file an appeal from the retirement on the basis that the original settlement was tainted by coercion. He should use a PFR to challenge the initial decision approving the settlement leading to the retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 56 MSPR 69, 72 (1992) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Lamb v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 470, 475 (1990)); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Mann v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-11-0736-C-1 (NP 6/24/2014) (appellant's cross-PFR responding to an agency PFR challenging an initial decision on a compliance issue was the wrong time for raising a challenge to the underlying validity of the settlement; that challenge should have been made when the settlement was first accepted into the record by the AJ's initial decision). [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-045.html#sec16-46">Coercion or Bias by Judge</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-23-046.html#sec16-47">Coercion by Counsel or Union Representative; Lack of Signature by Counsel</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board tends to reject assertions that settlements should be set aside because they are unconscionable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Forston v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 154, 160 (1993). A unilateral mistake is insufficient to set aside a settlement. Instead, the Board looks for mutual mistake, coercion, or conduct that suggests the appellant was fraudulently induced to settle his appeal. Coercion is measured by the circumstances surrounding the settlement, not by allegations of harassment experienced by the appellant during her employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bowie v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 42, 46 (1996) (arguments relating to the merits of an appeal are not probative of whether a settlement was coerced); <span class="Italic">Landreville v. DHHS</span>, 63 MSPR 282, 284 (1994) (treating objections to a settlement as a PFR; dismissing the PFR when the appellant's arguments addressed the merits of her removal and did not states bases leading to invalidation of the agreement or problems pertaining to compliance with the agreement); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bland v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 71 MSPR 388, 391 (1996) ("To establish that a settlement agreement was fraudulent as the result of coercion or duress, he must prove that he involuntarily accepted the other party's terms, that circumstances permitted no alternative, and that such circumstances were the result of the other party's coercive acts."). An appellant's "bare assertion" that he was deceived by an agency, unsupported by facts or evidence, does not provide a basis for setting aside the agreement. <span class="Italic">Lasker v. DOJ</span>, 74 MSPR 189, 191 (1997); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Devera v. Smithsonian Inst</span>., 217 Fed. Appx. 964, 965 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP) ("bare allegation" of coercion is insufficient to shift the burden of proof on coercion).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Addison v. Dept. of Navy,</span> DC-0752-11-0257-C-1 (NP 1/6/2012), pointed out that a settlement is not undermined by arguments that the agency's underlying case against the appellant was unfounded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party challenging the validity of a settlement agreement bears a heavy burden of showing that the agreement is unlawful, or that it was the result of fraud, coercion, or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 142 F.3d 1463, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 580, &#x00B6; 5 (1999). The appellant's assertion of innocence of the misconduct supporting the agency's removal action is unavailing because, by entering into the settlement agreement, the appellant waived his right to litigate any issues related to the removal action. <span class="Italic">See Burks v. Department of the Interior</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 423, &#x00B6; 4 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 243 F.3d 566 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table); <span class="Italic">Landreville v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 282, 284 (1994), <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed,</span> 47 F.3d 1179 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, although an appellant may establish that a settlement agreement was coerced and, thus, involuntary, by establishing that the agency threatened to take a future disciplinary action that it knew or should have known could not be substantiated, <span class="Italic">see Wyatt v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 28, &#x00B6; 19 (2006), bare allegations of coercion are not sufficient to set aside a settlement agreement, <span class="Italic">Tiburzi v. Department of Justice</span>, 269 F.3d 1346, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The appellant simply claims on review that he is innocent of the misconduct set forth in the agency's removal action charges. However, the record contains surveillance video recordings supporting the first and second charges and it contains documentary evidence supporting the agency's third charge. Thus, the appellant has failed to establish that the agency knew or should have known that the misconduct supporting its removal action could not be sustained and his bare allegation of innocence is not sufficient to set aside the parties' settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Tiburzi</span>, 269 F.3d at 1355.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As explained in <span class="Italic">Perkins v. VA</span>, 101 MSPR 642, 644 &#x00B6; 4, 2006 MSPB 114 (2006), in the prior subsection, a settlement may be set aside through a PFR if it is found to be invalid, or the settlement may be set aside through a petition for enforcement if it was materially breached. The distinction in the two procedures and approaches was summarized, <span class="Italic">Altman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 87 MSPR 116, 120-21 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of her argument that the documents she filed with the Office of the Clerk of the Board after her appeal was dismissed as settled should <span id="Page_4796"></span>have been handled as a petition for review, instead of as a petition for enforcement, the appellant indicates that she intended, when filing those documents, to have her appeal reinstated based on the agency's failure to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement. However, with respect to settlement agreements, it is the nature of the complaint, not the requested relief, that determines whether a pleading is properly characterized and processed as a petition for enforcement or a petition for appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, after an administrative judge issues an initial decision dismissing an appeal as settled, the appellant subsequently alleges that the appeal should be reinstated because the settlement agreement was invalid, the Board treats the allegation as a petition for review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.4(g); <span class="Italic">Virgil v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 75 MSPR 109, 112 (1997) (an attack on the validity of a settlement agreement must be made through a petition for review of the initial decision dismissing the appeal as settled). If the Board agrees that the settlement agreement was invalid, the usual remedy is to set the agreement aside and reinstate the appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Velarde v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 72 MSPR 110, 115 (1996). If, on the other hand, the appellant files a pleading which alleges that the other party breached a settlement agreement, but which does not contend that the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appeal pursuant to the agreement, the pleading is, in substance, a petition for enforcement, which should be considered initially by the regional office. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Trotta v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 MSPR 6, 9 (1997) (as a general rule, a petition for enforcement is the proper mechanism for obtaining relief where a party alleges breach of a settlement agreement); <span class="Italic">Sena v. Department of Defense,</span> 66 MSPR 458, 463 (1995). The reinstatement of an appeal is a remedy an appellant may elect if the agency has been found to have violated the terms of the agreement settling the appeal. <span class="Italic">Wonderly v. Department of the Navy,</span> 68 MSPR 529, 532 (1995). The issue of whether there has been such a violation, however, is a matter for determination in a petition for enforcement<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.182(a)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stasiuk v. Dept. of Army</span>, 118 MSPR 1, 3 n.1, 2012 MSPB 48 (2012) ("To the extent he is challenging the validity of the settlement agreement, such an attack cannot be raised in a compliance proceeding; it must be alleged in a petition for review of the initial decision that dismissed the appeal pursuant to the settlement. <span class="Italic">Wofford v. Department of Justice</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 367, &#x00B6; 9 (2010); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Vance v. Department of the Interior</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 6 (2010) (when a petition for enforcement unmistakably challenges the validity of the settlement agreement, the Board will treat it as a petition for review).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The distinction in use of the PFR process and enforcement proceedings to deal with problematic settlements has caused confusion among practitioners and <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigants, since either process can result in an agreement being set aside, depending on the nature of the problem and how that problem is characterized in the pleading to the Board's central office (PFR) or regional or field office (enforcement petition). The confusion may occur because if there is a material breach of the agreement accepted into the Board record for purposes of enforcement, the nonbreaching party may use the Board's enforcement process at the regional office level to either remedy the breach or, at the option of the nonbreaching party, set the agreement aside and return to litigation of the underlying appeal. Use of an enforcement petition to set an agreement aside by reason of breach is not intuitive. Nor is there a bright line separating an agreement that contains a mutual mistake, addressed through a PFR, and a claim that an ambiguous provision has been misapplied, leading to breach of the agreement. In <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Army</span>, 112 MSPR 689, 694 &#x00B6; 12, 2009 MSPB 237 (2009), the Board at least noted that "where an appellant's petition for enforcement 'unmistakably' challenges the validity of the agreement, the Board will treat it as a petition for review." [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-035.html#sec16-36">Setting Aside a Settlement</a>" and to later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-23-063.html#sec16-63">Enforcement Petition to Rescind Settlement; Late PFR Raising Enforcement Issue.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The discussion that follows assumes that an attempt to set aside a settlement agreement is within the Board's enforcement jurisdiction. If jurisdiction over the settlement is in doubt, the Board may remand the case for a jurisdictional determination by the AJ before moving on to whether the agreement should be set aside. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jarman v. SBA</span>, 44 MSPR 514, 516-17 (1990) (to consider a challenge to the validity of a settlement agreement resolving a Board appeal from constructive removal, the AJ should first determine if the Board had jurisdiction over the underlying appeal concerning the voluntariness of the appellant's separation; assuming jurisdiction, the AJ would then properly consider whether the settlement should be set aside due to fraud, mutual mistake, or coercion); <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. VA</span>, 39 MSPR 534, 537 (1989) (AJ accepted settlement of a case involving constructive adverse action and probationary jurisdictional issues; the AJ should have made a jurisdictional determination before accepting the agreement, but instead reserved jurisdictional issues until a question of enforcement arose). [But refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-016.html#sec16-17">Jurisdiction to Accept Settlement: <span class="Italic">Delorme</span></a>," for current rule concerning acceptance of settlements without a jurisdictional determination.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ordinarily the Board reviews challenges to settlements incorporated into the Board record of an appeal within the Board's jurisdiction. With the caveat that the jurisdictional analysis has changed under <span class="Italic">Delorme, supra</span>, the Board "has no authority to enforce or invalidate a settlement agreement that has not been incorporated into the record of an appeal over which the Board has jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grunfelder v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 119, 122 n.2 (1992). But the Board has the authority to consider an unfiled settlement agreement to determine if the right to appeal was waived as to a matter otherwise within its jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">King v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 60, 64-65 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may set aside a settlement agreement if a party shows that it is tainted by fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Asberry v. United States Postal Service</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Jennings</span>, 44 MSPR 1, 3 (1990). The statement by the administrative judge that is quoted above seems to reflect a belief that this authority exists only if the settlement agreement in question has been entered into the record of an appeal to the Board. Any such belief, however, would be incorrect. The Board also has the authority to consider the validity of settlement agreements not entered into the record as those agreements affect appeal rights to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Koczan v. Department of the Army</span>, 42 MSPR 160, 162-66 (1989) (Board considered whether employee's waiver of her appeal rights, in settlement agreement into which parties entered before action that was subject of appeal was effected, was made ineffective by invalidity of settlement agreement). We find that the administrative judge in this appeal should have considered whether the settlement agreement at issue here was invalid, and whether the reassignment to which the appellant agreed, therefore, did not preclude Board jurisdiction over his subsequent removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ferby v. United States Postal Service</span>, 26 MSPR 451, 454-56 (1985) (Board considered whether employee's waiver of his appeal rights was made ineffective by invalidity of settlement agreement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-160.html#sec2-158">Waiver of Appeal Through Last Chance or Other Preappeal Agreement</a>"; refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-058.html#sec16-58">Unfiled Settlement Agreement; Preappeal Settlement</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once a settlement is filed and accepted by the Board, the appellant who seeks to avoid the settlement must then show that it is tainted with invalidity, either by fraud practiced upon him or by a mutual mistake acted upon by both parties. <span class="Italic">Wells v. Dept. of Army</span>, 74 MSPR 266, 268 (1997) ("[a]ppellant's general allegations of bad faith and coercion by the agency and the administrative judge are not contained in an affidavit or sworn statement and are unsupported by any corroborating evidence.... The appellant...has not carried the heavy burden of making a specific showing that the agreement is tainted with invalidity by fraud, coercion, or mutual mistake[.]"); <span class="Italic">McNamee v. VA</span>, 39 MSPR 530, 533 (1989) (appellant's mere allegation that an agreement was somehow unfair does not show that it was invalid because of fraud or mutual mistake); <span class="Italic">Morris v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 358, 360 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Asberry v. USPS</span>, 692 F.2d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1982)); <span class="Italic">Lassiter v. Dept. of Army</span>, 26 MSPR 495, 497-98 (1985) (appellant's attorney indicated that he understood the settlement terms; there was no evidence of agency misrepresentation concerning the type of position that the appellant would receive); <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 23 MSPR 195, 198 (1984) ("There is nothing in the record which shows that appellant did not enter into this agreement voluntarily and in the company of his attorney.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because statutory requirements take precedence over the terms of a negotiated agreement, if a settlement relies on provisions of a negotiated agreement that defeat statutory rights, on challenge the result may be that the agreement will be set aside because of mutual mistake if a material provision of the agreement is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 48, 53-54 (1990) (conflict between the statutory and contractual provisions governing reemployment rights). However, if the settlement contains a provision that is unenforceable or unlawful, the Board will likely not set the agreement aside if the improper provision is not an essential part of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Butler v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 1, 3-4 (1993) (declining to rule as invalid a last chance settlement agreement that contained a provision that the appellant agreed to waive his right of appeal and also agreed to an unenforceable provision: to pay the agency's costs as a result of any appeal). [Refer to the earlier discussion, "<a href="0100-2023-23-026.html#sec16-27">Waiver of Statutory Rights; Release</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulations governing the form and timing of petitions for review are followed when the challenge to the agreement is its invalidity, and the PFR is a challenge to the initial decision that accepted the allegedly invalid settlement. The appellant's challenge to an agreement as coerced should be made through a PFR immediately following the AJ's initial decision dismissing the appeal as settled. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mullins v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 79 MSPR 206, 210 &#x00A7; 7 (1998). The Board is generally unforgiving of late PFRs, and that includes PFRs used to set aside settlements. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Eagleheart v. USPS</span>, 102 MSPR 672, 2006 MSPB 229 (2006) (declining to excuse belated PFR for several reasons offered by appellant, including awaiting the determination on a related grievance proceeding, alleged confusion over appeal rights, and dissatisfaction with terms of a settlement agreement). [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-031.html#sec5-32">Petition For Review; Reconsideration</a>," for the form and timing of petitions for review.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the PFR challenging a settlement is not timely, the PFR will not be considered unless there is good cause for excusing the delay in filing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nease v. Dept. of Army</span>, 68 MSPR 365, 368 (1995) (disappointment in the outcome of a settlement was not a valid basis for delaying a PFR); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Trice v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 73, 74 &#x00B6; 3 (2000) (enforcement petition sought relief but also alleged that a settlement was entered as a result of duress; AJ forwarded the issue of duress <span id="Page_4797"></span>to Board for consideration of PFR of the initial decision dismissing the appeal pursuant to settlement); <span class="Italic">Zelmer v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 64, 66 (1989) (treating as PFR an enforcement petition that sought to set a settlement aside as invalid; PFR was untimely filed). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Hardy v. USPS</span>, 76 F.3d 366, 368 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (suggesting that mental incompetence may justify the delay of an attack on the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of a settlement), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Hardy v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 71, 76 (1996) (determining that appellant had not made a nonfrivolous allegation of incapacity); <span class="Italic">Velarde v. VA</span>, 72 MSPR 110, 114 (1996) (Board accepted belated challenge to a settlement from an appellant who had history of a potential mental or emotional condition and who, on learning of the theory of setting aside the agreement due to her counsel's alleged lack of authority, filed her protest with the Board within 24 days); <span class="Italic">Nagel v. OPM</span>, 70 MSPR 371, 374 (1996) (belated reopening of the decision approving a settlement could be appropriate if the Board were presented with sufficient allegations of fraud or mental incapacity at the time the agreement was signed). <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. VA</span>, 79 MSPR 42, 45-46 (1998), noted the limitations of <span class="Italic">Velarde</span> and kindred decisions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the Board has previously stated that an appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status on review, and evidence of some disabling mental condition, are legitimate factors to be considered in deciding whether to exercise the Board's discretionary authority to remand for further findings<span class="Italic">. Ford</span>, 69 MSPR at 274 (incompetency suggested below by appointment of conservator by appellant); <span class="Italic">see Velarde v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 72 MSPR 110, 112, 114 (1996) (appellant alleged depression disabled her from attending hearings where settlement agreed to by her attorney). Although the appellant in the instant case is unrepresented, there is no indication that his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status has adversely affected his ability to pursue his petition. And while there is some evidence that he was treated for depression in 1995 and 1996, this evidence nowhere suggests the appellant's incompetency at any point in these proceedings. <span class="Italic">Cf. Visconti v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 78 MSPR 17, 19-20 (1998) (evidence of appellant's bipolar disorder did not permit inference of incompetency absent allegation of incapacity or medical evidence addressing incompetency); <span class="Italic">Larry v. Department of Justice</span>, 76 MSPR 348, 353 (1997) (appellant never alleged incompetency; absent medical evidence addressing mental incompetency, evidence of Employee Assistance Program counseling insufficient to require AJ to address issue).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, without sufficient evidence suggesting the appellant's incapacity to assent to or authorize settlement based upon his mental condition, and in the absence of evidence to rebut his attorney's unequivocal representations of his authority to enter into this settlement, we find that the appellant has not rebutted the presumption that his attorney of road possessed authority to settle this case on his client's behalf.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A reviewing court is no more excited about the prospect of undoing a settlement than the Board. A challenge to the voluntariness of a settlement will be reviewed in court under the same standard applicable to other Board decisions. <span class="Italic">Stivale v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 86-628).</p>
