<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-113"><span class="space">a.</span> Effect of Receipt of FECA and Insurance Benefits on Recovery of Compensatory Damages</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sloan v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 58, 65-70 (1997), decided that receipt of workers' compensation benefits for the disabling effects of discriminatory acts did not preclude assessment of compensatory damages for nonpecuniary losses:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record evidence shows that the appellant's award of benefits under FECA and her claim for compensatory damages under Title VII both arise from the same injury. The threshold question therefore is whether receipt of FECA benefits for a work-related injury precludes an award of compensatory damages for unlawful discrimination arising out of that same injury. We begin our analysis by comparing the benefits provided by FECA with the types of damages available under Title VII.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FECA does not provide for payment of nonpecuniary damages. Rather, FECA provides for "the payment of compensation for wage loss and for permanent impairment of specified members and functions of the body incurred by employees as a result of an injury sustained while in the performance of their duties in service to the United States."[2] 20 CFR &#x00A7; 10.1(b); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8102, 8105-08. In addition, FECA provides that <span id="Page_4941"></span>"eligible employees are entitled to receive, at reasonable expense to the United States, medical and related services made necessary by medical condition or conditions accepted as being employment related." 20 CFR &#x00A7; 10.1(b); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8104.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The statute contains a "compensation schedule" showing what amount of the employee's pay is owed to him or her for certain enumerated injuries, e.g., 312 weeks' compensation for loss of an arm, and 160 weeks' compensation for loss of an eye. 5 USC &#x00A7; 8107(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the 1991 Act allows for the award of compensatory damages covering non-pecuniary losses which are directly or proximately caused by the agency's discriminatory conduct. <span class="Italic">See Rountree v. Glickman</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01941906, slip op. at 6 (July 7, 1995). Such non-pecuniary losses are available in addition to any past or future pecuniary losses that may be awardable under Title VII. The 1991 Act authorizes the award of compensatory damages in Board appeals in which there is a finding of intentional employment discrimination. <span class="Italic">Yates v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 MSPR 172, 180-81 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was reimbursed for her pecuniary losses by both her FECA award and the award of back pay in her Board appeal. She is not now seeking, in her claim for Title VII compensatory damages, double recovery for these losses.... In fact, we note that EEOC has concluded that, while FECA is not the exclusive remedy for losses/damages engendered by workplace discrimination, "an award of compensatory damages is not intended to provide double recovery for an EEO complainant." <span class="Italic">Jackson U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Request No. 05930306, <span class="Italic">available in</span> Personnet, Database EEOC (1997), Personnet at n.6 (Feb. 1, 1993) <span class="Italic">denying request to reopen</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01923399 (Nov. 12, 1992). Thus, the question we must answer in this appeal is whether the appellant's receipt of OWCP benefits precludes her claim for non-pecuniary compensatory damages under Title VII.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC considered this question in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, which is cited in the preceding paragraph. In that case, the employee claimed that the discrimination he encountered in the workplace exacerbated his high blood pressure, and, as a result, caused him to incur additional medical expenses. <span class="Italic">See Jackson</span>, 1997 Personnet at *2. The agency argued that because the employee's medical expenses were allegedly work-related, they were recoverable, if at all, only under FECA. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at *3. The EEOC disagreed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC began its analysis by examining the language of FECA, which, it observed, is the federal equivalent of state workers' compensation acts. It noted that, according to 5 USC &#x00A7; 8116(c), liability under FECA with respect to the injury or death of an employee--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">is exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States or the instrumentality to the employee...entitled to recover damages from the United States or the instrumentality because of the injury or death in a direct judicial proceeding, in a civil action, or in admiralty, or <span class="Italic">by an administrative or judicial proceeding under a workmen's compensation statute or under a Federal tort liability statute.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *4 (emphasis added). Relying on the statutory language highlighted above, EEOC held that the employee was entitled to compensatory damages for injuries that are compensable under FECA because he was requesting relief in an administrative proceeding under Title VII, and was not seeking reimbursement under a workmen's compensation statute or a federal tort liability statute. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Under such circumstances, the EEOC concluded that FECA was not an exclusive remedy, and that the employee was not barred from entitlement to compensatory damages under Title VII for his mental stress and high blood pressure, even if he could obtain recovery for those conditions under FECA. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also Finlay v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01942985, slip op. at 3-7 (Apr. 29, 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts that have considered the effect, if any, of the receipt of compensation under FECA on entitlement to damages under Title VII have reached varying conclusions. We are aware of only one published decision in which a court found that FECA precluded the award of any compensatory damages for prohibited discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Frank,</span> 777 F. Supp. 516 (N.D. Tex. 1991), the court held that "FECA is a comprehensive scheme specifically designed to provide the exclusive and preemptive remedies for all work-related injuries for those employees it covers." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 523. Thus, it concluded that the employee's receipt of OWCP benefits under FECA for her on-the-job injury precluded her from receiving any additional damages for that injury under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 524.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Some courts have taken the approach that was adopted by the administrative judge here, <span class="Italic">viz.</span>, that an employee who is awarded OWCP benefits under FECA cannot also be awarded compensatory damages under Title VII for the injury that resulted in the OWCP award, but can receive compensatory damages for other conditions arising out of that injury. This approach is illustrated by the decision in <span class="Italic">Baker v. Runyon</span>, in which the court stated that "[b]ecause plaintiff has sought and recovered compensation for her frostbite under FECA," it would not consider that injury in its assessment of compensatory damages, so as to "avoid the prospect of double recovery." 922 F. Supp. 1300, 1303 (N.D. Ill. 1996), <span class="Italic">reversed in part on other grounds,</span> 114 F.3d 668 (7th Cir. 1997). However, to determine the amount of compensatory damages due to the plaintiff, the court stated that it would consider "'emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses' that fall outside FECA's definition of injury." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other courts have found, as did the EEOC in <span class="Italic">Jackson,</span> that FECA does not preclude full relief for discrimination prohibited under Title VII. For example, in a case that arose before the 1991 Act added the compensatory-damages provision to Title VII, the court in <span class="Italic">Miller v. Bolger,</span> 802 F.2d 660 (3d Cir. 1986), held that FECA is not the exclusive remedy when the injury results from discrimination prohibited by Title VII. In reaching that conclusion, the court examined FECA's legislative history and found that it confirms the statutory language showing that FECA was intended to be a substitute only for claims made against the United States "'under the Federal Tort Claims Act, Suits in Admiralty Act, Public Vessels Act, and the like,"' and that there is no reference in the legislative history showing any intent to apply the exclusivity clause to claims under Title VII in particular, or suits seeking relief from discrimination in general. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 663-64 (citation omitted and emphasis deleted)[.] Additionally, the court found no indication in the legislative history or language of Title VII that FECA recovery was intended to preclude relief for claims of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 664.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the legislative history of the 1991 Act discloses nothing that would change the result reached by the <span class="Italic">Miller</span> court. Indeed, the contention that receipt of compensation under FECA precludes recovery under Title VII for the same injury has been rejected by the majority of courts that have considered the question since the passage of the 1991 Act. <span class="Italic">See Callanan v. Runyun</span>, 903 F. Supp. 1285, 1296 (D. Minn. 1994) ("the Courts which have considered the issue [of whether FECA preempts recovery under Title VII for the same injuries] have, unanimously, rejected [it]" (citing cases)), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 75 F.3d 1293 (8th Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">see also Karnes v. Runyon</span>, 912 F. Supp. 280, 284-85 (S.D. Ohio 1995) (reviewing cases and findings that "the better view seems to be that FECA was designed as a substitute for common law tort actions only," and therefore "does not preclude recovery for injuries caused by illegal discrimination"). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span> <span class="Italic">Lockheed Aircraft Corp. v. United States,</span> 460 U.S. 190, 193-94, 103 S. Ct. 1033, 1036, 74 L. Ed.2d 911 (1983) (FECA was "designed to protect the Government from suits under statutes, such as the Federal Tort Claims Act, that had been enacted to waive the Government's sovereign immunity"; thus, as is common in workers' compensation legislation, "employees are guaranteed the right to receive immediate, fixed benefits, regardless of fault and without need for litigation, but in return they lose the right to sue the Government" in tort).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the principles established in <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 30 MSPR 471, 485-87 (Spec. Pan. 1986), the Board lacks authority to disagree with a decision of the EEOC which rests upon an interpretation of dissemination law, and which is not so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law. <span class="Italic">See Hurst v. Department of the Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 277, 282 (1994). We are not, <span class="Italic">per se,</span> bound by the EEOC's decision in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> interpreting both Title VII (a discrimination law) and FECA (a civil service law).[3] Moreover, unlike the appellant here, the complainant in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> had not actually filed an OWCP claim, even though his injuries apparently were work related<span class="Italic">. See</span> Personnet at *4. Nonetheless, for the following reasons, we find that the nonexclusivity of FECA can be extended to a case such as this one where claims for both FECA benefits and Title VII compensatory damages have been filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In distinguishing between discrimination laws and civil service laws, Congress has stated that the Board's interpretation of "'civil service laws under title V of the U.S. Code'" is entitled to appropriate weight. <span class="Italic">Ignacio,</span> 30 MSPR at 481 (citation omitted). Although the Board neither administers FECA benefits nor has the authority to review the merits of OWCP awards, FECA is part of title 5 of the United States Code, which contains a codification of laws relating to federal government organization and employees. Thus, we find that FECA is a civil service law, and that we need not defer to EEOC's interpretation of it....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where Congress' intent is clear from the words of the statute, and the legislative history does not indicate a contrary meaning, the plain meaning of the statute must be given effect. <span class="Italic">See Consumer</span> <span class="Italic">Product Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</span> 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S. Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L. Ed.2d 766 (1980). As EEOC observed in <span class="Italic">Jackson,</span> Title VII is not a workmen's compensation statute or a Federal tort liability statute. Thus, we agree with EEOC that FECA does not bar the recovery of compensatory damages sought in a Board proceeding under Title VII for injuries which result from unlawful discrimination and which are also compensable under FECA. Further, we agree with the courts that have examined the legislative history of FECA and Title VII that there is no indication of <span id="Page_4942"></span>congressional intent to prohibit recovery of compensatory damages under Title VII for an injury that results in the award of FECA benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, when it enacted the 1991 Act and the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, which made Title VII applicable to the U.S. Postal Service, Congress could be presumed to have been aware of FECA. <span class="Italic">See McCandless v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 996 F.2d 1193, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Yet, nothing in the Title VII legislation or legislative history indicates that Congress wished to preclude recovery under Title VII for injuries that are also compensable under FECA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the analysis set forth above, we hold that an individual who has received a FECA award for her pecuniary losses caused by workplace discrimination can also claim, under Title VII, compensatory damages for the non-pecuniary losses caused by the discrimination, even though both the pecuniary losses (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, lost wages and physician bills) and non-pecuniary losses (emotional distress, <span class="Italic">etc.</span>) may be connected to the same discrimination-caused or exacerbated injury. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Finlay</span>, slip op. at 3-7. Thus, we find that the appellant is not precluded from recovering non-pecuniary compensatory damages for her medical conditions of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder, even though she has already received compensation for them under FECA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Farquhar v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 82 MSPR 454, 458 &#x00B6; 10 (1999) (that the appellant may be awarded benefits by OWCP under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act would not defeat his compensatory damages claim if he proved that the agency discriminated against him in violation of the Rehabilitation Act or ADA).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following precedent developed by the EEOC, <span class="Italic">Reid v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/REID_JOHN_H_NY_0752_92_0562_P_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_199815.pdf">80 MSPR 405</a>, 406-07 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3 (1998), applied the "collateral source rule" to compensatory damage awards to preclude reduction of an award of damages by the amount that the employee received from an insurer for the same injury or condition compensated through the Board proceeding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial decision, the administrative judge held that the appellant was not entitled to $240 in compensatory damages for medical services provided in 1994 because his health insurer had paid those expenses. The administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Department of Agriculture</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945652 (July 17, 1995), to support her holding. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has subsequently ruled that appellants may receive compensatory damages for such expenses. <span class="Italic">Johnson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01961812 (June 18, 1998); <span class="Italic">Wallis</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01950510 (Nov. 13, 1995). The EEOC based its holding on the "collateral source" rule, which holds that "benefits received by the plaintiff from a source collateral to the defendant may not be used to reduce that defendant's liability for damages." <span class="Italic">Wallis,</span> slip op. at 12 (quoting 1 Dobbs, Law of Remedies 3.8(1), at 372-73 (2d ed. 1993)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the EEOC's holding is not based on Title VII law, and thus the Board need not defer to it<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Sloan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 77 MSPR 58, 68-69 (1997). However, we find that the EEOC's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Wallis</span> is persuasive. In <span class="Italic">Wallis,</span> the EEOC discussed decisions by federal courts of appeals addressing the collateral source rule. It found that application of the collateral source rule was appropriate because the funds disbursed to pay the appellant's expenses were overwhelmingly those of the insurance company, i.e., a collateral source, and it could not be said that the agency contributed to the appellant's health insurance premium in order to respond to some legal liability it might otherwise have toward the appellant.</p>
