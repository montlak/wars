<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-242"><span class="space">4.</span> Priority Placement Program</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board determined to be permissible the agency's use of a Career Transition Placement Plan to provide reemployment rights to an individual separated by reason of a compensable injury. The priority placement of other classes of employees did not improperly interfere in the appellant's statutory reemployment rights in <span class="Italic">Kachanis v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 80 MSPR 567, 569-72 (1999) (remanded, <span class="Italic">Kachanis v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 212 F.3d 1289 (Fed. Cir. 2000), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was employed as an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Revenue Officer when he suffered an on-the job injury in January of 1986. On March 13, 1987, the agency removed him because of that injury, and he continued receiving payments from the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) until OWCP terminated the appellant's benefits on May 28, 1995. On June 19, 1995, the appellant requested priority status for reemployment, and the agency placed him on its Reemployment Priority List (RPL) through October 19, 1997.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's obligation to restore an individual following a compensable injury is set forth at 5 C.F.R. Part 353. An employee who fully recovers from a compensable injury within 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began is entitled to be restored immediately and unconditionally to his or her former position or an equivalent one. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a).&#8197;...Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b) an employee who was separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than one year from the date he became eligible for compensation is entitled to priority consideration for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the individual on the agency's RPL....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in filling vacancies, an agency is required to give RPL registrants priority consideration over certain outside job applicants, and may, if it chooses, consider RPL registrants before considering internal candidates. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201(a). The Board has also held, however, that it will enforce an agency's own policy or regulation regarding the filling of vacancies, even if that policy or regulation grants the employee greater rights than the employee would have under the general regulations. <span class="Italic">See Stuck v. Department of the Navy</span>, 72 MSPR 153, 156-57 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant's recovery from his compensable injury took longer than one year from the date he became eligible for compensation. Thus, under the restoration regulations, the appellant would only be entitled to priority consideration by being entered onto the agency's RPL. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b)...&#8197;The CAJ, however, found that the IRS-CTAP afforded the appellant immediate restoration rights, which the agency violated by reassigning another employee into the vacant position at issue. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The IRS-CTAP generally mirrors the requirements of 5 C.F.R. Part 330, subpart F. It states that its purpose is to assist surplus and displaced employees affected by agency downsizing to obtain other employment, as required under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.602. It further states that it covers all employees identified as "surplus" and "displaced" within the IRS and provides policies and procedures for special selection priority when filling vacant positions and career transition services within the IRS. It defines a "displaced employee" as a "current agency employee...who has received a specific reduction in force (RIF) separation notice," a "surplus employee" as a "current agency employee...who has received a Certification of Expected Separation or other certification issued by the agency which identifies the employee as being in a surplus organization or occupation," and an "eligible employee" as a "surplus or displaced employee" who meets certain enumerated conditions. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.604(c), (d), and (i). As the CAJ recognized, the appellant does not meet these definitions because he was not a "current agency employee" during any of the relevant time period. Thus, the purpose, scope, and definition sections of the IRS-CTAP do not on their face afford the appellant any special restoration rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the remainder of the IRS-CTAP similarly fails to provide the appellant with any additional rights beyond those to which he is entitled under the restoration regulations cited above. For example, the IRS-CTAP states that eligibility for special selection priority, which is the priority that eligible employees have for selection to vacancies over any other candidate, begins on the date the agency issues the RIF separation notice, the Certification of Expected separation, or other certification identifying the employee as being in a surplus organization or occupation. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.605(b) (setting forth beginning date for special selection priority eligibility). The appellant does not obtain special selection priority under this provision because he has not received any of the enumerated notices. Further, special selection priority is only available to "eligible employees," and the appellant does not meet the IRS-CTAP definition of this term. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.605(a)(1) (setting forth requirements for eligibility for special selection priority).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The IRS-CTAP also enumerates the categories of employees for the special selection order for filling IRS vacancies. The appellant, however, does not fall into any of the enumerated categories of employees entitled to selection pursuant to that order. Although category "f" refers to displaced Treasury employees on the RPL, the appellant is not a "displaced employee."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The IRS-CTAP then sets forth exceptions to the enumerated special selection order for filling vacancies. The second exception applies to "[r]eemployment of a former agency employee exercising regulatory or statutory reemployment rights. The CAJ found that this exception applied to the appellant, that it constituted an exercise of the agency's choice under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201(a) to consider RPL registrants before considering internal candidates for vacancies, and that the appellant was, therefore, entitled to immediate restoration to the position into which the agency placed Mr. Howard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree, however, with the conclusion that excepting the appellant from the special selection order gives him benefits for which he was otherwise ineligible. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.606(d)(2) (reemployment of former agency employee exercising regulatory or statutory reemployment rights, such as those applicable upon recovery from a compensable injury, is not covered under the subpart governing CTAPs). The special selection order contained in the CTAP constitutes the additional benefit certain employees may receive instead of their regulatory rights. Thus, being an exception to the CTAP does not provide additional rights because those rights are contained in the CTAP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Instead, we find that, because the appellant is excepted from the order of special priorities, he is entitled only to the governing regulatory reemployment rights under both the IRS-CTAP and 5 C.F.R. Part 330, subpart F. As mentioned above, an employee who was separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than one year from the date he became eligible for compensation is entitled to priority consideration for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the individual on the agency's RPL, giving RPL registrants priority consideration over certain outside job applicants, and, if the agency chooses, considering RPL registrants before considering internal candidates. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201(a)<span class="Italic">.</span> We find no basis for concluding that excepting the appellant from the IRS-CTAP's special priority order entitled him to immediate restoration or otherwise constituted an <span id="Page_4517"></span>agency election to consider RPL registrants before internal candidates while filling vacancies, and, therefore, find that the agency did not violate the appellant's restoration rights when it selected internal candidate Howard for the position at issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kachanis</span> wound up at the Federal Circuit. The Board's decision was affirmed as to its conclusions concerning the use of the CTAP, but the appeal was remanded for further consideration of whether the agency properly provided restoration rights, <span class="Italic">Kachanis v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 212 F.3d 1289, 1294-96 (Fed. Cir. 2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At its heart, Kachanis's challenge concerns the scope of Congress's mandate in section 8151(b)(2). This section provides, in pertinent part, that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the department or agency which was the last employer shall, if the injury or disability is overcome within a period of more than one year after the date of commencement of compensation, <span class="Italic">make all reasonable efforts to place,</span> and <span class="Italic">accord priority to placing,</span> the employee in his former or equivalent position within such department or agency, or within any other department or agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151 (b)(2) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kachanis argues that this language requires that workers injured more than one year receive treatment equal to what they would have received in the absence of injury. Kachanis then contends that the regulations implementing this provision at 5 C.F.R. Part 330 contradict the provision, by affording less than absolute priority to such injured workers over both external and internal candidates for positions within the agency. Kachanis notes, for example, that under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201, the agency enjoys full discretion to deny such workers priority over internal candidates. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.206 (granting agency discretion to give certain employees on RPL priority outside commuting area). Kachanis also points to the legislative history behind the section, including various statements from representatives in Congress and previous language in the code repealed by the enactment of the section. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. 13871, 93rd Cong., 1st Sess. at 13402 (1971) (comments of Rep. Biaggi); P.L. No. 93-416, 88 Stat. 1150 (Sept. 7, 1974) (repealing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3315a). Citing to <span class="Italic">Chevron,</span> Kachanis concludes that the regulations are thus entitled to no deference by this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language of the section only mandates priority for workers injured more than one year in the most general of terms: "the department or agency...shall...accord priority to placing...the employee." We simply do not understand this language to demand absolute priority, as Kachanis suggests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, where Congress intended to afford injured workers absolute priority in hiring, it said so. For example, under section 8151(b)(1), workers injured <span class="Italic">less</span> than one year receive priority in hiring over both external and internal candidates. Significantly, the statute makes this absolutely clear, as it provides that "the department or agency which was the last employer shall <span class="Italic">immediately and unconditionally accord</span> the employee..., if the injury or disability has been overcome within one year,...the right to resume his former or an equivalent position." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(1) (emphasis added). If Congress had intended similar priority for workers injured <span class="Italic">more</span> than one year, it would have done the same under section 8151(b)(2). But it did not. Whatever the propriety of this distinction among injured workers, we must respect Congress's determination, as must the Agency. Because the Agency has done just that, we conclude that the regulations are entirely proper and consequently entitled to deference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the statute gives the Office of Personnel Management discretion in implementing its requirements. Section 8151(b) begins with the phrase: "Under regulations issued by OPM." This language is evidence of Congress's intent to let OPM decide how agencies should satisfy the statute's requirements. Moreover, the absence in section 8151(b)(2) of any details on the extent to which agencies are required to grant priority under that section, or on how agencies are to afford such priority must be understood as granting the Office of Personnel Management and the agencies discretion in such matters. This discretion is confirmed by the legislative history of section 8151(b)(2), which does not define "priority" or discuss how an agency might satisfy the requirement that it "make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing, the employee."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, in the legislative history of section 8151(b)(1), it is clear that Congress intended for individuals that recovered within one year of the date of disability to have absolute rights in placement. The House Report states that "Section 22 of the Bill provides a guaranteed right to an injured employee to return to his former or an equivalent position." H.R. Rep. No. 1025 at 3 (1974). This establishes that when Congress expected absolute priority in placement, it so stated. By comparison, no mention of "absolute" priority is made in section 8151(b)(2). Thus, the statute and its legislative history do not support Mr. Kachanis's interpretation affording him immediate reemployment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board properly focused on whether Kachanis was afforded any further rights under the CTAP. Here, too, the Board's decision must be respected. The Board conceded, properly so, that an agency's own policy or regulations regarding the filling of vacancies supersedes the regulations to the extent they afford greater rights. <span class="Italic">See Stuck v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 72 MSPR 153, 156-57 (1996). The CTAP is just such an agency policy. Accordingly, the question to be answered is whether the CTAP afforded Kachanis anything beyond the implementing regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the answer is no. By its own terms, the CTAP applies only to "surplus" and "displaced" workers within the Agency. Both of these types of workers are defined as "current employees." In contrast, Kachanis was not a current agency employee; he was a <span class="Italic">former</span> agency employee. As a result, the general provisions of the CTAP do not apply to him. Kachanis is left to qualify for one of the CTAP's "special selection provisions." Admittedly, the second exception, "[r]employment of a former agency employee exercising regulatory or statutory reemployment rights," is most applicable to Kachanis. But as the Board determined, this exception only affords workers the rights they are entitled to under the regulations. As a result, even if Kachanis does qualify under the exception, he enjoys no more rights than he already had.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we agree with Kachanis that several errors occurred in the Agency's application of the regulations. First, despite the mandate of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.202(b), the Agency took over four months to place Kachanis on the RPL after he submitted a request. The Board, in its decision, never addressed this issue. Nor did the Board address why Kachanis was never considered for part-time as well as full-time work, despite the absence of any such limitations in the regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.205(a). Moreover, the Board did not address the Agency's failure to consider Kachanis for positions beyond his assigned geographical area and grade level. In its argument to the court, the government only notes that Kachanis must prove prejudice from any agency error. Accordingly, we remand the case back to the Board for further fact-finding on the issue of prejudice from these errors.</p>
