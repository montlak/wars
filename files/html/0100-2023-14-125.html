<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-126"><span class="space">B.</span> PROCEDURES AND APPROPRIATE ARRANGEMENTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Some proposals ameliorating the effects of contracting out are negotiable. Evaluated in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1827 and DOD NIMA</span>, 58 FLRA 344, 346-47 (2003), were Proposals 1-1 and 1-4, requiring the employer to obtain early retirement authority for positions targeted for outsourcing to a contractor, Native Joint Venture Corporation (NJVC), and requiring that seniority be used to select from among volunteers for voluntary separation incentive pay (VSIP) opportunities. The proposals were appropriate arrangements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority follows the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87, </span>21 FLRA 24 (1986) <span class="Italic">(KANG). </span>Under this analysis, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 31; <span class="Italic">see also United States Dept of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA, </span>960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse<span class="Italic">. See KANG, </span>21 FLRA at 31. The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R1-100</span>, 39 FLRA 762, 766 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the proposal is determined to be an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management right(s). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">KANG, </span>21 FLRA at 31-33. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that management's decision to contract out can have "significant adverse effects on unit employees," as it can result in, among other things, employees being assigned to new duties or being laid off. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2077, </span>43 FLRA 344, 366 (1991); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 405, </span>42 FLRA 1112, 1117 (1991). The Authority has also found that an agency's decision to transfer a function "has serious repercussions for employees whose positions are affected[.]" <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 43 FLRA 1442, 1460 (1992), <span class="Italic">remanded as to other matters, NTEU v. FLRA, </span>30 F.3d 1510 (D.C. Cir. 1994). In a similar vein, the Authority has held that suffering involuntary removal from employment and a corresponding loss of the compensation and benefits that employment provides has a severe and negative impact on any employee. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Defense, Fort</span> <span class="Italic">Bragg Dependents Sch., Fort Bragg, N.C., </span>49 FLRA 333, 352 (1994) <span class="Italic">(Fort Bragg).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency does not anticipate that the exercise of its right to <span id="page_701"></span>contract out will result in the Agency conducting a RIF, it is undisputed that it will result in employees' functions and positions being eliminated within the Agency. The Agency explains that those employees whose functions and positions are eliminated may either go to work for NJVC or take another position performing different duties within the Agency. With regard to the former option, it is not disputed that, in order to take a position with NJVC, employees would have to terminate their employment with the Agency. With regard to the latter, even though the employee would remain employed with the Agency, it is not disputed that the employee would be displaced from his or her current duties and functions and would be required to perform new duties. Under either option, it is undisputed that employees whose functions and positions are eliminated would be involuntarily displaced from their current positions, suffering adverse affects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that VSIPs compensate employees for the adverse effects of a RIF, and because the Agency does not intend to conduct a RIF, there is no adverse effect on employees. However, contrary to the Agency's claims, the fact that employees may have other employment offers within the Agency or with NJVC does not eliminate the direct and immediate result of the Agency's decision to contract out, which is that employees will lose their current positions. The fact that the employees' positions are eliminated as a result of contracting out, rather than a RIF, does not undermine a finding that employees are adversely affected.[5] Accordingly, consistent with <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local</span> <span class="Italic">2077, NFFE, Local 405, and NTEU, </span>we find that the decision to contract out and the elimination of employees' positions and functions has an adverse effect on employees covered by the proposals. In addition, we find that because, by their terms, the proposals at issue here would provide VSIPs only to those individuals whose functions and positions had been eliminated as a result of the Agency's decision to contract out, the proposals are sufficiently tailored.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;In this connection, we note that in determining whether a proposal is negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the adverse effect need not flow from the management right that a given proposal affects. <span class="Italic">See Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge #1F, </span>57 FLRA 373, 381 (2001). Accordingly, although we have found that Proposals 1-1 and 1-4 do not affect management's rights to lay off employees or make determinations with respect to contracting out, that does not preclude a finding that the proposals are intended to address the adverse effects of the Agency's decision to contract out and to eliminate particular positions and functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to whether the proposals are appropriate, as explained by the Union, the benefit of offering VSIPs to employees adversely affected by the decision to contract out is significant. It is clear, in this regard, that providing employees with a lump-sum payment to voluntarily leave the Agency is a substantial financial benefit to employees whose positions have been eliminated. In addition to providing a direct benefit to individual employees whose positions have been eliminated, the proposals offer a meaningful benefit to all employees whose functions and positions the Agency has determined will be contacted out. In particular, by encouraging employees whose jobs have been eliminated to leave the Agency, the possibility of the Agency conducting a RIF may be diminished and the likelihood increases that employees who stay within the Agency will be reassigned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that under the proposals, the Agency would be likely to lose skilled employees and its cost of contracting out would increase. However, this claim is undercut by the fact that the Agency has already eliminated the functions and positions of the employees covered by the proposals. In addition, under the proposals, the Agency retains the ability to take additional steps or institute any policies or programs to encourage particular employees to remain Agency employees. Further, while it is reasonable that offering VSIPs will increase the Agency's costs associated with contracting out, the Agency has not indicated how significant that increase is likely to be. In this regard, there is nothing requiring the Agency to offer a particular number of VSIPs, and there is nothing indicating how many employees could in fact be eligible for VSIPs if offered by the Agency. Moreover, the Agency does not address the costs associated with a RIF if it is unable to adequately voluntarily reduce its workforce.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Weighing the significant benefit to employees whose positions were eliminated against the marginal limitation on management's right to retain employees and the possible cost to the Agency, we find that Proposal 1-1 and 1-4 do not excessively interfere with management's right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable in<span class="Italic"> AFGE Local 1827 and DOD NIMA</span>, 58 FLRA 344, 349-50 (2003), was Proposal 4-1, requiring the agency to include in its contract a requirement that the contractor offer jobs to unit employees when those jobs were targeted for elimination by the agency but prior to a RIF:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties agree that Proposal 4-1 requires the Agency to include in its contract with NJVC a provision providing that unit employees, who occupy a position targeted for contracting out, will have the right-of-first-refusal for NJVC positions that require substantially the same skills as the positions those employees encumber and for which there is more than one applicant. The Union explains that the proposal is intended to cover the period during which the Agency is transitioning functions and work to NJVC, and would not apply "in the eventuality of a RIF."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Circular A-76 establishes policies regarding the performance of commercial activities and implements certain statutory requirements.[7] As relevant here, Circular A-76 provides that agencies engaging in contracting out must secure for employees who are subject to RIF as a result of the decision to contract out the right-of-first-refusal for positions with the contractor.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;Contrary to the Union's claim, the policies and procedures in Circular A-76 apply without regard to whether an agency is exempt from the Circular's cost comparison requirements<span class="Italic">. See </span>OMB Circular A-76 Supplemental Handbook, Revised at Chpt. 1, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; E, H, Chpt. 3, &#x00A7; K (providing, among other things, that employees adversely affected by a decision to waive a cost comparison shall be afforded the same personnel considerations provided to employees generally under the Circular A-76). Accordingly, despite the fact that the Agency is exempt from the Circular A-76 cost comparison requirement, the Circular otherwise applies.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;More specifically, Circular A-76 provides that an agency must include in its agreement with a contractor a standard clause requiring the contractor to provide all Federal employees "adversely affected by a decision to convert to contract...performance...the [r]ight-of-[f]irst-[r]efusaI for jobs for which they are qualified that are created by the award of the conversion." Circular A-76, Chpt. 1, Policy Implement at &#x00A7; H.2. "Adversely affected employees" are defined as "employees identified for release from their competitive level by an agency, in accordance with 5 CFR Part 351 and Chapter 35 of Title 5, United States Code, as a direct result of a decision to convert to contract<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at &#x00A7; H.1. 5 C.F.R. Part 351 and 5 U.S.C. Chapter 35 address the procedures and requirements an agency must follow in conducting a RIF.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 4-1 gives the right-of-first-refusal to employees whose positions are targeted for contracting out where the Agency has not conducted a RIF; Circular A-76 provides that right to employees whose positions are identified for release pursuant to a RIF. As such, the rights-of-first-refusal provided under Proposal 4-1 and Circular A-76 are different in that they would apply in different circumstances--the proposal applies in non-RIF situations, while Circular A-76 applies in RIF situations. Nothing in the proposal infringes on the right-of-first-refusal provided under Circular A-76. Contrary to the Agency's assertions, nothing in Circular A-76 prohibits the Agency from providing the right-of-first-refusal in non-RIF situations, and nothing indicates that additional rights cannot be negotiated for such situations. Accordingly, there is no basis for concluding that the proposal is inconsistent with the Circular on this ground.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency's argument that the proposal is inconsistent with Circular A-76 because it would make the Circular's right-of-first-refusal grievable under the parties' agreement is misplaced. Contrary to the Agency's assertions, Proposal 4-1 would not subject any aspect of the Circular to the negotiated grievance procedure--the proposal applies in non-RIF situations, while Circular A-76 applies in RIF situations. Under the proposal, grievances over the right-of-first-refusal would be limited to the right guaranteed by the contract--not the right guaranteed by Circular A-76. in this connection, <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1345, </span>48 FLRA at 206,--where the Authority held that proposals subjecting disputes over compliance with Circular A-76 to resolution under the negotiated grievance procedure are nonnegotiable as inconsistent with the Circular--is not applicable here. Accordingly, the Agency's claim in this regard does not provide a basis for finding the proposal inconsistent with Circular A-76.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Pub. Debt</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-109.html">65 FLRA 509</a>, 518-19 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting), approved as negotiable a provision, Article 38 Section 2A, 2D, requiring the agency to include in its request for proposals a requirement that employees who are identified as potentially adversely affected by the decision to contract out receive a right of first refusal by the contractor for employment openings, coupled with certain information reporting requirements from the contractor:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A-76 sets forth several requirements that federal agencies must follow when contracting out agency functions, and states, with certain exceptions not relevant here, that "<span class="Italic">[n]</span> <span class="Italic">oncompliance with [A-76]</span> <span class="Italic"> </span>shall not be interpreted to create a substantive or procedural basis to challenge agency action or inaction[.]" A-76 Revised, para. 5.g. (2003) (emphasis added). In <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 996 F.2d 1246, 1248 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury</span>), the court held that substantively identical wording in a previous version of A-76 [12] precluded bargaining over a union proposal to subject alleged violations of A-76 to the negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1250. In this connection, the court stated that <span id="page_702"></span>"collective bargaining over the method for resolving disputes concerning application of [A-76] and arbitration of claimed 'violations' of [A-76] would both be inconsistent with [A-76]." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Consistent with <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury</span>, the Authority has held that grievances over compliance with A-76 <span class="Italic">itself </span>are barred, and that proposals subjecting disputes over compliance with A-76 <span class="Italic">itself </span>are outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1513</span>, 52 FLRA 717, 719-22 (1993) (grievance not arbitrable); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1345</span>, 48 FLRA 168, 205-06 (1993) (Member Armendariz concurring and dissenting as to other matters) (proposal outside duty to bargain).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;At the time of the court's decision, A-76 stated, in part, that except for an agency's internal appeal system, "This Circular and its Supplement shall not...establish and shall not be construed to create any substantive or procedural basis for anyone to challenge any agency action or inaction on the basis that such action or inaction was not in accordance with this Circular." <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 996 F.2d at 1248. The court noted that a supplement to A-76 "add[ed] that a decision in the internal review process should not be subject to appeal outside the agency." <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, neither the plain wording of A-76 nor the above-cited court and Authority decisions support a conclusion that parties are precluded from agreeing to, and enforcing in arbitration, contract provisions that independently impose on agencies obligations that are the same as, or similar to, the requirements set forth in A-76. In this connection, the Authority has stated that a proposal was not contrary to A-76 where it would merely limit grievances "to the right guaranteed by the contract--not the right guaranteed by...A-76." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1827</span>, 58 FLRA at 350. As Article 38, Sections 2A and 2D do not subject enforcement of A-76 to the negotiated grievance procedure and the Agency does not argue that the provisions are otherwise contrary to law, we find that they are not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">Procedural and impact bargaining obligations resulting from contracting out were noted in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 68 FLRA 1027, 1034 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the dissent's statement that we "refuse[ ] to address th[e] seminal issue" of whether the Arbitrator's finding of a bargaining obligation is contrary to law. But we have addressed, above, the only contrary-to-law claims that are properly before us. We also note the dissent's assertion that the Agency's decision to contract out part of its IT functions is a management right under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, and, "[t]herefore," that the Arbitrator's finding of a bargaining obligation "is contrary to law" because the Union "has no say." To the extent that the dissent is implying that the Union has absolutely no say in matters involving management rights, that is clearly not the case. Section 7106(a) of the Statute undoubtedly sets forth various rights that are reserved to management, but those rights are expressly "<span class="Italic">[s]</span> <span class="Italic">ubject to</span>" &#x00A7; 7106(b).[98] Section 7106(b)(2) requires bargaining over the procedures that management will observe when it exercises a management right,[99] and &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) requires bargaining over appropriate arrangements for employees who are adversely affected by the exercise of a management right.[100] So, when an agency makes a change that involves the exercise of management rights, the union has the right to bargain over the impact and implementation of that change[101]--precisely what the Arbitrator found here. In other words, the Union <span class="Italic">does</span> have a say, even though its say is limited to the right to bargain impact and implementation.</p>
