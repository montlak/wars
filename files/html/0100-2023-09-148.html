<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-146"><span class="space">4.</span> Dismissal Without Prejudice to Refile ("DWOP")</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">As a general rule, withdrawal of an appeal is an act of finality, resulting in an initial decision dismissing the appeal. But there is an exception. With approval of the AJ, an appeal may be dismissed without prejudice to its refiling. The <span id="Page_1098"></span>initial decision dismissing the case without prejudice (DWOP) will state the conditions governing its refiling. Once timely refiled, the appeal proceeds, with a slightly modified docket number, and it will eventually be closed out with another initial decision. The DWOP is similar to a continuance, but it removes the case from the AJ's docket (advantageous for the AJ, whose performance standards set processing times for appeals) and it provides additional time for the parties to conduct discovery or settlement negotiations or for other reasons that may or may not directly relate to the litigation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It was a long time coming, but in 2012 the Board issued a regulation on dismissals without prejudice to the refiling of appeals, codifying past practice, 5 CFR 1201.29 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">In general.</span> Dismissal without prejudice is a procedural option that allows for the dismissal and subsequent refiling of an appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Procedure</span>. Dismissal without prejudice may be granted on the judge's own motion or upon request by either party. The decision whether to dismiss an appeal without prejudice is committed to the sound discretion of the judge, and may be granted when the interests of fairness, due process, and administrative efficiency outweigh any prejudice to either party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Refiling</span>. Except in certain USERRA appeals under Part 1208 involving the use of military leave, a decision dismissing an appeal without prejudice will include a date certain by which the appeal must be refiled. The judge will determine whether the appeal must be refiled by the appellant or whether it will be automatically refiled by the judge as of a date certain. When a dismissal without prejudice is issued over the objection of the appellant, the appeal will be automatically refiled as of a date certain.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Waiver</span>. When a dismissed appeal must be refiled by the appellant, requests for waiver of a late filing based upon good cause will be liberally construed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulation made two changes, or clarifications, in past practice. First, it is not just the appellant's motion. Second, if the appellant misses the refiling deadline, the waiver doctrine is to be when their original appeals were timely filed and there is some basis for an untimely refiling. The discussion that follows concerns law developed without a specific regulation on the DWOP process--the common law of DWOPs.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board described the DWOP in <span class="Italic">Ryan v. DHS</span>, 112 MSPR 43, 45 &#x00B6; 4, 2009 MSPB 136 (2009) (an arbitration review proceeding):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, a dismissal without prejudice is a procedural option available to the Board's administrative judges when the circumstances of a case warrant such an action. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 669, 672 (1992). Further, the Board has held that an administrative judge may dismiss an appeal without prejudice where such a dismissal is in the interest of fairness, due process, and administrative efficiency. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Gidwani v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 509 (1997); <span class="Italic">Bowens v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 390, 392 (1993). In particular, the Board's administrative judges have dismissed cases without prejudice pending decisions and actions that are not before the Board and over which the Board has no control. Those Board decisions generally involve dismissals pending completion of criminal proceedings and, as in this case, retirement matters. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 70, &#x00B6; 12 (2006); <span class="Italic">Hodges v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 212, &#x00B6; 14 (2006). When reviewing decisions of arbitrators or administrative judges, the Board has not typically dismissed cases without prejudice; however, we find that such a dismissal is appropriate here because it is in the interest of fairness, due process, and administrative efficiency for the parties to resolve this matter as set forth in their settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under longstanding Board practice and under its regulation, with prior Board approval, an appeal may be withdrawn without prejudice to refiling of the appeal. "A dismissal without prejudice is a dismissal in which the appellant may refile the same claim, without loss of any rights. Black's Law Dictionary 1596 (7th ed. 1999)." <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> CH-300A-10-0760-I-1 (NP 5/12/2011). Before the 2012 regulation, a dismissal without prejudice to refile was ordinarily initiated by a motion from the appellant. When dismissal without prejudice to refile an appeal was not defined by Board regulations, the terminology was (still is) significant--to be distinguished from a dismissal with prejudice to refiling. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Gorny v. Dept. of Interior,</span> DE-0752-08-0233-X-1 (NP 4/1/2011) ("Accordingly, we find that dismissal of the petition for enforcement with prejudice to refiling (i.e., the parties normally may not refile this appeal) is appropriate under these circumstances, and we accept the settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes.");<span class="Italic"> cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Graves v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> SF-3330-10-0696-I-1 (NP 3/7/2011) ("There are no Board regulations specifically governing the dismissal of an appeal without prejudice. Rather, dismissal of an appeal without prejudice is a procedural option that is committed to the sound discretion of the administrative judge.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Federal Circuit decisions do not extensively discuss the DWOP process, although the Board's use of DWOPs are noted in some of its decisions in this subsection. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hahn v. EPA</span>, 445 Fed. Appx. 350, 353 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP) ("In this case, the administrative judge decided to rule on Ms. Hahn's claims against the EPA rather than awaiting a decision by OPM, and there is no reason to overturn that decision. <span class="Italic">See Gingery v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 134, 138 (2009) ('An [administrative judge] has wide discretion to control the proceedings before her and the dismissal without prejudice to refiling is a procedural option committed to her sound discretion.'); <span class="Italic">Gidwani v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 509, 511 (1997) ('It is well settled that dismissal of an appeal without prejudice is a procedural option that is committed to the sound discretion of the administrative judge.').").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The DWOP is popular with AJs, for it allows them to close out a case and gain credit in their performance standards for a timely case disposition. A continuance occurs while the case is actively docketed and the resultant adjudication delay may cause the appeal to exceed the AJ's performance standard on timely case processing. The problem with the dismissal without prejudice is that, unlike with a continuance, the case ordinarily must actually be refiled by the appellant within the time set by the dismissal order. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Santaro v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3189) (rejecting the argument that dismissal without prejudice equates to a suspension of administrative proceedings). If the case is not timely refiled, the Board must deal with collateral litigation over timeliness, and the appellant risks never being heard because an appeal once timely filed was not timely refiled. It is always the appellant who bears the risk of an untimely refiling. That risk is not inherent in a continuance. [Refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-029.html#sec3-29">Case Suspension</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-10-030.html#sec3-30">Continuance Procedure</a>."] To avoid the problem of an untimely refiling, the Board should adopt a uniform practice of automatically refiling a case that is dismissed without prejudice for a specific period of time. AJs will ordinarily use an automatic refiling procedure if it is requested in the DWOP motion, or they may decide to do so without a request. If a DWOP is issued at the instance of the AJ or the agency, it should have an automatic refiling provision so the appellant cannot be penalized by inattention to a stated mandatory refiling deadline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Appeals decided before the Board's regulatory revisions that included DWOP procedures, 5 CFR 1201.29 (2011) noted that "[d]ismissals without prejudice are not governed by specific Board regulations; rather, they are committed to the administrative judge's sound discretion." <span class="Italic">Ayers v.

There are no limitations on the reasons justifying dismissals without prejudice. <span class="Italic">Hart v. USDA</span>, 81 MSPR 329, 333 &#x00B6; 7 (1999), noted that "AJs commonly dismiss appeals without prejudice to refiling when the hearing is set for a date after the expiration of the 120-day period from the date the appeal was filed." The procedure was used when an appellant explained that he needed a continuance because he could not locate local counsel. <span class="Italic">Rosenberg v. CFTC</span>, 13 MSPR 240, 241 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v.

<p class="Body-Text">If a DWOP is denied, the Board reviews the denial for abuse of discretion, including prejudice to the appellant, <span class="Italic">Koch v. SEC,</span> DC-0752-10-0413-I-1 (NP 11/14/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has failed to show that the administrative judge abused her discretion. The initial decisions the appellant cited to support his assertion that the administrative judge should have granted his motion are nonprecedential. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gregory v. Department of the Army</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 27 (2010). The Opinion and Order the appellant cited to support his assertion--<span class="Italic">Padilla v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 561 (1993)--is distinguishable. In <span class="Italic">Padilla</span>, the Board found that the administrative judge appropriately exercised his discretion in granting a request to dismiss without prejudice based on the statement of the appellant's psychologist that the appellant would be unable to appear for her deposition for 6 months. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 563, 566. Here, in contrast, the appellant is represented by counsel and was released from the hospital almost 8 weeks before the scheduled hearing date. Although the appellant asserted that he was undergoing physical rehabilitation several times per week, is limited in his ability to sit or stand for prolonged periods, is taking painkillers that make him drowsy, and has difficulty thinking and functioning in the morning hours, he failed to explain what assistance he was incapable of providing to his counsel or how exactly he was prevented from participating in the appeals process. Notably, the appellant is represented by apparently quite capable counsel, who was responsible for responding to the agency's requests for discovery <span id="Page_1099"></span>and preparing for the hearing. The appellant has not explained why or how his counsel was unable to proceed with discovery or with preparing for the hearing without his constant presence. Thus, the appellant has failed to show that the administrative judge abused her wide discretion in declining to dismiss his appeal without prejudice. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ayers</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 550, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">No abuse of discretion occurred when the AJ denied a DWOP sought by the appellant to allow exhaustion of OSC remedies as a predicate to an IRA action, <span class="Italic">Sato v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-3443-16-0122-I-1 (NP 7/19/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An administrative judge has wide discretion in deciding whether to grant or deny a motion to dismiss an appeal without prejudice. <span class="Italic">Cassel v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 542, 546 (1996); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.29(b) (stating that the decision whether to dismiss an appeal without prejudice is committed to the sound discretion of the administrative judge). Here, we find that the administrative judge did not abuse his discretion. The Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal, and, as the administrative judge correctly noted, the appellant is free to file a future IRA appeal if he exhausts his administrative remedies with OSC regarding any allegations of whistleblowing that he may have raised in his Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See also Bump v. Department of the Interior</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 326, 330-33 (1994) (finding that a jurisdictional dismissal of an appellant's prior whistleblower claims for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies before OSC did not bar a second IRA appeal of the same claims after his administrative remedies had been exhausted).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The DWOP procedure is as flexible as circumstances require: "In accordance with the Board's policy that cases are to be processed in an expeditious manner while ensuring appropriate consideration of the unique and unforeseeable circumstances of an appeal, an administrative judge may establish reasonable interim deadlines for refiling an appeal that has been dismissed without prejudice." <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 204, 208 (1995);<span class="Italic"> see Ayers v. NASA</span>, 80 MSPR 550, 553 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (1999); (DWOP committed to the sound discretion of the AJ, who may set reasonable interim refiling deadlines). <span class="Italic">Hinton-Morgan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 75 MSPR 382, 399-400 (1997), suggested that when an appellant pursues several appeals with common issues, a stay of the proceedings at the regional office is preferable to a dismissal without prejudice if one of the appeals is being considered on PFR. "Although the appellant's burden to refile was not onerous, it is a burden unnecessarily placed on her in light of the option to stay proceedings pending a future specific event."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A dismissal without prejudice was properly entered, over the appellant's objection, so that the agency would have the opportunity to depose appellant when the appellant was in condition for the deposition to be taken, <span class="Italic">Shockness v. USPS,</span> DC-0752-09-0689-I-3 (NP 10/14/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge has wide discretion to control the proceedings before her and the dismissal without prejudice to refiling is a procedural option committed to her sound discretion. <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6; 9 (2009). Nevertheless, the administrative judge must exercise her discretion in a manner consistent with the policies set forth by the Board. <span class="Italic">Selig v. Department of the Army</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 6 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge made a reasoned and explained decision to dismiss the appeal without prejudice pending the appellant's recovery to a point where she would be psychologically able to submit to a deposition and testify at a hearing. The Board has found that a dismissal without prejudice under similar circumstances was not an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> Padilla v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 561, 566 (1993); <span class="Italic">Keene v. Department of the Interior</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 41, 44-45 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appears to argue that there was no reason to dismiss the appeal without prejudice for purposes of allowing her deposition because discovery is already closed pursuant to a November 17, 2009 hearing order, and that "reopening" discovery violates her due process rights. Again, we disagree. The order stated that discovery would close on January 20, 2010, "[u]nless otherwise specified." The agency served its notice of deposition on the appellant well within the deadline for initiating discovery, and the administrative judges' subsequent orders specified that discovery would remain open after that date. It was well within the administrative judges' discretion to keep discovery open beyond the original deadline to prevent the agency from being prejudiced by the appellant's inability to attend a deposition. <span class="Italic">See McCray v. Department of Defense</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 186, 196 (1995) (under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(4), an administrative judge has broad discretion to rule on discovery matters, and absent an abuse of discretion, the Board will not find reversible error in such rulings); <span class="Italic">cf. White v. Government Printing Office</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 355, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2008) (the administrative judge abused her discretion in denying the appellant's motion to compel on the basis that discovery had closed when the agency's delay in responding to the appellant's discovery requests pushed the contested discovery issues beyond the discovery deadline).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the dismissal without prejudice violated her due process rights because she has not been afforded a jurisdictional hearing. We find that the appellant's due process rights have not been violated in this appeal because the initial decision did not abrogate any right that the appellant may have to a jurisdictional hearing; it merely postponed the date of such a hearing in an attempt to resolve important evidentiary issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues that the administrative judge based her decision to dismiss the appeal without prejudice on the "bias[ed]" and "corrupt" rulings of the administrative judge previously assigned to this appeal. Although the initial decision referred to some of the previous administrative judge's orders, we find that the initial decision was not based on those orders. Rather, the initial decision was based on the current administrative judge's findings that the agency has a right to depose the appellant and question her at a hearing and that the appellant is unable to submit to such examination at this time. Therefore, we will not consider the propriety of any of the previous administrative judge's orders at this time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appears to argue that she should not have to submit to a deposition because the agency has not articulated a reason for its alleged failure to accommodate her. Without deciding whether this matter would excuse the appellant from submitting to a deposition, we find that her argument is factually incorrect. The agency submitted a lengthy and detailed statement of its version of events, as well as voluminous documentary evidence in support of its position, all within the timeframe for doing so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the dismissal without prejudice constitutes disability discrimination, and that the administrative judge is holding her appeal hostage until she is able to submit to a deposition. She further argues that the administrative judge should not have imposed a 90-day refiling deadline. We find that the administrative judge's decision does not constitute disability discrimination, and that her alleged holding the appeal "hostage" is actually a reasonable attempt to accommodate both the appellant's psychological condition and the agency's right to meaningful discovery in this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 649, 663-64 (1994) (the appellant was entitled to depose agency employees because the depositions were reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(a)). We further find that the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion in setting a 90-day refiling deadline for the appeal. The Board disfavors dismissals without prejudice that do not contain a specific refiling date, especially where it is unclear when the matter underlying the dismissal will be resolved. <span class="Italic">See Schulte v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 141, &#x00B6; 6 (2005). Given the Congressional mandate that Board cases be expeditiously adjudicated, a case may not go on indefinitely. <span class="Italic">Selig</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 6. In this case, all of the medical evidence shows that the appellant can be expected to recover from her condition sufficiently to submit to a deposition and testify at a hearing at some point in the future. In light of this information, it was reasonable for the administrative judge to postpone adjudication for up to 90 days and revisit the hearing and deposition issues at that time. Contrary to the appellant's assertion, the refiling deadline does not presuppose a "miraculous healing," or for that matter, any recovery by the appellant at all. It does however, account for the fact that the appellant may recover, as all of her doctors expect her to, thus avoiding the need for the administrative judge to make a difficult decision about what to do when the agency's rights are potentially prejudiced by the appellant's inability to testify or be deposed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">AJs are to ensure that when cases are dismissed without prejudice, appellants know what they must do and when they must do it to reactivate their appeals. The initial decision dismissing an appeal without prejudice to its refiling should set a refiling deadline or provide for automatic refiling on a date certain if the appeal is not earlier refiled. The standards that AJs should follow in the DWOP initial decision are summarized in <span class="Italic">Nelson v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 644, 647-49 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10, 2010 MSPB 96 (2010) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Nelson v. MSPB</span>, 414 Fed. Appx. 292 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP)), involving a DWOP pending adjudication of concurrent criminal proceedings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has repeatedly held that its dismissal without prejudice practice should not become a trap to deny an appellant the opportunity to have his case decided on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Jaramillo v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 244, &#x00B6; 6 (2007); <span class="Italic">Hodges v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 212, &#x00B6; 11 (2006); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 302, &#x00B6; 10 (2001); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 8 (2000). Accordingly, it has identified specific standards applicable to determining whether good cause exists for excusing an untimely refiled appeal of a matter previously dismissed without prejudice pending the resolution of criminal proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Gaddy v. Department of the Navy,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 485, &#x00B6; 13 (2005). These include the following: the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status; the timeliness of the initial appeal; the appellant's demonstrated intent throughout the proceedings to refile the appeal; the length of the delay in refiling; confusion surrounding and arbitrariness of the refiling deadline; the number of prior dismissals without prejudice; the agency's failure to <span id="Page_1100"></span>object to the dismissal without prejudice; and the lack of prejudice to the agency in allowing the refiled appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Further, in <span class="Italic">Jaramillo,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 244, the Board noted its policy to stay its proceedings when criminal proceedings involving the same matter are pending. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 7. Although the administrative judge did not apply the appropriate analysis to the refiled appeal in this case, the error did not affect the outcome, and, therefore, is not grounds for overturning the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it is true that (1) this <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant did timely file his initial appeal, (2) his appeal was previously dismissed without prejudice only once and at the agency's request; and (3) there is no apparent prejudice to the agency in allowing the refiled appeal, the record does not otherwise support finding that the appellant established good cause to excuse his untimely refiling. Specifically, the initial decision dismissing the appeal without prejudice clearly identified the date for refiling the appeal and warned the appellant that failure to refile by that date would "result in a finding that the appellant has waived his right to pursue the issues raised by the appeal, absent a showing of good cause for any filing delay." <span class="Italic">Cf. Hodges,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 212, &#x00B6; 13 (finding the refiling deadline unreasonable because it did not set a "date certain" for when the appellant must refile her appeal). Further, the deadline was not arbitrary, but based on the agency's estimate of when the criminal proceedings would be concluded. Conversely, as previously noted, the appellant failed to provide any evidence justifying any confusion over the deadline, and in particular, supporting his belief that he had either 6 months from the Board's final decision or 60 days from the end of his criminal case to refile his appeal. Moreover, even if he believed that refiling before his criminal case was completed would have been futile, he nonetheless failed to explain why, given the date certain for refiling, he neglected to contact the regional office to request an extension. In addition, the appellant's 4-month delay was hardly minimal. <span class="Italic">See Gulley v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 9 (2006). Even considering the delay in the light most favorable to the appellant, he still waited approximately 1 1/2 months after the July 31, 2009 conclusion of his criminal case to refile his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, considering this case under the specific standards applicable to a refiled appeal of a matter previously dismissed without <span id="Page_1101"></span>prejudice pending the resolution of criminal proceedings, we find that the appellant has failed to show that good cause exists for excusing his untimely refiling. Accordingly, we decline to waive the refiling deadline in this appeal.</p>

It held further, however, that this discretion was to be exercised in a manner consistent with the policies stated in that decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Those policies include that of deciding appeals within 120 days after their filing dates, to the extent practicable, and of acting in a manner consistent with the purpose of this goal, i.e., consistent with the purpose of benefiting appellants by preventing delays that adversely affect them.[1] <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00B6; 10. The Board noted further that the 120-day goal was to be applied in a manner "consistent with the interests of fairness and other priorities of the Board." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Although the Board in <span class="Italic">Milner</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 660, &#x00B6; 11, referred specifically to the adverse effects of unemployment--a condition that affects appellants who have been removed--appellants who, like the appellant, have been suspended also may be adversely affected by delays in the adjudication of their appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the issues in the complaint filed in the district court overlap with those presented in the appeal. In connection with this matter, we note that the amended complaint, like the original complaint, includes a claim that the agency falsely accused the appellant of disrespectful conduct, and that this claim evidently concerns the charge on which the suspension at issue in this appeal was based. In light of the overlapping issues, we concur in the administrative judge's apparent view that findings made by the district court in connection with the appellant's civil action might properly be given collateral estoppel effect in this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Mintzmyer v. Department of the Interior</span>, 84 F.3d 419, 423-24 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Giving collateral estoppel effect to district court findings regarding the merits of the appellant's allegations could reduce the time needed to hear and decide this appeal. We note, however, that the district court evidently had not issued a decision on the appellant's civil action at the time the initial decision was issued, that nothing in the record indicates that the court has issued a decision on that action since then, and that the record does not even indicate an approximate date on which a decision is expected. Delaying the adjudication of this appeal indefinitely pending disposition of the court case would be inconsistent with the goal of adjudicating appeals expeditiously, and with the purpose of benefiting the appellant by preventing unnecessary delays.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We also find unpersuasive the agency's apparent argument that the appellant should not be given "the opportunity to have the same legal issues tried in two forums (Federal District Court and MSPB)...." An appellant raising a claim of discrimination in connection with an appealable matter is entitled to further review as provided by applicable statutory provisions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the delay at issue here would not provide the kinds of benefits to the appellant that generally are provided by other kinds of delays, such as delays pending the disposition of related criminal charges against an appellant, or pending the resolution of health-related or other issues affecting the parties' ability to proceed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mroch v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 530, &#x00B6; 11 (2002) (suggesting that the appeal could be dismissed without prejudice in order to allow the appellant to establish in a state court the legal relationship necessary to show her entitlement to the annuity she sought in her appeal); <span class="Italic">Green</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 203, 204-06 (1983) (requiring an appellant to proceed with his appeal while he is under investigation for possible criminal prosecution on closely related charges could constitute improper interference with the criminal investigation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that, until the district court issues its decision on the appellant's civil action, there can be no assurance that it will make findings that may be given collateral estoppel effect in this appeal. The factual basis for this dismissal therefore is somewhat speculative, and delaying the adjudication of this appeal could ultimately have no benefit at all. Indeed, the situation in which the appellant finds himself is the product of the mixed-case statute. The administrative judge was not permitted to consider all of the matters raised in the appellant's EEO complaint; she could only consider the 30-day suspension. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702; <span class="Italic">Lethridge v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 675 (2005). At the same time, in order for the appellant to raise the 30-day suspension in the civil action along with the other matters raised in the EEO complaint, the appellant must exhaust his administrative remedy before the Board with respect to the 30-day suspension. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702; <span class="Italic">Sloan v.

<p class="Body-Text">An AJ could dismiss a case without prejudice to give an incompetent appellant in an annuity appeal the time to obtain counsel, but it does not appear that an AJ can dismiss an ordinary adverse action appeal to assist a mentally impaired appellant without the appellant's consent, <span class="Italic">Marbrey v. DOJ</span>, 45 MSPR 72, 74-75 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision issued June 8, 1989, the administrative judge dismissed the appellant's petition without prejudice. The administrative judge stated that during the course of various prehearing activities, the appellant appeared to be incapable of adequately representing himself. He cited several examples of the appellant's conduct as a basis for this conclusion. Citing <span class="Italic">French v.</span> <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management,</span> 37 MSPR 496 (1988), he determined that absent representation, rulings which would be <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> against the appellant should not be made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge advised the appellant that he would dismiss his appeal without prejudice and strongly urged the appellant to seek assistance in presenting his case. In addition, he noted that the agency agreed to provide the appellant with a list of available <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> legal services. Finally, he advised the appellant that he must refile his appeal within 30 days of the date of the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a petition for review of this initial decision. Among other arguments, he asserts that the administrative judge erred in relying on <span class="Italic">French</span> to dismiss his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case, we find that the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appellant's petition for appeal pursuant to <span class="Italic">French. In French,</span> a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant had raised the issue of his mental incapacity in connection with his application for disability retirement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the Board's first decision on the appellant's appeal, remanded the case to the Board, and directed the Board to formulate procedures for the processing of a case of <span id="Page_1102"></span>an apparently nonfrivolous claim of past incompetence by one presently incompetent and not represented by counsel or a conservator. <span class="Italic">See French v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 810 F.2d 1118, 1120 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In establishing these procedures, the Board noted that they were to be used in disability retirement cases of the kind present in <span class="Italic">French.</span> It directed the Regional Office to make diligent efforts to obtain appropriate representation for the appellant. The Board further stated that if counsel could not be obtained, the Regional Office should not enter an adverse order against the appellant, but if necessary, should dismiss the case without prejudice to reinstitution under circumstances conducive to fair adjudication. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 498-99. The Board has subsequently applied the <span class="Italic">French</span> procedures to cases involving appellants who claimed mental disability and applied for waivers of repayment after they had received annuity overpayments. <span class="Italic">See Dennison v. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management,</span> 42 MSPR 358 (1989); <span class="Italic">Eddy v. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management,</span> 38 MSPR 442 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, this case does not involve an appellant who bears the burden of proving his entitlement to annuity benefits. Rather, here the agency must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant committed the misconduct alleged, and that his removal is reasonable and promotes the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(a) and 7701(c)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 306 (1981). Moreover, the appellant did not claim that he suffers from a mental disability, and the record does not contain any medical evidence to support such a finding. Finally, the record does not show that the appellant asked the Board for assistance in obtaining a representative after the administrative judge properly informed him of the possibility of obtaining <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">French,</span> 810 F.2d at 1119-20, the court did not indicate that the procedures it directed the Board to formulate should be extended beyond retirement appeals in which appellants claim that they are mentally incompetent and present medical evidence to support such claims. Because these factors are absent here, we find no reason to apply the <span class="Italic">French</span> standards to the present case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There does not appear to be any limit on the duration of a DWOP, except that it should not be less than 35 days (the time necessary for the initial decision dismissing the case to become final and subject to PFR). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Washington v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 650, 651 &#x00B6; 4 (1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A DWOP is not granted of right. If an AJ declines to grant the dismissal (or declines to repeatedly DWOP a case), the appellant is obliged to pursue his appeal or suffer a dismissal (with prejudice) for lack of prosecution, <span class="Italic">Green v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 97-3407):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board did not abuse its discretion in denying Green's motion to dismiss his appeal without prejudice after it had already granted two similar motions that had delayed the appeal's adjudication for almost two years. We do not fault the board's conclusion that "further delay is not in the interest of justice and is highly prejudicial to the agency." The board also did not abuse its discretion in exercising its authority under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43(b) (1998) to dismiss the appeal for failure to prosecute in the wake of Green's failure to participate in prehearing conferences and to respond to telephone calls by the administrative judge and the agency representative.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The DWOP is usually initiated by motion with service of the motion on the opposing party,<span class="Italic"> see</span> <span class="Italic">Mughal v. OPM</span>, 54 MSPR 554, 555 (1992), although an AJ could enter a DWOP as a result of discussions in a status conference. If an appellant seeks a DWOP, the AJ should ensure the agency is provided an opportunity to respond to the request. <span class="Italic">Rodarte v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 224, 225 (1985) (remanding to the regional office for the AJ's consideration of briefs by both parties on a dismissal motion), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Soto v. VA</span>, 88 MSPR 626, 628 &#x00B6; 4 (2001) (AJ erred in entering DWOP when he did not ensure that the agency had notice and opportunity to respond to the appellant's request; the error was harmless based on the appellant's intervening refiling). Any representative seeking, or consenting to, a DWOP should be properly designated as representative. An AJ erred by agreeing to DWOP an appeal at the request of an undesignated representative when the appellant was not a party to the conference call discussing the dismissal and the appellant earlier indicated he would represent himself. <span class="Italic">Visconti v. EPA</span>, 78 MSPR 17, 20-21 (1998) (also suggesting that the AJ should not have attempted to determine the appellant's competency in an appeal not involving the potential right to an annuity).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under current Board regulations and earlier decisions, discussed below, an AJ may DWOP a case without the appellant's request. Under earlier practice, assuming the dismissal was not the AJ's idea, it was ordinarily the appellant, not the agency, who had the option of seeking a DWOP. <span class="Italic">Draper v. Dept. of Army</span>, 51 MSPR 518, 520 (1991) (agency should seek a continuance based on a date certain for proceeding with the appeal), <span class="Italic">relying</span> <span class="Italic">on</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. VA</span>, 51 MSPR 218, 221 (1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ballard v. VA</span>, 73 MSPR 598, 599-602 (1997) (discussed in the section below on agency-initiated dismissals). In <span class="Italic">Allison v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 335, 339 &#x00B6; 9 (1999), the Board permitted its AJ to dismiss an appeal as withdrawn, with prejudice, after the AJ warned the appellant that the agency might oppose his grievance-arbitration and that the AJ would not dismiss the appeal without prejudice, as requested by the appellant in his request to withdraw the appeal. The <span class="Italic">Allison</span> result appears to be ill-considered. If there were doubts concerning the arbitrability of the grievance, the AJ could have permitted the appellant to resolve those issues during a DWOP. Alternatively, the AJ could have denied the DWOP, insisted that the appellant proceed to hearing, and either sanctioned the appellant by dismissal or adjudicated the appeal on the record if the appellant did not cooperate in prehearing and hearing procedures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Agnew v. USPS</span>, PH-0752-04-0598-I-6 (NP 8/23/2013), suggested at footnote 2 that if an appeal is DWOP'd based on medical conditions, refiling should not be preconditioned on production of medical evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note our disagreement with the administrative judge's previous requirement that upon refiling, the appellant would have to present medical documentation establishing his inability to participate in a hearing since December of 2008 and his concomitant ability to now participate in a hearing. We believe this to be contrary to the Board's practice of dismissing an appeal without prejudice due to medical incapacity subject to automatic refiling, at which point "[i]f the appellant is still medically unable to proceed, medical documentation satisfactorily justifying the continued delay must be submitted to the administrative judge." <span class="Italic">Ayers v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 550, &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Zell v. Department of the Army</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 86, 88 n.2 (1993)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once the DWOP'd appeal is refiled, the appellant is expected to proceed with expedition. An AJ was not faulted for denying a continuance because of illness of counsel when the appellant refiled his appeal knowing of his counsel's health problems. Appellant was represented by a second attorney. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ray v. USPS</span>, 22 MSPR 228, 230 (1984). [Refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-029.html#sec3-29">Case Suspension</a>" under "<a href="0100-2023-10-025.html#sec3-25">Postponement of Hearing</a>" for explanation of the "suspension procedure" generally used early in the adjudication of an appeal to stop case processing, but keep the case on the docket, to pursue discovery or settlement for limited periods of time based on mutual agreement of the parties.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not all DWOP motions are granted. In <span class="Italic">Key v. GSA</span>, 60 MSPR 66, 69 (1993), the unrepresented appellant did not initiate discovery within the 25 days from the date of the acknowledgment order allowed for the initiation of discovery. The appellant subsequently retained counsel, who objected to the AJ's refusal to waive the rule governing the initiation of discovery. Counsel then moved for withdrawal of the appeal without prejudice to permit the parties to pursue discovery. The Board affirmed the AJ's refusal to grant the motion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, the Board affirmed the administrative judge's decision to grant the appellant's motion to dismiss his appeal without prejudice to refiling so as to allow him time for discovery even though the appellant first requested discovery at a prehearing conference after the discovery period had passed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The administrative judge found good cause for the untimeliness of the discovery request in that he had discontinued processing the case based on the parties' representations to him that they were settling the matter, and the information sought through discovery was directly related to the charges against the appellant and the reasonableness of the penalty imposed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 205-06. Here, settlement is not an issue and the then-unrepresented appellant simply failed to initiate discovery during the allotted time, of which he was notified. Thus, the appellant has failed to establish that the administrative judge abused his discretion in denying the appellant's untimely requests.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Milner v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MILNER_LARRY_D_SF_752S_98_0774_I_3_OPINION_AND_ORDER_251008.pdf">87 MSPR 660</a>, 665-67 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-15 (2001), seemed to suggest a departure from the frequent use of the DWOP in lieu of a continuance, although the Board may have limited its approach to cases arising under USERRA. Significantly, in <span class="Italic">Milner</span>, the Board made reactivation of the appeal automatic upon the expiration of a dismissal without prejudice in a USERRA case. More significantly, the Board (again) disavowed strict adherence to a 120-day adjudication period for the USERRA appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's policy of deciding appeals within 120 days is based on the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (CSRA), which reflects Congressional intent that appeals be decided expeditiously. For example, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(i)(4) provides that it "shall be the duty of the Board, an administrative law judge, or employee designated by the Board to hear any proceeding under this section to expedite to the extent practicable that proceeding." <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) (requiring the Board to decide within 120 days appeals in which discrimination prohibited by section 2302(b)(1) is alleged). Section 7701(i)(1) provides, however, that when the Board announces dates by which it expects to complete action on appeals, these dates are to be "consistent with the interests of fairness and other priorities of the Board." In <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 51 MSPR 218, 220 (1991), the Board explained that the policy underlying this CSRA statutory requirement that the Board expeditiously process appeals was to benefit appellants by preventing delays that adversely affected appellants who might be unemployed while their appeals were pending. A similar expeditious processing policy applies to individual right of action appeals<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(f) (the Board must issue a final order <span id="Page_1103"></span>or decision "as soon as practicable" after the proceeding is initiated).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, there is nothing in the statutory language of USERRA which directs the Board to expeditiously process USERRA complaints<span class="Italic">. See</span> 38 U.S.C. chapter 43. The 120-day time limit for adjudication that the Board has applied to appeals governed by section 7701 does not apply in USERRA cases<span class="Italic">. See Bodus v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 82 MSPR 508 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-17 (1999) (cases that are within the Board's jurisdiction solely because of USERRA are not governed by the CSRA provisions at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701-02). In fact, an amendment to USERRA that Congress enacted in 1998 led the Board to abandon the regulatory filing deadline it had originally set for USERRA cases. That amendment provided that the "Board shall adjudicate any complaint brought before the Board pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(A) or (b), <span class="Italic">without regard as to whether the complaint accrued before, on, or after October 13, 1994</span>." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(1) (emphasis added). In the wake of that amendment, the Board stated in the supplementary information accompanying its interim regulations governing USERRA appeals that "it would be inconsistent with the Congressional intent in enacting USERRA and its predecessor laws for the Board to establish a filing time limit by regulation. Therefore, there is no time limit for filing a USERRA appeal." 65 Fed. Reg. 5410, 5411 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in any of these statutory provisions supports a dismissal of cases without prejudice to refiling solely to avoid exceeding the Board's 120-day adjudicatory standard. Dismissing cases without prejudice solely to avoid the 120-day adjudicatory standard places an unnecessary burden on the appellants and results in an inaccurate picture of how long it actually takes the Board to adjudicate an appeal. Even with regard to a mixed-case appeal, where the Board is required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702, to decide the appealable action and the discrimination claim within 120 days, a dismissal of a case without prejudice to refiling does not effectuate that statutory purpose, because such a dismissal merely postpones an adjudication on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we hold that henceforth it is the Board's policy that: (1) A case will not be dismissed without prejudice to refiling simply to avoid exceeding the 120-day adjudication standard; (2) the dismissal of a case without prejudice to refiling will be granted or ordered only at the request of one or both of the parties or in order to avoid a lengthy or indefinite continuance; (3) the dismissal of a case without prejudice to refiling is a procedural option that is left to the sound discretion of the AJ, <span class="Italic">see Ballard v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 73 MSPR 598, 600 (1997), but this discretion must be exercised in a manner consistent with the policies set forth in this Opinion and Order*; and (4) to effectuate the USERRA statutory scheme, which contains no time limit for filing USERRA appeals, a USERRA case that has been dismissed without prejudice to refiling will be considered automatically refiled by the date set forth in the dismissal order, unless there is evidence that the appellant has abandoned the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;To the extent that <span class="Italic">Gardner v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 258, 261-62 (1995), <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed</span>, 114 F.3d 1207 (Fed. Cir.) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert denied</span>, 118 S. Ct. 443 (1997), and <span class="Italic">Neubeiser v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 47 MSPR 125, 127-28 (1991), are inconsistent with the policies set forth in this Opinion and Order, they are hereby overruled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Arndt v. USPS,</span> CH-0353-11-0080-I-2 (NP 7/19/2012) (automatic refiling date should have been set by the AJ in a restoration case that was DWOP'd at the AJ's initiative).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the parties set the conditions of a dismissal without prejudice through an agreement that is accepted by the AJ, the Board applies its usual principles of contract interpretation to the agreement, one principle being that the agreement is interpreted to avoid absurd results. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Donahue v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 488, 492 &#x00B6; 12 (2003) ("To construe the waiver clause [a component of a DWOP agreement] as the agency suggests would cause the absurd result of having one provision precluding refiling and another clearly allowing for it.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an unusual situation involving a DWOP, an appeal was filed from a performance-based removal under Chapter 43, and on the same date that the agency issued the performance removal, it also it issued a separate removal based upon misconduct under Chapter 75. The misconduct case was apparently grieved through the collective bargaining agreement grievance and arbitration process. The AJ, over the appellant's objection, DWOP'd the performance case pending the outcome of the misconduct case. The Board decided that the AJ erred: first, the DWOP was inappropriately open-ended because it was dependent upon the outcome of an arbitration; second, the Board appeal from the performance case involved allegations of whistleblower reprisal, and those involved possible consequential damages. A damages claim distinguished the performance case from the misconduct case, apparently involving no claim for consequential damages (the Board decision did not note the existence of a consequential damages claim in the misconduct case). <span class="Italic">Dey v. NRC</span>, 106 MSPR 167, 2007 MSPB 160 (2007).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some appeals are DWOP'd more than once--the case is DWOP'd, then refiled, then another DWOP motion is granted and another initial decision is issued setting the terms for the second refiling, and so on. The AJ is likely to convene a conference call when a appeal comes off of DWOP (by refiling or automatic refiling) to determine the case status and to discuss how the parties want to proceed.</p>
