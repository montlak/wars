<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-23"><span class="space">6.</span> Conditional Settlement; Lapsed Offer; Implicit Term</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the litigation over an appeal can be terminated on the basis of a settlement, a settlement must, in fact, have occurred. The AJ errs by dismissing a case on the basis of a settlement that is not final and that leaves terms open for the parties to fulfill before the appeal is to be withdrawn. <span class="Italic">Hatcher v. Dept. of Army</span>, 11 MSPR 135, 136 (1982); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Nixon v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 624, 629 (1991) (oral agreement was effective when a contingency set by the agreement, involving the issuance of a letter concerning the appellant's debarment from a naval station, was issued). A settlement may, however, permit the reactivation of an appeal under specified conditions. Although the Board did not comment on the agreement, in <span class="Italic">Gootee v. VA</span>, 36 MSPR 526, 528 n.1 (1988), it acknowledged the that the agreement provided that the appellant would be reinstated for a period not to exceed six months; he would attempt to secure other employment by the latter date; and if he was unable to do so, he could refile his appeal with the Board within 10 days. When the appellant was unable to find another job, he refiled his appeal from his removal. The Board viewed there to be nothing amiss about a settlement that required the agency to take action (supplying telephone numbers of a personnel office) after the settlement was signed. The agreement was formed when it was signed by the parties, even though it was not fully executed at the time it was signed. <span class="Italic">Allison v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 111 MSPR 62, 65 &#x00B6; 9 &#x0026; n.2, 2009 MSPB 43 (2009); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Sherman v. MSPB</span>, 530 Fed. Appx. 940, 942 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP) ("A settlement agreement with conditions does not become invalid so long as the conditions are definite and unequivocal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hammond v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 174, 181 (1991).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a more direct approach to a conditional settlement, the Board approved the dismissal of an appeal without prejudice to refiling pending the appellant's application for a discontinued service retirement. If OPM did not grant the annuity, the appellant had 60 days from the negative decision to refile his appeal at the PFR level (the level that the appeal reached before the case was settled). <span class="Italic">Beckett v. OPM</span>, 79 MSPR 632, 633 &#x00B6; 2 (1998) (settlement agreement that permitted refiling of an appeal if the appellant's disability annuity application was not granted); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Camastro v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3411) (settlement agreement providing for an application by the appellant for disability retirement and the dismissal of an appeal without prejudice during the adjudication of the application; if the application was approved, the agency would amend its records to delete the reference to removal; if the application was disapproved, the appellant could refile the appeal); <span class="Italic">Risen v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3149) (Board dismissed a disability retirement appeal on the basis of a settlement permitting refiling of the appeal following action on a related OWCP claim; reinitiation of the Board appeal was premature when OWCP had not then issued a decision); <span class="Italic">Shean v.

<p class="Body-Text">The parties may agree that a settlement will only be effective if it contains the signatures of all parties. Without those signatures, the AJ errs by dismissing the appeal as settled, <span class="Italic">Mastrogiuseppe v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 66 MSPR 251, 254-55 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, the fact that an appellant did not sign a settlement agreement will not, standing alone, invalidate the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Walker v. Department of the Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 600, 603 n.2 (1989). A written contract need not be signed to make the agreement binding. Rather, it is necessary only to show that the parties agreed to be bound. <span class="Italic">See J.A. Jones Construction Co. v. Plumbers &#x0026; Pipefitters Local 598</span>, 568 F.2d 1292, 1294-95 (9th Cir. 1978). The parties may agree, however, not to be bound until the agreement is signed<span class="Italic">. See Roth v. Garcia Marquez</span>, 942 F.2d 617, 626-27 (9th Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agreement here contains the provision that the effective date "shall be the last date upon which all signatures, as set out below, are affixed." The agreement has set out and labeled spaces for the signatures of two agency officials, the appellant, and the appellant's representative below. Only one of the agency signatures and the appellant's representative's signature are affixed. We find that by this term the parties intended to make the agreement binding only upon its signing by the parties. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ali v. Department of the Army</span>, 50 MSPR 563, 569 (1991) (the appellant's refusal to sign the written agreement after the oral agreement was reduced to writing did not affect the validity of the oral agreement in the absence of record evidence that the oral agreement was not to be binding until it was reduced to writing and signed by the parties). The appellant never indicated by his signature or his subsequent behavior that he agreed to settle his appeal. He informed the administrative judge shortly after receiving her June 2 initial decision dismissing the appeal that he did not agree to the settlement offer. Thus, the administrative judge in this appeal erred by dismissing the appeal as settled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 371, 374 (1997) (an agreement signed by the appellant and the agency representative was valid, even though the <span id="Page_4773"></span>appellant's representative did not sign it, when the agreement did not provide that it would become effective only upon the signing of the agreement by all of the listed individuals); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Kowalczyk v.

<p class="Body-Text">A party may offer a settlement and the other party may wait too long to accept it, perhaps hoping that intervening events may make it unnecessary. This seemed to be the situation in <span class="Italic">Ryack v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 294, 295-97 (1993). The agency offered the appellant a settlement signed by agency officials, but the appellant waited until after the issuance of the initial decision to accept the agreement. The passage of time allowed the agency successfully to claim that the agreement was withdrawn by unreasonable delay in its acceptance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency separated the appellant from his position of Research Psychologist, GS-14, through a RIF. The appellant filed an appeal of this action with the Board's Boston Regional Office. During a telephonic status conference held on December 15, 1992, the appellant suggested a settlement that would resolve this appeal, as well as all other outstanding discrimination complaints that were otherwise pending. The agency representative indicated that he would discuss the offer with other agency officials, and would reply to the appellant in writing if its response were favorable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency then drafted a settlement agreement to resolve the instant appeal, the appellant's formal discrimination complaint, and any other claims the appellant may have had. Under the terms of the agreement, the agency agreed to provide the appellant with a within-grade increase retroactive to December 3, 1989, in exchange for the appellant's withdrawal of his Board appeal, discrimination complaint, and any other complaints. This settlement was signed by the commanding officer of the agency's Submarine Medical Research Laboratory on December 21, 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant took no apparent action with regards to the settlement, and the administrative judge issued an initial decision sustaining the agency's RIF action on February 19, 1993. In this decision, the administrative judge found that the agency properly invoked the RIF regulations and properly applied them to the appellant, and that the appellant failed to establish the affirmative defenses of handicap or age discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Three days later, the appellant signed the settlement that the agency had sent him in December. On February 25, the agency informed the appellant that it would not accept the settlement because a final decision on his Board appeal had been issued. The agency argued that issuance of that decision precluded the appellant from withdrawing his appeal, as required under the agreement, and that the appellant had unilaterally modified the agreement by deleting a portion of one of its terms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant then filed a timely petition for review, asserting that he properly accepted the agency's settlement offer, and that he did not modify the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously recognized that a settlement agreement is a contract. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Romano v. US Postal Service</span>, 49 MSPR 319, 322 (1991). It is, therefore, appropriate to apply contract principles in determining whether a valid settlement has been reached.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an offer is silent regarding when acceptance must be exercised, it must be exercised within a reasonable time, otherwise the law presumes the offer to be withdrawn, and a later acceptance imposes no obligation of the proposer, even though the proposer has committed no act and gives no notice of the offer's withdrawal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mathewson Corp. v. Allied Marine Industries, Inc.</span>, 827 F.2d 850, 853 (1st Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Piland Corp. v. Rea Construction Company</span>, 672 F. Supp. 244, 246-47 (E.D. Va. 1987). What constitutes a reasonable time depends on all the circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mathewson</span>, 827 F.2d at 853.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant here failed to accept the agency's settlement offer within a reasonable time. He did not sign the settlement until two months after the agency official's signing, and there is no indication that the parties otherwise agreed to the settlement prior to the appellant's signing. Further, the issuance of the initial decision in the agency's favor before the appellant's acceptance further supports the conclusion that the time for accepting the offer had lapsed.[2] <span class="Italic">See</span> 827 F.2d at 855. We, therefore, conclude that a valid settlement has not been reached in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In reaching this conclusion, we disagree with the agency's position that issuance of the initial decision precluded acceptance because the appellant could no longer withdraw his appeal. Because the appellant timely filed a petition for review, the initial decision did not become final. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.113(a). The appellant's appeal was, therefore, still before the Board, and could be withdrawn in conjunction with a valid settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">McGann v.

Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3064), <span class="Italic">post</span>, presents an example of a settlement agreement--designed to secure appellant's retirement eligibility--that the agency negotiated as an unconditional settlement and that the Board declined to set aside when the appellant determined that the settlement might not accomplish the intended purpose:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1992, the appellant filed an individual right of action (IRA) appeal under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(a), claiming that the agency imposed two suspensions against him in reprisal for making whistleblowing disclosures. That appeal was dismissed pursuant to a written settlement agreement executed on April 7, 1993. Following the adjudication of a series of petitions for enforcement filed by the appellant, the Board set aside the 1993 settlement agreement and reinstated the IRA appeal for adjudication. <span class="Italic">Farrero v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration</span>, 78 MSPR 382 (1998), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, No. 98-3253, 1999 WL 435737 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 27, 1999). On remand, the IRA appeal was again dismissed pursuant to a second written settlement agreement executed on October 8, 1998. In his petition for review, the appellant asks the Board to set aside the 1998 settlement agreement as the result of a mutual mistake and misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term of the settlement agreement in contention is the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;Appellant shall be carried in an employed, non-duty status with the NASA until he is eligible for retirement (by virtue of having served ten-years active duty) June 21, 1999, or any adjusted date for correction or compliance with any OPM [Office of Personnel Management] regulations, on which day Appellant will be returned to duty status for one day only for the express and sole purpose of retirement processing.... <span class="Italic">Nothing in this Settlement Agreement warrants that Appellant will receive any retirement or other benefit after June 21, 1999.</span> If required for Appellant to qualify for retirement benefits, NASA shall adjust the June 21, 1999 retirement date to the extent that it can legally do so to assist in qualification,...<span class="Italic">provided</span> <span class="Italic">that</span> nothing in this agreement shall require the NASA to allow further duty status or make payments that will have the effect of enrichment of the Appellant beyond the compensation provided in Paragraph No. 4, below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant acknowledges the underlined text, and reports that it was included at the agency's insistence. He nevertheless contends that, through a letter from an agency retirement officer and other written and oral communications, the agency assured him that he would be eligible for a Federal Employees' Retirement System retirement annuity on May 31, 1999, based on his being 55 years of age and having 10 years creditable service, and that he would be able to carry his health and life insurance benefits into retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After signing the agreement, the appellant says he examined relevant provisions of the U.S. Code and Code of Federal Regulations, and learned that there is a chance that he might not qualify for an annuity if he separates from the agency on June 21. His concern is that he may lack 10 years of creditable service because significant portions of his service with the agency were spent in a nonpay status which might not be creditable. If this should be the case, he would not be able to remedy the situation under the terms of the settlement agreement, because he would be precluded from earning any further creditable service after June 21. Given the importance of his being eligible for a retirement annuity to his decision to accept the settlement agreement, the appellant asserts that it was a mutual mistake for the contract not to have provided that the agreement would become null and void if OPM found that he was not eligible for an annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4774"></span>A settlement agreement is a contract between the parties and, as such, may be set aside or voided only on the basis of certain limited grounds, including fraud, coercion, or mutual mistake<span class="Italic">. E.g., Lasker v. Department of Justice,</span> 74 MSPR 189, 191 (1997). The party challenging the validity of a settlement agreement bears a heavy burden of showing a basis for invalidating the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not established that the settlement agreement should be set aside on account of misrepresentation by the agency. The settlement agreement explicitly provides that "[n]othing in this Settlement Agreement warrants that Appellant will receive any retirement or other benefit after June 21, 1999." Moreover, paragraph 14 provides that the settlement agreement constitutes the complete understanding between the parties, and that "[n]o other promises or agreements will be binding unless reduced to writing and signed by both parties." To the extent that the appellant claims that he entered into the agreement based on misinformation, i.e., the retirement officer's letter, he has not met his burden of showing that this was, in fact, misinformation. The agency has produced new and material evidence, June 4, 1999 opinion letters from OPM, indicating that the retirement officer's statements were correct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it might have been prudent for the appellant to have bargained for an additional term providing that the settlement agreement would become null and void should OPM determine that he was not entitled to a retirement annuity, he did not do so, and the Board may not add such a term. <span class="Italic">See Murphy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 54 MSPR 202, 205 (1992) (parol evidence may not be used to add additional terms to a settlement agreement). We note that the appellant was aware of how to write such a term, since the 1993 settlement agreement expressly provided that it would become null and void if the agency violated the nondisclosure provisions. <span class="Italic">Farrero</span>, 78 MSPR at 384.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor has the appellant established that the settlement agreement should be set aside on account of a mutual mistake. Nullifying a settlement agreement on this basis may only be done when there is a mutual mistake that goes to a basic assumption about a fact in existence at the time of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Satterfield v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 80 MSPR 132 &#x00B6; 8 (1998); <span class="Italic">AsSalaam v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 MSPR 417, 421 (1994), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 47 F.3d 1184 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). The appellant's entitlement to a retirement annuity in June 1999 was of course not a fact in existence when the agreement was executed in October 1998.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Farrero</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Farrero v. NASA</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3064):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1992 Farrero filed an individual right of action (IRA) appeal under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221 (a), claiming that the agency imposed two suspensions against him in reprisal for making whistle-blowing disclosures. That appeal was dismissed pursuant to a written settlement agreement in 1993. Following the adjudication of a series of petitions for enforcement filed by Farrero, the Board set aside the 1993 agreement and reinstated Farrero's IRA appeal for adjudication. The parties again agreed to settle their dispute pursuant to a second written settlement agreement executed on October 8, 1998.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before signing the agreement, both parties asked the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) its opinion as to whether Farrero would be eligible for a Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) retirement annuity if he separated from the agency on June 21, 1999. OPM advised both the agency and Farrero in writing that, based on the personnel information provided by the agency, Farrero would meet the retirement annuity service and age requirements on that date. An agency retirement officer also advised Farrero in writing that he would qualify for a FERS retirement annuity on May 31, 1999. The settlement agreement was then executed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement provided in relevant part that Mr. Farrero would be</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">carried in an employed, non-duty status with the NASA until he is eligible for retirement (by virtue of having served ten-years active duty) [on] June 21, 1999, or any adjusted date for correction or compliance with any OPM regulations, on which day [Farrero] will be returned to duty status for one day only for the express and sole purpose of retirement processing. On said day, [Farrero] will complete, sign, and file with the Personnel Office at the NASA/John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC), all necessary retirement documents required to effect [his] retirement.... Nothing in this Settlement Agreement warrants that Appellant will receive any retirement or other benefit after June 21, 1999. If required for Appellant to qualify for retirement benefits, NASA shall adjust the June 21, 1999 retirement date to the extent that it can legally do so to assist in qualification, including adjustments to avoid an LWOP period that would adversely affect eligibility....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agreement included an integration clause and also stated that "[t]he parties understand the terms of this Agreement, voluntarily and knowingly agree to said terms, and willingly and freely execute this Agreement without duress or coercion."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the parties executed the settlement agreement, the Administrative Judge (AJ) dismissed Farrero's IRA claim as settled. <span class="Italic">See Farrero v. NASA</span>, Docket No. AT1221-93-0162-W-2 (Oct. 15, 1998) <span class="Italic">(Farrero 1)</span>, slip op. at 2. The AJ found the settlement agreement "lawful on its face and...freely reached by the parties." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1. The AJ also noted that "the parties have indicated that they understand the terms of the agreement and desire to have the agreement made a part of the record for purposes of enforcement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1-2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Farrero thereafter filed a petition for review of the AJ's dismissal of his IRA claim by the full Board, arguing that the settlement agreement was invalid on the grounds of mutual mistake and misrepresentation. Specifically, Farrero argued that, based on calculations he made after signing the agreement, he would not meet the service requirement for a retirement annuity if he retired on the agreed upon date and that the settlement agreement was therefore invalid because OPM and the agency were mistaken on this matter. Farrero also argued that the settlement agreement was invalid due to the agency's and OPM's misrepresentations concerning his retirement annuity eligibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held that Farrero did not prove that the agreement was invalid due to agency misrepresentation because (1) the agreement explicitly stated that there was no warranty that Farrero would receive any retirement benefits after June 21, 1999; (2) the agreement included an integration clause stating that no other promises or agreements would be binding unless reduced to writing and signed by both parties; and (3) Farrero did not show any evidence that the agency's and OPM's annuity information was, in fact, misinformation. <span class="Italic">See Farrero II</span>, slip op. at 4. The Board also held that Farrero did not prove that the agreement was invalid due to mutual mistake because Farrero's future entitlement to an annuity was not a fact in existence when the agreement was executed. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Farrero timely appealed to this court. We have exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from the final decision of the Board under 28 USC &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) (1994). However, we have a limited scope of review. We must affirm the Board's decision unless we find it to be (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 5503(c) (1994); <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Navy</span>, 130 F.3d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"One who attacks a settlement [agreement] must bear the burden of showing that the contract he has made is tainted with invalidity, either by fraud practiced upon him or by a mutual mistake under which both acted." <span class="Italic">Asberry v. USPS</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">see also Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes of Indians of Oklahoma v. United States</span>, 671 F.2d 1305, 1311 (Ct. Cl. 1982). We review the Board's refusal to vacate a settlement agreement under an abuse of discretion standard. <span class="Italic">See Asberry</span>, 692 F.2d at 1380. "It is not for this court to reweigh the evidence before the Board." <span class="Italic">Henry v. Department of the Navy</span>, 902 F.2d 949, 951 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appearing <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, Farrero makes the same arguments on appeal that he made below. He also admits that he does not know whether or not he would be eligible for a retirement annuity because he canceled his retirement application. The agency responds that the Board correctly found the settlement agreement not invalid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency. The agency cannot be said to have misrepresented to Farrero his eligibility for a retirement annuity given that he has not submitted any evidence that OPM rejected his retirement annuity application based on a failure to satisfy the service requirement. In fact, Farrero <span class="Italic">withdrew</span> his retirement annuity application. The issue is thus not ripe for review. Even if OPM or the agency's information were incorrect, Farrero has not provided any evidence that the agency concealed any material facts or knowingly misled him into believing he would be eligible for an annuity. Farrero has therefore failed to show any fraud<span class="Italic">. See Harris v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1463, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1998). In light of these facts, we need not evaluate the disclaimer of warranty in the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, since there has been no denial of an application for an annuity, and thus no basis to conclude that OPM or the agency were mistaken in their advice, Farrero has also failed to prove that the settlement agreement is invalid due to mutual mistake.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Evans v. Selective Service System</span>, 91 MSPR 376, 381 &#x00B6; 7 (2002) ("While it might have been prudent for the appellant to have bargained for an additional term providing that the settlement agreement would become null and void should OPM determine that the appellant was not entitled to a discontinued service annuity, he did not do so, and the Board may not add such a term.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">How could the difficulties in <span class="Italic">Farrero</span> have been avoided? Leaving aside the problem of the withdrawal of the retirement application, the settlement could have been made conditional upon OPM's grant of the annuity. Alternatively, the settlement could have provided that the appeal would be dismissed without prejudice for the amount of time necessary for OPM to adjudicate the retirement application with the condition that the parties would return to the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, with the settlement having no effect, if the annuity was disapproved. The appeal would then have to be refiled--to be dismissed as <span id="Page_4775"></span>settled if the annuity was approved, and to be adjudicated on the merits if the annuity was disapproved.</p>
