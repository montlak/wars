<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-130"><span class="space">d.</span> Claims Concerning Tenure, Contract Employment, Promotion, and Bonuses</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">"[I]t is well settled that employment within the federal civil service system is a product of appointment, not contract, and that removal from federal civil service does not give rise to an action for breach of contract within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims." <span class="Italic">Towsend v. United States</span>, 468 Fed. Appx. 962, 966 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP) (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Hopkins</span>, 427 U.S. 123, 128 (1976)). A contract of employment is not presumed. Federal employment ordinarily is by appointment, and termination challenges do not ordinarily provide jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, <span class="Italic">Soliman v. United States</span>, 724 Fed. Appx. 936, 938-41 (Fed. Cir. 2018 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Soliman is a former State Department employee who served as a legal advisor in the State Department's Iraqi Transition Assistance Office ("ITAO"). Executive Order 13,431 established ITAO as a temporary office to support the United States in "concluding remaining large infrastructure projects expeditiously in Iraq, in facilitating Iraq's transition to self-sufficiency, and in maintaining an effective diplomatic presence in Iraq." Exec. Order No. 13,431, 72 Fed. Reg. 26,709 (May 8, 2007). ITAO personnel were hired pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3161, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> which authorizes appointment of personnel to a temporary organization within the government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 30, 2009, the State Department confirmed Soliman's "temporary excepted appointment" as a "PRT Rule of Law Senior Advisor" in the ITAO for a term effective May 14, 2009 and not to exceed June 13, 2010. The State Department terminated Soliman's "temporary appointment" with the ITAO effective December 2, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We review the Claims Court's decision to dismiss a claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Waltner v. United States,</span> 679 F.3d 1329, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2012). A plaintiff bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, <span class="Italic">Taylor v. United States,</span> 303 F.3d 1357, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2002), and the leniency afforded <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigants with respect to mere formalities does not relieve them of jurisdictional requirements, <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Sec'y, U.S. Dep't of Labor,</span> 812 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Tucker Act provides the Claims Court with jurisdiction over claims "against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1). The Tucker Act is "only a jurisdictional statute; it does not create any substantive right enforceable against the United States for money damages." <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan,</span> 424 U.S. 392, 398 (1976). "Instead, to invoke jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, a plaintiff must identify a contractual relationship, constitutional provision, statute, or regulation that provides a substantive right to money damages." <span class="Italic">Khan v. United States,</span> 201 F.3d 1375, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first address Soliman's claims relating to termination of his employment. Soliman argues that the Claims Court erred in holding that it did not have jurisdiction over his breach of contract, back pay, and due process claims. Soliman contends that the May 14, 2009 Standard Form 50 ("May 2009 SF-50") relied on by the court was "fraudulent." Soliman argues that the government violated his due process rights and his rights pursuant to Chapter 75 of Title 5 in terminating his employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government responds that the Claims Court correctly concluded that it lacks jurisdiction over Soliman's breach of contract claim. The government contends that the court correctly found that Soliman failed to rebut the presumption that his employment was by appointment, not contract. The government argues that the May 2009 SF-50 was not a forgery and not necessary to the Claims Court's decision. The government contends that the court properly dismissed Soliman's back pay claims for failure to state a claim, not lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government that the Claims Court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Soliman's breach of contract claim. There is a "well-established principle that, absent specific legislation, federal employees derive the benefits and emoluments of their positions from <span class="Italic">appointment rather than from any contractual or quasi-contractual relationship</span> with the government." <span class="Italic">Chu v. United States,</span> 773 F.2d 1226, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (emphasis added).

United States,</span> 873 F.2d 1414, 1417 n.5 (Fed. Cir. 1989). Whether an employee serves by appointment or contract depends on an analysis of the relevant statutes and regulations and whatever evidence is adduced as to an employee's particular status. <span class="Italic">Hopkins,</span> 427 U.S. at 130.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, "[n]othing in the record rebuts the presumption that a federal employee is employed by appointment and not by contract or quasi-contract." <span class="Italic">Hamlet v. United States,</span> 63 F.3d 1097, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Executive Order 13,431 established the ITAO as a "temporary organization" "in accordance with section 3161 of title 5, United States Code." Section 3161 authorizes "the head of a temporary organization [to] <span class="Italic">appoint</span> persons to positions of employment...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3161(b)(1) (emphasis added). The documents submitted by Soliman confirm that his employment was by "appointment." <span class="Italic">See</span> Amended Complaint Ex.

C (A.A. 27) ("We are pleased to confirm your temporary excepted <span class="Italic">appointment</span>...."), Ex. D (same), Ex. E (A.A. 28) ("Please be advised that your temporary <span class="Italic">appointment</span> with the [ITAO] is being terminated....") (emphases added). The Claims Court thus correctly dismissed the breach of contract claim for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan,</span> 456 U.S. at 738, 741 (explaining "all the evidence in the record is to the effect that respondent was appointed to his positions" and holding "[b]ecause...respondent was [not] hired pursuant to an express employment contract, we find that the Tucker Act did not confer jurisdiction over respondent's claims for monetary relief"); <span class="Italic">Hamlet,</span> 63 F.3d at 1102 (holding appellant's employment was by appointment and, "[t]hus, [appellant's] breach of contract count...cannot provide for jurisdiction under the Tucker Act").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Claims Court also did not err in not exercising jurisdiction over Soliman's due process claims. The Claims Court lacks jurisdiction over claims based on the Due Process clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments because they are not "money-mandating." <span class="Italic">LeBlanc v. United States,</span> 50 F.3d 1025, 1028 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, Soliman's argument based on Chapter 75 of Title 5 is not well taken. Soliman does not appear to have raised this issue before the Claims Court.

<p class="Body-Text">A Tucker Act suit for breach of contract failed when the plaintiff's employment was by appointment as a medical resident at VA but his place of employment was at an Army medical center where he had a due process agreement concerning termination of his position there. That agreement did not alter the nature of the VA appointment and the lack of a contract of employment, <span class="Italic">Refaei v. United States</span>, 725 Fed. Appx. 945, 950-51 (Fed. Cir. 2018 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Tucker Act gives the Claims Court jurisdiction over, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, claims against the United States founded upon an "express or implied contract with the United States." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1). "The Tucker Act does not create substantive rights. Rather, it is a jurisdictional provision 'that operate[s] to waive sovereign immunity for claims premised on other sources of law (e.g., statutes or contracts).'" <span class="Italic">Holmes v. United States</span>, 657 F.3d 1303, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. Navajo Nation</span>, 556 U.S. 287, 291 (2009)). The sole basis for jurisdiction pressed by Dr. Refaei on appeal is that he had an "express or implied contract with the United States." The dispositive inquiry in this case is whether there was an employment contract between Dr. Refaei and the Government enforceable under the Tucker Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of whether a Government employee serves by appointment or by contract turns upon an analysis of the statutes and regulations governing the employment of the plaintiff and whatever evidence is adduced as to a plaintiff's particular status. <span class="Italic">United States v. Hopkins</span>, 427 U.S. 123, 130 (1976). We have stated that there is a "well-established principle that, absent specific legislation, federal employees derive the benefits and emoluments of their positions from appointment rather than from any contractual or quasi-contractual relationship with the government." <span class="Italic">Chu v. United States</span>, 773 F.2d 1226, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 1985). In <span class="Italic">Kania v.

Cl. 1981). However, "[t]he contract must be made by a person having authority." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5357"></span>Dr. Refaei admits that he served by appointment. The question, therefore, is whether he also had an employment contract enforceable under the Tucker Act. It is Dr. Refaei's burden to establish that the Resident Agreement was such a contract. <span class="Italic">Reynolds v. Army &#x0026; Air Force Exch. Serv</span>., 846 F.2d 746, 748 (Fed. Cir. 1988). We have not previously found an appointment-supplementing, enforceable employment contract. The decisions in <span class="Italic">Chu</span> and <span class="Italic">Kania</span> make clear, at a minimum, the strength of the presumption that federal employment is by appointment only, not also by contract. Moreover, the Supreme Court recognized in <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span> that Congress, in the Civil Service Reform Act, broadly (if not completely) displaced Tucker Act remedies for challenges to federal employment decisions. 484 U.S. 439, 454 (1988). We conclude that, if an appointment supplementing, enforceable federal contract could ever be found (an issue we need not decide), Dr. Refaei has not shown one here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only statutory basis of employment identified by Dr. Refaei is limited to VA appointment. The statute authorizing the VA to establish residency programs and to appoint qualified persons thereto provides that the Secretary "may prescribe the conditions of employment of persons appointed...including necessary training" and that medical schools and other hospitals may participate in the training of residents. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7406(b)-(c). Dr. Refaei cites no authority for Dr. DeZee, WBAMC, or the Army to enter into a supplemental employment agreement governing the residency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, WBAMC's letter offering Dr. Refaei a residency position expressly referred to his employment being governed by the VA, not WBAMC. And the Resident Agreement itself points against, not toward, Army authority to establish enforceable employment terms. It recognizes that WBAMC's training programs "acquire residents through several different sources" referred to in the Resident Agreement as "Fiscal Agencies." These Fiscal Agencies, according to the Resident Agreement, "provide the financial support and specific benefits for their respective group[s] of residents" and have their "own set[s] of formal policies" specific to employment at the respective Fiscal Agencies. The Resident Agreement states that it merely "highlights the various benefits provided to the residents" and "cannot super[s] ede the specific policies of each agency."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the foregoing, we agree with the Claims Court's conclusion that Dr. Refaei failed to establish the existence of Tucker Act contract jurisdiction.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Because we decide that Dr. Refaei served by appointment and not by contract, we need not evaluate whether Dr. Refaei has shown the Residency Agreement is money-mandating under the Tucker Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Tucker Act offers little succor to the civil servant contesting dismissal. <span class="Italic">Booth v. United States</span>, 990 F.2d 617, 619-20 (Fed. Cir. 1993), involving an alleged breach of an employment contract between the government and a National Guard civilian technician who resigned and challenged his resignation, explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In denying the Government's RCFC 12(b)(1) motion, the Court of Federal Claims determined that Mr. Booth's complaint stated a claim within the court's subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court reasoned that claims based on contracts with the Government fall within its general Tucker Act jurisdiction. With respect to Mr. Booth's employment contract, however, the trial court erred. The Supreme Court has specifically held that the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub. L. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978) (codified as amended in various sections of 5 USC), precludes Mr. Booth's type of suit in the Court of Federal Claims. <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 449, 454, 108 S. Ct. 668, 677, 98 L. Ed.2d 830 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA exclusively governs federal personnel matters. <span class="Italic">Bobula v. United States</span>, 970 F.2d 854, 857 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 443, 108 S. Ct. at 671-72). Thus, the CSRA specifies the only avenues for relief in personnel matters covered by the Act. <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 454, 108 S. Ct. at 677; <span class="Italic">Bobula</span>, 970 F.2d at 857. The Supreme Court has stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[U]nder the comprehensive and integrated review scheme of the CSRA, the [Court of Federal Claims] (and any other court relying on Tucker Act jurisdiction) is not an "appropriate authority" to review an agency's personnel determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 454, 108 S. Ct. at 677. Because the CSRA provides an exclusive alternative remedy, the United States has not waived its immunity to suit on Mr. Booth's personnel action in the Court of Federal Claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA specifically excludes employees in Mr. Booth's service category from its channels of administrative and judicial review. 5 USC 7511(b)(5) (Supp. III 1991). Section 7511(b)(5) denies administrative protection, including judicial review, to an employee "described in section 8337(h)(1) relating to technicians in the National Guard." Mr. Booth does not dispute that his employment as a technician for the Minnesota National Guard was within the definition set forth in 5 USC 8337(h)(1) (1988). Therefore, the CSRA expressly denies Mr. Booth judicial review in the Court of Federal Claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> governs jurisdiction over Mr. Booth's claim. Mr. Booth contends that his case differs from <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> because he is not seeking judicial review of an agency decision as was the employee in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>. Rather, Mr. Booth purports to seek enforcement of his right to obtain a final agency decision regarding the volitional nature of his resignation. Nonetheless a judicial inquiry into the Government's notice to Mr. Booth of his appeal rights or into the voluntariness of his resignation would require review of his resignation. Because the relief sought by Mr. Booth would require review of his underlying personnel action, the Court of Federal Claims lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 454-55, 108 S.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Piper is a retired United States Army officer and a retired civil servant. In December 2005, he responded to a newspaper advertisement by the Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Security Agency ("TSA") seeking applicants for transportation security officer positions. During the hiring process he specifically inquired whether his status as a retired federal employee would impact his TSA salary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal retirees who are reemployed by the federal government must ordinarily have their salary reduced by the amount of their retirement pay, but he was assured that TSA's hiring process was different from other agencies and that his TSA salary would not be impacted by his retirement pay. Based on these assurances, he retired from the job he held at the time in California and moved to Gunnison, Colorado, to accept a position with TSA. Three months after beginning his new job, he was informed that his status as a federal retiree required TSA to reduce his pay by the amount of his retirement annuity. When he inquired as to why he had been told prior to accepting the position that his salary would not be offset by his retirement pay, he was told that TSA had granted waivers to prevent the reduction of retirees' pay in the past, but the practice had ended. Because the pay reduction made living in Gunnison unaffordable, Piper resigned from TSA and moved to Arizona.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Piper filed a claim with TSA, alleging that TSA's failure to inform him that his salary would be reduced by his retirement pay was a breach of contract. He also wrote letters to his congressional representatives. After these measures failed to afford him relief, he filed a complaint in the Court of Federal Claims asserting jurisdiction under the Tucker Act and seeking reimbursement for <span class="Italic">inter alia</span> lost pay and relocation expenses. The government filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, which the court granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Tucker Act gives the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over "any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1). The Tucker Act, however, does not create any substantive rights. <span id="Page_5358"></span>Instead, it confers jurisdiction on the Court of Federal Claims only "when the constitutional provision, statute, or regulation in question expressly creates a substantive right enforceable against the federal government for money damages." <span class="Italic">LeBlanc v. United States,</span> 50 F.3d 1025, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 1995). As the trial court correctly held, there is no contract in this case that would grant Tucker Act jurisdiction. The court properly found that Piper's employment with TSA was by appointment and not by contract. <span class="Italic">Chu v. United States,</span> 773 F.2d 1226, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 1985) ("[A]bsent specific legislation, federal employees derive the benefits and emoluments of their positions from appointment rather than from any contractual or quasi-contractual relationship with the government.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Piper argues that whether his TSA position was by appointment or contract is irrelevant because the harm occurred during the hiring process, and that this is a "case of failing to properly tell[&#8197;] the truth to a prospective employee." This, however, does not create jurisdiction under the Tucker Act. Piper cannot show a contractual relationship between himself and the government during the hiring process any more than he can show there was one after he was employed by TSA. His suggestion that the Constitution, Title 5 of the United States Code, or the TSA Human Resources Personnel Handbook provide Tucker Act jurisdiction also fails because he has not pointed to any "substantive right enforceable against the federal government for money damages," <span class="Italic">LeBlanc,</span> 50 F.3d at 1028, provided by any of these sources that would be applicable under the facts of this case. Instead, Piper's claim is best characterized as one of misrepresentation, which sounds in tort and over which the Court of Federal Claims does not have jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Claims for temporary promotions have not fared well under the Tucker Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Monaco v. United States</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-5060) (rejecting claim for past compensation based on <span class="Italic">de facto</span> appointment arguably resulting from performance of higher level duties pending confirmation of appointment to higher level position: "[f]ederal employees serv[ing] pursuant to appointment are entitled to the rights and salary of only the position to which they have actually been appointed").<span class="Italic"> Collier v. United States</span>, 379 F.3d 1330, 1331-34 (Fed. Cir. 2004), rejected a claim for higher salary based on assignment of higher-level duties; the claim was denied under theories based on implied and express contractual arrangements, as well as under the Back Pay Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Collier was employed as a Patent Advisor with the Department of the Air Force at the Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts. In August 1985 he was promoted to grade GS-14, in which he served until his retirement in May 2000. In February 1986 he was assigned the position of Supervisory Patent Advisor, which was also a GS-14 position. His performance plan required him to perform the duties of the Chief of the Division, a GS-15 position, in the chief's absence. Mr. Collier states that for twenty-four months he performed the duties of the Chief, who was not "absent" but had retired. When he was not selected for the Chief position, Mr. Collier filed a grievance for back pay, seeking the difference between the GS-15 compensation of the Chief position and the GS-14 compensation at which he had been paid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When his grievance was denied, Mr. Collier filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims, which granted the government's motion to dismiss. This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Collier presented four issues: that the government breached a contract with him established by a performance plan requiring him to perform the duties of the Division Chief in the latter's absence; that the government took the salary to which he was entitled, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution; that the government owed him compensation under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596; and that he had an independent cause of action in the Court of Federal Claims. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed the independent cause of action, breach of contract, and Back Pay Act claims for lack of jurisdiction, and dismissed the Fifth Amendment taking claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Mr. Collier does not appeal the dismissal of the taking claim. He argues that for the three remaining counts the Court of Federal Claims failed to construe the facts in the complaint in his favor, and that there were various errors of law and fact.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Collier alleges that the Performance Plan entered into between him and his supervisor, which states that Mr. Collier will assume the duties of the Chief of the Division in the latter's absence, is an enforceable contract. Section 10E of the Plan states that Mr. Collier "[a]cts as Deputy Chief of the Division in the absence of the Chief and performs the duties of that position." The Plan does not provide for increased compensation when Mr. Collier is called upon to perform these duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Federal Claims observed that Civil Service employees hold their positions by appointment, not contract. It is undisputed that Mr. Collier held a Civil Service appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chu v. United States</span>, 773 F.2d 1226, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 1985) ("[A]bsent specific legislation, federal employees derive the benefits and emoluments of their positions from appointment rather than from any contractual or quasi-contractual relationships with the government.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court also observed that even if Mr. Collier's appointment did not bar his entry into a contract of employment, no statute or regulation granted his supervisor the authority to enter into an employment contract by way of a Performance Plan that might change the conditions and pay of employment. Mr. Collier cites <span class="Italic">Army Air Force Exchange Service v. Sheehan</span>, 456 U.S. 728 (1982) and <span class="Italic">House v. United States</span>, 14 Cl. Ct. 32 (1987) as cases which admit of the possibility of an employment contract with the government. However, neither case controls Mr. Collier's situation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Sheehan,</span> an employee of the Army Air Force Exchange Service, a nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the United States, sued for breach of contract because his discharge was allegedly in violation of the Service's regulations. Noting that a nonappropriated fund instrumentality can employ individuals either by appointment or by contract, the Court examined the circumstances of Mr. Sheehan's employment. Finding that he was employed by appointment, the Court rejected his contract claims:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although respondent alleges that he was employed, both initially and upon entering the EMP, by express employment contracts, he points to nothing in the record or in the relevant AAFES regulations that substantiates that claim. In fact, his complaint supports the contrary view....&#8197;Respondent's selection to the EMP plainly was pursuant to appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">456 U.S. at 735-36.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">House</span> this precedent was applied to former employees of the Service Department of the United States Senate, who alleged breach of employment contracts, stemming from their discharges. Stating that "it is well established that barring some explicit agreement to the contrary entered into by a federal officer having authority to contract, federal personnel do not have contractual relationships with the Government," the Claims Court (now the Court of Federal Claims) determined that the former employees had been appointed to their positions, and dismissed their contract causes of action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Collier argues that it is self evident that a government official at the level of his supervisor has the authority to bind the government in contract. However, any general contracting authority that his supervisor might have is not relevant to this situation. As an appointed employee, Mr. Collier did not have an employment contract with the government, and did not acquire such a contract through his job description or performance plan. The Court of Federal Claims correctly dismissed the contract claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Collier states that he presented a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> claim under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)(1)&#x2003;An employee of an agency who, on the basis of a timely appeal or an administrative determination (including a decision relating to an unfair labor practice or a grievance) is found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement, to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;is entitled, on correction of the personnel action, to receive for the period for which the personnel action was in effect--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any amounts earned by the employee through other employment during that period; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;reasonable attorney fees....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Collier states that his employment for an extended period of time in a position classified at the GS-15 level, while receiving compensation at the GS-14 level, violates the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Federal Claims dismissed this claim because Mr. Collier had not shown a reduction in his pay, and held that the failure to increase his pay is not cognizable under the Back Pay Act. The Back Pay Act applies to an employee found to "have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1). Precedent establishes that this language precludes the Act from applying to the government's failure to pay an employee at a higher rate than that at which he was paid, in the absence of an actual overall reduction of pay or benefits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Claims Court [stated] that [<span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 957 (1976)] referred to "situations in which the corrective action is of a retroactive nature, namely, restoration to the position held at the time of the wrongful adverse action in issue. Only in such situations can the Back Pay Act be interpreted to provide monetary relief....&#8197;[B]ack pay can be awarded for 'an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or a part of the pay...of the employee' <span class="Italic">from <span id="Page_5359"></span>the position from which the employee was discharged</span>.'" (Emphasis added.) This interpretation is required by the rule recited in <span class="Italic">Testan</span> that a "federal employee is entitled to receive only the salary of the position to which he was appointed...." 424 U.S. at 406.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Smith v. United States</span>, 823 F.2d 532, 535 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, Mr. Collier does not seek retroactive reinstatement to a position to which he had been legally appointed, but rather the pay of a higher position whose duties he temporarily performed as part of his appointed position. The Back Pay Act does not apply to such situations. The Court of Federal Claims properly dismissed this claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before filing suit in the Court of Federal Claims, Mr. Collier filed a formal grievance for back pay. That grievance was decided against him and, according to the Grievance System, was "final and not subject to review." Mr. Collier argues that the unreviewability of the grievance decision vests jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims as an independent cause of action. He states: "there is an independent cause of action in the CFC because the Decision in the formal grievance was non-reviewable and final by the [government's] own rules." He cites <span class="Italic">McClary v. United States</span>, 775 F.2d 280 (Fed. Cir. 1985), and <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. United States</span>, 5 Cl. Ct. 792 (1984), as establishing such an independent cause of action. The Court of Federal Claims rejected this asserted ground of jurisdiction, based on Mr. Collier's failure to establish entitlement to back pay. The court stated, "This Court need not rule on the Government's argument regarding the exclusive jurisdiction of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 because the rationale used by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> is sufficient to dismiss this count for lack of jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Collier</span>, 56 Fed. Cl. at 359 n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kennedy</span> the employee sued for lost salary resulting from a suspension of less than 14 days. Since suspensions of less than 14 days are not appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board, Mr. Kennedy asserted a right of direct appeal to the Claims Court. That court observed that "[p]rior to the enactment of the [Civil Service Reform Act], the United States Court of Claims exercised jurisdiction over cases where a substantive right to receive a certain sum of money was conferred on the plaintiff by statute or regulation and where the plaintiff had been unconstitutionally deprived of that money," <span class="Italic">Kennedy</span>, 5 Cl. Ct. at 793, and denied the government's motion to dismiss Kennedy's claim for lack of jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">McClary</span> the Federal Circuit held that the Claims Court did not have jurisdiction of the appeal, based on <span class="Italic">Kennedy</span>, specifically because McClary did have the right of review of the adverse action by the Merit Systems Protection Board. These cases do not help Mr. Collier, for he was not subject to an adverse employment action and he did not possess "a substantive right to receive a certain sum of money...conferred on [him] by statute or regulation." <span class="Italic">See United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439 (1998) (holding that there is no right of review in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act or the Back Pay Act of an employment claim for which administrative or judicial review is precluded by the Civil Service Reform Act); <span class="Italic">Romero v. United States</span>, 38 F.3d 1204 (Fed. Cir. 1994). The court correctly held that there is no independent right of action, for there was no removal of a right to receive payment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A claim was dismissed, based on a contract theory, that the government improperly failed to convert the plaintiff from a contract position to a staff employee position, <span class="Italic">Doe v. Goss</span>, 2007 WL 106523, 2007 U.S. DIST. LEXIS 2708 (D.D.C. No. 04-2122 Jan. 12, 2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no legal basis for a claim of "failure to convert." To the extent this claim is part of Plaintiff's contract or FTCA claims, as Plaintiff appears to argue, it is subsumed within those counts and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent this claim purports to allege a separate breach of contract for failure to abide by an alleged agreement to convert Plaintiff to an agency employee, it must fail on two grounds. First, such a contract claim amounts to yet another attempt to seek judicial review of an adverse personnel action and is preempted by the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See Bobula [v. United States Department of Justice]</span> <span class="Italic">,</span> 970 F.2d 854 at 857. Second, federal employment is governed by federal personnel law and not common law contract principles. Accordingly, federal employees' employment relationships are governed by Congressional statute and federal case law, not common law contract law. <span class="Italic">OCONUS DOD Emple. Rotation Action Group v. Cohen,</span> 144 F. Supp.2d 1, 8 (D.D.C. 2000) <span class="Italic">(citing Bell v. United States,</span> 366 U.S. 393, 401,[6 L.

<p class="Body-Text">Little Tucker Act jurisdiction existed under the National Security Personnel Act for a claim for a bonus, denied on the basis of interpretation of governing regulations, <span class="Italic">Price v. Panetta</span>, 674 F.3d 1335, 1338-41 (Fed. Cir. 2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Little Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1346(a), allows a plaintiff to bring an action in district court if the action is based on a claim against the United States "not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an executive department." The Act both creates jurisdiction in the district court and waives sovereign immunity for an action falling within the jurisdictional grant. It does not, however, create a cause of action; for that, the plaintiff must look elsewhere. <span class="Italic">Fisher v. United States</span>, 402 F.3d 1167, 1172 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span> in pertinent part). As the Supreme Court has explained, the plaintiff must "identify a substantive source of law that establishes specific fiduciary or other duties, and allege that the Government has failed faithfully to perform those duties," after which "the court must then determine whether the relevant source of substantive law can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation for damages sustained" as a result of the breach. <span class="Italic">United States v. Navajo Nation</span>, 537 U.S. 488, 506 (2003), <span class="Italic">quoting United States v. Mitchell</span>, 463 U.S. 206, 217, 219 (1983); <span class="Italic">see also United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe</span>, 537 U.S. 465, 472 (2003). This court has characterized that requirement as imposing on the Tucker Act plaintiff the burden of showing that the source of substantive law is a "money-mandating" provision, i.e., it must mandate "compensation for specific instances of past injuries or labors." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ctr. for Mfg. Scis. v. United States,</span> 114 F.3d 196, 201 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A statutory or regulatory provision that grants a government official or agency substantial discretion to decide whether to expend government funds in a particular way is not considered money-mandating and does not create a cause of action that can be prosecuted under the Little Tucker Act. <span class="Italic">See Barnick v. United States,</span> 591 F.3d 1372, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2010). However, a statute or regulation that provides for payment of money can qualify as money-mandating if the plaintiff's claim is that the statute or regulation creates a right to payment upon a showing that the plaintiff qualifies for that payment by satisfying designated statutory or regulatory requirements. <span class="Italic">Fisher</span>, 402 F.3d at 1174-75; <span class="Italic">see Jan's Helicopter Serv., Inc. v. FAA</span>, 525 F.3d 1299, 1307-08 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">In re United States,</span> 463 F.3d 1328, 1334-36 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Moreover, "[t]he substantive source of law may grant the claimant a right to recover damages either expressly or by implication." <span class="Italic">Navajo Nation</span>, 537 U.S. at 506, <span class="Italic">quoting Mitchell,</span> 463 U.S. at 217 n.16. Once the plaintiff has made such a showing, all the plaintiff is required to do in order to establish jurisdiction under the Tucker Act or the Little Tucker Act is to make a non-frivolous assertion that he is "within the class of plaintiffs entitled to recover under the money-mandating source"; the court then has jurisdiction to determine whether the plaintiff is entitled to relief on the merits. <span class="Italic">Jan's Helicopter Serv.</span>, 525 F.3d at 1307.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Complaints by civil service employees regarding personnel actions covered by the Civil Service Reform Act are subject to the jurisdiction of the Merit Systems Protection Board and do not give rise to actions under the Tucker Act or the Little Tucker Act. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 449, 455 (1988); <span class="Italic">Worthington v. United States</span>, 168 F.3d 24, 26-27 (Fed. Cir. 1999). However, a statute or regulation requiring an agency to pay employees certain amounts under certain circumstances is frequently money-mandating and sufficient to give rise to an action under the Tucker Act or Little Tucker Act for damages. <span class="Italic">See Hall v. United States,</span> 617 F.3d 1313, 1317-18 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (suit for compensation for days employee was engaged in jury service); <span class="Italic">Brodowy v. United States,</span> 482 F.3d 1370, 1375-76 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (statute providing for additional pay for FAA employees transferring between certain positions within the agency is a money-mandating statute); <span class="Italic">In re United States,</span> 463 F.3d at 1334 (statute fixing salary of bankruptcy judges is a money-mandating statute); <span class="Italic">Bosco v. United States</span>, 931 F.2d 879, 882 (Fed. Cir. 1991) ("prevailing rate" wage statute is money-mandating).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the district court noted, the statutory scheme at issue in this case contemplated that bonuses would be paid in amounts dictated by the ratings given to NSPS employees for the pertinent appraisal period. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(b)(7)(I) (Supp. II 2008) (directing the Defense Department to promulgate regulations providing for a "pay-for-performance evaluation system to better link individual pay to performance and provide an equitable method for appraising and compensating employees"). Those regulations created the NSPS pay system, which established pay structures and pay administration rules that replaced the standard civil service pay system for covered employees. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.301(a). With respect to the performance pay provisions of the NSPS, the regulations provided that NSPS employees would be rated after the close of each fiscal year, and each employee would be assigned a specific number of "shares" based on that rating. Those shares would then be used to determine the amount of the employee's performance payout. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.342. The amount of the performance payout would be calculated by starting with the number of shares each employee was assigned and multiplying the value of each share by the employee's base salary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 9901.342(g)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In Mr. Price's case, the government does not dispute the amount that he would have been entitled to under the regulations if he had been employed on the effective date of the bonus payments. According to Mr. Price, that amount, calculated according to his rating during the 2008 appraisal period and reduced to a sum certain, was $4,777. The issue in this case is not the amount of the bonus, but whether he was entitled to any bonus at all, which turns not on the exercise of discretion by a government official, but on the date that is determined to be the effective date of the bonus payments for the appraisal period ending on September 30, 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5360"></span>Mr. Price's claim is thus to a fixed amount calculated according to the regulatory formula, and his eligibility to be paid that sum turns on an interpretation of the governing statute and regulations. If Mr. Price is correct that he was employed on the effective date of the bonus payments, he would have an undisputed right to the payment of a bonus in an amount certain. An action to enforce the payment of that amount could properly be brought under the Little Tucker Act, as the regulation in dispute would be money-mandating as to an employee who is determined to be eligible for a bonus in a fixed amount. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. United States</span>, 463 F.3d 1314, 1324-25 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (where statute dictates that "once the agency makes a determination that a particular position is entitled to [certain type of] pay, the employee 'shall' receive premium pay under the statute," such a statute "is money-mandating because once a condition is met, namely that the head of an agency states that a position meets the [listed] criteria...the statute requires payment to employees with that position"); <span class="Italic">Fisher</span>, 402 F.3d at 1174-75 (statute is money-mandating because when the requirements of the statute are met--i.e., when the Secretary determines that a service member is unfit for duty because of a physical disability, and that disability is permanent and stable and is not the result of the member's intentional misconduct or willful neglect--the member is entitled to compensation"); <span class="Italic">Doe v. United States,</span> 100 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (finding statute to be money-mandating when it requires "the payment of some award to claimants who have met the statutory conditions for recovery," despite the "fact that the [government] retains some discretion to determine the amount of an award, within prescribed limits"); <span class="Italic">see generally United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392, 402 (1976) (noting authority allowing a Tucker Act suit for relief by a plaintiff arguing that his position carries a statutory entitlement to a higher level of pay).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government's argument that this case does not fall within the purview of the Little Tucker Act is based in part on its contention that Mr. Price is wrong in interpreting the pertinent regulations, and that under the proper interpretation of the governing regulations he was required to be employed on January 4, 2009, in order to be entitled to a bonus for the performance year ending on September 30, 2008. The government asserts that because Mr. Price was "not entitled to a bonus payout," the NSPS regulations were "not money-mandating with respect to Mr. Price." As the district court pointed out in responding to the same argument, however, that argument conflates jurisdiction with the merits. If Mr. Price is correct on the merits of his regulatory argument, he was entitled to be paid the bonus, and the district court would have jurisdiction to issue judgment in his favor. If Mr. Price is wrong on the merits, he is not entitled to be paid. But that is because he would lose his case on the merits, not because the district court would lack jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute. <span class="Italic">See Doe</span>, 463 F.3d at 1324 ("The jurisdictional requirement is met if a statute or regulation is 'money-mandating.'&#8197;...However, a party bringing suit under the Tucker Act may then lose on the merits if he or she is not one of the persons entitled to pay under the statute or regulation."); <span class="Italic">see also Brodowy,</span> 482 F.3d at 1375 ("Where plaintiffs have invoked a money-mandating statute and have made a non-frivolous assertion that they are entitled to relief under the statute, we have held that the Court of Federal Claims has subject-matter jurisdiction over the case.").</p>
