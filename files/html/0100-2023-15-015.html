<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 630.403(a) (2022) allows an agency to grant sick leave if a request is supported by administratively acceptable evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may grant sick leave only when the need for sick leave is supported by administratively acceptable evidence. An agency may consider an employee's self-certification as to the reason for his or her absence as administratively acceptable evidence, regardless of the duration of the absence. An agency may also require a medical certificate or other administratively acceptable evidence as to the reason for an absence for any of the purposes described in &#x00A7; 630.401(a) for an absence in excess of 3 workdays, or for a lesser period when the agency determines it is necessary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The burden of producing administratively acceptable evidence as to the reason for absence rests on the employee, not the agency. <span class="Italic">Rison v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-832); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Stockton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 11 MSPR 440, 443 (1982) (removal for a failure to provide the required medical documentation and AWOL); 5 CFR 630.403, 1201.56(c) (2022). An agency is entitled to require, as a condition to the approval of leave, detailed explanations from a physician rather than a summary conclusion that the employee could or could not attend work. <span class="Italic">Jiminez-Diaz v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-848); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Alaniz v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ALANIZ_GEORGE_SF_0752_04_0553_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249182.pdf">100 MSPR 105</a>, 111-12 &#x00B6; 13 (2005) ("The appellant has not alleged that he ever provided any supporting documentation to the agency. Thus, we find this charge supported by preponderant evidence."); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. VA</span>, 29 MSPR 594, 594 n.* (1986) (it was insufficient for the appellant to produce one brief statement from a doctor saying he had the flu, with no corroborating evidence and no attempt by the appellant to explain why he was incapacitated for three weeks); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 483, 484 (1984) (agency may deny sick leave to an employee who fails to provide adequate medical evidence of a need for leave despite a request to do so); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. USPS</span>, 19 MSPR 120, 122 (1984) ("[T]he postal employee and labor relations manual allows a supervisor to require medical documentation for sick leave requests of less than three days when 'the supervisor deems documentation desirable for the protection of the interests of the Postal Service.'"). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Shaw v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 98, 109 (1998) (although an agency could require medical documentation to cover a period of leave, "there is nothing in the agency's regulation which may be read as requiring the appellant to submit medical documentation periodically, and there is nothing in the record to show that he was ever instructed to do so"); <span class="Italic">Square v. VA</span>, 62 MSPR 569, 575 (1994) (if the agency charges an appellant with violating a specific regulation calling for advance approval for leave requests, it cannot charge the appellant with failing to provide medical documentation in the proper format); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Butler v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-1221-19-0077-W-1 (1/20/2023) ("If the employee has sufficient sick leave to cover the period in question, the agency must grant the request when the employee provides administratively acceptable evidence of incapacitation, regardless of whether the employee has complied with applicable leave procedures. Even when the employee lacks sufficient leave to cover his absence, an AWOL charge based on that absence cannot be sustained if the agency abused its discretion in denying the employee's request for leave without pay. <span class="Italic">White v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 299, &#x00B6; 17 (2003).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Michelson v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1811.Opinion.5-11-2020_1585276.pdf">812 Fed. Appx. 995</a>, 997 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP), said of insufficient justification for sick leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2450"></span>...As the AJ correctly found, several problems undermine the force of that letter. Most fundamentally, the letter does not go into detail about the relationship between Michelson's anxiety and depression and her inability to perform her work. Rather, the letter was conclusory in its key statements that "Ms. Michelson needed to be off work until 1/19/18 for medical purposes due to her anxiety and depression," and was "medically incapacitated and unable to attend work." <span class="Italic">See Young v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 79 M.S.P.R. 25, 33 (1998) (rejecting, due to a "lack of detail as to the medical condition, the diagnosis and prognosis," a letter stating that "the appellant was unable to work" because "she was 'overwhelmed and depressed'"). Moreover, the letter's conclusions were based on Michelson's appointment with nurse practitioner Kayla Ritzel on December 13, 2017, a visit that was scheduled as a follow-up visit for a sore throat. According to the contemporaneous progress notes of that appointment, anxiety was discussed, but there is no indication that Michelson would be imminently unable to perform her work duties. Indeed, the notes show that, while Michelson requested a month off "to help her anxiety, depression and get her started on her new meds," Ritzel made no determination that this was a medical necessity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 630.1208(h) (2022), governing family and medical leave, an employee must provide written medical certification within 15 calendar days of the agency's request for documentation and, if it is not otherwise practical to respond within 15 days, then the employee must provide documentation within 30 days of the date of the agency's request. <span class="Italic">Edwards v. VA</span>, 100 MSPR 437, 440 &#x00B6; 8 (2005) (although the agency failed to follow the regulation, an arbitrator could uphold a removal decision based on the grievant's failure to follow leave requesting procedures when the grievant did not provide medical evidence justifying his absence at or before the time of the arbitration hearing), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> <span class="Italic">Edwards v.

<p class="Body-Text">An AWOL charge will be sustained if the appellant fails to obtain necessary advance sick leave by obtaining the required medical certification justifying conversion of AWOL to sick leave. <span class="Italic">Daywalt v. Dept. of Army</span>, 5 MSPR 478, 480 (1981). There is an element of personal fault involved. If the employee's absences are caused by the mental illness of the appellant, an illness adversely affecting the appellant's ability to comply with the agency's reporting or medical certification requirements, an AWOL charge will not be sustained. <span class="Italic">Kulinski v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 574, 577 (1988) (sustaining removal, however, because evidence did not demonstrate that the appellant's mental condition rendered him unable to comply with agency instructions); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Barry v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 14 MSPR 561, 565-66 (1983) (evidence of mental as well as physical problems associated with absence and hospitalization; the appellant submitted some medical documentation along with evidence from a church pastor and deacon attesting to visits to the appellant while he was ill prior to his hospitalization; given the OPM regulation allowing for a medical certificate or other "administratively acceptable evidence," 5 CFR 630.405 (2022 ), the agency acted unreasonably in removing appellant for AWOL). As to AWOL charges coupled with charges relating to lack of required medical documentation, <span class="Italic">Butler v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-1221-19-0077-W-1 (1/20/2023) explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has held that charges of AWOL and failure to follow instructions by failing to submit medical documentation to substantiate an alleged inability to work on those same dates are duplicative and should be merged. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Justice</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 86, &#x00B6; 16 (2004). Similarly, we see little difference, if any, between a failure to follow instructions to report for duty on a particular day and AWOL for failing to appear at work for that same day.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is reasonable for the agency to request a certificate that includes a diagnosis of the appellant's condition and a prognosis for recovery, particularly if the information originally supplied by a physician does not state when the appellant is expected to return to work. <span class="Italic">Morris v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPB 202, 206 (1985) (still mitigating removal to a 90-day suspension; there was no dispute that the appellant was incapacitated during the period of absence). Failure of an employee to comply with appropriate requests for detailed medical information supporting an employee's requests for leave and LWOP was sufficient to support removal for subsequent charges of AWOL and failure to follow instructions. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3063); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Townsend v. Dept. of Army</span>, 191 Fed. Appx. 949, 953 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP) ("Townsend has not identified any evidence of record that purports to excuse her absence on the dates in question other than these doctor's notes, found by the Board to be insufficient to excuse her absence. We agree with the Board that the doctor's notes are insufficient because they do not indicate the dates on which Townsend was medically prevented from being at work or when Townsend was able to return to work, nor do they explain why leave was not requested in advance. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the Board's conclusion that Townsend did not demonstrate a valid excuse for her absence from work."); <span class="Italic">Carrick v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 280, 284 (1995) (allegation of a sleep disorder as a defense to a charge of sleeping on duty did not mitigate or excuse the charged conduct when the appellant waived affirmative defenses, submitted no evidence regarding a sleep disorder, and did not assert that the conduct was the result of a sleep disorder; apparently the only information in the record was a fitness report noting that the appellant had "a sleep disorder--narcolepsy by history" and suggesting further medical evaluation of the appellant to determine the "cause of the problem"); <span class="Italic">Frazier v. DMA</span>, 11 MSPR 179, 182 (1982) ("Appellant's only reason for failing to submit the requested documentation was her physician's delay in completing the forms. However, appellant selected the physician concerned and therefore remained ultimately responsible for submission of the forms.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The unexcused failure to submit medical certification requested for a prolonged and otherwise unexplained absence was sufficient reason for discharging an employee. <span class="Italic">McDonough v. USPS</span>, 666 F.2d 647, 651 n.4 (1st Cir. 1981). <span class="Italic">McDonough</span> observed that the result might be different if the employee worked for the employer many years rather than a few months, citing <span class="Italic">Power v. United States</span>, 531 F.2d 505 (Ct. Cl. 1976) (unblemished record of 25 years); <span class="Italic">Jacobowitz v. United States</span>, 424 F.2d 555 (Ct. Cl. 1970) (22 years of satisfactory service). Nonetheless, if the absence was prolonged, it was the employee's duty to supply adequate medical documentation. Removal would be sustained despite otherwise good and long service for the employee who should have known of reporting requirements but who failed to follow them for a prolonged period of time. <span class="Italic">Cresson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 33 MSPR 178, 183 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jefferies v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 78 MSPR 255, 262-63 (1998) (following <span class="Italic">Cresson:</span> when the employee failed to submit adequate documentation for leave under FMLA, that "[r]emoval is a reasonable penalty for excessive unauthorized absence even in cases where the employee has lengthy service and a clean prior disciplinary record."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Cole v. VA</span>, 77 MSPR 434, 442 (1998) ("[L]engthy years of service do not warrant mitigating the penalty of removal where the appellant was absent without a foreseeable end.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considers whether the agency unreasonably rejected a medical certificate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sorrells v. VA</span>, 12 MSPR 659, 664 (1982). An agency properly rejects a medical certificate offered by an employee who neither complies with a leave restriction letter nor provides the reason for the illness or the prognosis for recovery. <span class="Italic">Kincheon v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 17, 18-19, 6 MSPB 29 (1981). A medical certificate was unacceptable that apparently failed to comply with agency requirements that it be signed (rather than stamped) by a physician, that did not include a statement that the appellant could not perform his duties, and that did not include the date that the certificate was issued. <span class="Italic">Bergstein v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 232, 236 (1986). But a medical certificate should not be rejected for a technical defect not made known to the employee, e.g., the doctor's use of a signature stamp. Removal for this technical deficiency was reversed. <span class="Italic">Morton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 104, 106-07 (1987). If the employee presents what the Board considers an acceptable medical certificate, in sufficient detail, the unreasonable failure by the agency to accept the reasons stated in the certificate will not support removal. The appellant's good faith efforts to supply detailed medical documentation to the agency will overcome removal for failure to provide adequate documentation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Loots v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 42 MSPR 571, 576-77 (1989). If the agency is presented with information from its own physician demonstrating the appellant's disability resulting from a job-related injury, the information from the physician is considered administratively acceptable evidence of incapacity. <span class="Italic">Atchley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 46 MSPR 297, 303 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Enos v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 59, 63, 7 MSPB 554 (1981), if the appellant submits as part of his appeal a medical certificate that he claims to have provided to the agency, and if the agency does not challenge receipt of the document, the agency charge of AWOL for failure to provide medical documentation will not be sustained. If an appellant submits an application for sick leave before the agency decision to remove the appellant and the agency does not allege that it had a set time for the submission, the agency errs by rejecting the request as untimely. The agency may, however, deny the request if it is unsupported by medical evidence. The Board will then look to evidence later submitted under <span class="Italic">Zeiss</span> [discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-15-019.html#sec8-20">Evidence of Illness First Submitted to MSPB</a>"] to determine if the evidence warrants reversal or reconsideration of the agency decision on the leave request. <span class="Italic">Rison v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 23 MSPR 118, 124 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Rison v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-832).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no absolute regulatory requirement that justification for sick leave come only from a physician. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kelmon v. DOJ</span>, 27 MSPR 581, 584-85 (1985) (interpreting and relating 5 CFR Part 339 (then titled Medical Determinations Related to Employability) and 5 CFR Part 630, subpart D (Sick Leave)); <span class="Italic">Barry v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 14 MSPR 561, 565 (1983) (acceptable evidence was supplied by the pastor and deacon of a church).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee's absence could have been excused without a medical certificate, but the agency requires one of the employee, the Board reviews the request for reasonableness if the employee is then disciplined for failing to provide the certificate. An agency could reasonably require a certificate if the employee had a poor past leave record, or if the employee was in a restricted-leave status during the period of absence. <span class="Italic">Terrell v. DHHS</span>, 29 MSPR 548, 551 (1985) (removal for a day of absence coupled with prior suspensions and repeated warnings concerning absences). Under <span class="Italic">Morris v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPB 202, 206 (1985), if the medical certificate provided, although technically deficient, demonstrates incapacitation during the absence, a penalty may be appropriate--in that case, a 90-day suspension with consideration of a past disciplinary record that included disrespect toward a supervisor and prior attendance difficulties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency expects the employee to produce medical certificates for short <span id="Page_2451"></span>absences, agency regulations may provide that the employee be given advance notice of the requirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yartzoff v. EPA</span>, 38 MSPR 403, 407 (1988). One agency improperly discharged an employee as AWOL after the employee demonstrated that he was ill but lacked a physician's certificate for a short absence. There was no evidence that the agency told the employee that a physician's certificate was needed and no evidence that the agency told the employee when and how to document an illness. <span class="Italic">Dennis v. Army Corps of Eng'rs</span>, 4 MSPR 552, 554, 5 MSPB 77 (1981). Another agency erred by rejecting medical evidence that, though ambiguous and possibly warranting further inquiry, had relevance and was "not obviously unacceptable." <span class="Italic">Butler v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-1221-19-0077-W-1 (1/20/2023).</p>
