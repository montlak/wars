<p class="Body-Text">If OPM files a reconsideration petition and loses, OPM and not the employing agency is responsible for paying counsel fees if the interest of justice standard is met. In <span class="Italic">Robinson v. DHHS</span>, 37 MSPR 547 (1988), <span class="Italic">modified by</span> <span class="Italic">Stone v. DHHS</span>, 51 MSPR 673, 678 (1991), <span class="Italic">post</span>, the Board directed OPM to pay fees to appellant's counsel after OPM's petition was deemed clearly without merit. The payment will only be directed if a petition for fees is lodged with the regional office seeking payment from OPM; it is insufficient to seek payment against the respondent, i.e., the employing agency. <span class="Italic">Rose v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 5, 18 (1991). <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> explained the basis for an award against OPM, although the governing criteria were set out in <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> <span class="Italic">post</span>. Under <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, 37 MSPR at 550-52:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The plain language of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), the statute which provides for an award of attorney fees, does not exclude OPM from its coverage. That section provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the Board...may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the Board...determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to OPM's argument, the statute's use of the term "agency" without any specific reference to OPM does not preclude the Board from requiring payment of fees by OPM. The statute uses the broad phrase "the agency involved" to describe who should pay attorney fees, not "the employing agency" or "the agency which took the action appealed," as OPM urges the statute should be read. OPM is an agency, and in a petition for reconsideration it is the only "agency involved" within the meaning of section 7701(g)(1). By its terms, we find the statute plainly permits assessment against OPM of attorney fees incurred by an appellant in responding to OPM's petition for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is a basic tenet of law that when statutory language is clear the legislative history cannot alter the plain meaning. <span class="Italic">Consumer Product Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania</span>, 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S. Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L. Ed.2d 766 (1980). Although examination of the legislative history is for that reason unnecessary, we note that there is nothing in the history of section 7701(g) which reflects a Congressional intent to limit liability for attorney fees to the agency which took the action being appealed. Nor do we find any basis there for OPM's contention that the term "agency action" in section 7701(g)(1) necessarily refers to the "action" appealed to the Board under section 7701(a). Rather, as the CALJ pointed out, the history demonstrates Congress's concern that employees should not bear the financial burden of defending against unfounded agency actions. There is no evidence that Congress intended an exception for cases where the unfounded action was taken by OPM during the course of an appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7701(g)(1) authorizes the Board to award fees when it "determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice, including...any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit." When an appellant successfully opposes an agency petition for review which is "clearly without merit," an award of the fees incurred is warranted in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">Keely v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 760 F.2d 246, 249 (Fed. Cir. 1985). We find that an OPM petition for reconsideration which is clearly without merit similarly warrants an award of fees incurred by the appellant in responding to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Liability by OPM for such fees would not, as OPM contends, infringe on its statutory authority to seek reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Devine v. National Treasury Employees Union,</span> 805 F.2d 384 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (awarding fees against OPM under the Equal Access to Justice Act on a finding that OPM's petition for judicial review was not clearly reasonable). Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(d), OPM's authority to request reconsideration, and thereafter to seek judicial review, is circumscribed by the following language:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]he Director of the Office of Personnel Management may obtain review of any final order or decision of the Board...if the Director determines, in his discretion, that the Board erred in interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation affecting personnel management and that the Board's decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history makes clear that the Director of OPM should only exercise this section 7703(d) authority in "exceptional cases." S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 51, 64, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 2723, 2773, 2786. It is true that the decision to file a petition is within the Director of OPM's discretion, based on OPM's determination that the Board has made the kind of error contemplated by the statute. However, this fact does not exclude the possibility of an abuse of that discretion by the filing of a petition which plainly does not meet the statutory criteria and is in that sense clearly without merit. The award of attorney fees in such a case does not infringe on OPM's authority; rather, the potential for such liability helps ensure that OPM exercises its section 7703(d) reconsideration authority in only the exceptional case, as was the intent of Congress.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We hold here that section 7701(g)(1) authorizes the Board to award fees against OPM when its petition for reconsideration fails to meet the statutory criteria for such a petition and its action of filing a petition is accordingly "clearly without merit." However, we note that the other example in section 7701(g)(1) of when fees are warranted ("a prohibited personnel practice") is inapplicable to an OPM petition because it refers to findings concerning the underlying agency personnel actions appealed to the Board. Because the latter <span id="Page_4647"></span>are also to a large extent the focus of the guidelines for applying the "interest of justice" standard established in <span class="Italic">Allen v. United States Postal Service,</span> 2 MSPB 582, 2 MSPR 420 (1980), those guidelines will also generally be inapplicable in this context. For example, an appellant's "substantial innocence" of the charges on which the action appealed was based has no relevance to whether OPM abused its discretion in seeking reconsideration of the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Robinson</span> was modified to a degree in <span class="Italic">Stone v. DHHS</span>, 51 MSPR 673, 676-78 (1991), allowing fees against OPM for the efforts opposing OPM's reconsideration petition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequent to the date of the addendum initial decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued <span class="Italic">Newman v. Lynch</span>, 897 F.2d 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1990). The court held that the Board has no authority to review the discretionary decision by the Director of OPM to seek reconsideration of a Board decision, and that the Board must consider the Director's petition on the merits<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1145, 1147. In accordance with the court's decision, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Hammond v. Department of the Navy and Office of Personnel Management</span>, 50 MSPR 174, 179-80 (1991), that, with the exception of petitions for reconsideration on nonprecedential decisions, it would only review the Director's reconsideration petition on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, 37 MSPR at 552, which the administrative judge relied upon below, the Board held that attorney fees against OPM would be warranted if the Board were to find "an abuse of [OPM's] discretion by the filing of a petition which plainly does not meet the statutory criteria [of 5 USC 7703(d)] and is in that sense clearly without merit." This analysis is now supplanted by the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Lynch</span>, and our decision in <span class="Italic">Hammond</span>. Therefore, to the extent that <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> suggests that the Board may award attorney fees on the basis that OPM's petition for reconsideration failed to meet the statutory criteria, it is hereby MODIFIED consistent with the holdings in <span class="Italic">Lynch</span> and <span class="Italic">Hammond</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bartel v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 30 MSPR 451 (1986), the Board listed several situations in which it had considered an award of attorney fees for legal work done before other bodies, and it concluded that it had the authority to award attorney fees for work on a petition to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 453-54....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rule announced in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, 32 MSPR at 686, is that the Board "has authority to award attorney fees for counsel's compensable time reasonably spent outside the Board proceeding, where that time is in furtherance of the same goal as the Board proceeding." <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Bartel</span>, 30 MSPR at 454. We now extend this standard to an OPM petition for reconsideration. That is, an appellant's defense to an OPM petition is in furtherance of the same goal he or she had when instituting the Board proceeding. Moreover, OPM petitions for reconsideration are part of the Board's proceeding....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The compensable time that the appellant spent in responding to OPM's petition for reconsideration, which concerned the validity of the performance standards under which the appellant's performance had been measured, was undoubtedly in furtherance of the same goal that the appellant sought on appeal to the Board....&#8197;Moreover, in an addendum initial decision that became the final decision of the Board, an award of attorney fees against the appellant's employing agency was found to be in the interest of justice....&#8197;We therefore find that an award of attorney fees against OPM is warranted here in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board again explained its law concerning fees awarded against OPM when that agency pursues an unsuccessful reconsideration petition, <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Dept. of Educ</span>., 65 MSPR 407, 410-12 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, OPM contends that the administrative judge erred by awarding attorney fees against it because: (1) The Rehabilitation Act does not provide a basis for an award of attorney fees against OPM under 5 USC 7701(g)(2) inasmuch as the court's dispositive decision was based on an interpretation and application of 5 USC 7703(d); (2) attorney fees may not be awarded against OPM where the Federal Circuit has accepted a petition for review by the Director of OPM (Director) under 5 USC 7703(d) based on the court's determination that the issue raised would have a "substantial impact" on civil service law; and (3) attorney fees may never be awarded against the Director where he is exercising his authority under 5 USC 7701(d) and 7703(d) absent a showing of bad faith on his part....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 7701(g)(1), reasonable attorney fees may be awarded to a prevailing employee or applicant for employment before the Board where such fees are warranted in the interest of justice. Under 5 USC 7701(g)(2), however, if the Board's finding is based on discrimination prohibited under 5 USC 2302(b)(1), attorney fees shall be awarded in accordance with section 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 2000e-5(k)). The Director may intervene or participate in any case before the Board in which the interpretation or application of any civil service law, rule, or regulation under OPM's jurisdiction is at issue and the Director believes that an erroneous decision on that issue would have a substantial impact on any civil service law, rule, or regulation under OPM's jurisdiction. 5 USC 7701(d). The Director may obtain judicial review of any final Board order or decision in the Federal Circuit, if he determines that the Board erred in any such interpretation. 5 USC 7703(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to OPM's contention that attorney fees may never be awarded against the Director where he is exercising his authority under 5 USC 7701(d) and 7703(d) absent a showing of bad faith, we find no merit. This issue has been fully settled, as the administrative judge correctly found, and we find no basis for disturbing that finding, or for overruling the authorities on which it was based, as OPM urges. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stone v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 51 MSPR 673, 677-78 (1991); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. DHHS</span>, 37 MSPR 547, 550 (1988), <span class="Italic">modified by Stone</span>, 51 MSPR at 673.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, we find no merit to OPM's contention that the Rehabilitation Act does not provide a basis for an award of attorney fees against OPM in these appeals under 5 USC 7701(g)(2) because the court's dispositive decision was based on an interpretation and application of 5 USC 7703(d). The pertinent court decision directed the Board to consider OPM's petition for reconsideration on the merits. <span class="Italic">Newman v. Lynch</span>, 897 F.2d 1144, 1147 (Fed. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">reh'g denied</span> (May 2, 1990), <span class="Italic">reh'g</span> <span class="Italic">en banc denied</span> (June 18, 1990 and July 5, 1990). OPM, however, did not prevail on the merits of its petition for reconsideration, which the court specifically found did not involve an interpretation of a civil service law, rule, or regulation within the meaning of 5 USC 7703(d) but, rather, concerned an interpretation of law, rule, or regulation governing employment discrimination. <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 21 F.3d at 1088-90; <span class="Italic">see also Lynch</span>, 52 MSPR at 544-46. Thus, there is no merit to OPM's contention that the court accepted its petition for review based on its determination that the issues it raised would have a "substantial impact" on civil service law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Attorney fees may be awarded against OPM for legal services performed in connection with an appellant's successful defense against the Director's petition for reconsideration where that defense is in furtherance of the appellant's goal in filing his Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 51 MSPR at 677-78; <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, 37 MSPR at 550. Here, the appellant successfully defended against the Director's petition for reconsideration, which was inextricably interwoven with his affirmative defense of disability discrimination and, thus, his defense was in furtherance of his goal in filing his Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Lynch</span>, 52 MSPR at 544-46.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no merit to OPM's contention that a claim for attorney fees under the Rehabilitation Act (and, thus, under 5 USC 7701(g)(2)) could only be made against the appellant's employing agency. In this regard, we note that the Board has awarded attorney fees against OPM where OPM has filed, under 5 USC 7701(d) and 7703(d), unsuccessful petitions for reconsideration but other agencies took the underlying wrongful action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stone</span>, 51 MSPR at 677-78; <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, 37 MSPR at 550. We find no basis to relieve OPM from liability for attorney fees under 5 USC 7701(g)(2) where an appellant successfully defends against an OPM petition for reconsideration.</p>
