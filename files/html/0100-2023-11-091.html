<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-92"><span class="space">1.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Res Judicata</span></span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> means a claim once litigated is final as to the issues that were litigated or could have been litigated between the parties. <span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> was defined in its most straightforward application in <span class="Italic">Petty v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 92-3476):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Res judicata</span>, Latin for "the thing has been decided," developed in the law to prevent the re-litigation of an issue or claim that has already had its day in court. By affording a claimant only one opportunity to obtain redress, the doctrine conserves the resources of the judicial system and prevents the defendant from being harassed by repeated lawsuits asserting the same claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Summarized in <span class="Italic">Pangilinan v. OPM</span>, 245 Fed. Appx. 956, 958 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A petitioner may be barred by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> "if (1) the prior decision was rendered by a forum with competent jurisdiction; (2) the prior decision was a final decision on the merits; and (3) the same cause of action and the same parties or their privies were involved in both cases." <span class="Italic">Carson v. Dep't of Energy,</span> 398 F.3d 1369, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">From <span class="Italic">Maksimuk v. Connor Sport Int'l., LLC</span>, 771 Fed. Appx. 1001, 1004 (Fed. Cir 2019):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Claim preclusion, historically known as <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, prevents a party from litigating a matter that should have been litigated in an earlier proceeding. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 18 Charles Alan Wright <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, <span class="Italic">Federal Practice and Procedure</span> &#x00A7; 4402 (3d ed. 2018). Claim preclusion applies when three elements are met: "(1) there is identity of parties (or their privies); (2) there has been an earlier final judgment on the merits of a claim; and (3) the second claim is based on the same set of transactional facts as the first." <span class="Italic">Nasalok Coating Corp. v. Nylok Corp</span>., 522 F.3d 1320, 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting <span class="Italic">Jet, Inc. v. Sewage Aeration Systems</span>, 223 F.3d 1360, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2000))....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a contract dispute, <span class="Italic">First Mortgage Corp. v. United States</span>, 961 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2020), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> involves the related concepts of claim preclusion and issue preclusion." <span class="Italic">Phillips/May Corp. v. United States</span>, 524 F.3d 1264, 1267 (Fed. Cir. 2008). "[I]ssue preclusion operates only as to issues actually litigated, whereas claim preclusion may operate between the parties simply by virtue of the final judgment." <span class="Italic">Young Engn'rs, Inc. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm'n</span>, 721 F.2d 1305, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Claim preclusion "foreclose[es] any litigation of matters that...should have been advanced in an earlier suit." <span class="Italic">Phillips/May Corp</span>., 524 F.3d at 1267 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). "A final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action." <span class="Italic">Federated Dep't Stores, Inc. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...<span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> serves to bar claims that were not, but should have been, advanced in an earlier proceeding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The preclusive effects of former adjudication are...referred to collectively by most commentators as the doctrine of "<span class="Italic">res judicata</span>." <span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> is often analyzed further to consist of two preclusion concepts: "issue preclusion" and "claim preclusion." Issue preclusion refers to the effect of a judgment in foreclosing relitigation of a matter that has been litigated and decided. This effect is also referred to as direct or collateral estoppel. Claim preclusion refers to the effect of a judgment in foreclosing litigation of a matter that never has been litigated, because of a determination that it should have been advanced in an earlier suit. Claim preclusion therefore encompasses the law of merger and bar.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision to dismiss Whitby's appeal was based on the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, in which "a judgment on the merits in a prior suit bars a second suit involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action." <span class="Italic">Jet, Inc. v. Sewage Aeration Sys</span>., 223 F.3d 1360, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (quoting <span class="Italic">Parklane Hosier Co. v. Shore</span>, 439 U.S. 322, 326 n.5 (1979)). In effect, an earlier judgment forecloses litigation of a matter that never has been litigated if the claim should have been raised in the <span id="Page_1518"></span>earlier suit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist. Bd. Of Educ</span>., 465 U.S. 75, 77 n.1 (1984)). Thus, a subsequent suit will be barred by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> if: "(1) there is identity of parties (or their privies); (2) there has been an earlier final judgment on the merits of a claim; and (3) the second claim is based on the same set of transactional facts as the first." Those factors notwithstanding, however, the doctrine applies only if the litigant had a "full and fair opportunity" to litigate his case. <span class="Italic">Poyner v. Murray</span>, 508 U.S. 931, 933 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> "forecloses matters that, although never litigated or even raised, could have been advanced in an earlier suit." <span class="Italic">Carson v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 398 F.3d 1369, 1375 n.8 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing <span class="Italic">Migra</span>, 465 U.S. 77 n.1). Evidence of Whitby's PTSD and its effects was available while the record was open during his prior appeal. Whitby has known since at least 2007 that his PTSD causes "significant distress" in "important areas of functioning." He has known since at least 2009 that his PTSD symptoms had been present since his service in the Vietnam War, and thus would have existed in 1993, and that the symptoms were "daily and severe." At the July 8, 2010 hearing during the initial appeal, the AJ agreed to leave open the record until July 15, 2010, "for the parties to submit additional documentary evidence." Whitby could have submitted evidence concerning his PTSD during that time but did not. Though he was not rated 100% disabled by the VA until 2011, that rating itself is immaterial here because it reflected his condition in 2011 rather than 1993 when he submitted the refund application. The evidence relevant to his current argument, whether his PSTD [sic] rendered him mentally incompetent in 1993, was known and available to him during the time the record in the prior appeal was open.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whitby cites to <span class="Italic">Litton Indus., Inc. v. Litronix, Inc</span>., 577 F.2d 709, 711 (C.C.P.A. 1978), for the proposition that "<span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and collateral estoppel are not applicable where 'it is apparent that all the questions of fact and law involved...(in the second proceeding) were not determined in the previous proceedings.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Universal Overall Co. v. Stonecutter Mills Corp</span>., 310 F.2d 952, 956 (C.C.P.A. 1962)). The "questions of fact and law" referenced by <span class="Italic">Litton</span>, however, are the relevant transactional facts and the underlying claim. <span class="Italic">Litton</span> does not hold that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is avoided by simply raising new factual issues. Here, Whitby's current claim, that he is entitled to FERS retirement for the period covered by the refund that he requested, is the same as the claim that previously was adjudicated on the merits. To the extent Whitby is attempting to argue a new claim that his refund request should be considered "voidable" based on "mental incompetence" related to his PTSD, that argument was not raised before the Board and will not be considered on appeal. We generally do not consider issues that were not raised in the proceedings below. <span class="Italic">Oshiver v. Office of Pers. Mgt</span>., 896 F.2d 540, 542 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (quoting <span class="Italic">Rockwell v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 789 F.2d 908, 913 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("Our precedent clearly establishes the impropriety of <span class="Italic">seek</span>ing a reversal of the board's decision on the basis of assertions never presented to the presiding official or to the board."). Moreover, the argument and evidence could have and should have been raised during the prior appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whitby also contends that the Board has denied him due process in the prior appeal by conducting a hearing not longer than 15 minutes and by making credibility determinations without considering evidence of his PSTD [sic] or its effect on his mental capacity. Due process requires "a fair hearing on the merits" of a claim. <span class="Italic">Cushman v. Shinseki</span>, 576 F.3d 1290, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Though he indicates that he believes the hearing was too short, he does not contend that he was prevented from presenting any argument or evidence he desired to make. Significantly, Whitby made no attempt to raise the PTSD issue he now asserts at the hearing or afterward during the time that the AJ left open the record. On this record, there is no merit to Whitby's claim that the Board denied him due process.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, <span class="Italic">Schoening v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 6, 10 (1989), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> applies to prevent repetitious litigation on the same cause of action. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v.

Under the doctrine, when a right, question, or fact that is a ground for recovery, and that was distinctly put in issue is directly determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, such right, question, or fact cannot be disputed in a subsequent suit between the same parties or their privies. Even if the second suit is on a different cause of action, the right, question, or fact determined in the first action must be taken as conclusively determined between the same parties and their privies, as long as the judgment in the first suit remains unmodified. In this case, in which both the parties and the issues decided below are identical, we apply the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to prevent relitigating the merits of the earlier claim. <span class="Italic">See Aceto,</span> 40 MSPR at 161; <span class="Italic">Davis v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 35 MSPR 107, 109 (1987).</p>

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995). The general rule of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> rests upon considerations of economy of judicial time and public policy favoring the establishment of certainty in legal relations. The rule provides that when a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final judgment on the merits of a cause of action, the parties to the suit and their privies are thereafter bound "not only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose." <span class="Italic">Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Feliciana <span class="Italic">seem</span>s to confuse <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> (claim preclusion) with collateral estoppel (issue preclusion).

<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that the parties involved in this appeal--Feliciana and OPM--are the same as were involved in the prior action involving the guaranteed minimum annuity. Moreover, OPM issued a decision on the merits regarding Feliciana's claim to the guaranteed minimum annuity, and the Board affirmed. Finally, there is no reason why Feliciana could not have raised her claim with OPM for an annuity payable immediately from the date of retirement at the same time that she raised her claim to the guaranteed minimum annuity. Both claims relate to the same cause of action--the appropriate amount of Hilarion's annuity--even though <span id="Page_1519"></span>they are based on different legal theories. <span class="Italic">See Alyeska Pipeline Serv.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "<span class="Italic">res judicata</span>" is sometimes used broadly to encompass not <span id="Page_1520"></span>only the doctrine of "claim preclusion" but also the doctrine of "issue preclusion," also called "collateral estoppel." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lane v. Peterson</span>, 899 F.2d 737, 741 n.3 (8th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 498 U.S. 823, 111 S. Ct. 74, 112 L. Ed.2d 48 (1990); 18 Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &#x0026; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure &#x00A7; 4402 (1981). The doctrines of claim preclusion and issue preclusion both concern the preclusive effects of a prior adjudication and are based on similar policy concerns--to "relieve parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and, by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage reliance on adjudication." <span class="Italic">Allen v. McCurry</span>, 449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S. Ct. 411, 415, 66 L. Ed.2d 308 (1980). However, there are significant differences in their prerequisites for application, as well as in their preclusive effects, as further discussed below. The Board's practice, in general, has been to use the term "<span class="Italic">res judicata</span>" in the narrow sense, to refer solely to the doctrine of claim preclusion, and we will do so here.[4] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lopez v. Department of Labor</span>, 57 MSPR 163, 166 (1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 449 U.S. at 94, 101 S. Ct. at 414).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;On the other hand, there are Board cases that appear to use <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> in the broad sense, or appear to commingle the <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and collateral estoppel doctrines. <span class="Italic">See Roque v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 55 MSPR 50, 52 (1992) (stating that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> applies only to "matters that were actually adjudicated in prior appeals," whereas claim preclusion applies also to matters that were not, but could have been, raised and adjudicated in prior appeals); <span class="Italic">Schoening v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, a valid, final judgment on the merits of an action bars a second action involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action. <span class="Italic">See Federated Department Stores, Inc. v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The subsequent forum has a limited scope of review in determining whether the prior forum possessed competent jurisdiction to render its decision; the scope of review is generally limited to ascertaining whether the issue of jurisdiction has been fully and fairly litigated and finally decided in the first forum. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Underwriters National Assurance Company v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find that the second criterion is not satisfied here, we find it unnecessary to address the first and third criteria. With respect to the second criterion, the decision in the prior Board appeal unquestionably became "final" on July 31, 1992. The remaining issue is whether that decision was "on the merits." This issue is one which the Board has not heretofore addressed in depth, although the Board has suggested in <span class="Italic">Caple v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 52 MSPR 262, 265-66 (1992), and other cases that the prior decision need not be "on the merits" for <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Caple</span>, 52 MSPR at 265-66, the Board refused to hear an appeal where it had dismissed a prior appeal from the same personnel action as not within its jurisdiction, stating that "the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> [applies] to questions of jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Accord Byrd v.

North Carolina Life and Accident and Health Insurance Guaranty Association</span>, 455 U.S. 691, 706-07, 102 S. Ct. 1357, 1366-67, 71 L. Ed.2d 558 (1982); <span class="Italic">Durfee v.

However, these cases merely hold that, where the criteria for the application of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> are satisfied, the first forum's decision on all issues, including its finding that it had jurisdiction over the case, should be given full faith and credit by the second forum and not relitigated upon a party's claim that the first forum lacked competent jurisdiction to render its decision.[6] They do not hold that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is applicable to a prior decision that dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The second forum may, however, conduct a limited inquiry into whether the issue of the first forum's jurisdiction was fully and fairly litigated and finally decided in the first forum. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> n.5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In fact, it is "well settled" that a "dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction does not preclude a second action on the same claim...." 18 C. Wright, A.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it is thus well settled that a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction cannot be given <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect, it is not as well settled whether other types of dismissals prior to an actual adjudication on the merits, such as the Board's dismissal of this appellant's prior appeal as untimely filed, are entitled to <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect. <span class="Italic">See</span> 18 C.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Detherage</span> does not support the finding in <span class="Italic">Grasty</span> because it did not involve the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>.

Unlike a statute of limitations, which is part and parcel of a particular claim to the extent that the statute must be satisfied to prevail on the claim, a regulatory time limit for filing a Board appeal is not similarly part and parcel of a particular claim before the Board, notably in mixed cases for which a number of procedural choices and concomitant time limits are involved. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154. We therefore find that a regulatory time limit for filing a Board appeal constitutes merely a "precondition requisite to the [Board's] going forward to determine the merits of [a] substantive claim," i.e., merely an "initial bar to the [Board's] reaching" the merits, and is not equivalent to a statute of limitations for <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> purposes. <span class="Italic">Costello v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, a decision that is not "on the merits," such as the dismissal of the appellant's prior appeal involved here, could be given collateral estoppel effect. The Board may apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel if: (1) The issue previously adjudicated is identical to that now presented; (2) that issue was actually litigated in the prior case; (3) the previous determination of that issue was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party precluded by the doctrine was fully represented in the prior case. <span class="Italic">See Kroeger v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 865 F.2d 235, 239 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Mycka v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 56 MSPR 675, 678-79 (1993). Collateral estoppel does not apply here, however, because the timeliness issue involved in the present appeal--whether the appeal was timely filed within 20 days after the appellant received the agency's final EEO decision, under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(b) (1993)--was not involved in the prior Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Berkey v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 42 MSPR 24, 28 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Moore v. DOJ</span>, 112 MSPR 382, 389 &#x00B6; 22, 2009 MSPB 190 (2009) (earlier decision dismissing an appeal as untimely was not <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> as to a merits determination on a later appeal that was timely filed under mixed-case processing procedures); <span class="Italic">Peltier v. DOJ</span>, 79 MSPR 674, 677 &#x00B6; 6 (1998) ("[T]he appellant is correct that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> would not bar this appeal...because the now-final decisions dismissing the earlier appeal without prejudice to refiling and as untimely refiled were not on the merits."); <span class="Italic">Pashun v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 74 MSPR 374, 380 n.2 (1997) (because an earlier IRA appeal was dismissed as untimely rather than adjudicated on the merits, the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> does not apply); <span class="Italic">Nebblett v. OPM</span>, 73 MSPR 342, 347 (1997) ("While a dismissal under a statute of limitations is a ruling on the merits, and can therefore be given <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect, the Board's regulatory time limit for filing an appeal is not a statute of limitation, but rather a precondition requisite to the Board's reaching the merits of a claim, and a dismissal for failing to file within the Board's regulatory time limit is therefore not entitled to <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rogers v. OPM</span>, 67 MSPR 251, 256 (1995), distinguished procedural and merits adjudication for purposes of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is to prevent repetitious litigation of the same matter. <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior</span>, 48 MSPR 513, 517 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 954 F.2d 733 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). The doctrine applies only where there is an identity of parties and cause of action, and its application is limited to issues that were or could have been actually adjudicated in prior appeals. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 MSPR 332, 337 (1995); <span class="Italic">Holloway v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 56 MSPR 422, 425 (1993); <span class="Italic">Wexler,</span> 48 MSPR at 517-18. The Board's decision in an appeal from an agency action is <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> only where there has been a final Board decision on the merits of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Peartree,</span> 66 MSPR at 337-38, 339-40; <span class="Italic">Bullitt v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 10 MSPB 816, 12 MSPR 294, 296 (1982); <span class="Italic">see also Cavanagh v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 44 MSPR 485, 487-90 (1990). Thus, we find that because the Board previously decided this appeal on procedural grounds, i.e., timeliness, and there was no final Board decision on the merits, OPM is not barred by the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> from reopening or reconsidering its reconsideration decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baker v. DHS</span>, 111 MSPR 277, 282 &#x00B6; 14, 2009 MSPB 83 (2009) (dismissal for failure to state a claim is a decision on the merits, not a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Lubert v. USPS</span>, 110 MSPR 430, 435 &#x00B6; 12, 2009 MSPB 13 (2009) (dismissal for failure to state a claim is a decision on the merits); <span class="Italic">Holloway v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 82 MSPR 435, 440 &#x00B6; 11 (1999) ("[A]ppellant's claim for reinstatement was raised but dismissed as beyond the Board's enforcement authority in the prior compliance appeal and was not adjudicated on its merits.... [I]t is not barred by...<span class="Italic">res judicata</span>."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">McGrath v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 500, 503 (1981) (if an initial decision is vacated, it serves neither side by way of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> or collateral estoppel).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> applies to bar appeals litigated on the merits and there is authority stating that it does not bar relitigation of cases dismissed for jurisdictional deficiencies, collateral estoppel may prevent relitigation of jurisdictional issues. Four conditions must be present: the issues previously and currently litigated are the same; the dispositive issue was actually litigated in the earlier case; the previous determination of that issue was necessary to the resulting judgment; and the party precluded by the doctrine was fully represented in the prior case. <span class="Italic">Gregory v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 691, 700 (1995); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 92 MSPR 370, 375 &#x00B6; 12 (2002) (collateral estoppel may preclude a second action in the same forum that dismissed a prior appeal for lack of jurisdiction). If the first Board disposition is <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> as to the second appeal, the bar is not avoided by an allegation of inadequate representation in the first case. <span class="Italic">Grande v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 47 MSPR 403, 405-06 (1991). <span class="Italic">Pro se</span> status does not defeat collateral estoppel. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 95 MSPR 152, 156 &#x00B6; 11 (2003).</p>
