<p class="Body-Text">Removal based on alleged misstatements or omissions on a medical questionnaire was reversed when the request for information exceeded the legitimate scope of the inquiry and violated the ADA in <span class="Italic">Litton v. DOJ</span>, <span class="Italic"></span> DC-0752-14-1110-I-2 (NP 10/13/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2782"></span>The agency asserts that the administrative judge erred when she held that the questions on the SF-93 were overbroad. In support of this argument, the agency contends that a Federal employee does not have the right to make false statements if the questions are improper; rather, if he chooses to answer, he is obligated to answer truthfully. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 26-27. In support of these assertions, the agency relies on <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Erickson</span>, 522 U.S. 262, 265-68 (1998); <span class="Italic">Bryson v. United States</span>, 396 U.S. 64, 72 (1969); <span class="Italic">Delapenia v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 409 F. App'x 332 (Fed. Cir. 2010); and a nonprecedential Board final order. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Those cases, however, are distinguishable and do not warrant a different result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, 522 U.S. at 264, the Court identified the issue as whether the Due Process Clause or the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 precluded a Federal agency from disciplining an employee for making false statements to the agency regarding alleged employment-related misconduct. The Court held that those provisions did not preclude discipline, specifically finding that a meaningful opportunity to be heard does not include a right to make false statements with respect to the charged misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 264-66. <span class="Italic">Erickson</span> did not, however, involve a disability-related inquiry that violated the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Evans v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6; 22 (2007). In <span class="Italic">Bryson</span>, 396 U.S. at 65, 68-69, the Court held that a criminal conviction for having falsely denied in an affidavit an affiliation with the Communist Party did not depend upon the constitutional validity of the statute requiring the affidavit. The Court, therefore, held that the invalidity of a statute would not provide a defense to a criminal conviction because a citizen does not have a "privilege to answer fraudulently a question that the Government should not have asked." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 72. As in <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, the Court did not address the effect of an improper disability-related inquiry on a disciplinary charge brought against a Federal employee. <span class="Italic">See Evans</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6; 22. Moreover, the Court's holding in Bryson was grounded in its finding that there was a statutory basis for the inquiry. 396 U.S. at 71. There is no statutory basis, however, for an unlawful disability-related inquiry. Although the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Delapenia</span>, 409 F. App'x at 335, relied on language from <span class="Italic">Erickson</span> in finding that the appellant did not make a nonfrivolous allegation of an involuntary resignation, it too did not address the effect of an improper disability-related inquiry on a disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the agency has not provided a basis for disturbing the administrative judge's determination, which we modify and supplement herein, that the agency did not establish that its disability-related inquiries were job-related and consistent with business necessity, and thus did not prove its charge and discriminated against the appellant based on a disability. Significant restrictions are imposed on an employer's freedom to make medical inquiries of its employees. <span class="Italic">Archerda v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 29 (2014). Under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4)(A), an employer "shall not require a medical examination and shall not make inquiries of an employee as to whether such employee is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of the disability, unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity." The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has issued regulations implementing this provision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.13(b), 1630.14(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, a disability-related inquiry or medical examination may be job-related and consistent with business necessity if an employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that an employee's ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition, or that an employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">Archerda</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 30. A business necessity must be based on more than mere expediency. <span class="Italic">Hanna P. v. Coats</span>, 916 F.3d 327, 358 (4th Cir. 2019). A direct threat means a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). The employer has the burden of showing that its disability-related inquiries are job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Archerda</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 31.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's inquiries were not due to any reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that the appellant's ability to perform his essential job functions was impaired by a medical condition or that he posed a direct threat due to a medical condition. Rather, the inquiries were part of a general policy applying to all similarly situated employees. <span class="Italic">See Conroy v. New York State Department of Correctional Services</span>, 333 F.3d 88, 97-98, 100-01 (2d Cir. 2003) (distinguishing between disability-related inquiries to all employees arising from generally applicable policies, and such inquiries directed at an individual employee based on particular facts relating to that employee). The EEOC's Enforcement Guidance appears to permit such generally applicable policies and inquiries under certain circumstances. For example, an employer generally may not ask all employees what prescription medications they are taking. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Notice 915.002, Question 8, 2000 WL 33407181, at *9 (July 27, 2000) (Enforcement Guidance). Nevertheless, relevant provisions of the Enforcement Guidance provide as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Asking all employees about their use of prescription medications is not job-related and consistent with business necessity. In limited circumstances, however, certain employers may be able to demonstrate that it is job-related and consistent with business necessity to require employees in positions affecting public safety to report when they are taking medication that may affect their ability to perform essential functions. <span class="Italic">Under these limited circumstances, an employer must be able to demonstrate that an employee's inability or impaired ability to perform essential functions will result in a direct threat.</span> For example, a police department could require armed officers to report when they are taking medications that may affect their ability to use a firearm or to perform other essential functions of their job. Similarly, an airline could require its pilots to report when they are taking any medications that may impair their ability to fly. A fire department, however, could not require fire department employees who perform only administrative duties to report their use of medications because it is unlikely that it could show that these employees would pose a direct threat as a result of their inability or impaired ability to perform their essential job functions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (italics and bold in original). Similarly, the Enforcement Guidance provides that employers may require periodic medical examinations of employees in positions affecting public safety, such as police officers and firefighters, in "limited circumstances" if they are "narrowly tailored to address specific job-related concerns." Enforcement Guidance, Question 18, 2000 WL 33407181, at *14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant questions on the SF-93 asked the appellant to describe his "Present Health" and list his "Current Medication[s]," as well as to disclose whether he had consulted with or been treated by clinics, physicians, healers, or other practitioners within the past 5 years for other than minor illnesses. Asking an employee whether he is taking prescription drugs or medication or questions seeking information about illnesses, mental conditions, or other impairments an employee has or had in the past trigger the protections of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4)(A) and its implementing regulations. <span class="Italic">Lee v. City of Columbus</span>, 636 F.3d 245, 254 (6th Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">see Miller v. Whirlpool Corp</span>., 807 F. Supp.2d 684, 685-87 (N.D. Ohio 2011). The administrative judge found, after considering the testimony of the FBI's Chief Medical Officer, that the agency's inquiries were not narrowly tailored to be job-related and consistent with business necessity; in fact, she found that they were not tailored at all and were contrary to the agency's Fitness-for-Duty Program Policy Implementation Guide, which provides that "[n]o inquiries or examinations concerning an employee's medical condition or physical limitation may exceed the scope or relevance of the impact of said condition or limitation on the employee's ability, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential functions of his/her position." The administrative judge found that the agency required the appellant to disclose all doctors, illnesses, and medications whether or not they related to his ability to perform the functions of his position, and that its inquiries were not tailored to determine whether he was using a drug that may affect his ability to perform his job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency did not show that the broad inquiries at issue in this case were job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">See Roe v. Cheyenne Mountain Conference Resort, Inc</span>., 124 F.3d 1221, 1226-27, 1230 (10th Cir. 1997) (finding that a policy requiring employees to report all drugs present within their bodies violated the ADA in the absence of a showing that the policy was job-related and consistent with business necessity); <span class="Italic">Port Authority Police Benevolent Association, Inc., v. Port Authority of New York &#x0026; New Jersey</span>, 283 F. Supp. 3d 72, 84-85 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (holding that a health questionnaire of police officers was not narrowly tailored to address specific job-related concerns when it was intended to be comprehensive and reveal a panoply of conditions, including those having no relevance to an officer's ability to perform the job); <span class="Italic">Stahly v. South Bend Public Transp. Corp</span>., No. 3:10-CV-257-JVB, 2013 WL 55830, at *6-7 (N.D. Ind. 2013) (holding that a policy requiring the disclosure of all medications violated 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4)(A) when the agency provided no evidence of business necessity and merely set forth the purpose of the policy without proving, with evidence, that the policy was necessary to achieve the purpose); <span class="Italic">Scott v. Napolitano</span>, 717 F. Supp.2d 1071, 1076, 1084-85 (S.D. Cal. 2010) (finding that the Federal Protective Service's disability-related inquiries to a Special Agent, including asking him to list all medications taken and whether he had consulted with or been treated by clinics, physicians, healers, or other practitioners for other than minor illnesses, were not narrowly tailored to assess whether he could perform the essential functions of his job). Therefore, the administrative judge correctly found that the agency did not prove this charge and violated the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Evans</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6; 23 (holding that an agency's pre-offer-of-employment disability-related <span id="Page_2783"></span>inquiry that was prohibited by the ADA cannot form the basis of a charge of falsification); <span class="Italic">cf. Downs v. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority</span>, 13 F. Supp.2d 130, 140 (D. Mass. 1998) (finding that an employer that violates its employees' rights by asking impermissible questions ought not to be able to base adverse employment decisions on the resulting answers, to which it was not entitled in the first place, and which would not have been given had the employer not overstepped the bounds set by the ADA); <span class="Italic">Bozeman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120120923, 2013 WL 1933269 (May 3, 2013) (holding that an applicant's answers to an improper disability-related inquiry, even if false, cannot serve as a basis for the applicant's elimination from the applicant pool).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that <span class="Italic">Evans</span> is distinguishable because it involved questions asked before the agency made a job offer, which are more restricted than those that may be asked at later stages of hiring and employment. The agency further contends that it presented "substantial evidence" that the treatment and medications at issue here were relevant to the appellant's essential job duties and safety concerns. The agency cites to <span class="Italic">Kirkish v. Mesa Imports</span>, No. 08-CV-1965, 2010 WL 364183, at *5-6 (D. Ariz. Feb. 1, 2010), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 442 F. App'x 260 (9th Cir. 2011), for the principle that an employer may make medical inquiries regarding pain medications to an employee who drove automobiles as part of his duties because such medications have side effects, such as drowsiness, that could be relevant to the employee's performance, and that the business necessity standard can, therefore, be met even before an employee's work performance declines.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge relied upon <span class="Italic">Evans</span>, a case involving a preemployment disability-related inquiry, in finding that the agency's postappointment inquiries were prohibited by the ADA and the charge could not be sustained, the rationale underlying the analysis in <span class="Italic">Evans</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-23, applies regardless of whether the improper disability-related inquiry occurs pre or postemployment. In either case, an agency ought not be able to base an adverse action on answers to which it was not entitled in the first place, and in a situation where false responses are triggered by an agency's own improper actions. The agency contends that the treatment and medications the appellant received were relevant to his job duties and the agency's safety concerns, but this contention does not show error in the ultimate determination that the disability-related inquiries were overbroad and legally prohibited. The court in <span class="Italic">Kirkish</span>, No. 08-CV-1965, 2010 WL 364183, at *3, 6, concluded that the employer had good cause to inquire into whether Mr. Kirkish was capable of driving safely, which was an essential function of his position, because he had openly discussed his nerve disorder and use of prescription pain medications, which have possible side effects including drowsiness, with coworkers and supervisors, and a supervisor believed that there had been a "distinct change" in his cognitive abilities. Here, by contrast, the agency's inquiries were not due to any reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that the appellant's ability to perform his essential job functions was impaired by a medical condition or that he posed a direct threat due to a medical condition. Thus, <span class="Italic">Kirkish</span> is distinguishable from this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching our determination, we do not hold that a law enforcement agency cannot make inquiries regarding an employee's health. Rather, we hold that such inquiries must comport with the requirement of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4)(A) that any disability-related inquiries be job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c). The agency simply did not meet its burden in this case. <span class="Italic">See Scott</span>, 717 F. Supp.2d at 1085.</p>
