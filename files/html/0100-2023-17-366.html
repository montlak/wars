<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-364"><span class="space">32.</span> Privacy Act Violation</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1164 and SSA Region I</span>, 66 FLRA 74, 74, 77-79 (2011), sustained an award upholding the reprimand of a shop steward who disclosed Privacy Act protected information as an attachment to a grievance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On one occasion, the grievant sent to the Agency's regional commissioner and the Union president a copy of a grievance concerning denial of official time, with attachments. The attachments included "copies of records obtained from [the] [Agency's] computer system...[containing] the names of members of the public, their social security numbers, and <span id="page_2379"></span>reasons for seeking services." On a second occasion, the grievant sent to the Agency's regional commissioner, the Union president, and other Agency officials: (1) copies of a grievance concerning staffing and (2) unsanitized leave slips containing employees' Social Security numbers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency then issued the grievant a letter of reprimand for disclosing Privacy Act information on these two separate occasions in violation of Section 1.5 of the Agency's Standards of Conduct....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The award is not contrary to the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the award is contrary to law because the grievant did not commit an unauthorized disclosure under the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Privacy Act restricts the disclosure and re-disclosure of personally identifiable records.[6] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 32</span>, 59 FLRA 926, 929 (2004); <span class="Italic">Gen. Servs. Admin.</span>, 53 FLRA 925, 933 (1997). With certain enumerated exceptions, the Privacy Act provides that: "No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains...." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 32</span>, 59 FLRA at 929 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)). Under the "need to know" exception to the Privacy Act, disclosure of a record is permitted "to those officers and employees of the agency which maintains the record who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)(1). This exception focuses on the needs of the agency official who received the disclosure, rather than on the needs of the official who made the disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. U.S. Dep't of Justice</span>, 660 F. Supp.2d 31, 45 (D.D.C. 2009); <span class="Italic">Cacho v. Chertoff</span>, 2006 WL 3422548, at *5 (D.D.C. Nov. 28, 2006). Moreover, this exception applies to intra-agency disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Britt v. Naval Investigative Serv.</span>, 886 F.2d 544, 547 (3d. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Ciralsky v. Cent. Intelligence Agency</span>, 689 F. Supp.2d 141, 154-55 (D.D.C. 2010); <span class="Italic">Gamble v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 567 F. Supp.2d 150, 157 (D.D.C. 2008); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dep't of State</span>, 400 F. Supp.2d 1, 20 (D.D.C. 2005); <span class="Italic">see also Parks</span>, 618 F.2d at 681 n.1 (indicating that the purpose &#x00A7; 552a(b)(1) is "to prevent the office gossip, interoffice and interbureau leaks of information about persons of interest in the agency or community, or such actions as the publicizing of information of a sensational or salacious nature or of that detrimental to character or reputation" and covers "such activities as...reporting personal disclosures contained in personnel and medical records").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Under the Privacy Act, a record is defined as "any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, his...medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(a)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator set forth specific factual findings in support of his legal conclusion that the grievant's discipline was warranted. Specifically, the Arbitrator found that the reprimand was appropriate because the grievant sent "unsanitized materials to individuals and offices that did not have a legitimate reason to receive that information." Implicitly, the Arbitrator determined that the recipients did not need to know the Privacy Act-covered information contained in the attachments to evaluate the grievances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Union disagrees with these factual findings, it does not argue that they are based on a nonfact, and, as stated previously, in assessing whether an arbitration award is contrary to law, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 65 FLRA 523, 526 (2011); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2382</span>, 64 FLRA 123, 124 n.4 (2009) (concluding that, to preclude the Authority from deferring to an arbitrator's factual finding in determining whether the arbitrator's legal conclusion is consistent with the applicable standard of law, the appealing party needs to establish that the factual finding is deficient as based on a nonfact); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin.</span>, 63 FLRA 502, 504 (2009) (noting that, in the absence of a determination that a factual finding is deficient as based on a nonfact, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings in resolving whether the award is contrary to law). Also, the Arbitrator's factual findings support the conclusion that the need to know exception does not apply in this case. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(1) (permitting disclosure of a record "to those officers and employees of the agency which maintains the record who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties"); <span class="Italic">cf. Pippinger v. Rubin</span>, 129 F.3d 519, 529-30 (10th Cir. 1997) (finding that the recipients needed to know the information contained in the records, including the employee's name, to conduct a thorough investigation). Moreover, because Section 1.5 of the Standards of Conduct requires that any disclosure made within an agency must be to employees who legitimately need to know the information to perform their official duties, the Arbitrator's findings support the conclusion that discipline was warranted under that Section. <span class="Italic">See </span>Opp'n, Attach. 4 at 2-3 (requiring that, "[w]hen using systems of records protected by the Privacy Act," employees should "[e]nsure that any disclosure made within [the Agency] is in fact made to [Agency] employees and that such employees have a legitimate need to know the information in the course of their official duties"). Consequently, based on the Arbitrator's factual findings, the Union has not established that the Arbitrator improperly found that the recipients did not need to know the Privacy Act-covered information contained in the attachments. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1102</span>, 65 FLRA 148, 150-51 (2010) (concluding that the union's exception failed to demonstrate that the award was deficient because, based on the arbitrator's factual findings, his application of the confidentiality provisions of the Privacy Act was not contrary to law); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Emps., Local R5-66</span>, 40 FLRA 504, 506, 508-09 (1991) (upholding the award finding that discipline was warranted when the grievant disclosed and released confidential information that he obtained as an employee without proper authorization because the union's exceptions provided no basis for finding the award deficient).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Union's assertion that the award is contrary to law because intra-agency sharing of information does not constitute an unlawful disclosure under the Privacy Act is similarly without merit. As noted above, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)(1) clearly indicates that intra-agency disclosures are covered by the Privacy Act except when employees need to know the information to perform their official duties. <span class="Italic">See </span>&#x00A7; 552a(b)(1) (authorizing disclosure of a record "to those officers and employees of the agency which maintains the record who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties"). Legislative history also suggests that the Privacy Act covers intra-agency disclosures. <span class="Italic">See </span>Privacy Act, H.R. 16373, 93rd Cong. (1974) (indicating that one of the purposes of &#x00A7; 552a is to prohibit disclosure of "personal information within the agency other than to officers or employees who have a need for such personal information in the performance of their duties for the agency"). Moreover, the cases that the Union cites in its exceptions are distinguishable from this case and do not demonstrate that the Privacy Act was enacted to address only inter-agency disclosures. For instance, <span class="Italic">Murphy </span>is inapplicable because, although the plaintiff argued that the defendants "did not make required disclosures to [him]," he never asserted "that the defendants disclosed his records...." 2006 WL 2691614, at *4. Also, in <span class="Italic">Clarkson</span>, the court implicitly found that, because the agency officials who received the disclosure needed to know the material in question in order to pursue legitimate law enforcement activities, the disclosure was not made in violation of the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">See </span>811 F.2d at 1397-98 (indicating that "the material in question was collected and maintained in connection with legitimate law enforcement activities" and that the dissemination of this material to criminal investigation units within the agency did not violate the Privacy Act's disclosure requirements). Finally, in <span class="Italic">Coburn</span>, the court did not find that the Privacy Act only covers inter-agency disclosures; rather, the court determined that, because the agency employees "ha[d] a 'need for the record in the performance of their duties[,]'" it did not need to consider whether the Privacy Act was enacted to address intra-agency disclosures. 2008 WL 4390153, at *4 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)(1)) (emphasis omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The award is not contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Union, the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) of the Statute because it interferes with its right to provide supporting documentation when presenting a grievance. In this regard, the Union claims that the award, "relying on the Agency's argument and testimony, purports to have the Agency determine for the Union [when] documentation is necessary for representational purposes." Moreover, the Union asserts that the award has a chilling effect on union representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's claim that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) of the Statute is without merit. Here, the Arbitrator found that, because the recipients did not need to know the Privacy Act-covered information contained in the attachments to evaluate the grievances, the disclosure of that information was barred by the Privacy Act. Although &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) entitles a union "to act for, and negotiate collective bargaining agreements covering, all employees in the unit," the Union cites no authority permitting a union unlimited discretion to determine how to support a grievance. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1). In particular, the Union cites no authority supporting a conclusion that &#x00A7; 7114 permits a union to support a grievance by disclosing information when that disclosure is prohibited by law. Because the Arbitrator found that disclosure of the disputed information contained in the attachments was barred by the Privacy Act, the Union has not demonstrated that the award is deficient on this basis. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Mine Warfare Eng'g Activity, Yorktown, Va.</span>, 39 FLRA 1207, 1214 (1991) (holding that the right to represent under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) does not override other provisions of law); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1931, AFL-CIO</span>, 32 FLRA 1023, 1031-32 (1988) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we deny the Union's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The award is not contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute because the grievant was acting in a representative capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Statute, a union official acting in a representative capacity may not be disciplined for actions taken in performing representative <span id="page_2380"></span>duties unless such action exceeds the bounds of protected activity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army, U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, St. Louis Dist., St. Louis, Mo.</span>, 65 FLRA 642, 645 (2011); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Richmond, Va.</span>, 63 FLRA 553, 555 (2009) (<span class="Italic">VA Richmond</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Aerospace Maint. &#x0026; Regeneration Ctr., Davis Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz.</span>, 58 FLRA 636, 636 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's assertion that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute is without merit. Here, the Arbitrator determined that the reprimand was warranted because the grievant violated Section 1.5 of the Standards of Conduct by unlawfully disclosing Privacy Act-covered information. Because the grievant engaged in misconduct by making an unlawful disclosure, the grievant's actions exceed the bounds of protected activity. <span class="Italic">Cf. VA Richmond</span>, 63 FLRA at 554, 556 (upholding the arbitrator's determination that the agency did not have just cause to suspend the grievant because she did not engage in behavior that could properly be characterized as misconduct). Thus, even if the grievant was acting in a representative capacity when he made the disclosures, the Union has failed to demonstrate that the Arbitrator erred in sustaining the reprimand. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 987</span>, 63 FLRA 362, 364 (2009) (finding that, because the grievant's conduct exceeded the bounds of protected activity, the union did not demonstrate that the arbitrator erred in sustaining the suspension).</p>
<p class="noindent">[Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-266.html#sec9-264">Violation of the Privacy Act; Disclosure in Violation of the ADA or Rehabilitation Act</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">An award that essentially directed that a copy of the award be included in the grievant's personnel file, as an attachment to an appraisal, did not violate the Privacy Act (the union argued that the award did not permit the union to determine if the remedy was implemented), <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 215 and SSA, ODAR</span>, 67 FLRA 12, 13 (2012) (recon. den., <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 215 and SSA, Office of Disability, Region IV</span>, 67 FLRA 164, 165 (2014) (Member Pizzella concurring)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also contends that the appraisal-file remedy is contrary to the Privacy Act. Specifically, the Union argues that it must be able to independently confirm the Agency's compliance with that remedy, but claims that the Privacy Act bars the Agency from permitting the Union access to the relevant files.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With certain exceptions not relevant here, the Privacy Act prohibits an agency from disclosing personal information about federal employees without their consent. But nothing in the award requires the Agency to disclose personal information about federal employees, and the Union does not contend otherwise. Instead, the Union contends that it cannot confirm compliance with the award because the Privacy Act bars the Agency from permitting the Union access to the relevant files. However, the Union does not cite any provision of the Privacy Act or any other law that requires that the Union be able to independently confirm compliance with the award. Accordingly, the Union provides no basis for finding that the award is contrary to law in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent">A union unsuccessfully argued that an agency violated the Privacy Act by interviewing other employees before interviewing the grievant who was subjected to discipline, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1336 and SSA</span>, 68 FLRA 704, 706-07 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the Act requires, in pertinent part, that any federal agency that maintains a system of records must "collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under [f]ederal programs."[26] The Union asserts that the awards are contrary to the Act because, during the investigations leading to each suspension, the Agency interviewed persons other than the grievant about the grievant's alleged misconduct before it interviewed the grievant. In response, the Agency argues that, in investigating the grievant's alleged misconduct, it was not "practicable," within the meaning of the Act, to speak to the grievant before interviewing other witnesses.[28] In addition, the Agency questions whether the grievant's work status is a "right[&#8197;], benefit[&#8197;], [or] privilege[&#8197;] under [a] [f]ederal program[&#8197;]" within the meaning of the Act.[29]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is charged with developing guidelines and administering the Act.[31] In guidelines that OMB published in the Federal Register, OMB discusses "practicability" determinations under the Act, and states that "[p]ractical considerations...may dictate that a third-party source...be used as a source of information in some cases."[32] Specifically, OMB recognizes in its guidelines that "it may well be that the kind of information needed can only be obtained from a third party," particularly in "investigations of possible criminal misconduct."[33]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In the context of agency investigations of possible employee misconduct, courts have held, consistent with OMB's guidelines, that "the specific nature of each case shapes the practical considerations at stake that determine whether an agency has fulfilled its obligation under the...Act to elicit information directly from the subject of the investigation to the greatest extent practicable."[34] Specifically, where the inquiry may be resolvable by "objective evidence" in the employee's possession, then alleged concerns about the employee's credibility do not make it "impracticab[le]" to seek that evidence from the employee before contacting alternative sources.[35] Conversely, where the allegations against an employee cannot "be dispelled categorically" by the employee in a manner that would "obviate the need" to interview relevant witnesses, the Act does not require an agency to interview the employee first.[36] And where the allegations against an employee include threatening or harassing conduct, the possibility that the employee could impede or compromise the investigation after becoming aware of it by attempting to dissuade potential witnesses from cooperating is a legitimate "practicabil[ity]"[37] consideration under the Act.[38]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the investigation leading to the grievant's two-day suspension, the Arbitrator determined that, in order to "determine the nature of [the]...alleged misconduct," it was not "'practicable' [for the Agency] to obtain [the] [g]rievant's version of...events" before interviewing "the persons who overheard [the] [g]rievant's exchange with the customer."[39] Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Carton v. Reno</span>,[40] the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that an employer's investigation did not violate the Act where speaking to relevant witnesses first had the potential to "sharpen the issues and focus the charges in a way that would allow [the subject employee] to respond more particularly."[41] Further, as in <span class="Italic">Carton</span>,the allegation against the grievant in this case "was incapable of being resolved by [her] say-so or by some documentation [s]he might be expected to have."[42] Thus, OMB's guidelines and relevant court decisions support the Arbitrator's conclusion that it was not "practicable,"[43] within the meaning of the Act, for the Agency to interview the grievant first.[44] Accordingly, the Union has not established that the first award is contrary to the Act.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the investigation underlying the grievant's fourteen-day suspension, the Agency based this suspension on its allegations that the <span id="page_2381"></span>grievant: (1) criticized the agent in the presence of a customer; (2) belched in the agent's face; (3) repeatedly and improperly referred customers to the agent; and (4) overstayed a break and refused to coordinate her breaks with the agent. The Union asserts, and the Agency does not dispute, that the Agency interviewed the grievant's coworkers about these allegations before interviewing the grievant. Consequently, the Union argues that the investigation violated the Act, and that the second award is contrary to law. However, courts have found that "it is...impracticable to think that charges of employee mistreatment and harassment could be resolved by interviewing [the subject of the investigation] before others."[49] Those same practicability considerations are implicated here, where the allegations against the grievant revolve primarily around her alleged mistreatment of the agent. Moreover, as in <span class="Italic">Carton</span>, the allegations at issue here "could not be dispelled categorically by anything [that the grievant] could say or adduce,"[50] and, thus, it was necessary for the Agency to speak with witnesses. Therefore, consistent with the factors identified by OMB's guidelines and court decisions as relevant "practicab[ility]"[51] considerations under the Act,[52] we find that the Agency's investigation did not violate the Act, and that the second award is not contrary to law.</p>
