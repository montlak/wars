<p class="Body-Text">The categories of evidence that follow--unsworn statements, affidavits, depositions, investigation reports, and supervisors' notes--are often no more than hearsay. <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. DOJ</span>, 5 MSPR 77, 5 MSPB 150 (1981), and its progeny should be consulted for the underpinnings of the Board's analysis. "The Board will consider an unsworn statement by an appellant as hearsay evidence, i.e., a non-hearing statement offered to prove the matter asserted." <span class="Italic">Duffrin v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 70 MSPR 557, 561 (1996); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Perrin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, C-0752-15-0282-I-1 (NP 8/12/2016) ("However, the administrative judge considered the appellant's pleadings, but properly found the agency witnesses' live testimony to be more probative than the appellant's out-of-court statements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Whittlesey</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 684, 692 (1993) (live testimony is more probative than an out-of-court statement), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 39 F.3d 1197 (Fed. Cir. 1994)."); <span class="Italic">Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals v. Whittlesey</span>, 59 MSPR 684, 692-93 (1993) ("While a sworn statement has greater weight than one that is not, and live testimony is more probative than an out-of-court statement, respondent is mistaken in contending that hearsay evidence has no evidentiary weight if it is not sworn and if it is not shown that the declarant was unavailable to testify. Rather, the probative value of the agency's evidence must be evaluated in terms of the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Department of Justice,</span> 5 MSPR 77, 87 (1981)."); <span class="Italic">Gardner v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 565, 568 (1990) (statements in a grievance appeal form that was signed by a union representative were entitled to weight as relevant hearsay evidence); <span class="Italic">Devaney v. OPM</span>, 30 MSPR 261, 263 (1986) (appellant's responses to interrogatories were not to be discounted only because they were unsworn; answers had to be assessed along with other evidence); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Welhouse v. USDA</span>, CH-0752-12-0387-I-2 n.5 (NP 8/19/2014) ("Although the former second-level supervisor affirms that the information contained in his affidavit is 'true and complete,' it is not made under penalty of perjury. However, we have considered it as documentary evidence which supports the appellant's allegation of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alford v. Department of the Army</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 271, 274 (1991) (the appellant submitted documentary evidence to support her allegation of Board jurisdiction and the Board thus found that the administrative judge erred in making factual findings concerning the weight of the evidence submitted by both parties because such determinations should not have been made until after a hearing).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A summary of the law governing unsworn statements appears in <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. DOJ</span>, 30 MSPR 652, 655-56 (1986), involving allegations of misconduct leading to a demotion. The AJ declined to give controlling weight to statements offered by the agency. On PFR <span class="Italic">Ballentine</span> determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the presiding official misapplied <span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span>,...which the agency asserts "stands for the proposition that an unsigned statement made during the course of an agency investigation does not rise to the level of sufficient proof in the face of, among other things, <span class="Italic">contradictory live testimony</span> at the hearing...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency has misinterpreted <span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span>. When hearsay evidence is presented, it "remains for the trier of fact to weigh the probative value of the hearsay evidence in the circumstances of the case."...&#8197;Thus, there is no merit to the agency's contention that because a statement has not been shown to be contradictory or inconsistent with other evidence, it necessarily follows that it is sufficient to support a charge by preponderant evidence.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">An AJ should carefully evaluate the probative value of unsworn statements to determine their probative value as hearsay, <span class="Italic">Elmore v. VA</span>, CH-0752-16-0416-I-1 (NP 2/2/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although hearsay evidence is admissible in Board proceedings, assessment of the probative value of hearsay evidence necessarily depends on the circumstances of each case. <span class="Italic">Adamsen v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 16 (2011); <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Department of Justice</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 77, 83-84 (1981). The Board generally evaluates the probative value of hearsay evidence by considering various factors that include the availability of persons with firsthand knowledge to testify at the hearing, whether the out-of-court statements were sworn, whether the declarants were disinterested witnesses to the events and whether their statements were routinely made, the consistency of the out-of-court statements with other statements and evidence, whether there is corroboration or contradiction in the record, and the credibility of the out-of-court declarant. <span class="Italic">Adamsen</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 16; <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 178, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11 (2001), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 41 F. App'x 455 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Here, however, the administrative judge failed to consider any of these factors in crediting the unsworn out-of-court written statements over the hearing testimony of the agency witnesses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unsworn statements will be considered along with all the other evidence of record. But they are not conclusive. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Arredondo v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 113, 117-19 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10 (2000) (supervisor's unsworn statement did not constitute preponderant evidence when it was contradicted by the appellant, there was no other eyewitness evidence, the supervisor was approved as witness but did not appear on the day of the hearing, and the agency failed to secure a continuance of the hearing to obtain the supervisor's testimony); <span class="Italic">Salyers v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 19 MSPR 628, 629 (1984) (AJ weighed a written statement submitted by the agency and found it "not worthy of great weight, but sufficient in light of appellant's lack of credibility").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board determined that unsworn factual statements by an appellant in his Board appeal may constitute hearsay worthy of some weight, <span class="Italic">Scott v. DOJ</span>, 69 MSPR 211, 228 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Spotti v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 49 MSPR 27, 33 (1991), the appellant's unsworn statements in his response to the agency's notice of proposed removal and in his petition for appeal would not constitute evidence as to the truth of his assertions. For the following reasons, however, we find that <span class="Italic">Spotti</span> was incorrectly decided, and that the appellant's statements should be accepted as evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As authority for its statement that an appellant's unsworn statement does not constitute evidence as to the truth of the assertions contained therein, 49 MSPR at 33, <span class="Italic">Spotti</span> cited <span class="Italic">Fontanilla v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 312, 316-17 (1990), which found that the administrative judge in that case erred in relying upon the agency's bare assertions as evidence in making findings as to the appellant's handicap discrimination claim, stating that statements of a party do not constitute evidence as to the truth of their assertions. While <span class="Italic">Fontanilla</span> can be read as support for the same proposition as in <span class="Italic">Spotti</span>, it can also be read as supporting the more limited holding that the statements of a party's representative in a pleading do not constitute evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vincent v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 32 MSPR 263, 268 (1987); <span class="Italic">Enos v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 8 MSPR 59, 63 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has long held that relevant hearsay evidence is admissible in Board proceedings; the fact that it is unsworn merely goes to its weight and probative value. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration v. Whittlesey</span>, 59 MSPR 684, 692-93 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 39 F.3d 1197 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 115 S. Ct. 1690 (1995); <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 5 MSPR 77, 83-87 (1981). We find that an unsworn statement by an appellant in an initial appeal file is simply one form of hearsay evidence, i.e., a non-hearing statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The fact that it is unsworn may detract from its probative value, but it should still be considered as admissible evidence. An appellant's unsworn statement might be viewed as more reliable than some other types of hearsay, because it is the appellant's own account of what transpired, not a statement that someone else told the declarant about something the non-declarant saw or heard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 105 MSPR 604, 608 &#x00B6; 8, 2007 MSPB 130 (2007) ("We note that an unsworn statement by an appellant in an initial appeal file is admissible evidence. <span class="Italic">Scott v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's contentions are not in affidavit form, nor signed under penalty of perjury. However, in <span class="Italic">Scott v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 69 MSPR 211, 228 (1995), the Board found that an appellant's unsworn statements contained in the initial appeal file constitute admissible hearsay evidence, drawing a distinction between unsworn statements provided by a party's representative, and those made by the appellant himself. Although the appellant's unsworn statements in the present case were made on petition for review, we nevertheless find that the same principle enunciated in <span class="Italic">Scott</span> applies here:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]n unsworn statement by an appellant...is simply one form of hearsay evidence....&#8197;The fact that it is unsworn may detract from its probative value, but it should still be considered as admissible evidence.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Frederick v. DOJ</span>, 65 MSPR 517, 533 (1994), commented on the use of hearsay when no explanation is provided for failure to call the declarant as a witness:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More germane in this context is the Board's holding that the probative value of an unsworn hearsay statement regarding facts at issue is generally not as great as live testimony concerning the same matter. <span class="Italic">See Dubiel v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 428, 432 (1992); <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Department of Justice</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 77, 83-89 (1981). Evaluation of the probative value of hearsay evidence depends on the circumstances of each case. <span class="Italic">See Borninkhof</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 83. In this context, we note from our review of the record that no explanation exists for the agency's decision not to call Mr. Womack for live testimony, or for its failure to secure a sworn statement from him. In addition, Mr. Womack was not a disinterested party to the incidents at issue, and his statement was not made routinely. Our review simply does not establish that this unsworn hear say statement possesses the indicia of reliability and trustworthiness sufficient to accord it greater probative value than Mr. Mayberry's sworn testimony. <span class="Italic">See Dubiel</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 432; <span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 83-89. Therefore, although the administrative judge's analysis of this issue was incomplete, we sustain his implicit finding that Mr. Mayberry's testimony was more credible and probative regarding these two incidents than Mr. Womack's account.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 164, 166 (1986), suggested that unsworn statements offered as to the timeliness of a PFR have greater probative weight when they are corroborated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ceja v. United States,</span> 710 F.2d 812 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the Court held that unsworn declarations are equivalent to an affidavit and are entitled to great weight when unrebutted. In the present case, appellant presents his two unsworn declarations as proof that good cause exists for waiver of the regulatory time limit. We find that the facts in the present case are distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Ceja. In Ceja,</span> the Court considered the unsworn statement of petitioner along with the unsworn corroborative statements of two co-workers. Appellant provides no such corroborative evidence. Second, appellant was inconsistent in his explanation for the delay. In his first letter, appellant states that the delay was due to the fact that he was unable to secure representation. In his second submission, appellant states that the delay was due to the fact that he "was sick and unable to get out of bed and get a letter written." We find that this inconsistency further weakens a case which does not present very strong evidence to support waiver of the regulatory time limit for filing a petition for review. Thus, appellant has failed to establish good cause for waiver to the extent that there is an insufficient showing that he exercised diligence or ordinary prudence. <span class="Italic">See Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180 (1980) (factors for determining whether good cause for extending time limit for filing petition for review has been shown).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an unsworn statement may receive some consideration, a witness's specific affidavit outweighs the appellant's general unsworn statement. <span class="Italic">Caponio v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 73 MSPR 671, 679 (1997); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Davies v. OPM</span>, 5 MSPR 199, 202 (1981) (involving an OPM letter pertaining to a notice that the appellant asserted he did not receive; OPM statements were discounted because they were not in the form of testimony or an affidavit from a person with firsthand knowledge, nor was there an explanation for the lack of probative evidence). Yet the Board sustains adverse actions based on an unsworn but signed statement from an eyewitness whose recollection is challenged through the appellant's direct hearing testimony. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hipolito v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 11 MSPR 157, 158 (1982). Live testimony may trump interrogatory answers. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rose v. DOD,</span> AT-0752-12-0063-B-2 (NP 8/10/2015) ("Nevertheless, we find that the agency's written answers to interrogatories are not of sufficient weight to overturn the administrative judge's demeanor-based finding from the deciding official's firsthand in-person testimony. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Whittlesey</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 684, 692 (1993) (live testimony is more probative than an out-of-court statement), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 39 F.3d 1197 (Fed. Cir. 1994).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal False Statements Act, 18 USC 1001, may make even unsworn statements used in administrative proceedings the legal equivalent of sworn statements, since intentionally, materially false statements are subject to criminal penalties. The Board's written appeal form carries at the signature line, the statement "I certify that all of the statements made in this form and any attachments are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief." Arguably, statements made in the appeal take on a level of reliability somewhat above an unsworn statement. The e-filing system inquires whether pleadings contain information based on personal knowledge and, if so, whether than information is declared to be true under the False Statements Act.</p>
