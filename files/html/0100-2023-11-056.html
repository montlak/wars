<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-57"><span class="space">3.</span> Examples of Sufficiently Particularized Requests</h4>
<p class="noindent">Examples of decisions concluding that a union demonstrated "particularized need" sufficient to justify production of information from an agency were catalogued in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 2343</span>, 52 FLRA 1195, 1207-08 (1997), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2343 v. FLRA</span>, 144 F.3d 85, 87-90 (D.C. Cir. 1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The case now before the Authority is distinguishable from others in which the Authority found that a union established a particularized need for information in order to determine whether to file a grievance, invoke arbitration, or otherwise discharge its representational responsibilities. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Twin Cities</span>, 51 FLRA 1467 (union requested sanitized disciplinary actions involving infractions similar to those with which an employee it was representing in an oral reply to a proposed adverse action was charged to determine whether the employee had been treated disparately); <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Austin District Office, Austin, Texas</span>, 51 FLRA 1166, 1178 (1996) (union requested prior disciplinary letters issued to all employees for certain misconduct to determine whether action proposed against employee for same misconduct constituted disparate treatment); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, New</span> <span class="Italic">England Region, Bradley Air Traffic Control Tower, Windsor</span> <span class="Italic">Locks, Connecticut</span>, 51 FLRA 1054, 1068 (1996) (union asked for performance award data for nonunit employees to determine whether unit employees had been treated differently under awards program); <span class="Italic">United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, United States Border Patrol, Del Rio, Texas</span>, 51 FLRA 768, 774-76 (1996) (union requested all memoranda from unit employees seeking reassignment to determine whether complaints about assignment policy were true); <span class="Italic">Department of the Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois</span>, 51 FLRA 675, 682 (1995), <span class="Italic">enforced</span>, No. 96-1060 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 24, 1997) (<span class="Italic">Scott</span>) (union sought letter from agency allegedly disciplining supervisor to determine whether to proceed with grievance over supervisor's use of physical force against unit employee). In these cases, the record established that the union had communicated to the agency, in a timely manner, why it needed certain information.[12] Here, by contrast, the Union communicated nothing to the Respondent at or near the time of its information requests to explain why it needed the information developed by the OIA investigation of the correctional officer to prepare for or present its grievance claiming that the Respondent had endangered the health and safety of employees by releasing a violent inmate into the recreation area. That, as our dissenting colleague points out, the Union was unaware until the hearing that the investigation generated two reports does not excuse the Union's failure to articulate particularized need for any report.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12] In reviewing the records in the cited cases, the Authority took into account, where relevant, circumstances surrounding the information request--including the discussions (or lack thereof) between the parties--and not solely what the union stated in its written request. For example, the Authority considered the fact that the parties met to discuss and clarify the union's request for information in determining whether the union established a particularized need for one category of information in <span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span>, 51 FLRA at 1475-76. Consistent with this precedent, we agree with our dissenting colleague that circumstances, like other relevant evidence, are appropriate to consider in evaluating the overall sufficiency of the request. Based upon our careful evaluation of the entire record in this case, however, we are not persuaded that the Union met its burden to articulate, with specificity, why the requested information was necessary within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Border Patrol, Tucson Sector and AFGE Local 2544</span>, 52 FLRA 1231, 1236-40 (1997), also summarized successful (and unsuccessful) union information requests in disciplinary cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The sufficiency of requests for employee disciplinary information has been examined in four decisions issued by the Authority since <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>: <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. and U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, Northern Region, Twin Cities, Minnesota and Office of Inspector General, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 1467 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span>); <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Austin District Office, Austin, Texas</span>, 51 FLRA 1166 (1996) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Austin</span>); <span class="Italic">Scott II</span>; and <span class="Italic">Department of Labor, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 462 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Labor</span>). The Authority found that the unions articulated and established particularized need for requested information in <span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span>, <span class="Italic">IRS, Austin</span>, and <span class="Italic">Scott II</span>. In <span class="Italic">Labor</span>, the Authority concluded that particularized need had not been established.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Labor</span>, the union asked for employee disciplinary suspension records covering a 5-year period "to prepare for arbitration proceedings involving suspensions of five unit employees [and to] ensure that the [agency] had been 'consistent in its disciplinary actions of all employees.'" 51 FLRA at 476 (citation omitted). The Authority concluded that, although the union had articulated a general need for <span class="Italic">some</span> disciplinary records, it had not explained why it needed the exact information it had requested or the particular uses to which it would put that information. The Authority also concluded that the union had not shown why it needed disciplinary <span id="Page_308"></span>records covering a period of 5 years, pointing out that the union testified at the hearing that it had specified 5 years in its request only "because it believed that the [a]gency maintained such records for that time period<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Scott II</span>, the union requested a copy of any disciplinary action taken against a particular supervisor for using physical force against a unit employee. The union had filed a grievance over the matter seeking appropriate discipline against the supervisor and, in response to the grievance, the respondent asserted that "'[a]ppropriate action ha[d] been taken regarding the supervisor.'" 51 FLRA at 677 (citation omitted). In its request for the information and a subsequent clarification of that request, the union stated, among other things, that the information was needed to prepare for arbitration and "to determine if the requested remedy of disciplinary action against the supervisor was in fact taken, and what that action was<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (citation omitted). The union added:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Upon our review of this information, we may well conclude that no further action i[s] warranted....&#8197;In other words, we need this to assess the need to pursue arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority concluded that these statements clearly articulated the union's need for the information and satisfied the particularized need standard set forth in <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas</span> <span class="Italic">City</span>. 51 FLRA at 682-84.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">IRS, Austin</span>, as relevant here, the union was representing an employee facing a proposed adverse action for having allegedly violated the respondent's standards of conduct. The union requested, among other things, proposed and final disciplinary and adverse action letters issued to employees in a particular geographic area during a 3-year period. The union claimed that the information was a "factor relied on in determining adequacy and appropriateness of the proposed action" and informed the agency that it needed the information "to analyze the propriety of the proposed action with respect to similar allegations of misconduct on the issue of disparate treatment." 51 FLRA at 1167-8. The Authority concluded that the union had demonstrated a particularized need for the requested information because:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Union has explained why it needs the information (to ascertain whether there was disparate treatment of an employee), the uses to which the information will be put (to determine the appropriateness of the proposed penalty)[,] and the connection between the uses and the Union's representational responsibilities under the Statute (to represent an employee against whom an adverse action was proposed).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1178.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, in <span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span>, the union requested three categories of information to prepare for representation of a unit employee in an oral reply to a proposed removal: (1) disciplinary and adverse action letters issued within a particular geographic area during a 5-year period for offenses similar to those for which the employee was charged; (2) exhibits to an inspector general report mentioned in the notice of proposed removal; and (3) copies of the regulatory and statutory authority for the inspector general to investigate the employee. The Authority concluded that the union's expressed reason for the latter two categories of information--"to properly respond to the allegations" in the notice--lacked sufficient specificity to satisfy the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span> and, as such, the union did not establish a particularized need for that information. 51 FLRA at 1481, 1482. In reaching this conclusion, the Authority found it inappropriate to consider the additional reasons for requesting the information that were offered by the union for the first time at the unfair labor practice hearing, because these reasons were not communicated to the respondent "'at a time when it reasonably could have assessed the necessity [of] the information.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1481 (<span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 51 FLRA 248, 258 (1995) (<span class="Italic">EEOC</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority reached a different conclusion about the first category of information requested by the Union in <span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span>: proposed and final disciplinary and adverse action letters. As to this category, the Authority held that particularized need had been established by the Union. Although the reason stated by the Union in its written request for this category of information was identical to that stated for the other categories, which the Authority found insufficient to establish particularized need, additional explanation was provided by the Union prior to the agency's decision to deny the request. In this regard, unlike the other categories of information, the parties met shortly after the request to discuss the reasons the union requested the letters. At that meeting, the union stated that it needed the letters "to compare the discipline the [r]espondent had proposed [to the employee] with that given to other employees who had committed similar offenses." <span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span>, 51 FLRA at 1473-74. The parties also discussed the respondent's concerns about the privacy of such other employees, and the union clarified that it was requesting sanitized information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Taking into account both the reasons offered at the meeting and those contained in the written request for the disciplinary and adverse action letters, the Authority concluded that the union had "clearly explained why the requested...letters were [necessary]<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1475. The Authority also found that, in the circumstances presented, it was appropriate to consider reasons offered by the union for the first time in testimony at the unfair labor practice hearing concerning the scope--temporal and geographic--of the request. The Authority pointed out that no questions regarding the scope of the request had been raised at the parties' meeting, and concluded that refusing to consider the testimony would give "undue weight to whether the [respondent] asked or the union answered questions about matters that, unlike other matters that were discussed at the [parties'] meeting, neither party appeared concerned about at the time of the request<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1476. In this connection, the Authority distinguished <span class="Italic">Labor</span>, where, as noted previously, the Authority concluded that reasons offered by the union for the first time at the unfair labor practice meeting did not establish particularized need. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1475-76.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Portland Dist. and UPTU</span>, 60 FLRA 413, 213-17 (2004), provides an example of an information request that should have been granted--the union requested information to confirm (or deny) its concerns about nepotism within the workplace:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the Union President informed the Commander of the Respondent's Portland District (Commander) that bargaining unit employees had complained about nepotism at the Dalles-John Day Project (Project). The Commander appointed an investigating officer to conduct an informal investigation into, among other things, "[t]he family relationships that exist among the employees at the...Project including whether the hiring, supervision or performance on the jobs have been unduly influenced by said family relationships in violation of any laws, regulations, or policy in place and relating to nepotism in federal employment." Subsequently, the Commander informed the Union President that the investigating officer had completed an investigative report (the report) and had concluded that there was no merit to the allegations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union later initiated a grievance (the 2003 grievance) alleging that the Respondent violated law and regulation when the Chairman of the Project (the Chairman) was the senior rater of his son and in a position to recommend his son for promotion. The Union requested pertinent sections of the report,[1] stating that it needed the report in order to assess the merits of allegations "concerning the nepotism in the Power Plant Training Program and the Prohibited Personnel Practices that continue to occur there[,]" including not only allegations involved in the 2003 grievance, but also an allegation that the Chairman's son "is receiving preferential treatment by not being required to rotate through the craft crews in accordance with the Regional Hydropower Trainee Program Agreement." In this connection, the Union stated that it "need[ed] to review any documents that would prove or disprove these allegations or impact our grievance and any settlement efforts or arbitration efforts[&#8197;]" and that the report would not only enable the Union to "come to [its] own conclusions[&#8197;]" regarding those allegations, but also might "show other violations of our CBA[,] law or regulations for which we will need to seek remedies." Finally, the Union concluded that it needed the report in order to fulfill its "representational responsibility to its members to enforce personnel law rules regulations and the CBA[,]" including "[s]ettling grievances or pursuing them with all available data in the best manner possible[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;Although the Union requested only the sections of the report that concerned nepotism, we will refer to those requested sections as "the report" herein.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent denied the Union's request, asserting that the Union had not articulated a particularized need for the report because, in order to be necessary to the Union, "the information must reflect information useful in the grievance." In this regard, the Respondent stated that "[t]he report discusses only events predating the report's conclusion in February 2002[,]" and "any grievance based on these events needed to be filed some eighteen months ago." The Respondent also stated, in this connection, that "management is not obligated to respond to a data request whose identified use is a plainly untimely grievance." Finally, the Respondent asserted that the report constitutes guidance, advice, counsel or training provided for management officials or supervisors, relating to collective bargaining, that is exempt from disclosure under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Judge did not err in finding that the Respondent was required to furnish the information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, an agency must furnish information to a union, upon request and "to the extent not prohibited by law," if that information is: (1) "normally maintained by the agency in the regular course of business"; (2) "reasonably available[;]" (3) "necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining"; and (4) not "guidance, advice, counsel, or training provided for management officials or supervisors, relating to <span id="Page_309"></span>collective bargaining[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4). The only factors in dispute in this case are the third and fourth factors, which are discussed separately below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The Judge did not err in finding that the information was "necessary."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to demonstrate that requested information is "necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining" under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, a union "must establish a particularized need for the information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs the requested information, including the uses to which the union will put the information, and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute." <span class="Italic">IRS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 50 FLRA 661, 669 (1995). The union's responsibility for articulating its interests in the requested information requires more than a conclusory assertion and must permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether the disclosure of the information is required under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 670. The agency is responsible for establishing any countervailing anti-disclosure interests and, like the union, must do so in more than a conclusory way. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Health Care Fin. Admin.</span>, 56 FLRA 156, 159 (2000). Such interests must be raised at or near the time of the union's request. <span class="Italic">See United States DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Det. Ctr., Houston, Tex.</span>, 60 FLRA 91, 93 (2004) (<span class="Italic">FBP Houston</span>)<span class="Italic"> </span>(citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found particularized need established where, for example, the union stated that it was requesting information to determine if complaints by employees about a current policy are true and correct and to represent the employees "in any rightful charges against the [a]gency." <span class="Italic">United States INS, United States Border Patrol, Del Rio, Tex.</span>, 51 FLRA 768, 774-76 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Border Patrol Del Rio</span>), <span class="Italic">reconsid. denied</span>, 51 FLRA 1561, <span class="Italic">aff'd on other grounds sub nom.</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2366 v. FLRA</span>, 114 F.3d 1214 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Here, the Union explained that it needed the information not only in connection with the 2003 grievance, but also to: (1) assess the merits of an additional allegation that the manager's son was "receiving preferential treatment by not being required to rotate through the craft crews in accordance with the Regional Hydropower Trainee Program Agreement[;]" (2) "come to [its] own conclusions[&#8197;]" regarding "statements made by bargaining unit members concerning the nepotism in the Power Plant Training Program and the Prohibited Personnel Practices that continue to occur there[;]" and (3) determine whether there were "other violations of our CBA[,] law or regulations for which [it would] need to seek remedies." In other words, the Union was requesting the information to determine whether complaints by employees about a current policy are true and correct and to represent the employees in any rightful charges against the Agency. <span class="Italic">See Border Patrol Del Rio</span>, 51 FLRA at 774-76.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Union was not requesting the information solely in connection with the 2003 grievance, the Respondent's claim that the Union did not need the report in order to pursue the 2003 grievance does not provide a basis for concluding that the Union lacked particularized need for the report. In any event, the Union had a substantial interest in the report in connection with the 2003 grievance. In this connection, a union has a substantial interest in information that will assist it in determining whether to proceed to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Ill.</span>, 51 FLRA 675, 682 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Ill. v. FLRA</span>, 104 F.3d 1396 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Given the nature of the report--the results of an investigation into alleged nepotism at the Project--it was reasonable for the Union to conclude that the information could assist it in assessing the validity of, and determining whether to proceed to arbitration on, the 2003 grievance as well as additional claims of nepotism. Thus, the Union had a substantial interest in this information, and the Respondent's assertion in its response regarding timeliness of grievances does not establish that the Union lacked particularized need for the report.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Respondent asserts that it asked the Union to clarify its particularized need and that the Union did not respond, the record does not support this assertion. In this connection, the Respondent's denial of the request stated, in pertinent part, "If you have any questions regarding this response please do not hesitate to contact me." The response did not request clarification or give any indication that the Respondent was unclear as to the Union's reasons for needing the report. Accordingly, the Respondent's assertion is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Judge did not err by finding that the Union articulated, with specificity, why it needed the requested information, including the uses to which the union would put the information, and the connection between those uses and the Union's representational responsibilities under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See IRS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 50 FLRA at 669.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the Respondent's stated anti-disclosure interest--that disclosure of the report would violate the confidentiality of witnesses--as noted previously, an agency must state its anti-disclosure interests at or near the time of the information request. <span class="Italic">See FBP Houston</span>, 60 FLRA at 93. The Judge found, and the Respondent does not dispute, that the issue of confidentiality of witnesses in the report was not raised at or near the time of the Union's request. Further, the Respondent did not raise concerns regarding confidentiality in its denial of the request, and the Respondent provides no evidence that these concerns were communicated to the Union at or near the time of the request. Accordingly, we do not consider the Respondent's arguments about these matters in assessing the Union's particularized need. <span class="Italic">See United States DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Forrest City, Ark.</span>, 57 FLRA 808, 812 (2002) (Member Pope dissenting in part on other grounds).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, the Judge did not err in finding that the information was "necessary" under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4)(B), and we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The Judge did not err in finding that &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) of the Statute does not exempt the information from disclosure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent challenges the Judge's conclusion that &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) of the Statute does not exempt the report from disclosure. The Judge found that, even assuming portions of the report concern matters covered by &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C), those portions of the report could be sanitized. As the Judge's decision expressly provides that the Respondent is not required to disclose any sections of the report that may be covered by &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C), the Respondent's exception does not demonstrate that the Judge's decision is inconsistent with that statutory section. We note, in this regard, that any disputes that may arise as to the extent of sanitization are appropriate for resolution at the compliance stage of this case. <span class="Italic">See DOJ, United States INS, United States Border Patrol, El Paso, Tex.</span>, 40 FLRA 792 (1991), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, 41 FLRA 259.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In any event, for the following reasons, the Judge did not err in finding that the report does not concern matters covered by &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) of the Statute. In this connection, &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) exempts from disclosure information that contains guidance, advice, counsel, or training for management officials relating specifically to the collective bargaining process, such as: (1) courses of action agency management should take in negotiations with the union; (2) how a provision of the collective bargaining agreement should be interpreted and applied; (3) how a grievance or a ULP charge should be handled; and (4) other labor-management interactions which have an impact on the union's status as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees. <span class="Italic">See NLRB</span>, 38 FLRA 506, 522-23 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 523 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(b)(4)(C) "constitutes a narrow exception to an agency's duty to furnish data under [&#x00A7;] 7114(b) of the Statute." <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 38 FLRA at 520. Section 7114(b)(4)(C) does not exempt from disclosure guidance, advice, or counsel to management officials concerning the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 523. Further, a document that merely contains recommendations regarding how to improve the management and operations of an agency is not exempt from disclosure under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C). <span class="Italic">See Dep't of HHS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 49 FLRA 61, 67-69 (1994) (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>) (Member Talkin concurring as to other matters). Such a document will be exempt from disclosure under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) only if it addresses courses of action that management should take with respect to negotiations, the interpretation and application of a collective bargaining agreement, or the handling of grievances or ULPs. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In this connection, a document is exempt from disclosure under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) only if it constitutes "strategic information concerning the bargaining process." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 69. <span class="Italic">Accord NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d at 530-31 (upholding Authority's "distinction between nonstrategic and strategic information: information about the subject of collective bargaining versus information about the bargaining itself.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The report at issue here was the result of an investigation into alleged nepotism at the Project.&#x2003;The Respondent provides no basis for concluding that the report addresses courses of action Agency management should take in negotiations with the Union, how a provision of the collective bargaining agreement should be interpreted and applied, how a grievance or a ULP charge should be handled, or other labor-management interactions which have an impact on the union's status as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees. In this connection, the Respondent does not dispute that no grievance concerning nepotism had been filed at or near the time of the investigation. Further, even assuming that the report contains recommendations concerning steps management should take in improving the work environment, there is no basis for concluding that these recommendations constitute "strategic information concerning the bargaining process." <span class="Italic">HHS</span>, 49 FLRA at 69.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Judge did not err in finding that &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) does not exempt the report from disclosure, and we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Judge did not err in finding a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) is commonly found as a "derivative violation," that is, an interference with employee rights that flows from another violation under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, <span id="Page_310"></span>Wash. Reg'l Office</span>, 58 FLRA 261, 261 (2002) (citation omitted). It is well established that an agency commits a derivative violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) by violating &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5). <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Although the Respondent argues that the Judge erred by finding a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) because the Union representatives are not employees of the District, we disagree. In this regard, the Authority has found that an agency's interference with a union's right to designate the union's representatives violates &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), even when the intended union representative is a non-employee. <span class="Italic">See Bureau of Indian Affairs, Isleta Elementary Sch., Pueblo of Isleta, N.M.</span>, 54 FLRA 1428, 1438-40 (1998). Further, in situations where an agency has bypassed a union in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5), the Authority has found a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) because a bypass "demeans the Union and inherently interferes with the rights of employees to designate and rely on the Union for representation." <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 55 FLRA 978, 983 (1999) (citation omitted) (then-Member Cabaniss dissenting on other grounds). Here, denial of information interferes with the rights of represented employees, regardless of whether the Union officials representing them are themselves employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">That particularized need will not be outweighed by insubstantial privacy interests was established in <span class="Italic">INS, Border Patrol, Del Rio and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2366</span>, 51 FLRA 768, 769-70, 774-77 (1996), resolving that the agency erred when it failed to provide the union with memoranda needed to assess whether temporary duty assignments were made fairly or were the product of favoritism that could be addressed through the grievance process:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The American Federation of Government Employees, National Border Patrol Council, AFL-CIO (NBPC) is the certified exclusive representative of a nationwide consolidated unit of employees at the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), United States Border Patrol, including employees employed by the Respondent at Del Rio, Texas. The Charging Party, Local 2366, is an agent of NBPC for the purpose of representing unit employees in the subdivision of the Border Patrol known as the Del Rio Sector. INS and NBPC were parties to a collective bargaining agreement that had expired at the time of the relevant events.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For at least two years prior to the hearing, the Respondent operated six different units, including three specialized units--a War on Drugs unit, a Brush unit, and a Plain Clothes unit. All of the employees in the Del Rio facility are equally qualified for assignment to these units by grade. Assignment to the specialized units is considered desirable and is also career enhancing because of the opportunity to gain specialized experience for one full year or longer. As found by the Judge, an employee must request assignment to one of the specialized units by memorandum.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having received a number of complaints about the process by which the Respondent was selecting employees for the specialized units, the Union believed that the selection procedures were tainted with favoritism and were affecting the morale of the employees. As a result, the Union requested, by letter to the Chief Patrol Agent of the Del Rio Sector...copies of all memoranda submitted by agents requesting assignment to the three specialized units to "determine if the complaints by the employees are true and correct" and to represent the employees "in any rightful charges against the Agency."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its letter seeking copies of all memoranda requesting assignment to specialized units, the Union gave two specific reasons for its request: to determine if complaints by employees about the current policy of assigning agents are true and correct; and to represent the employees "in any rightful charges against the Agency." At the hearing, the General Counsel also asserted the Union's need to formulate bargaining proposals concerning the Respondent's assignment policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first two reasons, we conclude that the Union has both articulated and established a sufficient need for the memoranda. In its letter requesting the information, the Union clearly stated its concern that the Respondent's assignment policy had an adverse effect on the employees' conditions of employment and morale and specifically mentioned its belief that the Respondent had exercised favoritism in making the assignments. Moreover, the Union indicated that it might be necessary to take action on behalf of the unit employees to correct the perceived problems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Undisputed testimony at the hearing established, and the Judge specifically found, that in order to be considered for any of the specialized units, an agent was required to submit a memorandum. Despite this policy, however, the testimony establishes both an inconsistency and a disparity in the selection process. First, some employees were selected for these units without submitting a memorandum. Second, the memoranda submitted ranged from one-sentence requests to those of a page or two describing the background of the agent making the request. As the Union representative testified, the Union needs the memoranda that were submitted to analyze the process through which employees were selected. Based on this information, the Union can decide whether or not to file a grievance or a charge. In this regard, information may be found necessary within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4)(B) when it is required to determine whether to file a grievance. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland and Social Security Administration, Region X, Seattle, Washington</span>, 39 FLRA 298, 308 (1991). Accordingly, we conclude that the Union sufficiently articulated and established its need for the requested memoranda for the purposes of determining the validity of employee complaints and representing employees in any charges that it might decide to file based on those complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of its interest in withholding the information, the Respondent points solely to the absence of evidence that the employees who wrote the memoranda desired that their contents be released to the Union. However, the Respondent does not further explain, and it is not apparent, why the employees who wrote the memoranda have a privacy interest in them. The record discloses only that the memoranda are requests for assignment to a particular unit, and the Respondent has not shown any actual or potential privacy interests that would be implicated in releasing that information. The record also establishes that at the time it denied the Union's request, the Respondent stated only that the request for information was moot; the Respondent did not indicate, either at that time or during the hearing, that it was concerned about any privacy interests. For these reasons, we find that the Respondent has not met its burden of establishing an interest in nondisclosure. <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, 50 FLRA at 670 (an agency may not satisfy its burden of establishing countervailing anti-disclosure interests by making conclusory or bare assertions).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent has not established countervailing interests that outweigh the need established by the Union for the memoranda.&#x2003;Accordingly, we conclude that the need established by the Union for the requested memoranda outweighs the countervailing interest asserted by the Respondent.
