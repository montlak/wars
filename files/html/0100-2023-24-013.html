<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-12"><span class="space">c.</span> Arbitration Award</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An issue may arise concerning the proper petitioner in challenges to arbitration awards. Considered here are awards taken directly into the Federal Circuit, not those awards appealed to MSPB based on an EEO claim or defense presented to the arbitrator (leaving the employee to challenge the resulting MSPB decision in what amounts to a mixed case). The union that pursued the case through arbitration may desire to be named as an appellant in court, along with the individual who was the grievant. At one point, the Federal Circuit expressly withheld ruling on whether the union may properly be named as a party to the case. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2718 v. DOJ, INS</span>, 768 F.2d 348, 349 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Then along came <span class="Italic">Reid v. Dept.</span> <span class="Italic">of Commerce</span>, 793 F.2d 277 (Fed. Cir. 1986), a consolidated appeal by employees subjected to a Census Bureau RIF. Counsel was retained by a labor union to represent the employees in their appeals from adverse decisions of the Board. The court learned that most of the employees had not directed the filing of judicial petitions for review. Counsel for the employees argued that the employees, by signing MSPB representation forms, understood and desired that the union would provide representation for necessary judicial appeals. Discussion ended there on the ability of the employees' cases to receive review. Discussion then ensued on the standing of the union to maintain the action as a party. The interests of the members differed and the union did not have any direct representational stake in the outcome of the case. The review statute, 5 USC 7703(a)(1), creates a right of appeal for "employees," a term of unambiguous meaning under 5 USC 2105(a) and other statutes. <span class="Italic">Reid v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 793 F.2d 277, 280-81 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Another court came to the same result. For those who seek to obtain judicial review of adverse action appeals decided in arbitration, only the employee has the authority to petition a court of appeals for review of the arbitration award, even though the union may be the grievant and the contractual party in interest. 5 USC 7121(f) and 7703 place the election to undertake judicial review solely on the adversely affected employee. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council of Prison Locals, Local 1286 v. DOJ</span>, 738 F.2d 742, 747 (6th Cir. 1984). But without discussion of the standing of the union as an appellant, <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1442 v. Dept. of Army</span>, 810 F.3d 1272 (Fed. Cir. 2015), decided a furlough appeal stemming from arbitrators' decisions. Recent decisions suggest that a union cannot appeal an MSPB decision or arbitrator's award (in a case that could have been taken to MSPB) to the Federal Circuit under 5 USC 7703. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1367 v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 61 F.4th 952 (Fed. Cir. 2023), <span class="Italic">post</span>. A union could seek to submit an <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Union counsel may not seek review of an award that denies fees. The right of review is that of the employee or applicant who is the real party in interest. <span class="Italic">Tierney v. INS</span>, 75 Fed. Appx. 757 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3599 v. EEOC</span>, 920 F.3d 794 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (reviewing arbitrator's fee determination in adverse action case). One approach is for the employee and the union to both be named as petitioners. E.g.,<span class="Italic"> Fed. Educ. Ass'n, Karen Graviss, Petitioners v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20180806094">898 F.3d 1222</a> (Fed. Cir. 2018). 898 F.3d 1222 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Reviewing past decisions, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3438 v. SSA</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP), determined that a union lacked associational standing to seek Federal Circuit review of an arbitration in an adverse action that favored the grievant on the merits but that denied counsel fees to the union.

<p class="Block-Quote1">AFGE Local 3438 ("AFGE") appeals from an arbitration decision denying its request for attorney fees. Because AFGE does not have standing to appeal that denial, we <span class="Italic">dismiss</span> this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sarah Kidwell is a claims specialist at the Social Security Administration ("SSA"). In November 2019, the agency indefinitely suspended Kidwell based on allegations that she violated policies prohibiting transfer of confidential information to others, in this case, to her father.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1), a government employee may challenge a disciplinary action by appealing to the Merit Systems Protection Board (the "Board"). Alternatively, if the employee is represented by a collective bargaining agreement containing a provision for a grievance process, the employee may appeal to an arbitrator using the negotiated grievance procedure. Kidwell elected to have her grievance heard through binding arbitration in accordance with a collective bargaining agreement with AFGE. She was represented in that proceeding by AFGE. The arbitrator found in Kidwell's favor, concluding that the SSA imposed the penalty "without meeting the burden of reasonable cause and in contravention of its own past practice."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After Kidwell prevailed on the merits, AFGE filed a request for attorney fees pursuant to the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.C.S. &#x00A7; 5596; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g). The Back Pay Act "authorizes 'reasonable attorney fees' when an agency employee has prevailed, and the fees are warranted in the interest of justice." <span class="Italic">Raney v. Federal Bureau of Prisons</span>, 222 F.3d 927, 930 (Fed. Cir. 2000).
The arbitrator denied AFGE's motion for attorney fees. He found that the SSA's "disciplinary decision was premature[,]" and therefore reversed the decision; hence he concluded that Kidwell was the prevailing party. But he also determined that payment of attorney fees was not warranted in the interest of justice because the agency's issuance of its indefinite suspension was "not prohibited or meritless" and "there was sufficient evidence to conclude [that Kidwell] likely violated the [a]gency's internal policies on distribution of [personally identifiable information]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. AFGE appealed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review in this case is governed by a combination of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(a)(1) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(a)(1) states that "[a]ny employee or applicant for employment adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order or decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board may obtain judicial review of the order or decision." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f) states that &#x00A7; 7703 "shall apply to the award of an arbitrator in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the Board." <span class="Italic">See Dunn v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 F.3d 1308, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("This court reviews an arbitrator's decision 'in the same manner' as decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a prerequisite to our exercise of jurisdiction, we must consider whether AFGE has standing to appeal from the Arbitration Decision before reaching the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">AFGE contends that it has associational standing to pursue its interest on behalf of its members. "[T]he Supreme Court has recognized that an association may have standing to assert the claims of its members, even where the association itself has not suffered injury from the challenged action." <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, 793 F.2d at 279. To succeed, AFGE argues that it must only prove (1) "its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right," (2) "the interests it seeks to protect are germane to [its] purpose," and (3) "neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit." <span class="Italic">Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm'n</span>, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977). AFGE argues that it satisfies the three prongs of the <span class="Italic">Hunt</span> test. AFGE argues that (1) Kidwell could "as a client sue for the denial of attorney fees," (2) "the issue of obtaining attorney fees paid for by AFGE on behalf of its members is germane to its representational functions," and (3) "members of a labor organization do not need to be personally involved in litigating over an [a]ttorney fee dispute that was paid for by the organization because the [a]ttorney fee matter provides no personal stake for them...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">AFGE also argues that this court should reject "a literal statutory construction" of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(a)(1). AFGE argues that "to rule that a union does not have standing to pursue review of a denial of attorney fees, which were paid by the union, not the employee, would lead to [an] absurd result or otherwise fly in the face of legislative intent and be in direct opposition to clearly defined law...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that we do not have jurisdiction to hear this appeal. We are bound both by the statute, and by our precedent interpreting that statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We analyzed the governing statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(a)(1), in <span class="Italic">Reid</span>. We concluded that "Congress, in using the term 'employee' in &#x00A7; 7703(a)(1) and in defining that term to mean an individual, has exercised its legislative prerogative to impose a prudential limitation on the exercise of this court's jurisdiction over adverse decisions of the MSPB." <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, 793 F.2d at 284. "Since the right of appellate review under &#x00A7; 7703(a)(1) is phrased in terms of 'any employee or applicant for employment,' the logical conclusion is that Congress intended to narrowly circumscribe the party who may initiate appellate review...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 283. AFGE is admittedly <span id="Page_5175"></span>neither an employee nor an applicant for employment, and thus cannot seek review of the Arbitration Decision on its own behalf. Notably, Kidwell did not herself appeal for attorney fees as she did not pay them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We followed up the <span class="Italic">Reid</span> decision with nonprecedential decisions in Senior Executives Association and Tierney. <span class="Italic">See Senior Execs. Ass'n v. Office of Personnel Mgmt</span>., 1997 U.S. App. Lexis 10023 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Tierney v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv</span>., 75 Fed. App'x 756 (Fed. Cir. 2003). While our decision here, and in <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, may be unsatisfactory to some, our role is to follow a statute and our precedent. As we explained in <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, "[t]he remedy for any dissatisfaction with the results in particular cases lies with Congress and not this court. Congress may amend the statute, we may not." <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, 793 F.2d at 284 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the clear statute and established precedent, AFGE failed to demonstrate that it fulfills the <span class="Italic">Hunt</span> prerequisites for associational standing. With regard to <span class="Italic">Hunt's</span> first prong, AFGE failed to explain how Kidwell would have standing to appeal. On the contrary, AFGE stated that if "the Union simply named the employee as the petitioner, not only would that be unethical (as the employee is not a real party at interest as they have paid no [a]ttorney fees whatsoever and have no personal stake in the outcome either way) it would present [a] further ethical dilemma regarding the sharing of fees with non-attorneys and put the Union in [an] untenable position...." AFGE concedes that the attorney fees at issue here were paid by AFGE. Thus, AFGE's statements contradict its argument that Kidwell would have standing to appeal from the Arbitration Decision. Since AFGE failed to satisfy the first prong of the <span class="Italic">Hunt</span> test for associational standing, we do not need to address the second and third prongs. Finally, we note that <span class="Italic">Hunt</span>, although a decision of the Supreme Court, was not decided in the face of a clear statute limiting the right to an appeal for attorney fees, as this one was.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction over AFGE's appeal, and therefore do not evaluate the merits of the Arbitration Decision denying AFGE's request for attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered AFGE's remaining arguments, but we find them unpersuasive. For the reasons discussed above, we <span class="Italic">dismiss</span> this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">REYNA, Circuit Judge, additional views.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I write separately to express my belief that the statutory scheme surrounding appeals of arbitration decisions in federal employee grievances leads to the absurd result that while only a union may invoke binding arbitration, the same union lacks standing to appeal the result of that arbitration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I agree that we do not have jurisdiction to hear AFGE Local 3438's ("AFGE") appeal in this case. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1), a federal employee has the option to pursue arbitration of a grievance or an appeal before the Merit Systems Protection Board (the "Board"). If the result of the arbitration is appealed, judicial review is provided in the same manner and under the same conditions as a Board appeal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Only individuals can appeal Board decisions. The statute provides that "[a]n employee or applicant for employment" may appeal for judicial review of a Board decision. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(a)(1). We interpret the term "employee" to mean an individual and not a union. <span class="Italic">Reid v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 793 F.2d 277, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1986). As a result, only an individual may appeal an arbitration decision, not a union.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But only a union may invoke binding arbitration to resolve an employee grievance. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(b)(1)(C)(iii); <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, 793 F.2d at 282; <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps., Council of Prison Locs., Loc. 1286 v. U.S. Dep't of Justice</span>, 738 F.2d 742, 745 (6th Cir. 1984)). This statutory scheme concerning arbitration appeals yields an absurd result. If a union is required to invoke binding arbitration, then the union should have standing to appeal the subsequent decision to this court. For example, here, AFGE is required to invoke binding arbitration but prohibited from appealing the arbitration decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There apparently are two avenues for fixing this Catch 22 result--through Congress or through this court. "Congress may amend the statute; we may not." <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc</span>., 458 U.S. 564, 576 (1982). <span class="Italic">See also Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps</span>., 738 F.2d at 747-48; <span class="Italic">Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc</span>., 447 U.S. 102, 123-24 (1980); <span class="Italic">Reiter v. Sonotone Corp</span>., 442 U.S. 330, 344-45 (1979). Section 7121(f) provides that arbitration decisions are appealed in the same manner as Board decisions. A key Congressional amendment to this provision that would allow a union to appeal arbitration decisions would rectify the problem seen in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The other possible avenue for addressing this problem is for this court to revisit its decision in Reid. This court is limited to enforcing a statute "according to its terms...unless a literal interpretation would lead to an incongruous result." Reid, 793 F.2d at 281. The current statutory scheme produces an incongruous result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, we reasoned that because a union has no right to represent an employee before the Board, a union also has no right to represent an employee before this court. <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, 793 F.2d at 283 (citing S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 102-03). We explained that employees can choose between appealing grievances to the Board or using the negotiated procedure. An employee that chooses the negotiated procedure can be represented only by a union. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. An employee that chooses to appeal to the Board may choose their representative. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, we reasoned, a union has neither a right nor an obligation to represent an employee before the Board. Because a union does not have an independent right to represent an employee before the Board, it "would be anomalous to conclude that a union nevertheless has standing to appeal from the [Board] to this court under &#x00A7; 7703(a)(1)." <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, 793 F.2d at 283.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But the anomaly now is that a union has a right and an obligation to represent an employee in arbitration proceedings but does not have standing to appeal the result. Further, it is anomalous that an employee cannot invoke binding arbitration but nevertheless has standing to appeal. Obviously, we cannot amend the statute. And given our decision in <span class="Italic">Reid</span>, this court would be reluctant, and perhaps correctly so, to revisit this issue. At the end of the day, these anomalies are the necessary result of the statutory scheme created by Congress and must be corrected, if at all, by Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3438</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Fraternal Order of Police, United States Capitol Police Labor Committee v. Dept. of Interior</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fraternal Order of Police, United States Capitol Police Labor Committee ("FOP") appeals from an arbitration decision upholding a decision by the U.S. Park Police to remove an employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appeals from arbitration decisions in this context are governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f), which states that "section 7703 of this title pertaining to judicial review shall apply to the award of an arbitrator in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the [Merit Systems Protection] Board ['MSPB']." The referenced section in turn states that "[a]ny employee or applicant for employment adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order or decision of the [MSPB] may obtain judicial review of the order or decision." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have held that "Congress, in using the term 'employee' in &#x00A7; 7703(a)(1) <span class="Italic">and in defining that term to mean an individual</span>, has exercised its legislative prerogative to impose a prudential limitation on the exercise of this court's jurisdiction over adverse decisions of the MSPB." <span class="Italic">Reid v. Dep't of Com</span>., 793 F.2d 277, 284 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). We have therefore concluded that an organization (like FOP) lacks standing to appeal from an MSPB or arbitration decision because it is not an individual. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 280, 283-84 (MSPB decision); <span class="Italic">Senior Execs. Ass'n v. OPM</span>, No. 95-3460, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 10023, at *9-10 (Fed. Cir. Apr. 7, 1997) (nonprecedential) (MSPB decision); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3438 v. Soc. Sec.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1367 v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 61 F.4th 952, 955-56 (Fed. Cir. 2023), reaffirmed Federal Circuit decisions denying unions the ability to appeal to that court from merits arbitration awards on adverse actions, and the court determined that the grievant could not be substituted for the union that incorrectly initiated the appeal (although the court's decision did not preclude substitution had the effort been made during the time allowed for initial filing of the court appeal):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Johnson argues that he should be permitted, pursuant to Federal Rule 43(b) of Appellate Procedure, to substitute the local Union in this appeal. In support, he advances several arguments, including, for example, that he is the true party-in-interest because his termination (i.e., removal) is the subject of the appeal, that the local Union mistakenly filed the appeal in its name, and that the local Union was later compelled to withdraw from the appeal. The Air Force contends that substitution in this matter would be improper because the local Union lacked standing to file the appeal before this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, a federal employee may seek to reverse an adverse employment decision, such as termination, by appealing the decision directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB"). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(e)(1), 7512(1), 7513(d). In cases such as here, where the employment position is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the employee has a choice to proceed before arbitration or to proceed before the MSPB. <span id="Page_5176"></span><span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the employee chooses to proceed before the MSPB, the employee may appeal an unfavorable ruling by the MSPB to this court. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1). If the choice is made to proceed via arbitration, only the union may appear as a party at the arbitration, on its behalf or on the behalf of the employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(b)(1)(C)(i) &#x0026; (iii). Significant here, if the arbitration results in an unfavorable decision, only the employee may appeal the unfavorable arbitration award before this court. <span class="Italic">See Reid v. Dep't of Com</span>., 793 F.2d 277, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see also AFGE Loc. 3438 v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., No. 2021-1972, 2022 WL 1653177, at *3 (Fed. Cir. May 25, 2022) (Reyna, J., additional views); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f) (explaining 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703 applies to the review of an arbitrator's award in this court "in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the Board").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, Mr. Johnson elected arbitration, where he was represented by the local Union. The arbitration proceeding resulted in an unfavorable decision to Mr. Johnson. The unfavorable decision was then appealed to this court by the local Union. Mr. Johnson was not a party to the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our precedent and prior statutory interpretation are clear that unions lack standing to initiate an appeal of an arbitration decision under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(a). <span class="Italic">See Reid</span>, 793 F.2d at 282; <span class="Italic">see also Senior Execs. Ass'n v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 113 F.3d 1254 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (nonprecedential). The parties in this appeal do not dispute that the local Union in this case lacked standing to appeal the Arbitration Decision. The question before us is whether a party may substitute under Rule 43(b) where the original party to the appeal lacked standing. We hold that it may not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, Rule 43(b) governs substitution for "any reason other than death." Fed. R. App. P. 43(b). For example, substitution may "be necessary when a party is incapable of continuing the suit," such as when the property-at-issue or focus of the litigation shifts, rendering another entity the real party in interest. <span class="Italic">Mojave Desert Holdings, LLC v. Crocs, Inc</span>., 995 F.3d 969, 975 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (quoting 21 James W. Moore <span class="Italic">et al</span>., Moore's Federal Practice--Civil &#x00A7; 343.12 (2020)); <span class="Italic">see AngioDynamics, Inc. v. Biolitec, Inc</span>., 775 F.3d 550, 554 (2d Cir. 2015) (holding substitution is "permissible only when a [proper] party to the suit is unable to continue to litigate" (internal quotation marks omitted)). This court has allowed substitution for a successor-in-interest to a party that had standing at the outset of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Olaplex, Inc. v. L'Oreal USA, Inc</span>., 845 F. App'x 943, 948-49 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (nonprecedential).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other circuits evaluating Rule 43(b) have held that substitution is impermissible where the original party was not a proper party. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Silberman v. Miami Dade Transit</span>, 927 F.3d 1123, 1128 n.3, 1131-32 (11th Cir. 2019); <span class="Italic">Sable Commc'ns of Cal. Inc v. Pac. Tel. &#x0026; Tel. Co</span>., 890 F.2d 184, 191 n.13 (9th Cir. 1989) (noting an implicit "precondition that the original party was a proper party to the suit").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Johnson argues various grounds for why substitution is permissible in this case. While he is correct that Rule 43(b) permits substitution in certain circumstances, the cases he relies on involve intervention or substitution in matters where the original party being substituted had standing. Here, in contrast, the local Union does not have standing by operation of the statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(a). We reject the invitation to ignore &#x00A7; 7703(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we hold that a party may not substitute under Rule 43(b) when the original party being substituted lacked standing to initiate the appeal. We have considered the remainder of Mr. Johnson's arguments and find them without merit. We deny Mr. Johnson's motion for leave to substitute for the local Union and do not reach the merits of this appeal, which is hereby dismissed.</p>
