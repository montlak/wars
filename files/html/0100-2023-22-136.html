<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-136"><span class="space">e.</span> Unsuccessful EEO Claim</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Young v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 29 MSPR 589, 591-93 (1986), allowed compensation for time for the unsuccessful pursuit of an EEO claim in an otherwise successful Board appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board has not addressed the exact question of whether it has the authority to award attorney fees for work done on an EEO complaint at the agency level preceding a Board appeal, it has considered analogous situations. For example, we have considered whether to award attorney fees for work done before the agency in an adverse action prior to filing a Board appeal, <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Coast Guard,</span> 28 M.S.P.R. 539 (1985), for work done before a court after a final decision by the Board, <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Depart</span>ment <span class="Italic">of the Army,</span> 27 M.S.P.R. 611 (1985), and for work done before the Board's Special Counsel in pursuit of a successful resolution of a matter before the Board, <span class="Italic">Wells v. Schweiker</span>, 12 MSPB 329, 330-331, 14 M.S.P.R. 175, 177-79 (1982). In each of these situations, the Board has found that it has the authority to award fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, the Board has not excluded from a representing attorney's compensable time hours reasonably spent outside the Board proceeding but in furtherance of the same goal. When the Board has denied fees for hours spent outside a Board proceeding, it has depended on the fact that those hours were spent pursuing a claim unrelated to the merits of the agency action which is the subject of the Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Lizut, supra</span> (fees denied to the appellant in pursuing his claim concerning the agency's promotion and early optional retirement decisions, which were completely separate from and unrelated to the merits of his removal appeal); <span class="Italic">King v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 20 M.S.P.R. 467 (1984) (fees for time spent in unemployment compensation hearing not compensable since this proceeding was in no way connected with or necessary to the successful prosecution of the appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has also awarded fees for time spent in connection with unsuccessful claims made on appeal. In <span class="Italic">Lizut, supra,</span> at n.11, for example, the Board awarded fees for time spent on a reprisal claim as to which the appellant was unsuccessful. We believe such a result is in full accord with the rule stated by the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart,</span> 461 U.S. 424, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 76 L. Ed.2d 40 (1983), a case in which the Court decided the proper relationship of the results obtained to an award of attorney fees. In <span class="Italic">Hensley,</span> the Court held that fees were appropriately awarded for time spent on issues which arose from the same common core of facts where there was an interrelationship between the facts and the legal theories, and the plaintiff achieved a level of success that makes the hours reasonably expended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without citing <span class="Italic">Hensley,</span> the Board has exhibited similar thinking and has awarded fees for time spent on certain issues raised in an appellant's hearing on which he did not prevail. In <span class="Italic">Logan v. U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 345 (1984), the Board held that only when the time spent is "non-productive," or when certain legal theories are deemed meritless and are truly "fractionable," should fees be denied for issues on which an appellant does not prevail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board therefore concludes that attorney fees are awardable for work done on an unsuccessful EEO complaint made before the agency, filed prior to a Board appeal, when (1) the complaint arose from the common core of facts which were the basis of the Board appeal, (2) the appellant prevailed on the appeal, and (3) attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice. Of course, the fee award for the hours spent on the EEO complaint would be subject to the same scrutiny for duplication and excessiveness which all hours claimed receive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Boltz v. SSA,</span> DE-0752-08-0436-A-1 (NP 8/20/2010), allowed compensation for time spent on an unsuccessful EEO claim when "appellant's discrimination claims were based on a common core of facts regarding the merits of the agency's action, she had asserted alternative defenses in contesting the merits of the agency's adverse action, and she was fully successful in having the Board completely reverse the agency's action":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency reasserts on review that the administrative judge should have reduced the appellant's total billable hours by 25% so as to exclude any time the appellant spent on her unsuccessful Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) retaliation and discrimination claims and that the administrative judge's failure to do so is inconsistent with Board precedent. The agency relies on the Board's finding in <span class="Italic">Sowa v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 408, &#x00B6; 18 (2004), that attorney "[f]ees may be reduced for time spent on unsuccessful EEO matters where the appellant fails to show that the matters were related to the appellant's success in the appeal." However, the Board's precedent provides that attorney fees may be awarded for unsuccessful discrimination claims raised before the agency prior to a Board appeal where the complaint arose from a common core of facts that were the basis of the Board appeal, the appellant prevailed on the appeal, and fees were otherwise warranted, <span class="Italic">see Sowa</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 408, &#x00B6; 15; and they may be awarded for unsuccessful discrimination claims asserted as alternative grounds for setting aside an agency's adverse action, <span class="Italic">see Freeman v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 125, 133-34 (1995). Conversely, denial of an award of attorney fees for time spent on unsuccessful claims may be warranted where the unsuccessful claims are based on "facts and legal theories" that are "distinct in all respects" from the claims upon which the appellant was successful. <span class="Italic">See Heath v. Department of Transportation</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 101, 105 (1995) ("The denial of fees for unsuccessful claims is dependent upon a finding that they are distinctly different from the successful claims, because they rest on different facts and legal theories."). In the instant case, the appellant's discrimination claims were based on a common core of facts regarding the merits of the agency's action, she had asserted alternative defenses in contesting the merits of the agency's adverse action, and she was fully successful in having the Board completely reverse the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Time was compensable for EEO proceedings that were not successful but formed the jurisdictional basis for an appeal to the Board from an arbitrator's award. The appellant prevailed on non-EEO grounds. Apparently the time on the EEO case was compensable because the claim established jurisdiction rather than the basis for a favorable result on the merits. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. DHHS</span>, 32 MSPR 683, 688 (1987), analyzed fractionable time in unsuccessful claims or defenses:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, appellant's discrimination complaint arose from the common core of facts that were before the arbitrator and reviewed by the Board. The record establishes that appellant specifically withdrew her discrimination complaint and presented those matters to the arbitrator in connection with her demotion. We also note that while the arbitrator found that the agency did not engage in discrimination and this issue was not reached by the Board, the allegation was not frivolous. Moreover, the discrimination allegations constituted an integral part of appellant's request for Board review as well as an essential prerequisite for Board jurisdiction over this case. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). Appellant is, therefore, entitled to fees for work done in connection with the discrimination complaint.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An EEO claim adjudicated in the Board appeal figured into <span class="Italic">Morey v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 604, 608 (1992). The appellant was successful in reversing a constructive suspension, but he was not successful in convincing the Board that he was the victim of disability discrimination. The agency did not contest the liability for fees, but it did contest the appellant's right to fees for time spent on the discrimination claim. The Board declined to reduce the award:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, the appellant contends that his handicap discrimination claim arose out of the same facts as his placement on enforced leave, and that, as part of his burden of proving that he was placed on enforced leave pending inquiry...he was required to "explore" the handicap issue in relation to the agency's attempts to reasonably accommodate him....&#8197;The record supports the appellant's contention inasmuch as he challenged the agency's determination that he was disabled from performing the duties of his position during the enforced leave period....&#8197;Thus, the appellant's handicap discrimination claim was inextricably interwoven with his constructive suspension claim. Therefore, we find that the appellant's handicap discrimination claim was based on the same facts as the constructive suspension claim and was not fractionable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Diehl v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 104, 110-11 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-15 (2001), determined to be noncompensable time spent on an unsuccessful attempt to obtain compensatory damages in the course of enforcement proceedings arising out of breach of a settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to be found "reasonable," legal work for which fees are requested must be shown to have "significantly contributed to the success of the Board proceeding and eliminated the need for work that would otherwise have been required in the Board proceeding." <span class="Italic">Carson v. Department of Energy</span>, 86 MSPR 192 &#x00B6; 24 (2000). The Board has further held that, once a party proves that, he is the prevailing party, the extent to which he prevailed is the most critical factor to consider in determining reasonable attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Stein</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 MSPR 685, 689-90 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby,</span> 506 U.S. 103, 114, 113 S. Ct. 566, 121 L. Ed.2d 494 (1992)). This factor is particularly crucial where a party is deemed prevailing even though he succeeded on only some of his claims for relief. <span class="Italic">See Lizut v.</span> Department <span class="Italic">of the Navy,</span> 42 MSPR 3, 8 (1989). When more than one claim for relief is made and the claims involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories, the fee determination should reflect the significance of the overall relief obtained in relation to the hours reasonably expended. <span class="Italic">See Smit v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 612, 618-19 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant made more than one claim for relief (an order of enforcement and compensatory damages) and his allegations in his petition for enforcement were based on related legal theories--that the agency had materially breached the settlement agreement. Thus, we must determine whether the fee award should be reduced because the relief obtained was significantly less than that which the appellant sought.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant correctly characterizes our finding in the compliance decision, that he could have established a violation of the settlement agreement by showing agency discrimination or reprisal in its failure to comply with certain provisions of the agreement, the evidence supports the AJ's finding that the appellant made this particular argument of breach in order to obtain compensatory damages, relief distinct from that which he sought in making his other allegations of breach. While the appellant is correct that he could have proven discrimination/reprisal that constituted a material breach of the agreement, as a matter of law, <span class="Italic">he could not have established entitlement to compensatory damages. Diehl,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 620 &#x00B6; 11. As a result, despite the fact that the appellant's claim of discrimination/reprisal was related to the claim on which he prevailed (the breach--of the nondisclosure provision), and appears to have been raised in good faith, we agree with the AJ that the work on the discrimination/reprisal claim did not contribute to the appellant's success in the compliance proceeding, and that the fee award should be reduced to reflect his failure to receive compensatory damages, a significant portion of the relief he sought.[1] <span class="Italic">See Rothschild v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 54 MSPR 238 (1992) (reducing fees where the appellant succeeded in cancellation of an adverse action but failed to obtain a stay); <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>, 42 MSPR at 9 (reducing fee award where the appellant's petition for enforcement resulted in an order directing the agency to pay back pay, but failed to establish the right to return of security clearance or that agency had acted in reprisal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Actually, the appellant did not specifically seek the right to rescind the settlement agreement and reinstate his appeal, which is the only relief the Board afforded him. Because the Board has found both an order of enforcement and the right to rescind an agreement as available remedies where there has been a material breach, as here, we agree with the AJ that the appellant obtained at least the equivalent of some of the relief he sought.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the appellant's request for review, the appellant raised two separate claims: (1) that the arbitrator erred in not finding that the appellant's due process rights were violated; and (2) that the appellant proved his claim of retaliation for engaging in protected EEO activity. The Board found that the agency did violate the appellant's due process rights but affirmed the arbitrator's determination that the appellant failed to prove his affirmative defense of retaliation for protected EEO activity. The two claims do not share the same legal or factual basis. Though the appellant's retaliation claim appears to have been raised in good faith and the appellant obtained reinstatement on his other claim, we find that the work on the retaliation claim did not contribute to his success in the request for review and that the fee award should be reduced to reflect the failure of this claim. <span class="Italic">See Diehl</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 104, &#x00B6; 14 (reducing fee award for unsuccessful claims of breach based on discrimination and reprisal where the appellant's petition for enforcement resulted in a finding of noncompliance with the nondisclosure provision of a settlement agreement); <span class="Italic">see also Lizut</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 9 (reducing fee award to reflect the failure to obtain relief in the form of return of the appellant's security clearance or a finding of reprisal where the appellant's petition for enforcement resulted in an order directing the agency to pay back pay).
