<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-200"><span class="space">O.</span> OFFSETS; DEBT COLLECTION FROM ANNUITY</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">For CSRS, OPM is to follow the procedures of 5 CFR 831 Subpart M (2022) when it seeks to recover debts owed to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund; the procedures of 5 CFR 831 Subpart R (2022) apply when a federal agency requests OPM to recover a debt owed to the United States by administrative offset against money due and payable to the debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. Parallel procedures for FERS are at 5 CFR Part 845 (2022). <span class="Italic">Johnson v. OPM</span>, 97 MSPR 193, 196-97 &#x00B6; 7-9 (2004), pointed out the differences in OPM's role as collector, depending on the nature of the claim and identity of the claimant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, OPM agrees that it failed to provide the appellant with the procedural rights to which he is entitled under 5 C.F.R. part 831 and that the case should be remanded to it for further proceedings. However, OPM argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that OPM's action was governed by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1304 or other provisions of 5 C.F.R. part 831, subpart M, and it maintains that collection of debts such as the alleged debt at issue in this case is governed instead by the provisions of 5 C.F.R. part 831, subpart R.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's position is well founded. While subpart M of 5 C.F.R. part 831 prescribes procedures to be followed by OPM in collecting debts incurred by an annuitant, that subpart is applicable only where the debt allegedly is <span class="Italic">owed</span> to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF). 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1301, 831.1302. Subpart R of part 831 prescribes procedures to be followed by a federal agency in requesting that a debt owed to the United States be collected by administrative offset against money due and payable to the debtor from the CSRDF. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1801. It also prescribes procedures OPM must follow in making such offsets. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In the present case, the debt allegedly is owed to OWCP, and the agency to which it allegedly is owed is seeking offset of the debt against the appellant's CSRS annuity payments. Subpart R of part 831--and not subpart M--therefore governs OWCP's claim and OPM's actions in response to that claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that OPM's scope of review under subpart R is limited, and that it does not extend to a review of the merits of the underlying debt issue between the appellant and the creditor agency. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1806(d)(3)(1). OPM is responsible, however, for determining whether the administrative offset was effected in a manner consistent with the procedural requirements of that subpart and the authorities cited there; and it is responsible for ensuring its own compliance with procedural requirements imposed on it under the subpart. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1805-831.1808; <span class="Italic">cf. Malone v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 52 M.S.P.R. 655, 657 (1992) (describing Board's limited jurisdiction to review actions covered by subpart R); <span class="Italic">Lashley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 360, 365 (1990) (same).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The issue involved in the collection, overpayment, or offset dispute may involve the source of the debt and more particularly whether the debt is tied to funding of the retirement system or whether the source of the debt lies elsewhere. If the OPM reconsideration decision addresses a challenge to an offset from a lump sum refund, MSPB has jurisdiction to consider the propriety of the offset on appeal, since the Board has jurisdiction over OPM's determinations affecting an appellant's rights or interest under the CSRS. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 122, 126 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to an administrative offset, involving the reduction in annuity payments to recover funds owed under the federal life insurance program administered by OPM, the reduction was not based on any decision regarding a substantive right or interest under FERS and not within the Board's jurisdiction over annuity appeals. The Board explained in <span class="Italic">Miller v. OPM</span>, 99 MSPR 104, 106-110 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-5, 7-17 (2005) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Miller v. OPM</span>, 449 F.3d 1374, 1377-81 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (Judge Dyk dissenting), <span class="Italic">post</span>), still allowing for the possibility of waiver of the debt arising under the OPM insurance program:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The DVA removed the appellant from her position as a Registered Nurse due to her physical disability effective January 5, 1991. She applied for disability retirement benefits under FERS, but OPM denied her application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In November 2001, the appellant applied for a deferred or postponed annuity. OPM concluded that the appellant had been eligible for immediate retirement upon her separation from employment in January 1991, because she was 63 years old and had 16 years of federal service at that time. OPM determined that the appellant's annuity commenced on January 6, 1991, the day after she separated from government service. In 2002, OPM finalized the appellant's annuity application and paid her $98,723.67, which represented the annuity that had accrued from January 6, 1991, to March 30, 2002.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In June 2002, OPM gave the appellant the opportunity to elect the basic life insurance coverage she wished to continue into retirement, that with <span id="Page_4434"></span>no reduction, a 50% reduction, or a 75% reduction. OPM explained in a letter to the appellant that there was no charge for electing the 75% reduction in basic life insurance, but that there was a charge for electing the 50% reduction or no reduction. OPM specifically informed the appellant that an election of the no reduction option would result in an overpayment to her of $8,372.10 because OPM would have to collect the life insurance premiums from the date her annuity commenced in January 1991. In July 2002, the appellant elected the no reduction option, which led OPM to conclude that the appellant had received an overpayment of $8,510.82 for the period from January 6, 1991, through August 30, 2002.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued that no overpayment existed because her life insurance premiums should not have commenced until September 2002, when her life insurance coverage resumed. She asserted that insurance premiums should not be deducted from annuity benefits covering the period from February 5, 1991, to September 2002, during which she had no life insurance coverage. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In its reconsideration decision, OPM affirmed its initial decision.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The appellant has the burden of establishing Board jurisdiction over her appeal by preponderant evidence. As set forth below, the Board lacks jurisdiction to address the existence and amount of the overpayment. However, we have jurisdiction over the appellant's request for waiver of the overpayment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 68, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2001), the Board held that it does not have jurisdiction over overpayment cases where the overpayment resulted from a change in the terms of the appellant's life insurance coverage and premiums therefor, rather than anything related to the computation of the appellant's retirement annuity. The Board explained that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d), an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United States under this subchapter may be appealed to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.110. [t]his subchapter of Chapter 83, Retirement, refers to subchapter III, the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), which is comprised of numerous sections addressing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, different types of retirement, different types of annuities, and payment of benefits. <span class="Italic">Campbell,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 68, &#x00B6; 9<span class="Italic"></span> (<span class="Italic">citing</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8336-8338, 8341-8344, and 8345). Such benefits are paid from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. <span class="Italic">Id. (citing</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8348). On the other hand, life insurance falls under Chapter 87 of Title 5, and benefits under this chapter are paid from the Employees Life Insurance Fund. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (<span class="Italic">citing</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8714).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant appeal involves an annuity under FERS, rather than CSRS. As pointed out in<span class="Italic"> Richards v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 291, &#x00B6; 6 (2004), however, 5 U.S.C. 8461(e)(1) authorizes Board appeals from final decisions under Chapter 84 of Title 5 (FERS) in the same manner as 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1) authorizes Board appeals from final decisions under Chapter 83 of Title 5 (CSRS). Thus, the Board is also deprived of jurisdiction over overpayment cases where the overpayment resulted from a change in the terms of the appellant's life insurance coverage and premiums therefor when the appellant is covered by FERS. <span class="Italic">See Richards,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 291, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM assessed the appellant here, as it did in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, an overpayment of funds disbursed to her as an annuitant based upon the fact that OPM failed to withhold the proper amount of life insurance premiums. Generally, one who is assessed an overpayment has a right to appeal OPM's decision to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Campbell,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 68, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Tatum v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 7 (1999). Nevertheless, the Board in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> found that the overpayment resulted, not from anything related to the computation of the appellant's retirement annuity, but rather from a change in the terms of his life insurance coverage and premiums therefor, as interpreted by OPM, an administrative action not covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d). <span class="Italic">Campbell,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 68, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">cf. Mitchell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 25 M.S.P.R. 186, 189 (1984) (the Board has no jurisdiction to review whether OPM correctly determined that an annuity overpayment occurred when the overpayment involved a change in the appellant's health insurance coverage and premiums therefor).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board further found that its jurisdiction to review OPM overpayment determinations extends only to determinations that debts are owed to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 68, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1301, 831.1302. No such determination was made in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, and the Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the record in this case indicates that the overpayment resulted from a change in the appellant's life insurance coverage and not from anything related to the computation of her retirement annuity. Therefore, the Board lacks jurisdiction over issues regarding the existence and amount of the overpayment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's waiver request, the Board has held that it has jurisdiction to review OPM's decisions on waiver requests even where the overpayment allegedly resulted from errors in calculating or deducting life insurance benefits. <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 12 (2004). Thus, the fact that the Board may not review OPM's determination concerning the alleged overpayment in this matter does not preclude the Board from reviewing the appellant's waiver request. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recovery of an overpayment may be waived if the individual is without fault, and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8470(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.301. When recovery of an overpayment would cause financial hardship, it is against equity and good conscience. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.303(a); <span class="Italic">see James v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 211, 217 (1996). Nonetheless, when an individual is without fault in causing the overpayment, but accepts a payment she knows to be erroneous, she is expected to set aside the overpayment pending OPM's recoupment. <span class="Italic">James,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. at 217. Recovery by OPM in such circumstances is not against equity and good conscience, even if financial hardship results. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge correctly determined that OPM had expressly informed the appellant that an overpayment would be created and the amount of that overpayment when it gave her the opportunity to elect the amount of life insurance she wanted. The appellant elected the no reduction option knowing that it would create an overpayment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> She cannot be said to be without fault and is therefore not entitled to waiver of the overpayment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An annuitant who is ineligible for waiver may nevertheless be entitled to an adjustment in the recovery schedule if she shows that it would cause her financial hardship to make payment at the rate scheduled. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.301. Pursuant to OPM's regulations, financial hardship may exist where the annuitant needs substantially all of her income and liquid assets to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.304. In determining whether living expenses are ordinary and necessary, the Board applies a reasonable person test, regardless of the individual's accustomed standard of living. <span class="Italic">Gulan v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 16, &#x00B6; 12 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant never established that recovery would cause her financial hardship. Instead, she indicated that she did not know whether financial hardship would result, but that she believed it possibly could. She never submitted a Financial Resources Questionnaire or other evidence indicating that she needs substantially all of her income and liquid assets to meet her current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities. Accordingly, an adjustment to the recovery schedule is unwarranted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed the Board, <span class="Italic">Miller v. OPM</span>, 449 F.3d 1374, 1377-81 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (Judge Dyk dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The jurisdiction of the Merit Systems Protection Board is confined to those matters assigned to it by statute, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Meeker v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 319 F.3d 1368, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, 153 F.3d 1348, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 1998); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a). The Board has jurisdiction over appeals arising from OPM's administration of the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act ("FERSA"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8401-79, but it does not have jurisdiction over appeals arising from OPM's administration of the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Act ("FEGLIA"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8701-16. The jurisdictional provision that governs review of disputes concerning annuity payments made under FERSA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1), provides that, subject to an exception not applicable here, "an administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United States under the provisions of [FERSA] administered by [OPM] may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board." The jurisdictional provision that governs review of disputes concerning FEGLIA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8715, provides that "[t]he district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the United States Court of Federal Claims, of a civil action or claim against the United States founded on [FEGLIA]." The question in this case is whether Ms. Miller's claim may be characterized as a challenge to an order affecting her rights under FERSA, as she contends, or whether it should be characterized as a claim founded on FEGLIA, as the Board held and as the Board and the United States argue in this appeal. We conclude that the dispute is properly characterized as one founded on FEGLIA, and that jurisdiction to review the overpayment determination lay in the district court or the Court of Federal Claims, not in the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dispute on the merits in this case is whether Ms. Miller should be required to make premium payments for the period 1991 to 2002, during which she was not receiving a retirement annuity but for which she was later awarded retroactive annuity payments. OPM's decision that she is required to make those premium payments was based on a construction of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8707(b)--a provision outside of the FERS laws--as Ms. Miller acknowledges. Ms. Miller's sole quarrel with OPM is that she disagrees with its assertion that the provisions of FEGLIA require it to deduct retroactive payments from her retirement annuity. She supports her <span id="Page_4435"></span>arguments on the merits with references to various provisions of FEGLIA and corresponding regulations. If Ms. Miller's proposed construction of FEGLIA is correct, she will not have to make the back premium payments. If OPM's construction is correct, she will. The resolution of the dispute in this case thus depends on an interpretation of FEGLIA. Put another way, Ms. Miller's claim to have her annuity payments restored to their full, non-offset amount is "founded" on FEGLIA within the meaning of FEGLIA's review provision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8715. While the mechanism for collecting the overpayment was through a reduction in Ms. Miller's annuity payments, the order requiring that reduction does not "affect [her] rights or interests" under FERS, within the meaning of the FERS review provision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1). That is because the reduction in her annuity payments was merely the mechanism for recovering funds that OPM determined Ms. Miller owed under FEGLIA; the reduction was not based on any decision regarding a substantive right or interest under FERS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has consistently held that, when OPM seeks to offset an employee's salary or retirement benefits to collect a debt, the Board does not have jurisdiction over the merits of the underlying dispute that gave rise to the debt. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ramirez v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 211, 213 (2000); <span class="Italic">Lary v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 291, 298-99 (1994), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds, King v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., <a href="https://openjurist.org/105/f3d/635/king-v-merit-systems-protection-board">105 F.3d 635</a> (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Malone v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 52 M.S.P.R. 655, 657 (1992); <span class="Italic">Lashley v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 360, 365 (1990). In <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 68 (2001), a case analogous to this one, an annuitant's decision to change his life insurance coverage resulted in an overpayment of his CSRS annuity, which OPM recovered by a reduction in his annuity payments. The annuitant argued, as Ms. Miller argues here, that OPM's retroactive assessment of premiums "would be collecting payments for coverage [he] did not have." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 70. The Board dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction because "the overpayment resulted, not from anything related to the computation of the appellant's retirement annuity, but rather from a change in the terms of his life insurance coverage and premiums therefor, as interpreted by OPM, an administrative action not covered by [the CSRS statutes]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 71. Similarly here, Ms. Miller's overpayment is due to OPM's assessment of her rights and responsibilities under the FEGLIA statutes, not the FERS statutes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we are not bound by these decisions of the Board, they are consistent with our decision in <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 301 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2002). In that case, we held that an annuitant's challenge to OPM's refusal to permit him to purchase life insurance arose under FEGLIA, and was not within the Board's jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of OPM in administering the federal retirement systems. The underlying decision of OPM in this case is similar to the underlying decision in <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>: OPM has decided that Ms. Miller is entitled to purchase full life insurance coverage, but in order to do so she must pay the back premiums to 1991. That decision, like the decision in <span class="Italic">Lewis,</span> is a decision as to the scope of Ms. Miller's legal rights under FEGLIA, even though, as in <span class="Italic">Lewis,</span> OPM would collect the additional premiums, if they are ultimately determined to be due, by reducing the amount of Ms. Miller's annuity payments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to the Board's approach, Ms. Miller argues that any reduction in a retiree's FERS annuity payments "affect[s] ...the rights or interests" of the annuitant under FERSA, and that the merits of the dispute that led to the reduction are therefore reviewable by the Board. That theory, however, would give the Board very broad authority over a wide variety of substantive claims simply because of the mechanism used to collect the obligations stemming from those claims. We do not think that is what Congress intended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The approach that the Board has taken in such cases makes more sense of the statutory scheme. The reduction in Ms. Miller's annuity payments was merely one of several methods OPM could have used to recover the claimed back insurance premiums. Because recovering an overpayment by an offset against annuity payments, as in this case, is both more efficient and often less burdensome than other means of collection, OPM often employs such offset mechanisms to collect annuitants' debts. It would be curious to attribute to Congress the intention to direct review of a decision pertaining to the underlying obligation to different forums depending solely on the method used to collect the obligation. As the Board points out in its brief, if 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1) were interpreted to give the Board jurisdiction in every case in which an annuity payment is reduced in order to recover an asserted debt owed by the annuitant, the Board would assume the task of deciding the merits of a variety of disputes in different substantive areas, such as student loan obligations and tax law, that are far afield from the Board's expertise and are not subjects that Congress could plausibly have intended to assign to the Board for adjudication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The flaw in Ms. Miller's argument that any administrative offset that reduces a retiree's annuity falls within the Board's jurisdiction under section 8461(e)(1) is well illustrated by an examination of the administrative offset provisions of the Debt Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3716. In that Act, Congress authorized federal agencies (and even state instrumentalities under certain conditions) to collect a wide variety of claims by administrative offset. The scheme envisioned under the Act is for the collecting agency to provide a review mechanism through which to address the substance of the claim. If the claim is upheld, the agency may seek to collect it through an administrative offset, including an offset against federal annuity payments. 31 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 901.3(d). In such cases, the Office of Personnel Management is responsible for ensuring that the annuitant has had the proper due process procedures within the claimant agency, <span class="Italic">see</span> 31 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 901.3(b)(4); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1803, and the failure to comply with those procedures can be appealed to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Ramirez,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. at 214. But the Board has held that it does not have the authority to address the merits of the underlying claims, which can arise from an infinite variety of obligations that employees can incur during the course of their employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 193, 196-97 (2004) (no review of the merits of an administrative offset sought by the Office of Worker Compensation Programs); <span class="Italic">Cebzanov v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 562, 566 (2004) (no review of the merits of an administrative offset sought by Internal Revenue Service). Moreover, the government-wide regulations that governed Debt Collection Act offsets against employees' retirement funds, until the regulations were recently revised, provided that the setoff procedures did not "authorize the OPM or the MSPB to review the merits of the requesting agency's determination with respect to the amount and validity of the claim." 4 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 102.4 (2000); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1806(d)(3)(1) (in arranging setoffs of debts against employee retirement funds, OPM has no authority to review the merits of the claim against the employee).Thus, we think it clear that under the Debt Collection Act Congress envisioned that the substantive claims giving rise to the administrative offset would be adjudicated in the respective agencies, not before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The same principle applies to the offset at issue in this case. As in the case of setoffs authorized by the Debt Collection Act, any reduction in the amount of a former employee's annuity payments can in a broad sense be said to affect the former employee's interests under FERSA, since an employee has an "interest" in receiving an annuity. The operation of the Debt Collection Act makes clear, however, that Congress did not intend for the term "administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual...under [FERSA] " in section 8461(e)(1) to encompass any order that would have the effect of reducing the amount of an annuity, either on one occasion or over a period of time. Instead, we agree with the Board that the reference to "rights or interests" in section 8461(e)(1) limits the Board to the adjudication of substantive claims created by FERSA. Contrary to Ms. Miller's contention, section 8461(e)(1) does not extend the Board's jurisdiction to encompass review of "all attempts to recover payments from a retiree's annuity benefits--regardless of the reason for the recovery or the source of the overpayment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Miller notes that decisions whether to invoke equitable waiver of the government's right to recover over payments, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8470(b) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.301, are always reviewable by the Board, even though the underlying obligation may not be related to a right or obligation created by FERSA. <span class="Italic">See Mitchell v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 566 (2004). She argues that it would be highly inefficient to have questions relating to the substantive obligation reviewed in the Court of Federal Claims or in a district court, but to have the issue of the waiver of overpayments reviewed by the Merit Systems Protection Board, since it is possible that both claims will arise in connection with a single overpayment dispute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The possibility that a different regime would be more efficient does not justify our rejection of the system of review that Congress put into place, if we are persuaded that Congress has spoken clearly on the matter, as we are in this case. In any event, the specific concern raised by Ms. Miller is not implicated in this case, as the Board has already determined that OPM did not err by declining to waive the reimbursement requirement, and Ms. Miller has not sought further review of that issue. Therefore, we need not decide whether, in a case in which an annuitant challenges the merits of OPM's decision to offset her annuity to collect a debt external to her rights under the statutes creating the annuity and also seeks review of OPM's decision not to waive the debt, the annuitant would have to bring those claims in two different forums or whether the court addressing the overpayment decision could address the waiver issue as a matter of supplemental or pendent jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1367; <span class="Italic">Trek Leasing, Inc. v. United States,</span> 62 Fed. Cl. 673 (2004). If supplemental or pendent jurisdiction is available in such cases, the burden of requiring parties to litigate the two issues in different forums would, of course, be eliminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, Ms. Miller's challenge to the merits of the government's overpayment claim is not within the scope of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1), but falls instead under section 8715, which requires that her claim be brought either in a federal district court or in the Court of Federal Claims. We therefore affirm the Board's decision dismissing her claim that OPM erred in assessing an overpayment against her.</p>

In December of 1983, she was given another temporary appointment. Subsequently, on February 16, 1984, the Navy changed her employment status to a career-conditional appointment. Upon this appointment, Ms. Lary became qualified for retirement benefits. In that regard, the Navy designated her as being covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). She worked under that designation until she resigned from federal employment on August 16, 1993.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Lary's classification as a CSRS employee for the entire term of her employment was erroneous, however. On June 6, 1986, Congress enacted the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986, Pub.L. No. 99-335, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. (100 Stat.) 514 (FERSA) (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8401-8479 (1988)). In so doing, it created the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) as an alternative to the retirement benefits program existing under CSRS. <span class="Italic">Killip v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 991 F.2d 1564, 1565 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Under FERSA, a federal employee is covered by FERS unless a specific statutory exclusion from FERS applies. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331, note (1988). Since none of the exclusions applied to Ms. Lary, after FERSA was enacted, she should have been classified under a CSRS interim system as an interim employee and then automatically converted to FERS coverage when FERS became effective on January 1, 1987.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;CSRS interim employees included persons who were first employed in civilian service as career employees after December 31, 1983, and who were slated to become subject to the new retirement system (FERS) when it became effective because no exclusions applied to them. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331, note. Ms. Lary was such an employee. Unlike other CSRS employees, interim employees were required to pay OASDI taxes, as explained <span class="Italic">infra</span>. In addition, interim employees had credit for service performed after December 31, 1983, and before the earlier of the effective date of FERS or January 1, 1987, transferred to FERS. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331, note</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Navy's incorrect designation of Ms. Lary's employment status after FERSA was enacted led to a corresponding error in the handling of withholdings from her pay. Under CSRS, each pay period the employing agency deducts 7% of the employee's pay, and the entire amount deducted is credited to the Fund as a retirement contribution. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(a) (Supp. V 1993). By contrast, under FERS, while the same 7% is deducted from the employee's pay, about 5.7 to 6.2% of the amount withheld is remitted to SSA in payment of OASDI taxes. 26 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3101(a), 3102(a) (1988). The remaining 0.8 to 1.3% represents a FERS retirement contribution that is deposited into the Fund. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8422(a)(2) (1988). With differences not relevant for this appeal, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331, note, CSRS interim employees were treated essentially the same as FERS employees for withholding purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both CSRS and FERS are administered by OPM. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8347(a), 8461(b) (1988). At the time of Ms. Lary's resignation, the Navy submitted to OPM a form titled "Individual Retirement Record" indicating that retirement deductions withheld from her pay under CSRS and credited to the Fund totaled $14,113.98.[6] On August 25, 1993, Ms. Lary applied to OPM for a lump-sum refund of her Fund contributions.[7] Upon review of the pertinent records, however, OPM discovered Ms. Lary's erroneous classification as a CSRS employee and directed the Navy to correct her records to reflect her correct classification and the required withholdings under FERS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;An agency makes periodic payments to the Fund for all of its employees together rather than on an individual basis. This is accomplished by a payment to the United States Treasury which then is credited to the Fund. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(a)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(a) (1988 &#x0026; Supp. V 1993), if certain requirements are met, an employee separated from service is entitled to a lump-sum refund of his or her retirement contributions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Navy made the necessary corrections and submitted to OPM a "Notice of Correction of Individual Retirement Record" to correct Ms. Lary's record regarding service and retirement deductions. The Navy also submitted another form, titled "Individual Retirement Record," certifying that the proper retirement deductions withheld under FERS and credited to the Fund totaled $1,966.74.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letters dated October 26 and December 3, 1993, OPM informed Ms. Lary that the Navy had erred in designating her employment status and that OASDI deductions should have been made to SSA. OPM further informed Ms. Lary that she should fill out the appropriate FERS form to receive her FERS lump-sum refund of $1,966.74. Ms. Lary responded by requesting that OPM issue a reconsideration decision in connection with her request for a refund of retirement contributions under CSRS so that she could file an appeal with the Board. OPM declined to issue such a decision, however, informing Ms. Lary that because the Navy already had sent OPM forms correcting her account, any further questions should be referred to the Navy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In due course, the Navy sent Ms. Lary a letter in which it explained her erroneous classification as a CSRS employee and the Navy's process for correcting her records to reflect the correct withholdings under FERS. The Navy also enclosed an application for refund of her FERS retirement contributions. Thereafter, Ms. Lary filed an appeal with the Board challenging OPM's action denying her $12,147.24 in retirement contributions. This sum represented the difference between the $14,113.98 erroneously credited to the Fund under CSRS and the lump-sum refund of $1,966.74 to which OPM determined she was entitled under FERS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 1, 1994, an administrative judge of the Board concluded that the reallocation of Ms. Lary's payroll deductions from CSRS to FERS and the reduction of her lump-sum refund to reflect the payment of OASDI taxes constituted the collection of a debt by administrative offset. Accordingly, he determined, regulations implementing the DCA, including the Federal Claims Collection Standards (Standards), 4 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101-105 (1993), and OPM's applicable regulations, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1801-.1808 (1993) for CSRS and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 845.401-.408 (1993) for FERS, should have been followed. The AJ found that, contrary to 4 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101.1, 101.2, 102.4 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1804(b), OPM failed to ensure that the Navy afforded Ms. Lary what he termed "due process" prior to effecting the administrative offset.[8] The AJ ordered OPM to cancel the offsetting of OASDI taxes against Ms. Lary's lump-sum refund and to ensure that DCA procedures were followed before any offset took place.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Generally, the cited regulations provide that an agency must follow specific requirements before collecting debts by administratively offsetting money due and payable to a debtor from the Fund.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM filed a petition for review pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.114-.115 (1993). Although the Board denied the petition, it reopened the case <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.116-.117 (1993). <span class="Italic">Lary v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 291, 294 (1994). In its decision, the Board held that the portion of the erroneous CSRS contribution that was equal to the Fund contribution component of FERS ($1,966.74) was properly credited to the Fund even though it had been incorrectly treated as a CSRS rather than a FERS contribution. Therefore, the re-designation of the money to the proper retirement account was not the collection of a debt, but rather was merely an accounting adjustment not subject to administrative offset procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also held, however, that the portion of the erroneous CSRS <span id="Page_4437"></span>contribution that should have been sent to SSA to pay OASDI taxes under FERS (i.e. $12,147.24) was due and payable to Ms. Lary from the Fund. Consequently, the Board reasoned, DCA procedures should have been followed before OPM denied Ms. Lary's request for a lump-sum payment of what she contended were retirement contributions. The Board directed OPM to recredit Ms. Lary's retirement account with the money that OPM argued was due on account of OASDI taxes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM then sought reconsideration from the Board pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(d) (1988). In response, the Board issued its final decision on July 13, 1995, in which it denied OPM's motion for reconsideration, re-opened the case <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> to consider new arguments by OPM, and affirmed its earlier decision. The Board again held that Ms. Lary was entitled to the money credited to the Fund that should have been sent to SSA to satisfy OASDI taxes under FERS, unless the Navy complied with the DCA's administrative offset procedures. This appeal by OPM followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The issue before us is one of statutory interpretation: whether OPM and the Navy were required to follow DCA procedures for administrative offsets before using the $12,147.24 that was erroneously credited to Ms. Lary's retirement account under CSRS to satisfy OASDI taxes due and owing under FERS. For the reasons which follow we hold that the DCA does not apply in this case. Accordingly, OPM and the Navy were not required to follow DCA procedures in satisfying the obligation to pay OASDI taxes that arose from Ms. Lary's employment with the Navy. Thus, we reverse the decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The DCA was the result of "increasing concern...expressed in Congress and elsewhere over the increasing backlog of unpaid debts owed the federal government." S. Rep. No. 97-378, at 2 (1982), reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3377, 3378. The DCA was promulgated to facilitate improved debt collection procedures in the government. The statute provides various mechanisms to promote improved debt collection that previously were not available to the government, including reporting delinquent debtors to credit bureaus, obtaining addresses of delinquent debtors from the Internal Revenue Service, and utilizing private collection agencies for collection services. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 97-378, at 1-2, 1982 U.S.S.C.A.N. at 3377-78. One method identified in the DCA for collecting debts owed by federal employees to the government--and the one at issue in this case--is administrative offset.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Administrative offset is defined in 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3701(a)(1) (1988) as "withholding money payable by the United States Government to, or held by the Government for, a person to satisfy a debt the person owes the Government." The term "debt" is defined by the Standards as "an amount of money or property which has been determined by an appropriate agency official to be owed to the United States from any person...." 4 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 101.2 (1993). OPM's regulations implementing the DCA define "debt" as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an amount owed to the United States on account of loans insured or guaranteed by the United States, and other amounts due the United States from fees, duties, leases, rents, royalties, services, sales of real or personal property, overpayments, fines, penalties, damages, interests, taxes, forfeitures, etc.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1803.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to collecting a debt by administrative offset, an agency must follow the steps set forth in 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3716(a) (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;After trying to collect a claim from a person under section 3711(a) [9] of this title, the head of an executive or legislative agency may collect the claim by administrative offset.

<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;an opportunity for review within the agency of the decision of the agency related to the claim; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;an opportunity to make a written agreement with the head of the agency to repay the amount of the claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3711(a) (1988) provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The head of an executive or legislative agency--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;shall try to collect a claim of the United States Government for money or property arising out of the activities of, or referred to, the agency;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;may compromise a claim of the Government of not more than $100,000 (excluding interest) or such higher amount as the Attorney General may from time to time prescribe that has not been referred to another executive or legislative agency for further collection action; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;may suspend or end collection action on a claim referred to in clause (2) of this subsection when it appears that no person liable on the claim has the present or prospective ability to pay a significant amount of the claim or the cost of collecting the claim is likely to be more than the amount recovered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of section 3716, the term "claim" is defined as including "amounts owing on account of loans insured or guaranteed by the Government and other amounts due the Government." 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3701(b) (1988).[10] OPM's regulations define "debtor" as "a person who owes a debt, including an employee, former employee, Member, former Member, or the survivor of one of these individuals." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1803 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;The Standards state that "claim" is interchangeable with "debt" and therefore has the same definition as debt. <span class="Italic">See</span> 4 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 101.2</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Standards specify the procedures to be followed when an agency seeks to collect a debt by administrative offset against amounts payable from the Fund. Section 102.4 of the Standards provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Unless otherwise prohibited by law, agencies may request that moneys which are due and payable to a debtor from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund be administratively offset in reasonable amounts in order to collect in one full payment or a minimal number of payments debts owed to the United States by the debtor. Such requests shall be made to the appropriate officials of the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with such regulations as may be prescribed by the Director of that Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;When making a request for administrative offset under paragraph (a) of this section, an agency shall include a written certification that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;The debtor owes the United States a debt, including the amount of the debt;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;The requesting agency has complied with the applicable statutes, regulations, and procedures of the Office of Personnel Management; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;The requesting agency has complied with the requirements of &#x00A7; 102.3[11] of this part, including any required hearing or review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 102.4 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;Section 102.3 requires, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that agencies establish procedures for providing a debtor appropriate procedural rights before collecting a debt by administrative offset. Such procedures must include certain stated requirements, which track those found in 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3716(a)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The foregoing makes it clear that, in order for the DCA to be applicable in a given situation, the government must have a "claim" against a "debtor" as a result of a "debt" owed the United States. In this case, that requirement is not met. To begin with, as indicated by the definition in the Standards (4 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 101.2) and in OPM's regulation (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1803), a debt generally requires some sum of money or other obligation owed by a person to a creditor. <span class="Italic">See Allied Signal, Inc. v. United States,</span> 941 F.2d 1194, 1197 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Ms. Lary, however, owes no money to the United States. The reason is that, during the relevant period of time, the total correct amount of money was withheld from her pay. As noted above, under the CSRS, FERS, and CSRS interim systems, the employing agency withheld a total of seven percent of an employee's pay. That total amount was withheld from Ms. Lary's pay. However, as a result of the Navy's error in not converting Ms. Lary to FERS coverage, there was an incorrect allocation of the withheld money within the government. In short, the error in this case lay in allocation rather than in withholding. Even under a correct classification (FERS), the same seven percent would have been withheld from Ms. Lary's pay. Thus, because there is no conceivable way in which Ms. Lary could be said to owe money to the United States, she is not a "debtor" against whom the government has a "claim."[12]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3102(a) (1988), an employer is responsible for withholding OASDI taxes from an employee's pay. Once such money is withheld, the amount withheld is "credited to the employee regardless of whether [it] is paid by the employer, so that the IRS has recourse only against the employer for [its] payment." <span class="Italic">Slodov v. United States,</span> 436 U.S. 238, 243, 98 S. Ct. 1778, 1783, 56 L. Ed.2d 251 (1978). Thus, it is the employer, not the employee (in this case, Ms. Lary), who is liable for the taxes. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, as seen above, the DCA defines "administrative offset" as "withholding money payable by the United States Government to, or held by the Government for, a person to satisfy a debt the person owes the Government." 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3701(a)(1). By the same token, under the Standards, the money an agency wishes to collect from the Fund by administrative offset must be "due and payable to [the] debtor" from the Fund. 4 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 102.4. OPM argues that to be "payable"--and thus <span id="Page_4438"></span>subject to administrative offset procedures under the DCA--the money at issue must have been properly credited to the Fund, so that it can be said that Ms. Lary is entitled to it. We agree. The statute and regulations compel the conclusion that a prerequisite to applying the administrative offset procedures of the DCA is that the "debtor" have a valid interest in the moneys being offset. It is undisputed that Ms. Lary never was entitled to the money equal to OASDI taxes that was erroneously credited to the Fund. Therefore, she plainly did not have a valid interest in the money. Thus, the money credited to the Fund equal to the OASDI taxes that should have been paid to SSA was neither "payable" by the government to Ms. Lary nor "due and payable" to Ms. Lary from the Fund.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, steps that must be followed before collecting a debt by administrative offset that are specified in the DCA could not be implemented in this case. For one thing, as seen above, the term "claim" appears in all of the steps set forth in 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3716(a). The present case, however, involves no "claim." Contrary to the definition of "claim" in 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3701(b), as far as Ms. Lary is concerned, there are no "amounts owing on account of loans insured or guaranteed by the Government," and there are no "other amounts due the Government" from Ms. Lary. In addition, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3716(a)(4), a debtor must be given "an opportunity to make a written agreement with the head of the agency to repay the amount of the claim." Since Ms. Lary is not indebted to the government, there is no government "claim" that could be the subject of the repayment agreement contemplated by the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, our conclusion that the DCA does not apply in this case also is supported by legislative history. The legislative history states that offset procedures are designed to reach general debts owed the government, such as for student or other government loans, erroneous payments to employees, overpayment of benefits such as education benefits, and indebtedness arising from salary or other allowances. S. Rep. No. 97-378, at 11, 23 (1982), reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3377, 3387, 3399; <span class="Italic">see also</span> S. Rep. No. 97-287, at 15 (1981), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3413, 3426. Plainly, such indebtedness does not exist in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the Board argues that the Navy made an "overpayment" of benefits to the Fund on behalf of Ms. Lary and that this overpayment fits the definition of "debt" under the pertinent regulations. The Board points out that the definition of "debt" in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1803 (OPM's regulations) includes amounts owed the United States based on, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "overpayments." From this, the Board contends that an overcredit to the Fund is "an amount of money" determined "to be owed the United States" and therefore is a "debt" under 4 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 101.2(a) (the Standards). Thus, the Board argues, administrative offset procedures must be followed before the amount erroneously credited to the Fund can be withheld from Ms. Lary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The contention is without merit. Quite simply, what happened here was that an amount of money equal to OASDI taxes that were due and owing was credited to the Fund as the result of the Navy's incorrect classification of Ms. Lary as a CSRS employee. There was no miscalculation of benefits to which Ms. Lary was otherwise entitled, which would constitute an "overpayment" to her. Furthermore, the Board's position fails to address both the requirement of 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3701(a)(1) that the money be "payable" to the debtor and the language of 4 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 102.4 which states that the money be "due and payable" to the debtor from the Fund. As discussed above, these sections require that the debtor be entitled to the money that is to be administratively offset. No such entitlement exists in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the DCA does not apply to Ms. Lary's situation. No one disputes the fact that Ms. Lary should have been classified as a FERS employee. Therefore, she is not entitled to money erroneously credited to the Fund as a retirement contribution under CSRS that should have been remitted to SSA in payment of OASDI taxes under FERS. Withholding this money from Ms. Lary's lump-sum refund does not represent the collection of a debt by the government.[13]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;To the extent that Ms. Lary believes her employer withheld an incorrect amount for OASDI taxes, that is a matter that should be pursued with the Navy. <span class="Italic">See</span> 26 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 601.103(c), 601.106 (1993).</p>
