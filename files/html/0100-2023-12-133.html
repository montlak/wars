<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-132"><span class="space">f.</span> Issue of Jurisdiction; Exhaustion of Remedies</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">When the Board started issuing decisions on PFRs in 2022 after a hiatus of five years when it lacked a quorum, a series of nonprecedential decisions, often involving IRA cases, demonstrated a willingness of the Board to receive new evidence and new arguments at the PFR level if the evidence and arguments implicated jurisdiction. Since jurisdiction in IRA cases (and others, e.g., constructive adverse actions, enforcement of last chance agreements, allegations of discrimination) depends on well-pleaded facts, the result was that the Board was providing a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of everything presented in the record, both to the AJ below and to the Board above. The decisions that follow demonstrate the more recent, relaxed approach, to evaluation of new evidence on jurisdictional issues at the PFR level, and the more restrictive approach often applied before 2022.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ does not provide the appellant with sufficient notice of a required burden of proof on jurisdiction before the issuance of an initial decision, the Board will consider newly-raised evidence on the basis that it was previously unavailable. <span class="Italic">Boughton v. USDA</span>, 94 MSPR 347, 350 &#x00B6; 6 (2003); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dodson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 111 MSPR 504, 507 n.2, 2009 MSPB 113 (2009) (AJ did not adequately explain to the appellant what was required to show that she was an "employee" with appeal rights based on prior service when she appealed her probationary termination; the Board considered evidence of her prior appointment submitted with the PFR); <span class="Italic">Turner v. USPS</span>, 91 MSPR 669 (2001) (Table) (considering new evidence on a jurisdictional issue of derivative veterans preference eligibility submitted by a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant who was not adequately informed by the AJ of information needed to establish Board jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Koury v. DOD</span>, 84 MSPR 219, 226-27 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (1999) (rather than remand for the development of a jurisdictional issue, where an appellant represented by counsel at the PFR level demonstrates awareness of and addresses jurisdictional issues in the PFR, the Board considered new evidence and argument submitted with the PFR as to IRA jurisdictional issues that were not specifically brought to the attention of the appellant by either the AJ's show cause order or the agency's motion to dismiss); <span class="Italic">Orr v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 83 MSPR 117, 121-22 &#x00B6; 7 (1999) (Board evaluated new arguments on a PFR of dismissal of an IRA claim when the agency's motion to dismiss and the AJ's acknowledgment (or show cause) order did not inform the appellant of jurisdiction elements he had to address, but the AJ's initial decision discussed jurisdictional requirements, providing the appellant an opportunity to meet his jurisdictional burden on the PFR); <span class="Italic">McCray v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 80 MSPR 154, 158 &#x00B6; 7 (1998) (considering evidence and an argument first submitted with a PFR if the appellant was not notified of what was required to establish Board jurisdiction until the issuance of an initial decision); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. FEC</span>, 33 MSPR 254, 255 (1987) (Board need not consider the appellant's contention that she was a preference eligible after she failed to raise the issue in response to the AJ's jurisdictional order); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Fleming v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 97 MSPR 341, 344 &#x00B6; 9 (2004) ("[W]here, as here, the administrative judge did not provide the appellant with sufficient notice that she must address an issue, or of the <span id="Page_1719"></span>required burden of proof, the Board will consider such newly-raised evidence and arguments on the basis that they were previously unavailable."); <span class="Italic">cf. Moncada v. Exec. Office of the President</span>, 2022 MSPB 25, n.2 (2022) (when the agency first challenged jurisdiction over the agency on PFR, evidence could be submitted by appellant in response to the jurisdictional challenge); <span class="Italic">Campo v. Dept. of Army</span>, 93 MSPR 1, 5-6 &#x00B6; 12 (2002) (information brought out during PFR that pertained to jurisdiction over an IRA appeal was to be considered by the AJ when the case was remanded for other reasons).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An early decision, <span class="Italic">Hurst v. GSA</span>, 2 MSPR 497, 499, 3 MSPB 21 (1980), not addressing the adequacy of any show cause or similar order from the AJ, stated that the jurisdictional basis for a probationer's appeal cannot be raised for the first time in a PFR as new evidence; it must first be placed before the AJ. <span class="Italic">But cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Goodwin v.

Under the established rules of adversary litigation, Mrs. DuBoise won this particular contest. There are no compelling equities in the Government's favor that demand we make an exception here; indeed, the equities are all on the other side. Because we cannot uphold a decision of the Board that is "unsupported by substantial evidence," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c), I would award Mrs. DuBoise the survivor benefit to which the rule of law entitles her. I respectfully dissent from the majority's remand of the case to the Board to see if the Government can do better next time.</p>
