<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-53"><span class="space">n.</span> Lack of Mutual Assent</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Although "[a]n agreement is not rendered unlawful or unenforceable...merely because some of its terms may be ambiguous," <span class="Italic">Coleman v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3089), the agreement may be set aside for want mutual assent. In <span class="Italic">Gullette v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 569, 574-77 (1996), a material term in a settlement involved establishing a seniority date for the appellant. The language was ambiguous. Parol evidence demonstrated that the parties did not agree on the interpretation of the ambiguous language. The agreement was set aside as a result of the parties' differences of interpretation, that is, their lack of mutual assent to the agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the seniority term was reasonably susceptible of either party's interpretation, the administrative judge properly considered parol evidence of the party's intentions. We disagree with the administrative judge's conclusion, however, that the evidence tended to show that both parties either did or should have understood the seniority term as requiring the appellant to begin a new period of seniority in 1994. Both the agency's representative and Miller testified that they understood the language as requiring the appellant to begin a new period of seniority upon her return to the Clerk Craft, but the appellant testified that she understood the agreement as providing her with seniority back to the date she first entered the Clerk Craft. Both representatives also testified that they could not have negotiated an agreement providing the appellant with seniority back to 1971 because such a term would be in conflict with the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant, her former representative, and the agency's representative all testified as to their own understanding of the seniority term, we find no evidence establishing that anyone involved in the negotiation or execution of the settlement agreement discussed his or her understanding of the seniority term, or any limitations imposed by the collective bargaining agreement on such a term, with anyone else. Miller testified that he discussed the terms of the settlement agreement with the appellant before he transmitted it to the agency for its approval, but he did not testify that he discussed his understanding of the seniority term with the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find no basis for a conclusion that the appellant knew or should have known that both her representative's and the agency representative's understanding of the seniority term was different from her own. Given this fact, plus our finding that either interpretation is reasonable, we conclude that the appellant believed that the seniority term gave her seniority back to 1971, while her representative and the agency's representative believed that it required the appellant to begin a new period of seniority in 1994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the parties give substantially different meanings to the words of a contract, and neither party knew or had reason to know what the other meant or understood by the words, there is no reason for choosing one interpretation rather than the other. 3 Arthur L. Corbin, <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span>, &#x00A7; 538 at 64-65 (1960); Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 20, 201 (1979). In such a case, no party has reason to rely on the understanding of the other party. There is no question of one party materially changing its position in reliance on a different meaning of a term in the contract. <span class="Italic">See</span> Corbin, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, &#x00A7; 538 at 63 (the testimony of a party as to his own meaning becomes immaterial as soon as it is established that he knew or had reason to know that the other party had a different meaning and has materially changed his position in reliance thereon).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence shows that no one involved in the formation of this contract communicated his or her understanding of the seniority term to anyone else. In these circumstances, the agency had no reliance interest to violate. We, therefore, find that the appellant's own understanding of the contract language controls over that of her representative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have found that the parties to this agreement attached substantially different meanings to the seniority term, and that neither knew or had reason to know of the meaning attached by the other party. Accordingly, we find no basis for choosing one interpretation over the other. Corbin, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, &#x00A7; 538 at 64-65; Restatement, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 20, 201.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to Corbin, the absence of a common meaning would result in the conclusion that no contract was formed. Corbin, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, &#x00A7; 538 at 65. According to the Restatement, the absence of a common meaning would result in a "failure of mutual assent," but such a failure might extend only to the particular term, rather than to the entire agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, &#x00A7; 201(3) &#x0026; cmt. d. Case law also supports limiting a finding that no contract existed where both parties held reasonable but different views of what the contract meant to situations in which the ambiguity "went to the heart of the contract." <span class="Italic">See Consumers Ice Co. v. United States</span>, 475 F.2d 1161, 1165, 201 Ct. Cl. 116 (1973). We similarly conclude that a failure of mutual assent as to a particular term should result in the invalidation of the entire agreement only when the term in question goes to the heart of the contract. <span class="Italic">Cf. Butler v. Department of the Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 1, 4 (1993) (when a term of a settlement agreement is unconscionable or contrary to public policy, the agreement as a whole will not be invalidated unless the term in question was an "essential part of the agreed exchange").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The seniority term in the case before us is an essential part of this agreement. There is a huge difference between returning to a bargaining unit position with no seniority and returning with over twenty years seniority. True, the appellant obtained other benefits from the settlement agreement; her removal was replaced with a demotion, and she received a full-time work schedule on a particular tour of duty that had daytime work shifts and weekends off. The receipt of these benefits, however, does not adversely affect our finding that the seniority term is essential to the agreement. The difference between no seniority and over twenty years of seniority is more than significant in an organization in which many job opportunities and benefits are governed by seniority. We therefore find that the seniority term went to the heart of the settlement agreement, and that the entire agreement must be set aside.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, a finding that a settlement agreement must be set aside results in the reinstatement of the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Stipp v. Department of the Army</span>, 61 MSPR 415, 420 (1994). The Restatement provides, however, that in situations where the parties attached significantly different meanings to the words of a contract, one party can waive the misunderstanding and enforce the contract in accordance with the understanding of the other party. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, &#x00A7; 201 cmt. d. We find that it is appropriate under the circumstances of this case to give the appellant the opportunity either to reinstate the removal appeal, or to accept the settlement agreement under the agency's interpretation of the seniority term, i.e., that she was required to begin a new period of seniority in the Clerk Craft as of January 21, 1994. <span class="Italic">Cf. Murphy v. US Postal Service</span>, 54 MSPR 202, 206 (1992) (remanding the case to the regional office where it was unclear whether, in light of the agency's breach, the appellant wanted to enforce the agreement or rescind it and reinstate his appeal).</p>

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 569, 576 (1996). In an apparent effort to bolster her argument that the provision of the settlement agreement quoted above is ambiguous, the appellant fails to quote the remainder of the provision, which specifically identifies the appellant's current position as a GS-04 Medical Support Assistant at Brooke AMC's Allergy Clinic. Thus, the agreement states that the appellant occupies a specific position, at a specific location, with a specific grade. Therefore, the clear and specific terms of the agreement are unambiguous with respect to the appellant's grade at the time the agreement was executed.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Walker-King v. VA</span>, 119 MSPR 414, 419-20 &#x00B6; 12, 2013 MSPB 32 (2013) (Member Robbins dissenting), provided a factor analysis to determine the mutuality of the parties' intent--the necessary meeting of the minds--over a term that was ambiguous:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the term "physically qualified" is subject to possible differing, reasonable interpretations, remanding the petition for enforcement to the administrative judge to consider extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent is appropriate. In making this assessment, the administrative judge should determine: (1) whether the parties had differing, albeit reasonable, interpretations of the term "physically qualified"; (2) whether neither party had reason to know of the meaning of the term used by <span id="Page_4837"></span>the other party; and (3) whether the term is an essential part of the settlement. <span class="Italic">See Young</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 20. In making this assessment, the administrative judge may consider the legal definition of the term "qualified" within the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and its accompanying regulations. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 39 n.4 (parties are presumed to be aware of applicable statutes and regulations and intend to incorporate them into contracts). If the administrative judge answers "yes" to each of these questions, then the parties would not have had a meeting of the minds regarding the meaning of the term "physically qualified," and the settlement agreement could be set aside in its entirety. <span class="Italic">See Young</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 20. Should the administrative judge reach such a conclusion, the appellant would be afforded the opportunity either to (1) set aside the settlement agreement and reinstate her prior initial appeal; or (2) accept the agreement under the agency's interpretation of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although <span class="Italic">Walker-King</span> did not specifically mention mutual assent, that decision relied on <span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 609, 619 &#x00B6; 21, 2010 MSPB 92 (2010), declaring:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has held that, if there is failure of mutual assent to a particular term of the contract, and the term in question goes to the heart of the contract, then the agreement should result in the invalidation of the entire agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 577. Therefore, if the administrative judge finds that: (1) the parties had differing, but reasonable interpretations of the term "independent medical examination"; (2) neither party had reason to know of the meaning attached by the other; and (3) the term in question is an essential part of the settlement agreement, then the administrative judge should allow the appellant the opportunity to: (1) set aside the settlement agreement and reinstate her enforced leave appeal; or (2) accept the settlement agreement under the agency's interpretation of the term "independent medical examination." <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Gullette</span> 70 M.S.P.R. at 576-77 (where the parties had differing and reasonable views of the term "anniversary date" in an settlement agreement, and neither party knew or had reason to know of the meaning attached by the other, the Board gave the appellant the opportunity to reinstate her removal appeal or to accept the settlement agreement under the agency's interpretation of the term because the term in question was an essential part of the agreement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A lack of mutual assent to a provision of an agreement means the parties did not spell out the provision with sufficient precision. Each party has a materially different view of the obligations imposed by the provision. If the parties have not truly reached agreement, their settlement agreement may be set aside if the provision at issue is critical to the agreement. In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 86 MSPR 546, 556-58 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-22 (2000), an oral agreement was reached that called on the appellant to "settle her MSPB complaint." The appellant believed that the obligation was to discontinue her MSPB litigation, but the agency believed, based on the circumstances of negotiation and other provisions in the agreement, that the appellant was obliged to withdraw her EEO complaints. The Board sent the appeal back to the AJ to determine whether there was mutual assent to the agreement, that is, to determine whether the parties had actually agreed to specific obligations and, if so, what interpretation would be applied to the disputed provision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant has not proven that the settlement agreement should be set aside as involuntary, she has raised an issue concerning whether the parties mutually assented to the agreement. A settlement agreement is a contract, the interpretation of which is a question of law. In construing the terms of a written settlement agreement, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance, and parol evidence will be considered only if the written agreement is ambiguous<span class="Italic">. Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Ambiguity exists if the terms of the settlement agreement are reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation<span class="Italic">. See Birdsong v. Department of the Navy</span>, 75 MSPR 524 (1997). When the parties' intended meaning is not apparent from the face of the agreement, it is appropriate to examine extrinsic evidence of intent<span class="Italic">. See Wells v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 52 MSPR 497, 500 (1992). However, where the parties hold reasonable but different views of an ambiguous term that goes to the heart of the contract, no contract was formed due to a lack of mutual assent<span class="Italic">. See Gullette v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 MSPR 569, 576 (1996); Restatement (Second) of Contracts, &#x00A7; 20 (1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant alleges that she did not understand that the settlement agreement would preclude her from contesting the merits of the two suspensions if they were made permanent on her record again. Yet, the transcribed terms of the settlement agreement do not include language indicating that the appellant waived her right to contest the merits of these actions in the event that she should commit further misconduct that would, under the agreement, negate the agency's obligation to purge these suspensions from the appellant's OPF at the end of the 2-year period. The appellant merely agreed to "settle her MSPB complaint," and it appears that the parties held different views of the meaning of this phrase. The agency apparently interpreted this phrase as precluding the appellant from contesting the merits of the suspensions if she violated the settlement agreement and thereby relieved the agency of its obligation to expunge the record of the suspensions from the appellant's OPF. The appellant apparently believed that the agreement did not preclude her from contesting the merits of the suspensions in the event that they were to become a permanent part of her OPF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the current state of the record, we cannot say that either party's interpretation was unreasonable. Generally, a settlement agreement resolves the basic controversy surrounding the appellant's claim, and the parties cannot relitigate the merits of that claim<span class="Italic">. See Asberry v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982) (where the settlement agreement fully resolved the basic controversy surrounding the employee's discharge, the court stated that there was no case or controversy over the merits of which either the Board or the court might exercise jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Black v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 64 MSPR 279, 280 (1994). While the agency's interpretation appears reasonable, however, there is no evidence in the record that would suggest that the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant had reason to know, prior to the execution of the agreement, that the meaning that the agency attached to the phrase "settle her MSPB complaint" included waiver of her right to contest the merits of the earlier actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, prior to execution, the appellant specifically asked whether the agreement meant that the Board would not have jurisdiction over the 30-day and the 5-day suspensions in the event that these actions were to become a permanent part of her OPF. As mentioned previously, neither the administrative judge nor the agency representative responded to this question on the record. It is possible that the response the appellant received may have led her to reasonably believe that the settlement agreement did not preclude her from relitigating the merits of the suspensions in the event that the agency was relieved of the obligation to expunge these actions from her record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If so, and the agency had reason to know that this was the meaning the appellant attached to the agreement, the agreement should be interpreted in accordance with the appellant's interpretation<span class="Italic">. See</span> Restatement (Second) of Contracts, &#x00A7; 20(2) (1979) ("The manifestations of the parties are operative in accordance with the meaning attached to them by one of the parties if (a) that party does not know of any different meaning attached by the other, and the other knows the meaning attached by the first party; or (b) that party has no reason to know of any different meaning attached by the other, and the other has reason to know the meaning attached by the first party."). Furthermore, if the appellant's interpretation was reasonable, and the agency did not have reason to know that the appellant attached a materially different meaning to the agreement, the agreement would have to be set aside for lack of mutual assent if the parties' differences went to the heart of the contract<span class="Italic">. Gullette</span>, 70 MSPR at 576. However, if neither party had reason to know of the different, but reasonable, meaning that the other party attached to the agreement, and their differences did not go to the heart of the contract, the agreement would still be in effect, but neither party would be bound by the meaning attached by the other. Restatement (Second) of Contracts, &#x00A7; 201(3) (1979). Because the record is unclear concerning these matters, we must VACATE the initial decision and REMAND this appeal to the field office for further adjudication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge shall determine whether the appellant reasonably interpreted the settlement agreement as allowing her to relitigate the merits of the suspensions in the event that the agency was relieved of the obligation to permanently expunge these actions from her record. If the administrative judge determines that the appellant's interpretation was reasonable, he shall determine if the agency had reason to know of the appellant's interpretation. If he determines that the agency did not have reason to know of the appellant's interpretation, he shall determine whether the parties' differences went to the heart of the contract. If the parties' differences went to the heart of the contract, he shall afford the appellant the option of accepting the settlement agreement under the agency's interpretation or setting the settlement agreement aside and reinstating the appeal<span class="Italic">. See Weber v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 86 MSPR 25 &#x00B6; 12 (2000); <span class="Italic">Gullette</span>, 70 MSPR at 577. If the administrative judge determines that the appellant's interpretation was reasonable, and further determines that the agency had reason to know of the appellant's interpretation, he shall inform the parties that the settlement agreement will be interpreted according to the appellant's interpretation.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4838"></span>In addition, to the extent that the settlement agreement contained a latent ambiguity, i.e., an ambiguity that is not glaring, substantial, or patently obvious, the administrative judge could construe the ambiguous term against the drafter of the contract if the nondrafter's interpretation is reasonable<span class="Italic">. See Bables v. Department of the Army</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 171 &#x00B6; 8 (2000). In this case, it appears that the agency may have drafted the agreement.

<p class="Body-Text">Lack of mutual assent will not be attributed if the view of the party seeking to set aside the agreement is not a reasonable view of the language or intent of the agreement, <span class="Italic">Coker v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 324 Fed. Appx. 912, 916 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Coker argues that the settlement agreement is voidable because he and the agency "had reasonable and differing interpretations of an essential term of the agreement." Specifically, Mr. Coker asserts that he is entitled to avoid the agreement because of his misunderstanding of the sick leave provision, which he interpreted as obligating the agency to provide him availability pay as part of that approved sick leave. Because Mr. Coker alleges a misunderstanding, the failure of the parties to attach a common meaning to a material term would render the contract void, and not, as Mr. Coker asserts, voidable at his discretion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Restatement (Second) of Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 20 (1981). In any event, there is no cause for rescission here because Mr. Coker's interpretation of the settlement agreement is not a reasonable one; the agreement clearly foreclosed any claim by Mr. Coker to compensation beyond the restoration of his sick leave. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 20, 201; 2 E. Allan Farnsworth, <span class="Italic">Farnsworth on Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 7.9, at 285 (3d ed. 2004) (standard of reasonableness applies when parties attach different meanings to contract language). Mr. Coker asserts that he interpreted the agency's agreement to "rescind" his initial removal as a promise to restore the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>--including his eligibility to receive availability pay. But the agency never agreed to restore Mr. Coker to his prior position; instead, the settlement agreement provided that Mr. Coker would still be removed from his position, albeit on medical grounds, and that he waived any right to compensation that he would otherwise have been entitled to (other than that specifically provided for in paragraph 3 of the agreement). Thus, Mr. Coker's belief that the rescission of his initial removal would entitle him to availability pay was not a reasonable one.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Evans v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-12-0379-I-1 (NP 5/24/2013), declined to credit an appellant's challenge to a settlement based on, among other arguments, an averment that there was no meeting of the mind concerning the scope of waiver of appeal rights in a settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review the appellant also reiterates her argument below that there was no "meeting of the minds" between her and the agency when they executed the settlement agreement because she believed that the agreement encompassed only her EEO claims and the agency failed to provide her a "precise explanation" of the scope of the settlement agreement. The administrative judge rejected this argument in the initial decision, finding that the appellant did not assert that she was deceived or that the agency operated in bad faith or coerced her agreement. Although the appellant's argument is less than clear, she seems to be challenging the validity of the settlement agreement on the grounds that the agency misled her with respect to the scope of the settlement agreement by failing to explicitly inform her that the agreement encompassed her claim that the agency improperly converted her position from the NSPS to the GS. Consequently, we have considered the appellant's claim that there was no "meeting of the minds" as an allegation that the settlement agreement is invalid because the agency misrepresented the scope of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement may be invalid if a party to the agreement shows that the agreement was based on fraud or misrepresentation by the agency. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 467, &#x00B6; 19 (2002). One who attacks a settlement agreement bears the heavy burden of showing that the contract is tainted, and thus invalidated, by fraud practiced upon him. <span class="Italic">See Hazlett v. Department of Justice</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 623, 625 (1985) (citing <span class="Italic">Asberry v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982)). On the issue of misrepresentation, it is sufficient to show that a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency's statements. <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 467, &#x00B6; 19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our review of the record, we disagree with the appellant's apparent contention that the agency misled her as to the scope of the settlement agreement by failing to explicitly inform her that the settlement agreement would preclude her from filing a Board appeal regarding her conversion from the NSPS to the GS. As the administrative judge explained, the language of the settlement agreement is unambiguous and clearly states that the appellant agreed to waive the right to appeal any action that arose before the settlement agreement became final. We also agree with the administrative judge that the language of the settlement agreement is comprehensive and encompasses the appellant's claim pertaining to the conversion of her position from the NSPS to the GS because that claim arose before the settlement agreement became final. In light of the broad scope of the waiver language in the settlement agreement, we find that a reasonable person would not have been misled by the fact that the agency did not specifically inform the appellant that the agreement encompassed her claim pertaining to the conversion of her from the NSPS to the GS in September 2010. Therefore, the appellant has failed to establish that the agency knowingly concealed a material fact or intentionally misled her when it did not specifically explain to her that the agreement included her conversion claim. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1463, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (the appellant's "heavy burden of showing fraud" requires him to demonstrate that the agency knowingly concealed a material fact or that he was intentionally misled). Accordingly, we find that the appellant has failed to establish that the settlement agreement is invalid based on misrepresentation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also seems to argue on review that the waiver provisions of the settlement agreement do not bar this appeal because she is "a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigant without the sophistication to draft or agree to precisely-worded settlement agreements." We find this argument unavailing. The appellant offers no support for her apparent assertion that the waiver provisions of the settlement agreement are unenforceable due to her <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status. Moreover, in the settlement agreement the agency specifically advised the appellant to consult with an attorney before signing the agreement and informed her that: she had 21 days from receipt of the agreement to review and consider it before signing the agreement; and she could revoke the agreement within 7 days of signing and delivering it to the agency. Thus, the appellant had ample opportunity to consult with an attorney if she was uncertain as to the scope of the settlement agreement.</p>
