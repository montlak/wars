<h5 class="h5" id="sec10-117"><span class="space">k.</span> Events Preceding, Subsequent to RIF</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">During its adjudication of RIF appeals, the Board considers those matters covered by OPM RIF regulations. It does not ordinarily concern itself with the validity of events that occurred before and apart from the RIF, e.g., previous transfers of function<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Simonelli v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 316, 317, 7 MSPB 205 (1981). The Board is without authority to review the propriety of an appellant's appointment preceding a RIF. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stephens v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3021) (appellant maintained that he should have been assigned a permanent rather than term appointment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Conversely, the rule is that the propriety of an agency's decision in a RIF is judged on the basis of events at the time the action occurred and not on events that later occurred. <span class="Italic">FDA v. Davidson</span>, 46 MSPR 223, 226 (1990) (relying on <span class="Italic">Clerman v. ICC</span>, 35 MSPR 190, 194-95 (1987)) (in <span class="Italic">Davidson</span>, the Board considered immaterial the argument that the employee would be on a detail at the time of a planned furlough and his furlough would save the agency nothing; the Board would not speculate as to what would happen during the period of the furlough, and the Board would not look back to see if any money was saved by furloughing the employee).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not exclude consideration of all events predating a RIF. An appellant may challenge the manipulation of promotions prior to a RIF if the object of the promotions is to place favored employees out of bumping range. That situation arose in <span class="Italic">Peters v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 29 MSPR 253 (1985). A reorganization led to RIF. A retention register showed that the appellant was eligible for another employee's position through bumping. Management asked for assistance from a classifier to determine how to protect the other employee. Ultimately the other employee was given a promotion through accretion of duties--a promotion previously determined to be unwarranted when the other employee was not threatened by RIF. The Board reversed the appellant's RIF, for it was tainted by improper motivations. The agency engaged in an impermissible circumvention of RIF regulations by promoting the other employee to avoid having him bumped by the appellant during the reorganization. But the Board may preclude litigation and adjudication of collateral claims in age discrimination cases. <span class="Italic">Vincent v. FDIC</span>, 41 MSPR 637, 641 (1989), avoided deciding claims that the employee, an excepted service attorney, was not selected for positions that might have saved him from a RIF. The Board reasoned that as an excepted service employee, the appellant had no mandatory right to an assignment under RIF procedures; further, to the extent that the appellant was viewed as challenging the agency's failure to select him for positions unrelated to the RIF action, the Board had no jurisdiction over those allegations. <span class="Italic">Vincent</span> cited <span class="Italic">Decker v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 119 (1989), for the proposition that "the fact that qualified employees over age 40 are selected for RIF is not inherently suspect because there is no automatic presumption that every termination of such employees constitutes prohibited discrimination."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency actions after the decision to reorganize and before an employee's receipt of a RIF notice are relevant to the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the reorganization and subsequent RIF. <span class="Italic">Nielson v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2148). <span class="Italic">Metger v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 68 MSPR 225, 227-29 (1995), set aside the RIF of an employee who demonstrated that the agency incorrectly relied on lack of work to separate the employee when the agency hired additional personnel in his job series immediately after his separation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective July 1, 1994, the agency appointed three individuals who had been separated by RIF from their WG-3801-11 Metals Inspectors positions the previous day to temporary WG-3801-11 Metals Inspectors positions. The agency classified the temporary positions in a competitive level different from the one the appellant had occupied because the temporary positions had different position descriptions than the position description the appellant had held; specifically, the three temporary positions were designated either as Metals Inspector (Radiography) or Metals Inspector (Eddy Current), and the corresponding position descriptions required the incumbent to be certified in the applicable specialty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency conducting a RIF is prohibited from releasing an employee from a competitive level while retaining in that level an employee with a specifically limited temporary appointment. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.602(a). The appellant argues that the agency violated this prohibition, but in fact there were no temporary Metals Inspectors in the competitive level from which the appellant was released on June 30, 1994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the appointment of temporary Metals Inspectors just one day after it released him from the Metals Inspector competitive level shows that, contrary to the administrative judge's finding, the agency did not establish that it had to release him from his competitive level due to lack of work. As explained below, we agree.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;The appellant did not raise this argument in precisely these terms before the administrative judge, but his claim that he should not have been released from his competitive level when the agency knew it had work for three temporary Metals Inspectors, amounted to a challenge to the agency's stated reason for running the RIF. <span class="Italic">Cf. Kanner v. Department of the Army</span>, 4 MSPR 130, 132 (1980) (the appellant's claim that the position he was offered during a RIF was identical to the position he had held, and that was supposedly abolished, was a challenge to the agency's stated reason for running the RIF).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that it invoked RIF procedures for one of the reasons set forth at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2). <span class="Italic">Schroeder v. Department of Transportation</span>, 60 MSPR 566, 569 (1994). Here, the agency asserts that the RIF that affected the appellant was due to lack of work. In <span class="Italic">Dziedzic v. Department of Energy</span>, 24 MSPR 673 (1984), the agency released an employee from his competitive level during a reorganization and assigned him to a lower-graded position, based on the abolishment of his GS-14 position. On appeal, the reassignment was set aside. The agency had created a new GS-14 position during the reorganization that was "substantially the same" as the displaced employee's former position, and thus, the agency did not establish the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>s of the RIF action as to that employee. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Hoffman v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 22 MSPR 564, 568 (1984), RIF procedures were found not to have been properly invoked as to an employee whose position was abolished, where "the function the [employee] performed...[was] still needed [immediately following the abolishment of his position] and [was] being performed by another employee in the same grade as the [displaced employee]." (Footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, as in <span class="Italic">Dziedzic</span> and <span class="Italic">Hoffman</span>, the agency has not shown that it had to abolish as many positions as it did. Beginning the day after the agency released the appellant from his competitive level due to a supposed lack of work, and continuing for at least seven months thereafter, the agency had work for three full-time employees that had previously been performed by employees in the competitive level from which the appellant was released.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contended below that it could not use the appellant after June 30, 1994, because he did not hold a certification in either Radiography testing or Eddy Current testing. This contention is unavailing. In <span class="Italic">Wright v. Department of Commerce</span>, 9 MSPR 472 (1982), the agency separated the appellant from his GS-11 Community Services Specialist position by RIF, and immediately reassigned another employee with lower retention standing who had been released from the same competitive level as the appellant, to a supposedly "new" GS-11 Community Services Specialist position. According to the agency, the "new" position had a different "focus," but the evidence showed otherwise; the allegedly new concentration had actually been a part of the appellant's former position. Thus, the appellant's separation was set aside.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Just as in <span class="Italic">Wright</span>, the agency's claim that the three temporary WG-3801-11 Metals Inspectors positions are different than the appellant's former position is unpersuasive. An agency is permitted to establish separate competitive levels for positions with the same grade and title, to take into account special qualifications or duties required of some incumbents. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Griffin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 64 MSPR 561 (1994) (the agency established separate competitive levels for pipefitters who performed nuclear work and those who did not). For purposes of the RIF effective June 30, 1994, however, the agency did not distinguish among the four major Metals Inspector specialties. Instead, the agency considered all <span id="Page_3124"></span>WG-3801-11 Metals Inspectors positions, irrespective of specialty, to be essentially interchangeable. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.403(a) (positions in the same grade and classification series belong in the same competitive level if they are "similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay schedules, and working conditions so that the incumbent of one position could successfully perform the critical elements of any other position upon entry into it, without any loss of productivity beyond that normally expected in the orientation of any new but fully qualified employee").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Thus, for purposes of the RIF effective June 30, 1994, the agency did not consider a Metals Inspector's lack of certification in a major specialty to be a bar to assigning that employee to work in that specialty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency had work for three Metals Inspectors beginning July 1, 1994, of the sort that had been performed by eleven Metals Inspectors in the competitive level from which the appellant was released on June 30, 1994, the agency has only shown that it had to release eight Metals Inspectors from the appellant's competitive level due to lack of work. If the agency had shown that the appellant would have been released from his competitive level in any event if it had eliminated only eight positions, then the appellant would not prevail. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hill v. Department of Commerce</span>, 25 MSPR 205, 207-08 (1984) (the Board will not reverse an action based on an agency error in the application of RIF regulations if the agency shows that the error had no effect on the appellant's substantive entitlements). We find, however, that the appellant would not have been released on June 30 or September 12 because his retention standing was the highest among the eleven Metals Inspectors who were separated (all of whom were in tenure subgroup 1B).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a RIF used to reduce personnel levels, it is immaterial that subsequent to the RIF action the agency may have increased staffing levels, assuming that the initial RIF was <span class="Italic">bona fide.</span> <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baron v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 65 Fed. Appx. 721 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP) ("[W]hile some tours resumed, they were of a more limited nature. Mr. Baron did not provide any evidence that tours resumed to the extent and volume they had before September 11, 2001."); <span class="Italic">Williams v. VA</span>, 4 MSPR 333, 334 (1980) ("The fact that subsequent to the RIF action, the agency may have received increased staffing levels, would not invalidate the action effected under the circumstances in existence at the time the appellant was downgraded."); <span class="Italic">Jones v. VA</span>, 4 MSPR 320, 322 4 MSPB 387 (1980) ("Although the appellant submitted notes from a staff meeting which indicated that the hospital ceiling would be increased by forty-eight positions, she did not assert nor submit any evidence that any subsequent staff increases would reestablish the position she formerly held. Therefore, the evidence she submitted is not material evidence."); <span class="Italic">Baker v. VA</span>, 4 MSPR 315, 316-17, 4 MSPB 383 (1980) ("The fact that subsequent to the RIF action, the agency may have received increased staffing levels, would not invalidate the action effected under the circumstances in evidence at the time the appellant was down-graded."). A subsequent reclassification of competitive levels is not dispositive of whether competitive levels were properly established on the date of the RIF. <span class="Italic">George v. ICC</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-1464).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to events postdating the RIF, the permanence of a position acquired by assignment rights is considered. If an employee is assigned by RIF to a position that is downgraded through reclassification two-and-a-half months later, no violation of 5 CFR 351.701 (2022) occurs if at the time of the assignment, the reclassification was a good possibility but not a certainty, the agency was not certain when or if it would occur, and it was impossible to determine whether the position would or would not stay at its grade for at least three months. The conclusion could be different if there were another job within the appellant's assignment rights and if that position was not subject to an ongoing classification review. <span class="Italic">Walsh v. EPA</span>, 25 MSPR 460, 465-66 (1984). A different conclusion was reached when an employee was reassigned to a position the agency knew would soon be downgraded through reclassification. The employee should have been subjected to a RIF from the initial position so that he could compete at that grade level rather than being forced to compete in a subsequent RIF from a lower grade level. <span class="Italic">McClure v. FEMA</span>, 32 MSPR 672 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Peters</span>, 29 MSPR 253 (1985), <span class="Italic">post</span>, and distinguishing <span class="Italic">Walsh</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>). If post-RIF actions of the agency suggest that the reorganization was never truly implemented, the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the RIF become suspect. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Disney v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 563 (1995).</p>
