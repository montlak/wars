<p class="Body-Text">A seasonal employee placed in a nonduty, nonpay status in accordance with the conditions established at the time of his appointment is not entitled to adverse action or RIF procedures. <span class="Italic">Nagle v.

<p class="Body-Text">Of seasonal employees, <span class="Italic">Sommers v. USDA</span>, 62 MSPR 519, 521-22 (1994), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The general rule is that the placement of a seasonal employee in a nonduty, nonpay status in accordance with the conditions of his employment is neither an adverse action furlough under 5 USC 7512(5) nor a reduction-in-force (RIF) action under 5 CFR 351.201(a)(2). Such an action is specifically excluded from coverage under adverse action procedures by 5 CFR 752.401(b)(14) and from RIF regulations by 5 CFR 351.202(c)(6)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Devine</span>, 9 MSPB 448, 10 MSPR 194, 196-200 (1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. NTEU v. MSPB</span>, 743 F.2d 895 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (upholding 5 CFR 752.401(b)(14) as facially valid). Thus, the Board lacks jurisdiction over such actions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge rejected the appellant's assertion that he had a right to appeal to the Board in order to challenge the validity of the agency's asserted reasons for laying him off, i.e., "budget and workload factors." In so doing, the administrative judge acknowledged the statement made by Judge Wald in her concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 743 F.2d at 917, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If [the seasonal employee] can show that the layoff conditions of his contract have not been met, or have been invoked only as a pretext to mask other reasons, I interpret the MSPB and [the Office of Personnel Management's] position to be that the employee is entitled to the protections given furloughs by 5 USC 7513.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He disagreed with Judge Wald's statement, however, opining as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I reject appellant's argument and Judge Wald's supposition that a seasonal or on-call employee may appeal to the Board claiming that the agency's stated reason for the layoff could not be justified or was pretextual. To hold otherwise would give seasonal/on-call employees a virtually unfettered right to question its [sic] employer's exercise of discretion for every layoff. Any disgruntled, laid-off employee in almost any situation could formulate <span class="Italic">some</span> claim, reasonable on its face, that there was not really a lack of funds or a lack of work or whatever the agency's stated reason happened to be. Such a situation would seriously frustrate the underlying purposes for having seasonal/on-call employees in the first place.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Judge Wald's "supposition," however, was apparently drawn from the Board's decision in the same case, which provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he crucial question in an individual case is whether placing the seasonal employee in a nonduty, nonpay status was in accordance with the terms of his appointment. Proving the meaning of an appointment for duty "as needed," "as weather permits," or the like, may not be a simple matter in some cases, but that remains a matter for determination on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 10 MSPR at 199.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation below that his placement in a nonduty status was <span class="Italic">not</span> in accordance with the terms of his employment. Therefore, it suffices to dismiss his appeal on that basis rather than under the administrative judge's reasoning set forth above, which we find overly broad.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Further explanation concerning jurisdiction over seasonal employees' appeals was provided, <span class="Italic">Strickland v. MSPB</span>, 748 F.2d 681, 684-85 (Fed. Cir. 1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official found, and the record shows, that petitioner was hired by the agency as a seasonal employee and signed a statement accepting the conditions of his employment. The statement stated in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_203"></span>At certain times during each year your services will not be required because of lack of work, lack of funds, weather conditions, or other reasons administratively warranted by management considerations. During these periods you will be placed in a nonwork, nonpay status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner, being placed in a nonduty, nonpay status, contends that he is entitled to appeal to the MSPB under the RIF regulations because the agency's action constituted a furlough. We hold otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Placing a seasonal employee in a nonduty, nonpay status in accordance with conditions established at the time of employment is not an adverse action "furlough" under 5 USC 7511(a)(5) and does not give rise to the adverse action procedures of 5 USC 7513<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR 752.401(c)(10) (1984). This rule is entirely consistent with the employee's reasonable expectations when he agreed to work subject to the conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The same reasons apply with equal force to appeal rights under the RIF regulations. A seasonal employee, who is placed in a nonduty, nonpay status in accordance with the conditions of his employment, is not entitled to RIF appeal rights. We agree with the presiding official that requiring agencies to comply with the RIF regulations in such a case would frustrate the intended flexibility of seasonal employment. <span class="Italic">See also NTEU v. Devine</span>, 9 MSPB 448 (1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Adams v. IRS</span>, 314 F.3d 1367, 1370-71 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (defining furloughs of seasonal employees, relative to adverse action jurisdiction, in terms of reasonable expectations of employment as defined by individual employment agreements and collective bargaining agreements).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee may be able to invoke Board jurisdiction to determine if he has been laid off in accordance with federal regulations or the terms of a negotiated agreement, i.e., lack of work. The court explained in <span class="Italic">Horner v. Schuck</span>, 843 F.2d 1368, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">aff'g</span> <span class="Italic">Schuck v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 624, 627 (1986), as to Board jurisdiction over appeals by Postal Service employees placed into nonpay, nonduty status in the course of temporary or permanent light duty assignments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that where an agency places employees in a nonpay, nonduty status in accordance with the conditions of their employment, the decision is not subject to review by the MSPB. It bases this argument on <span class="Italic">Strickland v. MSPB</span>, 748 F.2d 681 (Fed. Cir. 1984), and <span class="Italic">NTEU v. MSPB</span>, 743 F.2d 895 (D.C. Cir. 1984), which held that seasonal employees, who are hired on a temporary basis, were not furloughed within the meaning of 5 USC 7511(a)(5) because their employment agreement provided for layoff without pay. Since, in OPM's view, there was no adverse action, it argues the MSPB had no jurisdiction to hear these appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Horner v. Andrzjewski</span>, 811 F.2d 571 (Fed. Cir. 1987), this court reversed an MSPB decision and upheld an OPM regulation, 5 CFR 752.404(d)(2), which permitted agencies to furlough employees without notice or opportunity for reply under certain emergency conditions. However, the court remanded for a determination by the MSPB of whether the regulation was properly invoked under the circumstances of the case, stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The issue of the propriety of use of the emergency furlough regulation is an open question here. For the protection of employees, precipitous action which deprives them of their livelihood must be restricted to very narrow circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">811 F.2d at 577. Thus, the court held that even though agencies may be permitted by federal regulations to furlough employees without notice, the MSPB has jurisdiction to determine whether the regulations were properly invoked. We conclude for similar reasons that, even if the Postal Service may place employees having temporary or permanent light duty assignments in nonpay, nonduty status, the MSPB has jurisdiction to determine whether respondents were properly laid off in accordance with federal regulations and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, i.e., because of a lack of work. <span class="Italic">See also National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 743 F.2d at 912 (if employee can show that furlough was not in accordance with the terms of his appointment, employee is entitled to invoke section 7513's adverse action procedures).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If an adverse action is taken against a seasonal employee in the excepted service, that individual may have appeal rights, irrespective of being placed in normal seasonal periods of nonduty status, if the employee has completed more than a year of continuous service and is a preference eligible. If the nonduty status is a normal incident of the seasonal appointment, the nonduty status does not interrupt the continuous employment of the individual for purposes of the statutory definition of "employee" at 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B). The seasonal employee may appeal an adverse action even though he served in a nonpay status due to lack of work for an interval during the 365 days prior to the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 344, 345 n.1 (1991). <span class="Italic">Tom v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 32 MSPR 126, 128-30 (1987), said of employment calculus for a seasonal employee who appealed a 30-day suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant in this case is a preference-eligible "seasonal employee" in the excepted service. The Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Supplement, 296-33, ch. S15-2(e) (Jan. 4, 1985), defines a "seasonal employee" as "one who works on an annual recurring or on-call basis and for less than 2,080 hours per year." The question before us, then, is whether the appellant's seasonal employment with the agency for more than four years constitutes "current continuous service in the same or similar positions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues in its petition for review that the appellant, as a seasonal worker, was in a nonpay status for more than twenty-two days during the year preceding the agency's adverse action, and was, therefore, not an "employee" entitled to appeal his suspension. In support of its position, the agency relies upon the provisions of the FPM, Chapter 315, Appendix A, Paragraph A-3 (Apr. 27, 1982), for the proposition that employees must make up nonpay absences in excess of twenty-two workdays in order to complete their probationary periods.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency's contention in this regard is misplaced for two reasons. First, the FPM provision relates only to competitive service employees. And, second, the requirement that preference-eligible employees in the excepted service must complete "1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) does not involve a probationary period. <span class="Italic">See Shobe v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 466, 470 (1981) (5 C.F.R. part 315, subpart H--regarding probationary periods--does not apply to employees serving in the excepted service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also contends in its petition for review that the Board and courts have interpreted the statutory requirement that an employee have one year of current continuous service to relate to "the one year period immediately preceding the action under appeal," thus excluding the consideration of service before that 365-day period. The agency cites several cases in support of this contention, but none of the cases cited actually support it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In two of the cited cases in particular, <span class="Italic">O'Gorman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 310 (1981), and <span class="Italic">Turner v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 194 (1983) the Board found that the appellants were not "employees" because each of them had served less than a year after a break in service. In this case, however, there was no break in service. The appellant has remained on the agency's rolls in his present position since 1982.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record on appeal includes documentation of the appellant's service record as follows: He was reassigned from a permanent Motor Vehicle Operator position to a seasonal Motor Vehicle Operator position on May 30, 1982; he was placed in a pay status on August 12, 1984; he was placed in a nonpay status on June 2, 1985, for lack of work; he was placed back in a pay status on August 4, 1985; and he was suspended for thirty days in the action now on appeal, beginning on April 13, 1986.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Devine,</span> 10 M.S.P.R. 194, 198-99 (1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. National Treasury Employees Union v. U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 743 F.2d 895 (D.C. Cir. 1984), the appellant's temporary placement in a nonpay status for lack of work on June 2, 1985, was not an adverse action requiring adherence to statutory procedures because it was in keeping with the terms of his seasonal employment and therefore did not constitute a suspension or a furlough. The appellant's placement in a nonpay status did not remove him from the agency's rolls or otherwise disrupt his continued employment with the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the appellant completed more than one year of current continuous service with the agency before the agency suspended him. He began his employment as a seasonal Motor Vehicle Operator in 1982, and remained in that position through the time of his suspension in 1986. Although the appellant served in a nonpay status due to lack of work for approximately two months during the 365 days prior to his disciplinary suspension, his service satisfies the statutory requirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gutierrez v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GUTIERREZ_DIANA_R_DA_315H_04_0209_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249400.pdf">99 MSPR 141</a>, 144-48 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-20 (2005), considered when a period of nonpay status accrues to the one year of current continuous service for a competitive service seasonal employee. The Board resolved that time spent in nonduty, nonpay status, while remaining on the agency's rolls, contributed to completion of the current continuous service requirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802, the probationary period for an initial appointment to the competitive service is 1 year. Because the appellant's appointment began on November 26, 2002, her probationary period would have ended on November 25, 2003, if not for the fact that she was placed in a nonduty status from September 6, 2003, until November 17, 2003. Due to her time in a nonduty status, her probationary period would not have ended until after the effective date of her termination on January 3, 2004.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;"Absence in a nonpay status while on the rolls (other than for compensable injury or military duty) is creditable up to a total of 22 workdays." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(c). However, "[n]onpay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the probationary period by an equal amount." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant was absent in a nonpay status for 72 calendar days. <span id="Page_204"></span>The regulations do not define workdays or specify how the 22 workdays referenced in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(c) convert to calendar days. Even if we assume that time in a nonpay status may be counted as workdays for the purpose of this calculation, and assume that the appellant worked 5 days each week and subtract holidays, the appellant would have been in a nonpay status for approximately 49 workdays from September 6, 2003, until November 17, 2003. Thus, her probationary period would have been extended by approximately 27 workdays.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was a probationer at the time she was terminated, and she failed to allege that she was terminated due to her marital status, for partisan political reasons, or for pre-appointment reasons. Ordinarily, under such circumstances, the Board would lack jurisdiction over this appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(a), (b); <span class="Italic">Mastriano</span>, 714 F.2d at 1155. In <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2002), <span class="Italic">pet. for reh'g en banc denied</span>, 329 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2003), however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) determined that an appellant meets the definition of an "employee" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) for purposes of appeal rights before the Board if the appellant is "an individual in the competitive service (i) who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; <span class="Italic">or</span> (ii) who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant was probationary when she was terminated, she did not meet the definition of an "employee" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i). She did, however, occupy her position for a little more than 13 months before she was terminated. Despite this fact, the administrative judge apparently did not consider whether <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> applied to the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the Board ordered the agency to submit any evidence relevant to the <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> issue. It also provided the appellant with an opportunity to respond. The agency argued that the initial decision was correct and that the <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> decision had no bearing on the instant case. The appellant submitted no reply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It does not appear that the precise issue before the Board has been previously addressed--that is, whether an individual serving under a competitive service appointment as a seasonal employee whose appointment lasted more than 1 year, but who actually only worked for 10 months due to periods in a nonduty, nonpay status, can be considered to have "completed 1 year of current continuous service," thereby rendering her an "employee" with Board appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii) as interpreted in <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>. We find that, under this set of facts, the appellant was an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Current continuous employment" is defined as "a period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action in the same or similar positions without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b). There is no break in Federal civilian employment when a seasonal employee is placed in a nonduty, nonpay status. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 340.401, 340.402. Seasonal employees are permanent employees who have annually recurring periods of work of less than 12 months each year. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 340.401(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) Guidance and Information on Furloughs, Document Number: OPMPC 98-12, 1998 WL 1804164 (Dec. 1, 1998), provides that time in a nonpay status, including furlough, leave without pay (LWOP), absence without leave, and suspension, is creditable service for time-in-grade requirements, and an aggregate nonpay status of 6 months in any calendar year is creditable service for retirement and reduction in force (RIF) purposes. 1998 WL 1804164 at 15-17. Additionally, health benefits continue for up to 365 days in a nonpay status, and life insurance coverage continues for 12 consecutive months in a nonpay status. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 16. While nonpay status for seasonal employees is not mentioned, and while it does not constitute a furlough, <span class="Italic">see Sommers v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 519, 521 (1994), since October 1, 1980, nonpay status of seasonal employees has been treated as LWOP for service credit and benefit purposes, <span class="Italic">Curdy v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 291 F.3d 1371, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2002). For example, seasonal employees may accrue up to 6 months of retirement credit annually for time in a nonpay status, just as an employee in LWOP status would. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8332(b), (f), 8411(d); <span class="Italic">Curdy</span>, 291 F.3d at 1372.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Board has held that, with respect to a preference eligible employed as a seasonal worker in the <span class="Italic">excepted</span> service, the time he spent in a nonduty, nonpay status, while remaining on the agency's rolls, counted toward his current continuous service. <span class="Italic">Tom v. Department of the Interior</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 126, 128-30 (1987). In <span class="Italic">Tom</span>, the Board recognized that the previously mentioned rule that nonpay time exceeding 22 workdays extends the probationary period by an equal amount deals with probationary periods, not current continuous service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 128-29 (concerning a Federal Personnel Manual provision on this issue); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802I. The Board also noted that the 22 workday rule was a competitive service construct and did not apply to the excepted service. <span class="Italic">Tom</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. at 128-29. The Board later cited <span class="Italic">Tom</span> for the proposition that a seasonal employee with over 1 year of current continuous service may appeal an adverse action to the Board despite the fact that the employee served in a nonpay status due to lack of work for an interval during the 365 days prior to the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 344, 345 n.1 (1991). The <span class="Italic">Williams</span> case was unclear regarding whether the appellant was in the competitive or excepted service, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), which is similar to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A), the relevant statute here, an employee with a right to appeal to the Board includes a preference-eligible employee of the U.S. Postal Service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions. In interpreting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), the Board held that an individual completed 1 year of current continuous service, thus satisfying the requirement for Board appeal rights, where she was separated after more than a year from the date on which she entered the position, notwithstanding the fact that she had been absent from work in a nonpay status since shortly after her first month of work. <span class="Italic">Campbell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 546 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 7-8 (2001); <span class="Italic">see also Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 512, 514 n.2 (1997) (the Board found that it had jurisdiction over the appellant's constructive suspension and removal appeal beginning 1 year from the date of her entry into her position; the fact that the appellant was not present at work or in a pay status did not affect her completion of the 1-year current continuous service requirement), <span class="Italic">rev'd in part on reopening on other grounds</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 46 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, the Board discussed, but did not decide, whether time in a nonpay status in excess of 22 workdays might implicate a competitive service employee's current continuous service. <span class="Italic">See Campbell</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 546 &#x00B6; 9. We note, however, that the regulation for extending a probationary period by the individual's time in a nonpay status in excess of 22 workdays makes no provision for similarly impacting that person's current continuous service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(c). Nor are we aware of any statute or regulation indicating that time in a nonpay status should not be counted toward current continuous service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the OPM regulations define current continuous employment as a period of service without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b). When a seasonal employee is placed in a nonduty, nonpay status there is no break of a <span class="Italic">workday</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 340.401, 340.402. A seasonal employee's time in a nonduty, nonpay status is contemplated as part of his employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 340.401(a). These off-duty days cannot be considered workdays, as it is anticipated that such an employee would not be working during these days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that in one pre-<span class="Italic">McCormick</span> case, the Board held that, where it was undisputed that an individual serving under a career-conditional appointment in the competitive service as an intermittent employee had only worked 78 days in a pay status after his appointment, he did not complete 1 year of current continuous service, thereby depriving the Board of jurisdiction over his appeal. <span class="Italic">Gibson v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 335, 337-38 (1988). The appellant in <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> was appointed on December 22, 1985, and was terminated on March 30, 1987. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 336-37. Therefore, he remained on the agency's rolls for over a year, as did the appellant in this case. The Board in <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> relied on a provision in the now defunct Federal Personnel Manual, <span class="Italic">see Walsh v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 88, 92 n.2 (1998), for the proposition that an intermittent worker could only meet the 1 year of current continuous service requirement by showing that he had served at least 260 days in a pay status, <span class="Italic">Gibson</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. at 337. The Board also noted that the appellant had failed to complete his probationary period. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In any event, as stated previously, the appellant in the instant case was a seasonal worker, not an intermittent worker like Gibson.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority of the Board's decisions in analogous cases indicate that the appellant's time in a nonduty, nonpay status should count toward her 1 year of current continuous service. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 546 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 7-8; <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 514 n.2; <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. at 345 n.1; <span class="Italic">Tom</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. at 128-30. This result comports with the regulatory definition of "current continuous service" and the fact that certain amounts of time in a nonpay status for a seasonal employee are creditable toward the employee's time-in-grade requirements, retirement benefits, RIF rights, health benefits, and life insurance coverage. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8332(b), (f), 8411(b)(3); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b); <span class="Italic">Curdy</span>, 291 F.3d at 1372;<span class="Italic"></span> OPM's Guidance and Information on Furloughs, Document Number: OPMPC 98-12, 1998 WL 1804164 at 15-17 (Dec. 1, 1998). Accordingly, we find that the appellant has completed 1 year of current continuous service immediately preceding her termination without a break in federal employment of a workday, and she therefore qualifies as an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that, because she is an "employee," the agency's action violated her constitutional right to minimum due process of law. An agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an <span id="Page_205"></span>opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives her of her property right in her employment constitutes an abridgment of her constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). The record shows that the appellant received written notice of her termination on December 29, 2003, and that her termination was effective on January 3, 2004. The appellant was not provided a right to reply. Therefore, the agency's procedures for effecting the appellant's removal did not comport with a tenured employee's constitutional right to minimum due process of law because she was not provided with an opportunity to respond. Accordingly, the agency's removal action must be reversed. <span class="Italic">See Daniel v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant is an "employee" because she has completed 1 year of current continuous service, notwithstanding her placement in a nonduty, nonpay status. <span class="Italic">See Gutierrez v. Department of the Treasury</span>, MSPB Docket Number DA-315H-04-0209-I-1, slip op. &#x00B6; 19 (July 12, 2005). "Current continuous employment" is defined as "a period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action in the same or similar positions without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b). Seasonal employees are permanent employees who have annually recurring periods of work of less than 12 months each year. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 340.401(a). Therefore, a seasonal employee's time in a nonduty, nonpay status is contemplated as part of his employment such that these off-duty days cannot be considered workdays breaking her current continuous employment. <span class="Italic">See Gutierrez</span>, &#x00B6; 17. We find that there was no break in the appellant's Federal civilian employment when, as a seasonal employee in the competitive service, she was placed in a nonduty, nonpay status. Accordingly, she completed 1 year of current continuous service prior to her termination and so qualifies as an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that, as an employee, the appellant's constitutional right to minimum due process of law was violated by the agency. A tenured public employee is entitled to notice of the charges against her, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present her side of the story. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). The record shows that the appellant was given written notice of her removal and the agency's reasons on May 25, 2004, which was also the effective date of the removal. The appellant was provided with no opportunity to respond. Therefore, the agency's procedure effecting the appellant's removal violated her constitutional right to minimum due process of law because she had no opportunity to present her side of the story. <span class="Italic">See Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 546; <span class="Italic">cf. Rawls v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 21 (2003) (employee was given an explanation of the agency's evidence and the opportunity to file a grievance prior to the effective date of the removal; this grievance procedure provided the appellant an opportunity to respond and satisfied the due process requirements of <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 129 Fed. Appx. 628 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Accordingly, the agency's removal action must be reversed. <span class="Italic">See Daniel v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 459, 461-62 (1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pollak v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 99 MSPR 187, 190-91 &#x00B6; 8 (2005) (competitive service seasonal tax specialist had a year of service to qualify for appeal rights; a period of nonduty, nonpay status did not constitute a break in service for purposes of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wik v. SBA</span>, 41 MSPR 97, 100-01 (1989), considered the Board's jurisdiction over appeals of "on-call" employees, explaining that their jurisdictional status was the same as seasonal employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board has jurisdiction over appeals from on-call employees to the same extent that it has jurisdiction over appeals from seasonal employees. In <span class="Italic">Lopez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 26 MSPR 369, 370-71 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 790 F.2d 91 (Fed. Cir. 1986), the Board indicated its intent to treat both groups of employees similarly.... Furthermore, it cited a case involving seasonal employees, <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 19 MSPR 202 (1984), for the proposition that RIF regulations may sometimes be applicable to on-call employees. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU v. MSPB</span>, 743 F.2d 895, 902 n.6, 912 n.21, 914 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (characterizing on-call employees as a category of seasonal workers).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision is in accord with the definitions of seasonal and on-call employment in 5 CFR 340.401. These definitions state that both types of employment involve recurring periods of work and provide that employees will be placed in nonduty/nonpay status and recalled to duty in accordance with preestablished conditions of employment. More importantly, the regulation concerning RIF rights, the regulation applicable here, treats on-call and seasonal employees in the same fashion in providing that the RIF procedures do not apply to such employees when they are placed in a nonpay/nonduty status in accordance with conditions established at the time of their appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.202(c)(6). In addition, although it states that seasonal and on-call employment are tailored to different situations, the FPM provision on on-call employment, FPM, ch. 340, subch. 3 (Mar. 12, 1985), notes that both provide a means by which agencies can meet fluctuating recurring workloads without keeping employees in a pay status when the workload subsides. This provision also provides that RIF procedures do not apply to the release of an on-call employee to nonpay status or recall to pay status, when the actions are in accordance with preestablished conditions of employment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find that the Board's jurisdiction over on-call employees concerning RIF actions is the same as that over seasonal employees, we find that the same scope of Board review applies. In <span class="Italic">Strickland v. MSPB</span>, 748 F.2d 681, 684 (Fed. Cir. 1984), the court looked to the terms of the employment agreement to determine whether the Board had jurisdiction over the employee's appeal. It held that a seasonal employee, who is placed in a nonduty/nonpay status in accordance with the conditions of his employment, is not entitled to RIF appeal rights. It found that requiring an agency to comply with the RIF regulations in such a case would frustrate the intended flexibility of seasonal employment....[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;We are aware that in two cases issued after <span class="Italic">Strickland,</span> the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit indicated that the Board should consider not only whether the agency complied with the terms of the employment agreement, but also whether it properly invoked the federal regulation and followed the terms of any collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See Horner v. Schuck,</span> 843 F.2d 1368, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Horner v. Andrzjewski,</span> 811 F.2d 571, 577 (Fed. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 484 U.S. 912, 108 S. Ct. 257, 98 L. Ed.2d 215 (1987). We do not believe that these standards apply in the present case, however, because there is no indication that the employees in <span class="Italic">Schuck</span> and <span class="Italic">Andrzjewski</span> did not occupy full-time career positions entitling them to all the benefits and rights of such positions. By contrast, the appellants here agreed, as a condition of their employment, to accept less.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board reiterated its analysis of jurisdiction over actions affecting on-call employees, <span class="Italic">Prior v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 561, 567-68 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Strickland v. MSPB</span>, 748 F.2d 681, 684 (Fed. Cir. 1984), the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that an employee's tour of duty and the legal consequences flowing therefrom, such as regular periods of inactivity, are conditions of employment and determine whether the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal. Applying <span class="Italic">Strickland</span>, the Board has found that in cases where the agency notifies an employee at the time of his appointment that his position is on-call subject to placement in nonpay status, and the employee signs an employment agreement acknowledging that the employment is subject to the needs of the agency, placement in nonpay status does not constitute a furlough appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wik v. SBA</span>, 41 MSPR 97, 101 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to their appointments to Material Processor positions, the appellants signed employment agreements providing that they would be employed on an as-needed basis subject to being placed in nonpay status at the discretion of management.... The agency's placement of the appellants into nonpay status for lack of work in keeping with the terms of the appellants' employment therefore does not constitute a furlough appealable to the Board.[6] <span class="Italic">See Wik</span>, 41 MSPR at 101; <span class="Italic">Tom v. Department of the Interior</span>, 32 MSPR 126, 129-30 (1987). Nor does their placement into nonpay status constitute a suspension for purposes of Board jurisdiction under 5 USC 7512(2), since an action, among other things, must be disciplinary to be considered an appealable suspension<span class="Italic">. See Dubler v. Department of Transportation</span>, 18 MSPR 160, 162 (1983). The record here contains no indication that the agency's action constituted discipline. Because placement of the appellants in nonpay status did not constitute an appealable action, the agency was not required to provide the appellants with notice of appeal rights to the Board.[7] <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union v. Devine</span>, 10 MSPR 194, 198 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The Board's adverse action jurisdiction extends to cases involving furloughs of thirty days or less.... Because the appellants were in nonpay status for more than thirty days, the appeals would not fall within the Board's adverse action jurisdiction, even assuming that the agency's placement of the appellants in nonpay status constituted furloughs. Moreover, assuming that the agency's action constituted a reduction in force, the Board does not have jurisdiction over an agency's placement of an on-call employee into nonpay and nonduty status in accordance with conditions established at the time of the employee's appointment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Horner v. Schuck</span>, 843 F.2d 1368, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 1988) and <span class="Italic">Horner v. Andrzjewski</span>, 811 F.2d 571, 577 (Fed. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 484 U.S. 912, 108 S. Ct. 257, 98 L. Ed.2d 215 (1987), the court indicated that the Board should consider not only whether the agency complied with the terms of the employment agreement, <span id="Page_206"></span>but whether it properly invoked the applicable Federal regulation and followed the terms of any collective bargaining agreement. However, we have observed that there was no indication that the employees in <span class="Italic">Schuck</span> and <span class="Italic">Andrzjewski</span> did not occupy full-time career positions entitling them to all the benefits and rights of such positions<span class="Italic">. See Wik</span>, 41 MSPR at 101-02 n.6. Because the appellants here agreed, as an express condition of their employment, to accept less than all the rights and benefits of a full-time career position, we believe the standards enunciated in <span class="Italic">Schuck</span> and <span class="Italic">Andrzjewski</span> are inapplicable to their appeals<span class="Italic">. Accord id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also National Treasury Employees Union v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 743 F.2d 895, 912 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (if an employee can show that a furlough was not in accordance with the terms of his appointment, he is entitled to invoke adverse action procedures of 5 USC 7513).</p>
