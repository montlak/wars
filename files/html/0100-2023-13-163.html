<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-162"><span class="space">a.</span> 2014 Legislation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The now superceded 2014 statutory provisions, as codified to the U.S. Code, were:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 USC 713--<span class="Italic">Senior executives: removal based on performance or misconduct</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;In General.--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;The Secretary may remove an individual employed in a senior executive position at the Department of Veterans Affairs from the senior executive position if the Secretary determines the performance or misconduct of the individual warrants such removal. If the Secretary so removes such an individual, the Secretary may--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;remove the individual from the civil service (as defined in section 2101 of title 5); or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;in the case of an individual described in paragraph (2), transfer the individual from the senior executive position to a General Schedule position at any grade of the General Schedule for which the individual is qualified and that the Secretary determines is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;An individual described in this paragraph is an individual who--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;previously occupied a permanent position within the competitive service (as that term is defined in section 2102 of title 5);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;previously occupied a permanent position within the excepted service (as that term is defined in section 2103 of title 5); or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;prior to employment in a senior executive position at the Department of Veterans Affairs, did not occupy any position within the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Pay of Transferred Individual.--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including the requirements of section 3594 of title 5, any individual transferred to a General Schedule position under subsection (a)(2) shall, beginning on the date of such transfer, receive the annual rate of pay applicable to such position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;An individual so transferred may not be placed on administrative leave or any other category of paid leave during the period during which an appeal (if any) under this section is ongoing, and may only receive pay if the individual reports for duty. If an individual so transferred does not report for duty, such individual shall not receive pay or other benefits pursuant to subsection (e)(5).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Notice to Congress.--Not later than 30 days after removing or transferring an individual from a senior executive position under subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives notice in writing of such removal or transfer and the reason for such removal or transfer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Procedure.--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;The procedures under section 7543(b) of title 5 shall not apply to a removal or transfer under this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)(A)&#x2003;Subject to subparagraph (B) and subsection (e), any removal or transfer under subsection (a) may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under section 7701 of title 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_2227"></span>(B)&#x2003;An appeal under subparagraph (A) of a removal or transfer may only be made if such appeal is made not later than seven days after the date of such removal or transfer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;Expedited Review by Administrative Judge.--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;Upon receipt of an appeal under subsection (d)(2)(A), the Merit Systems Protection Board shall refer such appeal to an administrative judge pursuant to section 7701(b)(1) of title 5. The administrative judge shall expedite any such appeal under such section and, in any such case, shall issue a decision not later than 21 days after the date of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including section 7703 of title 5, the decision of an administrative judge under paragraph (1) shall be final and shall not be subject to any further appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;In any case in which the administrative judge cannot issue a decision in accordance with the 21-day requirement under paragraph (1), the removal or transfer is final. In such a case, the Merit Systems Protection Board shall, within 14 days after the date that such removal or transfer is final, submit to Congress and the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives a report that explains the reasons why a decision was not issued in accordance with such requirement.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1210.18 <span class="Italic">Burden of proof, standard of review, and penalty.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Agency</span>. Under 5 U.S.C. 7701(c)(1), and subject to exceptions stated in paragraph (c) of this section, the agency (the Department of Veterans Affairs) bears the burden of proving that an appellant engaged in misconduct, as defined by 38 U.S.C. 713(g)(2), or poor performance, and the Secretary's determination as to such misconduct or poor performance shall be sustained only if the factual reasons for the charge(s) are supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Proof of misconduct or poor performance shall create a presumption that the Secretary's decision to remove or transfer the appellant was warranted. The appellant may rebut this presumption by establishing that the imposed penalty was unreasonable under the circumstances of the case. The following examples illustrate the application of this rule:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Example A.</span> The Secretary determines that the appellant intentionally submitted false data on the agency's provision of medical care and that the misconduct warrants transfer to a General Schedule position. The appellant files an appeal with the Board. Following a hearing, the administrative judge finds that the agency proved its charge by preponderant evidence. The appellant's transfer is presumed to be warranted, absent a showing that such a penalty was unreasonable under the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Example B.</span> The Secretary determines that the appellant's performance or misconduct warrants removal, but the notice of the decision and the agency's response file do not identify any factual reasons supporting the Secretary's determination. The appellant files an appeal with the Board. The administrative judge may not sustain the removal because the agency, in taking its action, provided no factual reasons in support of its charge(s).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Example C.</span> The Secretary determines that the appellant's performance or misconduct warrants removal. The appellant files an appeal with the Board. During the processing of the appeal, the appellant contends that the agency unduly delayed or refused to engage in discovery. If the agency has obstructed the appeal from being adjudicated in a timely fashion, the administrative judge may impose sanctions, up to and including the drawing of adverse inferences or reversing the removal action. Because the administrative judge finds that the agency has not unduly delayed or refused to engage in discovery, he declines to impose sanctions and affirms the removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Example D.</span> The Secretary decides to remove the appellant based on a charge that the appellant engaged in a minor infraction that occurred outside the workplace. The appellant files an appeal with the Board. Following a hearing, the administrative judge finds that the agency proved its charge and further finds that the appellant established that the penalty of removal was unreasonable under the circumstances of the case. The presumption that the Secretary's decision to remove was warranted is rebutted and the action is reversed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appellant</span>. The appellant has the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, concerning:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Issues of jurisdiction;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The timeliness of the appeal; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Affirmative defenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Affirmative defenses</span>. Under 5 U.S.C. 7701(c)(2), the Secretary's determination may not be sustained, even where the agency met the evidentiary standard stated in paragraph (a) of this section, if the appellant shows that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The agency, in rendering its determination, committed harmful error in the application of its procedures;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The decision was based on any prohibited personnel practice described in 5 U.S.C. 2302(b); or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The determination is not otherwise in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Penalty review</span>. As set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, proof of the agency's charge(s) by preponderant evidence creates a presumption that the Secretary's decision to remove or transfer the appellant was warranted. An appellant may rebut this presumption by establishing that the imposed penalty was unreasonable under the circumstances of the case, in which case the action is reversed.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2230"></span>As part of the Veterans Access Act, Congress created a new executive removal scheme, codified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 713, to make it easier for the DVA to remove or demote its senior executives. At a high level, &#x00A7; 713 differs from the removal provisions of Title 5 in two respects: (1) it creates a process for the removal or transfer of senior executives by the Secretary for poor performance with limited executive protections, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 713(a)-(d)(1), (f)-(g); and (2) it creates a process for an expedited MSPB review of a removal or transfer carried out under the statute, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 713(d)(2)-(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, with respect to the removal and transfer process, &#x00A7; 713 provides the Secretary with broader authority to remove or transfer a senior executive if "the <span class="Italic">performance</span> or misconduct of the individual warrants such removal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 713(a)(1) (emphasis added).[1] A senior executive removed or transferred under &#x00A7; 713 is not entitled to the thirty-day written notice requirement or the seven-day response period that are provided under Title 5. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 713(d)(1). Section 713 eliminates the moratorium on removals and transfers within 120 days of the appointment of a new agency head or, in some circumstances, the employee's most immediate supervisor. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 713(f)(2). Executives transferred under &#x00A7; 713 may only receive the annual rate of pay applicable to their new position, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 713(b)(1), whereas Title 5 allows the individual to receive the highest of various basic rates of pay, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3594(c)(1)(B)(i)-(iii). Finally, &#x00A7; 713 prohibits placing executives on administrative leave. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 713(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;"[M]isconduct includes neglect of duty, malfeasance, or failure to accept a directed reassignment or to accompany a position in a transfer of function." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 713(g)(2). The term "performance," which does not appear in &#x00A7; 7543(a) of Title 5, is undefined in &#x00A7; 713.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, with respect to the MSPB appeal process, &#x00A7; 713 creates an accelerated timeline for appeals to the MSPB and shortens the MSPB appeals themselves. For example, where Title 5 provides thirty days to appeal an adverse action to the MSPB, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(1), &#x00A7; 713 only provides seven, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 713(d)(2)(B). Section 713 also requires the MSPB, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(1), to refer all appeals to an administrative judge who "shall issue a decision not later than 21 days after the date of the appeal." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 713(e)(1). Additionally, the removal or transfer may not be stayed during the appeal to the administrative judge, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 713(e)(4), and the Secretary and the Board must ensure that the appeal is expedited, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 713(e)(6); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Veterans Access Act &#x00A7; 707(b)(1), (3), 128 Stat. at 1754, 1800 (requiring the Board to promulgate rules for the processing of expedited appeals under &#x00A7; 713 and authorizing the Board to waive any regulation as necessary for that purpose). Section 713 denies senior executives any type of pay, bonus, or benefit during their appeals. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 713(e)(5). In contrast to Title 5, administrative judges' decisions under &#x00A7; 713 are final and Board or judicial review is prohibited. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 713(e)(2) ("Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including section 7703 of title 5, the decision of an administrative judge...shall be final and shall not be subject to any further appeal.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We generally have jurisdiction over appeals of a final decision of the MSPB under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9), pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1). Ms. Helman and the government agree that Ms. Helman properly seeks review in this court of a "final order or decision of the Board" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(A) and that &#x00A7; 713(e)(2) cannot preclude judicial review of Ms. Helman's constitutional claims. Intervenors maintain, however, that this court does not have jurisdiction--not even to review Ms. Helman's constitutional claims--because of the language of &#x00A7; 713(e)(2). <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 713(e)(2) ("the decision of an administrative judge...shall be final and shall not be subject to any further appeal"). We have considered the Intervenors' arguments and find them to be unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has consistently declined to interpret provisions like &#x00A7; 713(e)(2) to preclude judicial review of colorable constitutional claims. <span class="Italic">See Webster v. Doe</span>, 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Robison</span>, 415 U.S. 361 (1974). The Court has explained that "where Congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to do so must be clear." <span class="Italic">Webster</span>, 486 U.S. at 603. Here, while Congress intended to prohibit judicial review of the merits of MSPB administrative judges' decisions, nothing in the statute or its legislative history indicates that Congress intended to take the additional step of precluding judicial review of constitutional questions. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction over Ms. Helman's constitutional claims under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9), pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to address the constitutionality of &#x00A7; 713, we first identify the constitutional flaw, if any, in the statute. With respect to this question, we agree with Ms. Helman and the government and conclude that by prohibiting Board review, Congress vests significant authority in an administrative judge in violation of the Appointments Clause. We carefully considered the Intervenors' arguments on this point but find them to be unpersuasive. Second, upon identifying the portions of the statute that are indeed unconstitutional, we determine whether those invalid portions are severable from the remainder of the statute. In addressing this question, we agree with the government that the problematic portions of the statute are severable and, thus, the proper remedy to the constitutional flaw in &#x00A7; 713 is to sever those portions of the statute and leave the remainder intact. We carefully considered the Intervenors' remedial arguments but find them to be unpersuasive. Finally, once we conclude that the invalid portions of the statute are severable, we determine whether actions taken under the original statute, as enacted, must be vacated. We conclude that the Secretary's decision to remove Ms. Helman and the administrative judge's affirmance of that decision, both under &#x00A7; 713 as enacted, may stand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We address the constitutionality of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 713 by discussing each step in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Appointments Clause provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The President] ...shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint...Officers of the United States...but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">U.S. Const. art. II, &#x00A7; 2, cl. 2. "Officers of the United States, does not include all employees of the United States." <span class="Italic">Buckley v. Valeo</span>, 424 U.S. 1, 126 n.162 (1976) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>). "Employees are lesser functionaries subordinate to officers of the United States," <span class="Italic">id</span>., and are not "selected in compliance with the strict requirements of Article II." <span class="Italic">Freytag v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue</span>, 501 U.S. 868, 880 (1991). Neither Ms. Helman nor the government contends that MSPB administrative judges are constitutionally appointed officers of the United States; they are hired as employees.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;MSPB administrative judges are employed under the Board's general authority to hire "employees." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204(j), 3101. The MSPB's Director of Financial and Administrative Management is charged with hiring MSPB administrative judges. <span class="Italic">See</span> MSPB, <span class="Italic">Organization, Functions &#x0026; Delegations of Authority</span> &#x00B6; 2.5.2.2 (Apr. 2011) (reflecting a general delegation of hiring authority to "[e]ffect appointments, make employment commitments, [and] arrange reporting dates" to the Office of Financial and Administrative Management). The Office of Financial and Administrative Management is an office of the Board's headquarters staff that handles a variety of administrative, budgetary, and personnel functions for the agency as a whole. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1200.10(b)(8). To be clear, we reserve judgment as to whether administrative judges are employees for purposes of the Appointments Clause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The Appointments Clause prevents Congress from dispensing power too freely." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Congress may not vest authority in employees such that "the degree of authority exercised by the [employee is] so 'significant' that it [i]s inconsistent with the classifications of 'lesser functionaries' or employees." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 881. Thus, there are "duties that may be performed by an employee not subject to the Appointments Clause," and then there are "significant" duties that can only be performed by officers of the United States. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 882. The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Freytag</span> examined the degree of authority considered "significant." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 880-82.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the questions in <span class="Italic">Freytag</span> was whether a special trial judge for the Tax Court is an employee or an inferior officer of the United States.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 880. In addressing this question, the Court examined, as a whole, "the significance of the duties and discretion that special trial judges possess" to determine whether the special trial judges were employees or inferior officers. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 881-82. The Court determined that the special trial judges were inferior officers, in part, because special trial judges "perform more than ministerial tasks"; they carry out "important functions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 881-82. Those important functions performed by the special trial judges included "tak[ing] testimony, conduct[ing] trials, rul[ing] on the admissibility of evidence, and hav[ing] the power to enforce compliance with discovery orders." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Additionally, "[i]n the course of carrying out these important functions, the special trial judges exercise[d] significant discretion." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 882.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the alternative, the Court also found that the special trial judges were inferior officers because in some cases, "the Chief Judge may assign special trial judges to <span class="Italic">render the decisions</span> of the Tax Court in declaratory judgment proceedings and limited-amount tax cases." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). Having the authority to render the decisions of the Tax Court, and thereby "exercise independent authority," also made the special trial judges inferior officers. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 882.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Against this backdrop, we must determine whether, through &#x00A7; 713, the authority Congress purports to vest in MSPB administrative judges is significant authority in violation of the Appointments Clause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the conventional Title 5 MSPB appeal process, the Board typically refers its cases to an administrative judge, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(1), but once the administrative judge makes an initial decision, the Board may review the decision and render its own final decision, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1). Through this framework, Title 5 permissibly vests in the members of the Board--<span id="Page_2231"></span>appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1201--the authority to render a final decision overturning another officer's decision. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701. By contrast, &#x00A7; 713 prohibits any review of the administrative judge's decision, thereby vesting this authority entirely in an administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both Ms. Helman and the government maintain that the authority Congress vests in an administrative judge via &#x00A7; 713--final and unreviewable discretion to affirm or overturn the decision of a cabinet-level official--is significant. We agree. As in <span class="Italic">Freytag</span> where, in some instances, the special trial judges could render the decisions of the Tax Court, the authority here to render the decisions of the MSPB, and thereby exercise significant discretion and independent authority, is also a "significant" duty that can only be performed by officers of the United States. Indeed, granting such final decision-making authority and giving the administrative judge the last word on affirming or overturning a cabinet-level official directly conflicts with the definition of employee: a lesser functionary who is <span class="Italic">subordinate</span> to officers of the United States. <span class="Italic">Freytag</span>, 501 U.S. at 881. An administrative judge with this authority is no longer subordinate to any officer. Further, when we compare the &#x00A7; 713 authority to render a decision to implement or overturn the Secretary's decision to the functions found to be important in <span class="Italic">Freytag</span>, it is clear that this &#x00A7; 713 decision making authority is also an "important function," and surely "more than a ministerial task." <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we conclude that the authority to render a final decision, affirming or overturning the Secretary of the DVA's removal decision, is a significant duty that can only be performed by officers of the United States. Through &#x00A7; 713, Congress purports to vest this significant authority in administrative judges who are hired as employees. This is unconstitutional under the Appointments Clause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we declare invalid those portions of &#x00A7; 713 that are expressly keyed to the finality of the administrative judge's decision. This includes &#x00A7; 713(e)(2) in its entirety and portions of &#x00A7; 713(e)(3) and &#x00A7; 713(e)(5).[4] <span class="Italic">Cf. Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Donovan</span>, 766 F.2d 1550, 1560 (D.C. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock</span>, 480 U.S. 678 (1987) (severing one portion of subsection 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1552(f)(3) and leaving the remainder of the section--including the first sentence of the subsection--unaffected). In particular, a portion of &#x00A7; 713(e)(3) is invalid because the word "final" creates a backdoor grant of final decision-making authority to MSPB administrative judges. For example, the MSPB administrative judge may simply decline to render a decision within 21 days, thereby causing the employee's removal or transfer to become final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Removing the invalid provisions, &#x00A7; 713(e)(3) now reads as follows: "(3) In any case in which the administrative judge cannot issue a decision in accordance with the 21-day requirement under paragraph (1), the removal or transfer is final. In such a case, the Merit Systems Protection Board shall, within 14 days after the date that such removal or transfer is final, submit to Congress...." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 713(e)(3) (strikethrough added to indicate invalidated portion). Similarly, &#x00A7; 713(e)(5) now reads as follows: "(5) During the period beginning on the date on which an individual appeals a removal from the civil service under subsection (d) and ending on the date that the administrative judge issues a final decision on such appeal, such individual may not receive any pay...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 713(e)(5) (strikethrough added to indicate invalidated portion).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Looking to the remainder of the Appeal Provisions, it is clear that the revised appeal process advances the ends that Congress sought to achieve by the statute's enactment. The Appeal Provisions retain many other provisions that help to accomplish the same objectives Congress wished to achieve by prohibiting review of the administrative judges' decisions. In <span class="Italic">New York v. United States</span>, the Supreme Court concluded that "[c]ommon sense suggests that where Congress has enacted a statutory scheme for an obvious purpose, and where Congress has included a series of provisions operating as incentives to achieve that purpose, the invalidation of one of the incentives should not ordinarily cause Congress' overall intent to be frustrated." 505 U.S. 144, 186 (1992); <span class="Italic">see also Booker</span>, 543 U.S. at 264 ("The system remaining after excision, while lacking the mandatory features that Congress enacted, retains other features that help to further these objectives."). The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">New York</span> held that, after severance, the Act was consistent with Congress's objective because it still included two incentives that operated in service of that objective. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 187.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, if Congress enacted &#x00A7; 713 principally to expedite final removal, as Ms. Helman suggests, then it has included myriad provisions that operate to achieve that purpose. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 713(d)(2)(B), (e)(1), (e)(4)-(6). Therefore, the invalidation of one of these provisions, namely the provision prohibiting review of the administrative judge decision, does not cause Congress's overall intent to be entirely frustrated. What remains of &#x00A7; 713 includes <span class="Italic">five</span> provisions that operate to achieve the purpose of expediting the final removal of senior executives terminated from the DVA. Specifically, the appeal process under &#x00A7; 713 is initiated sooner, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 713(d)(2)(B), the administrative judges' decisions are completed in only 21 days, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 713(e)(1); the removal or transfer cannot be stayed during the appeal, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 713(e)(4); the senior executive is not entitled to any type of pay, bonus, or benefit while appealing the decision of removal, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 713(e)(5); and the Secretary and the Board must ensure that the appeal is expedited, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 713(e)(6); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Veterans Access Act &#x00A7; 707(b)(1), (3), 128 Stat. at 1800 (requiring the Board to promulgate rules for the processing of expedited appeals under &#x00A7; 713 and authorizing the Board to waive any regulation as necessary for that purpose). Thus, because the Appeal Provisions retain many provisions that help to accomplish the same objectives Congress wished to achieve by prohibiting review of the administrative judges' decisions, the remaining Appeal Provisions are consistent with Congress's basic objectives in enacting the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we conclude that we are not required to invalidate &#x00A7; 713 in its entirety. First, the Appeal Provisions, as a whole, are clearly severable from &#x00A7; 713, allowing us to retain the Removal Provisions. Second, the specific unconstitutional portions of the Appeal Provisions--namely, &#x00A7; 713(e)(2) and related portions of &#x00A7; 713(e)(3) and &#x00A7; 713(e)(5)--are also severable from the remaining Appeal Provisions. Thus, upon severing &#x00A7; 713(e)(2) and the two related portions, &#x00A7; 713 remains fully operative as a law. Nothing in the statute's language, structure, and legislative history makes it evident that Congress, faced with the limitations imposed by the Constitution, would have preferred no statute <span class="Italic">at all</span> to &#x00A7; 713 with a modified MSPB appeal process. We therefore must sustain the remaining provisions of &#x00A7; 713.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that by prohibiting Board review of administrative judges' decisions, Congress impermissibly vests through &#x00A7; 713 significant authority in administrative judges. Accordingly, we declare &#x00A7; 713(e)(2) and related portions of &#x00A7; 713(e)(3) and &#x00A7; 713(e)(5) invalid, but conclude that they are severable from the remainder of &#x00A7; 713. Thus, the proper remedy to the constitutional flaw in &#x00A7; 713 is to sever those portions of the statute and leave the remainder intact. Upon severing the offending portions of &#x00A7; 713, Board review of administrative judges' decisions is now permitted. Accordingly, the appropriate relief here is to remand to the Board for its review of the administrative judge's decision affirming Ms. Helman's removal. Ms. Helman is free to pursue before the Board her due process claims and the broader constitutional question of whether administrative judges hearing appeals subject to Board review under &#x00A7; 7701 of Title 5 are inferior officers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After <span class="Italic">Helman</span>, the 2017 statute took MSPB out of the review process entirely, relegating actions against SES personnel under that statute to review within the VA through its grievance procedure or in federal court.</p>
