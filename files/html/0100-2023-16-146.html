<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-146"><span class="space">a.</span> Newspaper</h5>
<p class="noindent">A union official has a protected right to write a letter to a newspaper critical of managers and management policy. Federal labor law gives a union the license to use intemperate, abusive, or insulting language without fear of restraint or penalty if it believes the rhetoric to be an effective means to make a point; erroneous assertions lose their protected status only if they are published with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard of whether they are true or false. But not all comments by union officers related to labor relations fall within the protection of the Statute. To the extent that a union officer includes in his statements or publications about existing labor relations problems remarks that are derogatory or defamatory, undermining the credibility and the confidence of U.S. government officials in a foreign country and that have no reasonable nexus to his union's legitimate labor relations problems, the union agent loses the protection of the Statute. <span class="Italic">US Forces Korea/Eighth US Army and NFFE Local 1363</span>, 17 FLRA 718, 728-29 (1985) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">Racially derogatory terms, e.g., "Uncle Tom" and "spook," went beyond robust debate and did not warrant protection against a reprimand of the union official who was responsible for a newsletter that employed the characterizations to criticize a supervisor. In the judgment of FLRA, management need not tolerate having its members subjected to defamatory and libelous statements. The terms used were different from "scab" or other insulting but descriptive epithets; the latter terms, although derogatory, did not carry the same vilification of an individual by reference to an entire group or race, rather than by a particular course of action. <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE Local 2301</span>, 26 FLRA 114 (1987). The D.C. Circuit affirmed FLRA, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2301 v. FLRA</span>, 878 F.2d 460, 464 (1989):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we note that the parties' exclusive focus on the "right to assist" clause of &#x00A7; 7102 may seem somewhat anomalous, given that the more specific provisions of &#x00A7; 7102(1) appears to govern this case; in publishing the column here at issue, Carter was unquestionably acting for the Union "in the capacity of a representative and...in that capacity,...present[ing] the views of the labor organization." As such, it would appear that because his column was distributed not to "heads of agencies[,]...other officials of the executive branch of the Government, [or] the Congress, or other appropriate authorities" but rather to members of the Union and of the general public, it does not fall within the statute's specific provision protecting representative speech....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In any event, since all of the parties have assumed, both in this court and in the proceedings before the agency, that the case is governed by the general "right to...assist" clause of &#x00A7; 7102, rather than the more specific "right...to present...views" clause of &#x00A7; 7102(1), we will assume, without deciding, that is the case....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have no doubt that the FLRA could reasonably conclude that racial name-calling is inherently a threat to the maintenance of employee discipline. Indeed, the Union does not take issue with this general proposition. In this case, however, the Union claims that the Authority erred in failing to view the terms...in their context....&#8197;[T]he Union claims that the column, properly understood, actually advanced "the union's interest[&#8197;] in <span class="Italic">promoting</span> an effective EEO program."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Union, as did the FLRA, that the column, read as a whole, could be seen as a legitimate criticism of Cole's performance both as a manager and as chairman of the EEO Committee. We also agree that the intraracial character of the remarks is a relevant nuance that makes them somewhat more difficult to assess: the thrust of Carter's criticism of Cole clearly was not that Cole's alleged shortcomings were due to his race, but rather that he had betrayed his race by serving as a token appointment and failing adequately to champion the interests of black employees as against those of white management.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It was not unreasonable, however, for the FLRA also to find that Carter's remarks constituted "the disparagement of a manager based on racial stereotyping," and that, as such, they did not fall within the protection of the statute. Even though Carter's statements were directed at a member of his own race, they could legitimately be understood as a broader appeal--criticism of Cole being only the vehicle--to further racial polarization between black VA employees and white managers....&#8197;The FLRA could reasonably conclude that, due to the inherently disruptive nature of statements tending to generate or to exacerbate racial conflict in the workplace, such statements "have no place in the Federal labor-management relations program." Given the difficult balance the agency must strike when the statutory protection of employee speech conflicts with the Government's need for discipline in the workplace, we cannot conclude that it acted unreasonably in striking that balance as it did in this case....</p>
<p class="noindent">Denying exceptions to an arbitrator's award concluding that the union improperly placed a threatening statement in its newsletter, <span class="Italic">Indep. Union of Pension Employees and PBGC</span>, 68 FLRA 999, 1012-13 (2015) (recon. den., 69 FLRA 158 (2016)), recognized no statutory protection for the statement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also contends that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute. The Union argues that &#x00A7; 7102 "guarantees employees and unions the right to communicate about working conditions and union matters 'freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal.'" Section 7102 guarantees, "[e]xcept as otherwise provided under this chapter," certain employee rights, including: the right "to act for a labor organization in the capacity of a representative and the right, in that capacity, to present the views of the labor organization"; and the right "to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by employees under this chapter." However, as noted above, the rights enumerated under &#x00A7; 7102 are subject to the remainder of the Statute, including &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1)--which the Arbitrator found that the Union had violated with its newsletter. In short, &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1) limits the rights under &#x00A7; 7102, and &#x00A7; 7102 cannot operate as a shield to protect the Union from its violation of &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1). Because the Union violated &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1), the award is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute, and we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union similarly argues that the award is contrary to law because the Statute protects "the rights of union members to receive information." However, the Union cites no support for the contention that any alleged right that union members may have to receive information permits a union to violate &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union contends that &#x00A7; 7116(e) of the Statute protects the newsletter. Section 7116(e) of the Statute states, in part, that "[t]he expression of any personal view, argument, [or] opinion...shall not, if the expression contains no threat or reprisal or force or promise of benefit or was not made under coercive conditions,...constitute a [ULP]." Additionally, well-settled labor precedent establishes that neither the First Amendment nor the speech guarantees found in federal labor laws protect threatening or coercive statements.[209] In the current case, the Arbitrator found that the article in question contained a threat--a finding the Union does not successfully challenge--and so, the article loses its protection under &#x00A7; 7116(e) and the expression therein constituted a ULP.[210]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[209]<span class="Italic">Cf. NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co.</span>, 395 U.S. 575, 616-20 (1969) (ruling that threats against employees do not receive protection from the NLRA's counterpart to &#x00A7; 7116(e) of the Statute); <span class="Italic">NLRB v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 526 F.3d 729, 732 (11th Cir. 2008) (ruling that the NLRA's counterpart to &#x00A7; 7116(e) of the Statute incorporates the First Amendment, but a "threat of retaliation against an employee for engaging in protected conduct" does "not enjoy Speech Clause immunity").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[210]<span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE Local 987, Warner Robins, Ga</span>, 35 FLRA 720, 724 (1990) (standard for determining whether a union's statement violates &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1) is an objective one); <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 15 FLRA 488, 490 (1984) (remarks in the publication at issue, which were of sufficient particularity that the identity of the unit employee could be ascertained, violated &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1) as they reasonably could have a coercive effect on the exercise by employees of their protected rights under the Statute); <span class="Italic">Okla. City Air Logistics Ctr. (AFLC), Tinker Air Force Base, Okla</span>, 6 FLRA 159, 160-61 (1981) (discussing the purpose and intent of &#x00A7; 7116(e)); <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Va</span>., 5 FLRA 788, 791, 810 (1981) (adopting judge's finding that agency's speech was protected by &#x00A7; 7116(e) of the Statute and the First Amendment where it "contained no explicit threat" against employees and "was not attended by coercive conditions.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, as to the Union's claims concerning both &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116(e) and 7102, the right to free speech in labor disputes does not permit a union to coerce employees in the exercise of those employees' rights.[211] To allow the use of the Statute as a shield to protect the Union's coercive activity would undermine the valid interests of Congress in enacting the Statute. In the instant case, such a misapplication of the Statute would result in the Union being able to, with impunity: (1) retaliate against an employee for testifying on behalf of the Agency; (2) chill other employees from exercising their right to provide similar testimony at Authority and arbitral proceedings in the future; and (3) potentially obstruct the ability of both arbitrators and the Authority to receive relevant evidence in proceedings under the Statute. Such a result directly contradicts the protections given to employees by Congress under the Statute.[212] Therefore, the Union's argument fails.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[211]Although we denied Union's First Amendment argument in Section IV.I. above without reaching the merits of that argument, were the Authority to reach the merits of that argument, this same reasoning would lead us to reject that argument as well.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Citing <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, 315th Airlift Wing v. FLRA</span> (<span class="Italic">Air Force</span>),[213] the Union claims that "speech must constitute a threat of force or actual reprisal in order to possibly lose protection" under &#x00A7; 7116(e) of the Statute. <span id="Page_1363"></span>However, <span class="Italic">Air Force</span> only concerns the Authority's flagrant-misconduct standard under &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute, which is not at issue here because no union official was disciplined or threatened with any discipline.[215] Because this case does not address &#x00A7; 7116(e), <span class="Italic">Air Force</span> does not have any applicability here. Furthermore, &#x00A7; 7116(e) removes protection from a "threat of reprisal or force"[216] not, as the Union alleges, from "a threat of force or actual reprisal." In short, the Union's misreading overlooks the fact that a threat does not need to be a threat of force to lose protection. The Union's misreading of the Statute cannot support its argument.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The right to publicize matters affecting unit employees' terms and conditions of employment is protected under section 7102 of the Statute....&#8197;Management's interference with that right violates section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the statutory right to publicize matters affecting working conditions extends to using the employer's property as the site of communication--as in handbilling in nonwork areas--that right does not extend to using the employer's property as the means of communication....&#8197;Thus, neither a union nor an employee has a statutory right to post material in public areas on agency property. <span class="Italic">Federal Election Commission</span>, 20 FLRA 20, 21 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Judge found that the <span class="Italic">Command Post</span> "beyond question is an arm of the Base[.]" We agree with the Judge that the control exerted over the <span class="Italic">Command Post</span> by the Respondent extends to the newspaper's advertising space. We find that advertising in an agency's newspaper is similar to posting on agency bulletin boards or in other public areas....&#8197;Access to an agency's property, including agency-controlled newspapers, requires the agency to provide the means for the communication. Because placing an advertisement in an agency-controlled newspaper is analogous to posting material on agency property and because a union does not have a statutory right to post material on an agency's property, we find that a union does not have a statutory right under section 7102 to advertise in an agency's newspaper....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although a union does not have a statutory right to advertise in an agency-controlled newspaper, it may establish a right to advertise in such a newspaper or a right of access to other agency property by contract or past practice. Where a right of access to agency property has been established by past practice, an employer would reasonably tend to discourage union activity in violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute if: (1) the employer discriminatorily denies the union the use of an agency bulletin board or other public area...or (2) the employer removes the union material from the employer's property where the union had been permitted to post notices and the posted material meets the employer's established standards....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a union's right of access to agency property is established through collective bargaining, however, the remedy for a violation of that right in most instances is contractual, not statutory....&#8197;Of course, if an agency is found to have repudiated provisions of a negotiated agreement, that repudiation constitutes an unfair labor practice....&#8197;To the extent that previous Authority decisions suggest that, absent a finding of contract repudiation, an unfair labor practice may be found for a violation of a union's right of access to agency property that has been established solely through collective bargaining, those cases will no longer be followed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Election Commission</span>, 20 FLRA at 21; <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Prison System, Federal Correctional Institution, Milan</span>, 17 FLRA 1023, 1036-37 (1985).</p>
