<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-25"><span class="space">8.</span> Integration or "Zipper" Clause</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Settlement agreements frequently include integration ("zipper" or "merger") clauses providing that "there are no other agreements, oral, express, or implied." These clauses are given effect. An appellant was unable to set aside a settlement that led to his retirement because of his reliance on an alleged oral representation by an agency official that he would be allowed to retire with 30 years of service rather than the 27 years of service shown on his personnel records. In addition to a reference to the integration clause, the Board stated, first, "the fact that an agreement is silent as to a term does not mean it is ambiguous," and, second, "[w]hen a contract is silent as to a term, the term is removed from the Board's jurisdiction and the Board lacks the authority to unilaterally modify the material terms in a settlement agreement." <span class="Italic">DeLuna v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 526, 530 (1993) (characterizing appellant's PFR as an attack on the validity of the settlement agreement rather than an enforcement petition seeking enforcement of the alleged oral agreement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Turner v. DHS</span>, 95 MSPR 688, 692-94 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-12 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Turner v. DHS</span>, 121 Fed. Appx. 852 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>, further explained the ins and outs of merger provisions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the benefits issues raised by the appellant are not addressed within the four corners of the settlement agreement, parties may supplement an integrated agreement with consistent additional terms unless that agreement is completely integrated. An agreement is integrated if the writing constitutes a final expression of one or more terms of an agreement. "Where the parties reduce an agreement to writing which in view of its completeness and specificity reasonably appears to be a complete agreement, it is taken to be an integrated agreement unless it is established by other evidence that the writing did not constitute a final expression." An agreement is not considered to be completely integrated where the writing omits a consistent additional term which is agreed to for separate consideration or where such a term might naturally be omitted from the writing under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, it appears from the evidence before the Board that the parties may have orally agreed to certain provisions related to the appellant's benefits which were not reduced to writing in the settlement agreement. This indicates that the agreement is not fully integrated. Moreover, because the appellant's benefits may flow from the cancellation of her removal and her reinstatement to a temporary position under the settlement agreement, terms regarding such benefits might naturally be omitted from the writing under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the settlement agreement contains a "merger" clause, which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he parties mutually agree to the following terms and conditions, and further agree that these terms and conditions contained herein constitute the full agreement of the parties, and that these terms and conditions shall fully resolve the above-styled and captioned appeal, and that, except as specified herein, no other promises, conditions, or obligations are made by or imposed on the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such a clause may "negate the apparent authority of an agent to vary orally the written terms, and if agreed to is likely to conclude the issue whether the agreement is completely integrated. Consistent additional terms may then be excluded even though their omission would have been natural in the absence of such a clause." The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that a merger clause conclusively establishes that integration of the agreement is total, unless the document is obviously incomplete or the merger clause was included as a result of mutual mistake, fraud, or another reason for setting aside the agreement<span class="Italic">. Rumsfeld v. Freedom NY, Inc.</span>, 329 F.3d 1320, 1328-29 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">see McAbee Construction, Inc. v. United States</span>, 97 F.3d 1431, 1434 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (a party carries an "extremely heavy burden" in overcoming a merger clause, which is an "attestation to the document's finality and completeness"); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Farrero v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 487 &#x00B6; 7 (1999) (the Board found that the appellant did not establish that additional unwritten terms were part of the settlement agreement that included a merger clause), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 232 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table);<span class="Italic"> see also Brown v. Department of the Interior</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 546 &#x00B6; 24 (2000) (an appellant is prohibited by the parol evidence rule from introducing extrinsic evidence to prove that the Board should enforce terms that were not included in a fully integrated agreement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the settlement agreement on its face is not obviously incomplete. Nor has the appellant demonstrated that any mutual mistake or fraud occurred regarding the inclusion of the merger clause. It appears that, at a minimum, the appellant and agency agree that the appellant is entitled to retain her insurance benefits, to participate in TSP, and to have her sick leave restored. However, due to the existence of the merger clause in the settlement agreement, the Board finds that the agreement is completely integrated. Under the circumstances, any claim the appellant has regarding additional terms does not provide a basis to invalidate the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's assertion that the agency agreed to reinstate or reassign her to a permanent position, the settlement agreement contains no such provision. The agency argues that the appellant is confusing an earlier draft settlement agreement with the one that was actually executed. It appears that, if there was any mistake concerning this issue, it was the appellant's alone, and unilateral mistakes are not bases for invalidating settlement agreements<span class="Italic">. See Virgil v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 109, 113-14 (1997). The appellant has shown no reason for setting aside the settlement agreement in this matter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal the Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Turner v. DHS</span>, 121 Fed. Appx. 852, 853-54 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An integrated agreement constitutes a final expression of the terms of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Restatement (Second) of Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 209(1) (1981). We have previously held that "integration clause[s] create a strong presumption that a contract is, as it purports to be, a fully-integrated agreement. One attempting to add terms to a contract with an integration clause carries an extremely heavy burden in overcoming this attestation to the document's finality and completeness." <span class="Italic">Rumsfeld v. Freedom NY, Inc.</span>, 329 F.3d 1320, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turner cannot overcome the "extremely heavy burden" required by <span class="Italic">Rumsfeld</span>. The settlement agreement contains the following integration clause:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">By executing this Settlement Agreement, the parties mutually agree to the following terms and conditions, and further agree that <span class="Italic">these terms and conditions contained herein constitute the full agreement of the parties</span>, and that these terms and conditions shall fully resolve the...appeal, and that, except as specified herein, no other promises, conditions or obligations are made by or imposed on the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(emphasis added). A similar provision provided that the parties "understand and fully agree that they will receive no other relief or other consideration beyond that recited in this Settlement Agreement." In addition to these clear provisions, Turner was represented by counsel in negotiating the settlement agreement, which both Turner and her counsel signed, and should reasonably have known that the settlement agreement constituted the entire agreement of the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As previously noted, the settlement agreement provided that Turner would be deemed placed in leave without pay status from April 25, 2003 to January 5, 2004, and provided with a temporary position "not to exceed one year" beginning January 5, 2004. The settlement agreement contained no provision that Turner would be placed in a position, permanent or temporary, reflecting her former pay, leave, and benefits status. Thus, Turner cannot now ask that this court add these provisions into the settlement agreement or void the agreement because these provisions allegedly should have been included. If Turner wished to be placed in a position reflecting her former pay, leave, and benefits status, she should have bargained for the inclusion of express provisions providing for such benefits in the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit explained the significance of an integration clause--placing an "extremely heavy burden" in overcoming plain contract language--in <span class="Italic">Boque v. VA</span>, 314 Fed. Appx. 299, 300-01 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2006, Boque was employed as a postgraduate medical resident at the Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA"). On April 14, 2006, he was separated from his position for "unprofessional behavior." Boque appealed his separation and on January 3, 2007, Boque and the VA executed a settlement agreement. In exchange for Boque's dismissal of <span id="Page_4777"></span>his Board appeal and his agreement to submit his voluntary resignation, the VA agreed to verify his employment to prospective employers and to expunge the removal action from his file. Relevant to this appeal, the agreement also contained two additional provisions. First, Paragraph 4 of the agreement stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Agency agrees to issue a letter to the Appellant certifying that the Appellant fulfilled the minimum requirement of twelve months in clinical training in the subspecialty of Critical Care Medicine.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, Paragraph 8(d) of the agreement also set forth an integration clause that stated that "this Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties, and there are no other terms or commitments, verbal or written."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 13, 2007, Dr. Rodriguez, Chief of the Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Training Program, issued a letter pursuant to Paragraph 4 using nearly identical language to that set forth in the settlement agreement. The letter stated the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This is to certify that [D]octor Miguel Boque fulfilled the minimum requirement of twelve months in clinical training in the Subspecialty of Critical Care Medicine at our Training Program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Boque did not accept the letter. Rather, he requested "a certificate that is valid for 'credential purposes.'" In particular, Boque asserted that the letter should indicate the dates during which he participated in the training program and requested that the document be labeled "Certificate of Training."<span class="Italic"></span> The VA refused to modify the letter or issue a certificate and Boque appealed to the Board for enforcement of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board denied Boque's petition. In doing so, the Administrative Judge ("AJ") determined that the VA complied with the settlement agreement. The AJ found that under the agreement, the VA was required to issue a letter certifying that Boque fulfilled the minimum requirement of twelve months in clinical training in the subspecialty of critical care medicine, and was not required to specify when the training occurred or to issue a certificate. Thus, the AJ determined that the February 13, 2007 letter met the requirements of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Boque appealed the AJ's decision to the full Board, which denied his petition for review, thereby rendering the AJ's decision final. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113. Boque timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Boque primarily argues that the Board erred by failing to take into account the intent of the negotiating parties. Boque contends that he intended to obtain credit for the grade he obtained while he trained at the VA as part of the critical care program. Moreover, Boque asserts that the VA failed to comply with an implied clause of fair dealing and failed to act in good faith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, the government argues the AJ correctly determined that the VA complied with the settlement agreement. According to the government, the letter issued by Dr. Rodriquez strictly complied with the unambiguous language of the settlement agreement. Moreover, the government contends that Boque's demand for a certificate as if he completed a residency is unsupportable in light of the settlement agreement's integration clause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government. It is well-settled that "a settlement agreement is a contract [and]...interpretation of the terms of a contract is a question of law." <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In interpreting a contract, we first look to the plain language of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Gould, Inc. v. U.S.</span>, 935 F.2d 1271, 1274 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Here, the agreement clearly provides that the VA was required to issue a letter to Boque "certifying that [he] has fulfilled the minimum requirements of twelve months in clinical training in the subspecialty of Critical Care Medicine." The February 13, 2007 letter issued by Dr. Rodriguez, which contained nearly identical language, clearly met that requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we are unpersuaded by Boque's assertion that the letter should have contained additional information based on the parties' intent, particularly in light of the integration clause contained in the agreement. Indeed, a party "attempting to add terms to a contract with an integration clause 'carries an extremely heavy burden in overcoming this attestation to the document's finality and completeness.'" <span class="Italic">Rumsfeld v. Freedom NY, Inc.</span>, 329 F.3d 1320, 1328 Fed. Cir. 2003). Boque fails to demonstrate that, notwithstanding the integration clause contained in the agreement, the VA was required to include any information beyond the plain language set forth in Paragraph 4. Thus, because Boque fails to meet his extremely heavy burden, his argument fails.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, we are likewise unpersuaded by Boque's assertion that the VA failed to act in good faith and failed to comply with an implied clause of fair dealing. The record demonstrates that the VA upheld its obligations under the agreement in part by issuing the February 13, 2007 letter and is devoid of any evidence indicating that the VA acted in bad faith during its dealings with Boque.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit also applied an integration clause in <span class="Italic">Melton v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP No. 2006-3346):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The settlement agreement stipulated a lump sum payment of $32,000 to Ms. Melton to put her claim to rest. The relevant terms of the settlement agreement include the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;The agency agrees to pay Ms. Melton the sum of $32,000.00 within 30 calendar days from the effective date of this agreement for promises set forth below....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">9.&#x2003;Ms. Melton fully understands her removal from federal service, as cited above, will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">14.&#x2003;This agreement constitutes the complete understanding between the parties. No other promises or agreements shall be binding unless signed by all parties and expressly designated as an amendment to this agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Melton's present appeal is for enforcement of the settlement agreement, based on an alleged violation by the Agency. The alleged violation is the Government's effort to recover an erroneous overpayment of $8,056.76. The erroneous overpayment stems from a period, prior to her removal, when Ms. Melton was paid while absent without leave (AWOL).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Melton claims that the Government is not entitled to recover this debt because allegedly her debts were settled by the settlement agreement. The Agency asserts that repayment of the debt was discussed during the settlement negotiations and that the settlement was increased by $10,000 specifically to facilitate this repayment. The settlement agreement, however, contains no mention of Ms. Melton's AWOL debt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract, and its construction is a question of law which this court reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Conant v. Office of Pers. Mgm't</span>, 255 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001). When interpreting a contract, we first ascertain whether the contract clearly states the parties' understanding. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> To the extent the contract is clearly stated and understood by the parties, it is enforced according to its terms. <span class="Italic">Pagan v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 170 F.3d 1368, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 1999). If the language of the contract is sufficiently clear, the inquiry ends there. <span class="Italic">Textron Def. Sys. v. Widnall</span>, 143 F.3d 1465, 1469 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">see Greco v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988) ("Only if there is ambiguity should parol evidence be considered."). If any ambiguity is found, our role is to implement the intent of the parties at the time the contract was made. <span class="Italic">Pagan</span>, 170 F.3d at 1371.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the settlement agreement is silent about Ms. Melton's AWOL debt. The most relevant sections are paragraphs 1 and 9, and these paragraphs specify a lump sum payment to Ms. Melton in exchange for her removal from the Agency. Paragraph 14 adds that "[n]o other promises or agreements shall be binding unless signed by all parties and expressly designated as an amendment to this agreement." Nothing in the settlement agreement addresses whether the Agency may or may not collect debts duly owed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, parol evidence on the matter of Ms. Melton's AWOL debt is inapposite. In the unambiguous language of the agreement itself, the Agency did not agree to waive its right to collect Ms. Melton's AWOL debt nor is there any implication of such a waiver. In a petition for enforcement of a contract, only the terms of the contract may be enforced. We cannot rewrite the contract or insert words to which a party has never agreed. <span class="Italic">Am. Capital Corp. v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp.</span>, No. 05-5150, 2006 WL 3055912, at *3 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 30, 2006). Because the settlement agreement is silent on the matter, Ms. Melton cannot now procure a waiver of her debts through a petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agreement excludes a term, and if the agreement contains an integration clause, the expectation by the appellant that the term is embraced by the agreement will not suffice to place it there, as the Federal Circuit noted of an agreement to restore sick leave, used by the appellant, who argued that the salary payment through sick leave should have included a pay premium, Law Enforcement Availability Pay, <span class="Italic">Coker v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 324 Fed. Appx. 912, 914-17 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Coker worked as a criminal investigator with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an agency within the Department of Commerce. On February 22, 2007, the agency issued a notice removing him from his position for failing to provide accurate time and attendance information on official documents. Mr. Coker filed an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board challenging his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Coker and the agency then entered into a settlement agreement in which the agency agreed to rescind the initial removal action and to replace it with an action removing him for failure to satisfy the medical requirements of his position. Mr. Coker agreed to submit medical documentation demonstrating his inability to meet those requirements. As part of the agreement, the agency was required to reinstate Mr. Coker's sick leave balance in the amount of 1,399 hours and to approve his use of sick leave retroactively from March 2, 2007, to the effective date <span id="Page_4778"></span>of his removal. The settlement agreement included a release in which Mr. Coker agreed to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[w]aive, release and forever discharge the Agency...from any claims, demands, or causes of action, which the Appellant has or may have, arising from his MSPB appeal or from his employment with the Agency. This release includes but is not limited to a release of any right to administrative, judicial or congressional relief, or any other type of relief, or of any claim to back pay, attorney's fees and costs, or other type of compensation, except what is specifically set forth in paragraph 3 [pertaining to the rescission of the initial removal, issuance of the new removal for failure to meet the medical requirements, and reinstatement of Mr. Coker's sick leave balance].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement also contained an integration clause:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">TOTALITY OF AGREEMENT. This Settlement Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and represents full and final resolution of all aspects of the claims which Appellant may have against the Agency arising out of his appeal to the MSPB, as cited above, or his employment with the Agency. No other conditions or assurances, expressed or implied, are included.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 29, 2007, the Board approved the settlement agreement and dismissed Mr. Coker's case, while retaining jurisdiction to ensure compliance with the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with the settlement agreement, the agency retroactively reinstated Mr. Coker and placed him on paid sick leave for the period from March 2, 2007, through September 2, 2007, when he was removed for failure to meet the medical requirements of his position because of hearing loss. Mr. Coker's sick leave payments did not include Law Enforcement Availability Pay ("LEAP"), a type of premium pay provided to federal criminal investigators who are required to work, or be available to work, substantial amounts of unscheduled duty beyond their 40-hour work week. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a. The agency explained that it had canceled Mr. Coker's certification for eligibility for availability pay on the ground that his medical condition prevented him from performing unscheduled duty during the period in question. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.184(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 31, 2007, Mr. Coker filed a petition for enforcement of the settlement agreement. He contended that the agency's decision not to include availability pay as part of his compensation for his hours of approved sick leave breached the agreement. The administrative judge assigned to the enforcement action concluded that the settlement agreement did not obligate the agency to provide availability pay to Mr. Coker. The administrative judge therefore issued a decision denying the petition for enforcement. After the full Board denied Mr. Coker's petition for review, he filed a petition for review by this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Law Enforcement Availability Pay Act ("LEAP Act") provides that a criminal investigator who is eligible to receive availability pay shall receive such pay while on approved sick leave or annual leave. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(f)(1)(B). The administrative judge explained that because the settlement agreement "was silent regarding LEAP," Mr. Coker was not entitled to availability pay. Mr. Coker contends that the LEAP Act was "expressly incorporated into the agreement as a matter of law," and that the agency was therefore required to provide availability pay for the period in which he was on approved sick leave status pursuant to the agreement. That argument is unpersuasive for several reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To begin with, the right to receive availability pay was not "expressly" incorporated into the settlement agreement. As the administrative judge made clear, no portion of the agreement addressed the issue of availability pay. Moreover, the settlement agreement contained an integration clause that clarified that no other express or implied assurances were included in the agreement. We therefore discern no error in the administrative judge's conclusion that the settlement agreement did not expressly incorporate the right to receive availability pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Coker argues that he was automatically entitled to availability pay incident to the agency's obligation to pay him for his sick leave. But in the settlement agreement Mr. Coker explicitly waived his right to "any...type of compensation, except what is specifically set forth in paragraph 3." Availability pay is a type of compensation, and paragraph 3 of the settlement agreement did not specifically provide for such compensation. Mr. Coker therefore waived any right he might otherwise have had to seek availability pay under the LEAP Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Coker claims that on other occasions he had received availability pay while he was on approved administrative leave or sick leave. For that reason, Mr. Coker argues that his entitlement to availability pay was implicit in the settlement agreement based on his course of dealing with the agency. Even assuming that, as Mr. Coker alleges, he had previously received availability pay while he was on sick leave, his course-of-dealing argument is without merit. Evidence of the parties' course of dealing constitutes parol evidence that is typically not relevant to the interpretation of a contract unless that contract is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">United States v. Ford Motor Co.,</span> 463 F.3d 1267, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">Barron Bancshares, Inc. v. United States,</span> 366 F.3d 1360, 1735-36 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Because the settlement agreement made no reference to availability pay and expressly released the agency from any claims for compensation beyond that specifically referenced in the agreement, the terms of the settlement agreement were unambiguous, and Mr. Coker cannot rely on course-of-dealing evidence to supplement those terms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Coker argues that the settlement agreement is voidable because he and the agency "had reasonable and differing interpretations of an essential term of the agreement." Specifically, Mr. Coker asserts that he is entitled to avoid the agreement because of his misunderstanding of the sick leave provision, which he interpreted as obligating the agency to provide him availability pay as part of that approved sick leave. Because Mr. Coker alleges a misunderstanding, the failure of the parties to attach a common meaning to a material term would render the contract void, and not, as Mr. Coker asserts, voidable at his discretion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Restatement (Second) of Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 20 (1981). In any event, there is no cause for rescission here because Mr. Coker's interpretation of the settlement agreement is not a reasonable one; the agreement clearly foreclosed any claim by Mr. Coker to compensation beyond the restoration of his sick leave. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 20, 201; 2 E. Allan Farnsworth, <span class="Italic">Farnsworth on Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 7.9, at 285 (3d ed. 2004) (standard of reasonableness applies when parties attach different meanings to contract language). Mr. Coker asserts that he interpreted the agency's agreement to "rescind" his initial removal as a promise to restore the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>--including his eligibility to receive availability pay. But the agency never agreed to restore Mr. Coker to his prior position; instead, the settlement agreement provided that Mr. Coker would still be removed from his position, albeit on medical grounds, and that he waived any right to compensation that he would otherwise have been entitled to (other than that specifically provided for in paragraph 3 of the agreement). Thus, Mr. Coker's belief that the rescission of his initial removal would entitle him to availability pay was not a reasonable one.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, as the administrative judge observed, "because LEAP is an active-duty benefit that compensates an employee's availability to perform unscheduled duty, it is probable that the appellant, who is physically unable to perform his position, was never intended to receive LEAP while waiting for his removal to be finalized." Mr. Coker disputes that he was physically unable to perform the duties of his position at the time the settlement agreement was executed, because the Office of Personnel Management did not issue its notice finding Mr. Coker to be disabled until February 8, 2008. However, Mr. Coker agreed to be removed from the agency on the ground that he was unable to meet the medical requirements of his position. Substantial evidence therefore supports the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency did not intend to provide availability pay to Mr. Coker while he was waiting for his removal on medical grounds to be finalized.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations governing availability pay provide that an agency may cancel an availability pay certification based on a finding that an investigator "is unable to perform unscheduled duty for an extended period due to physical or health reasons." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.184(d). When the agency retroactively reinstated Mr. Coker, it canceled his certification on the ground that his medical condition--which Mr. Coker himself attested to, and which formed the basis for his removal from his position--rendered him unable to perform unscheduled duty. The cancellation action was in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.184(d) and did not conflict with any provision of the settlement agreement. Because Mr. Coker did not satisfy the requirements for availability pay established by law, the agency was free to cancel his certification for failure to meet those requirements regardless of whether or not availability pay would normally be paid during an employee's sick leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we agree with the Board that the settlement agreement did not require the agency to provide availability pay to Mr. Coker. We therefore affirm the Board's denial of his petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Appellant's belief that she would secure a disability retirement by a settlement was not credited when the settlement provided a lump sum payment and contained a general statement that the agreement resolved all issues, <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Dept. of Navy</span>, AT-0752-16-0686-I-1 (NP 3/21/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also suggests that the parties verbally agreed that she would be awarded a disability retirement as a result of signing the settlement agreement. However, the settlement agreement contains no such term, and further provides that it is a "full and final settlement of...all issues related to [the appellant's] employment." Similarly, it plainly provides that the lump sum payment to the appellant "represents full settlement of this matter and all relief sought by [the] Appellant." <span class="Italic">See Birdsong v. Department of the Navy</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 524, 528 (1997) (explaining that parol evidence only is admissible to show the parties' intent if the terms of an agreement are ambiguous). Thus, the appellant waived her rights to claim any additional damages associated with her employment with the agency. <span class="Italic">See Swidecki v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 25 (2006) (finding that a settlement agreement providing that it was a "full <span id="Page_4779"></span>and final release of all matters" in the appeal constitutes a waiver of the right to move for payment of attorney fees).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ziegler v. Dept. of Interior,</span> DE-3443-06-0454-C-1 (NP 12/8/2010), applied an integration clause to exclude claims for compensation that was not specified by the settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the agency violated the parties' settlement agreement when it denied him "the proper application of interest by the Backpay Act for the whole sum of my" settlement agreement and denied him "premium pay" for the years 1996-1998. He further claims that the Back Pay Act was the only statute cited in the settlement agreement, that he had already put in the Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime hours for 1996-1998 before he entered into the agreement, and that he wants the back pay interest to apply to the "whole sum" of his settlement, including his "retroactive retirement sum."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge found, the agency paid the appellant interest for the one year of back pay it agreed to pay him under the settlement agreement, and there is no other provision in the agreement that could fairly be read as calling for the payment of money by the agency on which additional interest would be calculated. The administrative judge further correctly found that there was no provision in the agreement addressing Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime or premium pay for the 1996-1998 time period, and that the agreement specifically indicated that it contained the complete understanding of the parties regarding its terms and conditions, with no other express or implied terms.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The significance of the lack of an integration clause became apparent in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 86 MSPR 546, 559-60 &#x00B6; 24 (2000), involving an oral agreement that contained ambiguous terms.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 MSPR 660, 664 (1995) (the party asserting noncompliance bears the burden of proving, by preponderant evidence, that the other party breached the agreement); <span class="Italic">Rothwell</span>, 64 MSPR at 477.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hutchison v. USPS</span>, 39 MSPR 327, 330 n.4 (1988), noted that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The admission of evidence concerning agreements to modify a contract after formation of a contract is not preluded by the parol evidence rule, which precludes the admission of prior or contemporaneous evidence to vary the terms of the final agreement. <span class="Italic">See Montefiore Hospital Association of Western Pennsylvania v. United States</span>, 5 Ct. Cl. 471, 474 (1984), <span class="Italic">citing</span> Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 213 (1979) ("[a] binding integrated agreement discharges prior agreements to the extent that it is inconsistent with them").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An "integration clause" does not necessarily preclude consideration of extrinsic evidence used to determine the meaning of an agreement. <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span>, &#x00A7; 579 (1951), explains:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">No parol evidence that is offered can be said to vary or contradict a writing until by process of interpretation it is determined what the writing means. The "parole evidence rule" is not, and does not purport to be, a rule of interpretation or a rule as to the admission of evidence of the purpose of interpretation. Even if a written document has been assented to as the complete and accurate integration of the terms of a contract, it must still be interpreted; and all those facts that are of assistance in this process may be proved or oral testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Antecedent and surrounding factors that throw light upon this question may be proved by any kind of relevant evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Corbin adds, at &#x00A7; 532</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is not only the words of a contract that require interpretation. Words and conduct used in the process of making a contract, offers, acceptances, preliminary communications not themselves operative in any way, all these need interpretation, before we can say that the parties have reached agreement, before we can determine whether or not agreement has resulted in contract, and before we can determine the operative effect that should be given to the contract....</p>
