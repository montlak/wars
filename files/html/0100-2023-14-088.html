<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-89"><span class="space">13.</span> Authority to Carry Weapon</h4>
<p class="noindent">FLRA considered aspects of proposals involving employees who carry weapons, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council and DOJ, INS</span>, 40 FLRA 521, 522-23 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he first sentence of Proposal 1, which concerns the Agency's withdrawal of authority granted to employees to carry firearms, is nonnegotiable because it directly interferes with the Agency's right to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. The second sentence of Proposal 1, which requires that the Agency serve a written notice of the withdrawal of the authority to carry a firearm on the affected employee, is negotiable. The last sentence of Proposal 1, which addresses the assignment of duties to employees whose authorization to carry a firearm has been withdrawn, is a negotiable appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first four sentences of Proposal 2, which concern necessary qualifications for employees to carry firearms, are nonnegotiable. The last sentence of Proposal 2, which addresses the assignment of duties to employees whose authorization to carry a firearm has been withdrawn, is a negotiable appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Proposals 3 and 4, which define the firearms which the Agency will authorize for use by its employees during both on-duty and off-duty assignments, are nonnegotiable because they excessively interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 5, which provides that all employees involved in a shooting incident are entitled to Union representation and that they will have up to 48 hours in which to consult with a Union representative, is negotiable. Proposal 6, which provides that employees currently carrying certain kinds of privately-owned firearms will continue to be authorized to carry them until they are replaced by Agency-issued firearms, is nonnegotiable because it excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1917 and DOJ, INS</span>, 55 FLRA 228, 231-37 (1999), determined that a proposal that employees be authorized to carry designated weapons was nonnegotiable as an undue infringement upon management's right to determine internal security; the proposal was negotiable, however, at the election of the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not dispute that, as a general matter, the equipment employees will use in the performance of their duties constitutes a condition of employment within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14) of the Statute. Rather, the Agency contends that insofar as decisions with respect to equipment also implicate matters of "public policy"--in this case, public safety--they are excluded from the definition of "conditions of employment." The Agency's contention must be rejected. <span class="Italic">See National Association of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Locals R14-22 and R14-89 and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Headquarters, U.S. Army Air</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Artillery Center and Fort Bliss, Fort Bliss,</span> <span class="Italic">Texas, </span>45 FLRA 949, 952-53 (1992) (Authority rejects agency argument that proposal concerning gate inspections does not concern conditions of employment because such inspections concern base security, which is the constitutional prerogative of the military commander). There is nothing in the text of section 7103(a)(14) that expressly excludes "public policy" decisions. To the extent the Agency's argument addresses an exclusion under section 7103(a)(14)(C), that argument is addressed below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we reject the claim that the proposal does not pertain to conditions of employment because the proposal relates to 8 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1357(a), a statute that was not enacted for the purpose of affecting employee working conditions. In this regard, the definition of "conditions of employment" in section 7103(a)(14) does not contain an exclusion that turns on whether a proposal relates to a statute that was issued for the purpose of affecting conditions of employment. The only exclusion for matters pertaining to a Federal statute is set forth in section 7103(a)(14)(C) and, as will be discussed below, that exclusion turns on whether a matter is specifically provided for by the statute. Moreover, <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> concerned whether a statutory provision constituted a "law," within the meaning of section 7103(a)(9), that could be enforced through the grievance procedure. It did not concern whether a proposal constituted a matter pertaining to conditions of employment within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14). Specifically, <span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service </span>did not hold that matters pertaining to the conditions under which customs inspectors would board vessels were not conditions of employment. Rather, the court held that the particular law pertaining to the boarding of vessels by customs inspectors that was relied on by the union in that case did not constitute a law concerning conditions of employment that was enforceable through the grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we reject the Agency's claim with respect to the operation of 8 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1357(a). The issue of whether 8 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1357(a) is a "law" enacted to affect conditions of employment of unit employees is not germane to determining whether the proposal here concerns employees' conditions of employment within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the Agency's claim that the proposal deals with a matter that is excluded from the definition of conditions of employment under section 7103(a)(14)(C), the Authority outlined the framework for determining whether a matter is "specifically provided for" by Federal statute within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14)(C) in <span class="Italic">International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Franklin Lodge No. 2135, et al. and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 50 FLRA 677 (1995) <span class="Italic">(BEP),</span> <span class="Italic">affirmed, United States Department of the Treasury v.</span> <span class="Italic">FLRA, </span>88 F.3d 1279 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (mem.). The Authority held that "[m]ere reference to a matter in a statute is not sufficient to exclude it from the definition of conditions of employment under [section 7103(a)(14)(C)]." 50 FLRA at 681 (citing <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Association of Government Employees, Local R1-144,</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Union of Scientists and Engineers and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Naval Underwater Systems</span> <span class="Italic">Center, Newport, Rhode Island, </span>38 FLRA 456, 487-88 (1990), <span class="Italic">decision on remand as to other matters</span>, 43 FLRA 47 (1991). Instead, the Authority stated that it will find that a matter is "specifically provided for" by Federal statute only to the extent that the governing statute leaves no discretion to the agency. <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 50 FLRA at 682 (citing <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association, Inc. and</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense Dependents Schools, </span>29 FLRA 734, 835 (1987) (Chairman Calhoun concurring in relevant part), <span class="Italic">enforced as to other matters, </span>911 F.2d 743 (D.C. Cir. 1990)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, it is clear that the statute in question, 8 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1357(a), vests the Agency with discretion to determine the categories of employees who may use force, including deadly force, and the circumstances in which such force may be used. For example, 8 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1357(a) provides that the Attorney General is authorized to prescribe by regulation that an Agency employee "may" carry a firearm. Since the statute in question gives the agency discretion regarding the subject matter of the proposal, the proposal does not concern a matter that is "specifically provided for by Federal statute." Consequently, we reject the Agency's section 7103(a)(14)(C) claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's claim that the proposal does not "vitally affect" unit employees' conditions of employment. The Agency contends that the proper test here is whether the subject matter of the Union's proposal "vitally affects" conditions of employment for bargaining unit employees more than it "vitally affects" the interests of the public, which, the Agency claims, it does not. Where a third party's concerns are directly implicated by a negotiating proposal, the "vitally affects" test is appropriate. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 32 and U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 491, 502 (1995) <span class="Italic">(OPM) affirmed, American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA,</span> 110 F.3d 810, 813 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (citing <span class="Italic">Allied Chemical &#x0026;</span> <span class="Italic">Alkali Workers of America, Local Union No. I v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., Chemical Division, et al,</span> 404 U.S. 157 (1971)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "vitally affects" test does not apply here. The Union's proposal does not directly implicate a third party: it provides for the use of certain equipment by bargaining unit employees. To be sure, the proposal could "affect" the general public. However, the objective of the proposal is to alter a condition of employment for unit employees; any effect on the public is an indirect consequence of this proposal. That a proposal may have an impact on a third party does not, by itself, require the <span id="page_676"></span>application of the "vitally affects" test<span class="Italic">. OPM</span>, 51 FLRA at 491, 502-04; <span class="Italic">see also United States</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point, North Carolina v. FLRA, </span>952 F.2d 1434, 1439-40 (D.C. Cir. 1992) ("vitally affects" test not implicated merely because otherwise sound union proposal would, if accepted, have an impact upon persons outside bargaining unit). As for the Agency's assertion that the proposal affects public safety, in particular, the prospect of such an effect does not implicate the "vitally affects" test where it otherwise would not apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">VII.&#x2003;The proposal affects the exercise of a management right under section 7106(a), and is not an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Meaning of the Proposal</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By its terms, the proposal identifies the types of equipment that employees will be allowed to wear in the performance of their duties and prescribes the work areas or types of duties wherein employees will be allowed to wear that equipment. Specifically, employees will be allowed to wear handcuffs, non-lethal Agency-approved security equipment, and appropriate leather gear at all times, including in the primary area. Employees assigned to INSPASS, gate checks, maritime inspections, and other duties outside primary areas will be allowed to carry an Agency-approved firearm, in addition to the equipment listed above, and will be equipped with a working two-way radio.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union explains that the proposal is designed to ensure the safety of employees by providing them with equipment that will allow them to defend themselves.&#x2003;According to the Union, the proposal re-institutes the preventive measures that existed in previous Agency policy and thereby minimizes the risks inherent in the nature of employees' duties. The Union's explanation is consistent with the wording of the proposal and we adopt it for purposes of determining the negotiability of the proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The Proposal Affects Management's Right to Determine Its Internal Security Practices under Section 7106(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, HUD Council of Locals 222, Local 2910 and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> 54 FLRA 171 (1998) <span class="Italic">(HUD), </span>the Authority clarified the sequence of analysis it will follow in resolving negotiability disputes where parties disagree as to whether a proposal comes within the terms of section 7106(a) or section 7106(b). Where an agency claims that a proposal affects a management right or rights under section 7106(a), and a union claims that the proposal is within the duty to bargain under section 7106(b)(2) and/or (3), as well as being electively negotiable under section 7106(b)(1), for the reasons stated in <span class="Italic">HUD, </span>the Authority will first resolve those claims that would determine if a proposal is within the duty to bargain, and then, if necessary, address those claims that would determine if a proposal is electively negotiable. <span class="Italic">See National Association of Government Employees, Local R1-109 and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Newington, Connecticut, </span>54 FLRA 521, 526-28 (1998) <span class="Italic">(VAMC, Newington).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following this sequence, we first address the Agency's claim under section 7106(a)(1). Because the Union does not dispute the Agency's contention that the proposal affects management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1), we find that the proposal affects that right<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Newington, </span>54 FLRA at 527; <span class="Italic">International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 25 and Department of the Navy, Mare Island</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California, </span>33 FLRA 304, 306 (1988); <span class="Italic">Fraternal Order of Police Lodge IF (R.1) Federal and Veterans Administration, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Providence, Rhode Island,</span> 32 FLRA 944, 957-58 (1988) <span class="Italic">(VAMC Providence).</span> We turn next to the Union's contention that the proposal is an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The proposal is not an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The test for determining whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under 7106(b)(3) is set out in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard, </span>21 FLRA 24 (1986) <span class="Italic">(KANG). </span>Under that test, the Authority initially determines whether the proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. An arrangement must seek to mitigate adverse effects "flowing from the exercise of a protected management right." <span class="Italic">United States</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA, </span>960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG, </span>21 FLRA at 31. Proposals that address speculative or hypothetical concerns do not constitute arrangements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 2015 and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior, National Park Service,</span> <span class="Italic">Washington, D.C., </span>53 FLRA 967, 973 (1997). The alleged arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local 1687 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Mountain Home, Tennessee, </span>52 FLRA 521, 523 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the proposal is an arrangement, the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management rights. <span class="Italic">KANG, </span>21 FLRA at 31-33. In determining whether a proposal is appropriate, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming, without deciding, that the proposal constitutes an arrangement under the first inquiry in the <span class="Italic">KANG </span>analysis, we conclude that the proposed arrangement is not appropriate under the second inquiry in that analysis because it excessively interferes with management's right to determine its internal security practices. We note at the outset that the proposal provides blanket permission to employees to wear and use firearms and other equipment in the work situations specified without supervisory control. In this regard, the proposal provides no exception for the exercise of managerial judgment as to the necessity for employees to wear such equipment depending on the circumstances in which they are working at any given time. Under the proposal, that is, management has no discretion to balance the day-to-day risks facing employees in their work environment against the need to protect other employees and the public from potential harm due to the use of that equipment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, even taking into account the distinctions between the type of security equipment that is permitted in the different work situations specified, because of the all-encompassing permission given by the proposal for employees to wear and use that equipment, the proposal imposes a significant burden on the Agency's ability to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Immigration and Naturalization Service,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Border Patrol, San Diego Sector, San</span> <span class="Italic">Diego, California, </span>43 FLRA 642, 654-56 (1991) <span class="Italic">(Border Patrol, San Diego Sector). See also American Federation of Government Employees, Council of Marine</span> <span class="Italic">Corps Locals, Council 240 and U.S. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, Washington, D.C., </span>50 FLRA 637, 641 (1995) (provision, which permitted no exception to its requirements, imposed significant burden on management right); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, National Border Patrol Council and</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service</span>, 51 FLRA 1308, 1325-26 (1996) (provision imposed significant restriction on management's need for flexibility).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that the proposal has some benefit for employees' personal safety and security by providing them with the equipment to protect themselves. However, the proposal gains that protection by removing all management control over the use of the equipment. Weighing the significant burden imposed by the proposal on management's determination of its internal security practices against the benefit afforded employees by the proposal, we find that the proposal excessively interferes with management's internal security right under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">VIII. The proposal is electively negotiable under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has construed the term "method" to refer to "the way in which an agency performs its work." <span class="Italic">See International Federation of Professional</span> <span class="Italic">and Technical Engineers, Local 49 and U.S. Department of the Army, Army Corps of Engineers, South Pacific Division, San Francisco, California, </span>52 FLRA 813, 818 (1996). The Authority has construed the term "means" to refer to "any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. The Authority employs a two-part test to determine whether a proposal interferes with management's right to determine the methods or means of performing work. First, the agency must show a direct and integral relationship between the particular method or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission. Second, the agency must show that the proposals would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,</span> <span class="Italic">Region V, Walnut Creek, California, </span>41 FLRA 1195, 1202 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that firearms, handcuffs, and "leather gear" are the tools or devices that the Agency uses to accomplish its law enforcement mission. Consequently, because the proposal requires the Agency to permit employees to use that equipment, the proposal is determinative of the means by which the Agency will perform its work within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., VAMC Providence,</span> <span id="page_677"></span>32 FLRA at 958-59 (proposal requiring agency to provide vehicles for use in accomplishing its law enforcement mission constitutes means of performing work). Moreover, because the proposal would permit employees to wear the specified equipment in circumstances precluded by the Agency's existing internal security policy, the proposal interferes with the purposes for which the Agency adopted that policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's attempt to distinguish the <span class="Italic">Marshals</span> <span class="Italic">Service </span>case by distinguishing between proposals that concern the particular type of firearms, for example, that employees will use and proposals that concern the circumstances in which firearms will be used, is unavailing. The Authority has not so narrowly circumscribed what constitutes a means of performing work within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1). If a proposal prescribes the use of particular instrumentalities for mission-related purposes, it concerns the means of performing work within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1). <span class="Italic">VAMC Providence</span>, 32 FLRA at 958-59. The fact that those purposes may be related to the agency's internal security policies does not make the proposal any less a section 7106(b)(1) matter. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the proposal is electively negotiable under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. Pursuant to section 2424.10 of the Authority's Regulations, we dismiss the petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable under <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1214 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Jackson</span>, 58 FLRA 601, 602-03 (2003), was the proposal to permit civilian police officers to carry a personally-owned firearm into and out of the facility:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(12) of the Statute defines "collective bargaining," in pertinent part, as the parties' mutual obligation to bargain "with respect to...conditions of employment...." The term "conditions of employment" is defined in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14), with exclusions not relevant here, as "personnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions[.]" In determining whether a proposal concerns a condition of employment, the Authority applies a two-prong test. In particular, the Authority determines whether: (1) the proposal pertains to bargaining unit employees; and (2) the record establishes that there is a direct connection between the proposal and the work situation or employment relationship of unit employees<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Antilles Consolidated Educ. Assoc.</span>, 22 FLRA 235, 237 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Antilles</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal permits civilian police officers to bring personally owned firearms into and out of the Fort Jackson installation and to store the firearms, while on duty, wherever they believe it is appropriately secure to do so. As to the first prong of the <span class="Italic">Antilles </span>test, the proposal applies to bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the second prong of the test, the Union has not demonstrated that the ability to bring personally owned weapons onto the installation and store them during duty time would change or affect any aspect of the job functions, job requirements, or any other incidents of employment of the bargaining unit employees. In <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1917</span>, 4 FLRA 150, 153 (1980), the Authority determined that a proposal requiring the agency to provide secure storage areas for unit employees' private weapons, "which are neither required nor permitted to be used in the performance of such employees' official duties," did not concern employees' conditions of employment. As in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1917</span>, police officers in the instant case are prohibited, with certain exceptions not relevant here, from carrying or storing personally owned weapons on the installation, and these weapons are not required for the employees to perform their duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the employees are police officers 24 hours a day.&#x2003;However, a memorandum relied on by the Agency demonstrates that these employees have law enforcement responsibilities only while on duty and that they are allowed to use only agency issued weapons while in performance of their duties. Therefore, whether or not the employees may bring personally owned weapons onto the installation and store them during duty time does not have an impact on their job duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This proposal is distinguishable from proposals concerning the storage of personal items found by the Authority to involve employees' conditions of employment<span class="Italic">. See Fed. Employees Metal Trades Council</span>, 41 FLRA 107, 113 (1991); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1770</span>, 17 FLRA 752, 756 (1985). In this regard, the proposals in those decisions involved items employees were permitted and expected to bring with them to work, <span class="Italic">e.g</span>., wallets, purses and lunches, or items that were required by the agency, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, motorcycle safety equipment. Here, employees are not permitted to bring personally owned weapons to work and such weapons are, thus, not ordinary personal items subject to storage during work hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This proposal is also distinguishable from proposals 3 and 4 in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council and Nat'l Immigration and Naturalization Serv. Council</span>, 40 FLRA 521, 537-39 (1991) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Border Patrol</span>), <span class="Italic">rev'd as to other matters, United States DOJ, Immigration and Naturalization Serv. V. FLRA,</span> 975 F.2d 218 (5th Cir. 1992), where the Authority found that the proposals involving the carrying of personally owned firearms off-duty concerned employees' conditions of employment. The agency in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Border Patrol</span> had established a policy concerning both on and off-duty use of firearms and the union sought to modify this policy. The agency expected its employees to perform law enforcement functions while off-duty and the Authority found that the existing employment relationship was extended beyond duty hours with respect to this issue<span class="Italic">. See AFGE, Border Patrol</span>, 40 FLRA at 542-43. As there is no existing policy permitting the carrying and storing of personally owned weapons in the instant case, <span class="Italic">AFGE, Border Patrol</span> is not controlling.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that there is no direct connection between carrying and storing personally owned weapons on the installation and the work situation or employment relationship of unit employees and, as such, find that the second prong of the <span class="Italic">Antilles </span>test has not been met. We note, in this connection, the obvious linkage between carrying weapons and storing them and that there is no argument or basis in the record to distinguish between the aspect of the proposal permitting employees to carry weapons on Fort Jackson and the aspect permitting employees to store the weapons. As such, the proposal is outside the duty to bargain because it does not concern bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 58 FLRA 611 (2003), was a proposal requiring the agency to reimburse employees for the cost of their weapons in the event that they were precluded from use on duty of a personally-owned weapon. Because agency policy prohibited employees from using personal weapons in the performance of official duties, the proposal was deemed to have no connection, direct or otherwise, to any aspect of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 400 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Drum</span>, 66 FLRA 68, 69-70 (2011) (proposal did not relate to working conditions that required management to pay for firearm, ammunition, and a permit for agency law enforcement officers who desired to carry firearm while off duty to counter what proposal characterized as "risk in the community while off duty"); <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 55 FLRA 892, 897-98 (1999) (statutory delegation of authority to agency to issue regulations governing use of weapons by agency law enforcement personnel did not establish matter "specifically provided for by federal law" that exempted management's policies on use of batons from impact and implementation negotiation).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 60 FLRA 367, 373-74 (2004), ruled nonnegotiable, as an infringement upon the right of the agency to determine its internal security practices, a variety of procedural proposals designed to assist Customs employees whose ability to carry weapons is restricted by the agency: Proposal 14(f) (requiring the agency to conduct an expeditious investigation when it takes an employee's firearm pending an internal investigation); Proposal 14(g) (allowing the union to use expedited arbitration to challenge decisions precluding employees from carrying firearms while investigations are pending--the proposal would cause the agency to risk going to arbitration before the investigation was completed; 14(h) providing certain rights relative to the carriage of weapons if agency investigations are not given priority. Negotiable in <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS</span>, was Proposal 14(f) (requiring agency to provide employee with monthly, written report informing employee of status of an internal firearms authority investigation, including expected time frame for completion of investigation).</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VA Connecticut Healthcare Sys.,</span> 64 FLRA 132, 134 (2009) (Member Beck dissenting), was a proposal that the employer bargain on accommodative measures for employees determined by the agency to be physically or psychologically unable to qualify to use a firearm that the agency designated for their use:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that standard "reopener" proposals--i.e., proposals that specify the conditions under which a party may seek to negotiate mid-term over a subject that is covered by a collective bargaining agreement--are within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See, e.g, POP A,</span> 56 FLRA 69, 72-73 (2000) (Chairman Cabaniss &#x0026; Member Wasserman dissenting in part on other grounds); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1995,</span> 47 FLRA 470, 471-73 (1993);<span class="Italic"> NAGE, SEIU, AFL-CIO,</span> 24 FLRA 147, 148-49 (1986); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 3804,</span> 21 FLRA 870, 889-91 (1986); <span class="Italic">see also NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 399 F.3d 334, 342 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (court stated that the Authority has "often ordered an agency to bargain over a reopener proposal"). Proposal 15(a) addresses the conditions under which the Agency would be required to bargain after it determines that physical and/or psychological reasons render an employee unable to qualify with a weapon. As the proposal seeks to define the scope of the parties' bargaining rights, it is akin to a negotiable reopener provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It also is well established that proposals that "require management to take action in accordance with law[ ]" are within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Locals 3807 &#x0026; 3824,</span> 55 FLRA 1, 5 (1998) (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> <span class="Italic">Chs. 213 &#x0026; 228,</span> 32 FLRA 578, 581 (1988)); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Professional Airways Systems Specialists,</span> 56 FLRA 798, 801 (2000) (where union explained and agency did not dispute that proposal only required agency to exercise its right to assign work in manner consistent with law, Authority found proposal did not affect right to assign work) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Dep't of Educ Council of AFGE Locals,</span> 35 FLRA 56, 62-63 (1990)).[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;That a proposal may simply restate existing obligations does <span id="page_678"></span>not affect its negotiability. Further, parties frequently include in their collective bargaining agreements provisions that mirror, or are intended to be interpreted in the same manner as, statutory provisions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States DOJ, Fed Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Complex, Coleman, Fla., </span>63 FLRA 351, 354 (2009) (citing, <span class="Italic">e.g., NLRB,</span> 61 FLRA 197, 199 (2005), <span class="Italic">AFGE,</span> 59 FLRA 767, 769-70 (2004)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, Proposal 15(a) expressly would require the Agency to bargain "to the extent provided by law" in certain circumstances. Specifically, once the Agency has determined that an employee is physically or psychologically unable to qualify with a firearm, the Agency would be required to bargain with the Union over "accommodative measures" for those employees. The proposal's plain wording indicates that the Agency would not be required to bargain in any manner that exceeds legal requirements, which includes any bargaining that would be inconsistent with management's right to determine internal security practices. We note, in this regard, that the Union has not offered, and the proposal would not require the Agency to negotiate over, any particular measures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the proposal is not contrary to management's right to determine internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal that sought a variance from use of the standard waist holster (e.g., shoulder or purse holster) infringed the right of the agency to determine its internal security and was not an appropriate arrangement, <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 59 FLRA 978, 981-82 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the proposal affects its right to determine its internal security practices.&#x2003;Under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, management's right to determine its internal security practices includes the right to determine the policies and practices that are necessary to safeguard its operations, personnel, and physical property against internal and external risks. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 101</span>, 58 FLRA 653, 654 (2003) (<span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 101</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1920</span>, 47 FLRA 340, 348 (1993) (Local 1920)). The right also encompasses an agency's decisions that employees must use certain types of protective equipment. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council 214</span>, 53 FLRA 131 (1997); <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R7-72</span>, 42 FLRA 1019, 1031 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency maintains that there is a clear "link between the use of shoulder holsters and its concern with safeguarding its employees and the public...." Where an agency establishes a link between its goal of safeguarding its personnel, property or the public and its practice or policy to implement the expressed security concerns, the Authority will not review the merits of the agency's action. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1030</span>, 57 FLRA 901, 902 (2002) (<span class="Italic">Local 1030</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Local 1920</span>, 47 FLRA at 348).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the proposal would require it to authorize holsters that could prove dangerous to Agency personnel, property and the public. The Agency explains that alternative holsters are not authorized for on duty use primarily because of safety concerns. We conclude that the Agency has established a link between its action of only allowing the use of authorized holsters and its concern for the safety of the public and its personnel. Therefore, the Authority will not review the merits of the Agency's action. <span class="Italic">Local 1030</span>, 57 FLRA at 901.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an agency demonstrates such a link, any proposal that "interferes with or negates the agency's policy or practice affects the agency's right to determine internal security practices...." <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 101</span>, 58 FLRA at 654. The Agency's "Firearms and Use of Force Handbook" (Handbook) from December 2001, requires employees to carry an authorized holster and provides a list of the authorized holsters for on duty use. The Union's proposal interferes with the Agency's policies set forth in the Handbook as it would require the Agency to authorize some alternative to those already authorized. Therefore, the proposal affects the Agency's right to determine internal security practices. <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 101</span>, 58 FLRA at 654.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority follows the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under this analysis, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 31; <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Serv. V. FLRA, </span>960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG,</span> 21 FLRA at 31. Proposals that address purely speculative or hypothetical concerns, or that are unrelated to management's exercise of its reserved rights, do not constitute arrangements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NAGE, Local R1-100,</span> 39 FLRA 762, 766 (1991). The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently "tailored" to compensate only those employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1687</span>, 52 FLRA 521, 523 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the proposal is an arrangement that is sufficiently tailored, the Authority then determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management right. <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's right. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming that the proposal in this case constitutes an arrangement that is sufficiently tailored, the proposal does not constitute an appropriate arrangement because it excessively interferes with management's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See Patent Office Prof'l Ass'n</span>, 56 FLRA 69, 79 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that employees who cannot wear an Agency authorized holster because of a change in "physical circumstances" would benefit from the proposal because those employees could continue to perform the full range of duties requiring a firearm, including overtime, with the use of an alternative holster.[12] The Union asserts that the proposal would only slightly interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices because the Agency can still require employees to carry a firearm and holster and can determine which alternative holster to authorize. Although the Union asserts that the Agency "would have the right to set specifications[,]" the Agency would be required to authorize some alternative holster.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;It is important to note that of the employees the Union argues will benefit from the proposal, those experiencing a change in "physical circumstances" that would be defined as a disability under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 may be entitled to some protection under that Act. The Rehabilitation Act utilizes the same standards established in the Americans with Disabilities Act in order to determine whether the Act has been violated "in a complaint alleging nonaffirmative action employment discrimination...." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(g).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the proposal would effectively negate its right to determine the necessary internal security measures for the protection of personnel, property and the public. The Agency argues that it would be required to approve some alternative holster even if it considered the alternative to be dangerous to the Agency personnel and the public.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, the burden on the Agency's ability to exercise its management right to determine its internal security practices outweighs the benefits the proposal would afford to employees. Although the proposal would allow employees who are unable to carry the authorized holster to continue to perform the full range of duties, including overtime, the proposal would remove the Agency's discretion to determine the risks of alternative holsters to personnel, property and the public and to conclude that no alternative holster provides the same security as the authorized waist holsters. Because the Agency is required to approve an alternative shoulder holster even if it determines that all shoulder holsters present unacceptable risks and concerns, the proposal excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">Local 1917</span>, 55 FLRA at 235 (finding a proposal that did not allow for managerial discretion excessively interfered with the agency's right to determine its internal security practices); <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, <span class="Italic">Nat'l Border Patrol Council, </span>40 FLRA 521, 544-46 (1991) (finding nonnegotiable a proposal that specified the firearms that would be authorized for off-duty use because it would "negate the [a]gency's determinations as to the weapons, or categories of the weapons, that safely may be used by the employees"). The proposal also places a significant restriction on the Agency's right to protect its personnel, property and the public by precluding it from requiring employees to carry the Agency authorized holsters. <span class="Italic">NAGE</span>, <span class="Italic">SEIU, Local R7-51,</span> 30 FLRA 415, 419 (1987) (finding a proposal requiring an agency to allow employees to have options for safety equipment on a motorcycle instead of having the agency required faceshield excessively interfered with the Agency's rights because it precluded the agency from "implementing its chosen internal security practice....").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given these restrictions on the Agency's exercise of the right to determine its internal security, the proposal excessively interferes with that right. Thus, the proposal does not constitute an appropriate arrangement and is outside the duty to bargain.</p>
