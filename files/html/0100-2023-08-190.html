<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-188"><span class="space">c.</span> Veterans Canteen Service</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Not to be forgotten is the Veterans Canteen Service, whose employees are exempt from civil service laws unless they are preference eligibles. <span class="Italic">Bentley v. VA</span>, 3 MSPR 270, 271 (1980), described the exemption at 38 USC 4202 [now generally at 38 USC 7802] :</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note in this connection that 38 USC 4202 provides in pertinent part as follows, with respect to the duties of the Administrator of the Veterans Canteen Service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Administrator shall--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;employ such persons as are necessary for the establishment, maintenance, and operation of the Service, and pay the salaries, wages, and expenses of all such employees from the funds of the service. Personnel necessary for the transaction of the business of the Service at canteens, warehouses, and storage depots shall be appointed, compensated from funds of the Service, and removed by the Administrator without regard to civil-service laws and the Classification Act of 1949. Such employees shall be subject to the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, the Civil Service Retirement Act, and laws administered by the Bureau of Employees' Compensation applicable to civilian employees of the United States.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, under the terms of section 4202(5), petitioner could accede to the statutory and regulatory rights of appeal provided to preference eligible employees. Petitioner as a non-preference eligible would accede to none of these rights, however, and his removal is therefore within the total control of the Administrator of the Veterans Canteen Service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The exclusion of Veterans Canteen Service employees from Board jurisdiction was reconfirmed, <span class="Italic">Chavez v. VA</span>, 65 MSPR 590, 591-94 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Due Process Amendments of 1990...grant adverse action appeal rights to nonpreference eligibles in the excepted service who are not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service, or who have completed 2 years of current, continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less. 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C); <span class="Italic">see Ferguson v. Dept. of the Interior</span>, 59 MSPR 305, 307 (1993). Because the appellant was not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service, and had completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar position with the agency under other than a temporary appointment, she appears to meet the definition of "employee" set forth at 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The provisions of subchapter II of chapter 75, title 5, however, do not apply to those employees described at 5 USC 7511(b). Although the appellant argues on review that section 7511(b) does not exclude her from coverage under the Amendments, the agency conceded below that 5 USC 7511(b) does not specifically exclude her from such coverage.[1] Rather, the agency relied upon 5 CFR 752.401(d)(12), which provides that adverse action appeal rights are not afforded to an employee whose "position has been excluded from the appointing provisions of title 5, United States Code, by separate statutory authority in the absence of any provision to place the employee within the coverage of chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code." In comments on the regulation that were published in the Federal Register, OPM stated that such employees were excluded from coverage "whether or not they [were] specifically listed as excluded in the [Due Process Amendments]." 58 Fed. Reg. 13,191 (Mar. 10, 1993).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We note that an employee who holds a position within the Veterans Health Administration that has been excluded from the competitive service by or under a provision of title 38, unless such employee was appointed to such position under section 7401(3) of such title, is not covered by the Amendments. 5 USC 7511(b)(10). This provision does not exclude the appellant because she was employed by the Veterans' Canteen Service, which functions as an independent unit in the Department of Veterans Affairs with exclusive control over activities that include personnel management. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC 7808.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The appellant contends on review that 5 CFR 752.401(d)(12) does not apply to her because she had been an employee of the Veterans' Canteen Service for 7 years before the regulation's April 9, 1993 effective date. Neither the regulation nor OPM's comments on the regulation, however, indicate that the regulation does not apply to employees who were appointed before April 9, 1993. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 752.401(d)(12); 58 Fed. Reg. 13,191 (Mar. 10, 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that 38 USC 7802(5) excludes the appellant from the appointing provisions of title 5. Section 7802(5) provides that the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs shall, with respect to the Veterans' Canteen Service,</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that 5 CFR 752.401(d)(12) applies, by its terms, to positions that have been excluded generally from the appointing provisions of title 5<span class="Italic">. See Todd v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 63 MSPR 4, 8 (1994); <span class="Italic">Briggs v. National Council on Disability</span>, 60 MSPR 331, 334 (1994). In its comments on section 752.401(d)(12), OPM stated that "a legislative exclusion from the appointing requirements of title 5" was "required for a statutory exclusion from chapter 75." 58 Fed. Reg. at 13,192. Section 752.401(d)(12) does not indicate that the appointment and removal of employees "without regard to the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service" is the same as exclusion from chapter 75. Excluding a position from the appointing requirements applicable to the competitive service means only that the position is in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See Briggs</span>, 60 MSPR at 334-35 (citing 5 USC 2103(a) ("the 'excepted service' consists of those civil service positions which are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service")). Thus, on its face, 38 USC 7802(5) does not appear to exclude the appellant from the appointing requirements of title 5 in general.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 4202(5) of title 38, however, originally provided that personnel necessary for the transaction of the business of the Veterans' Canteen Service "shall be appointed, compensated from funds of the Service, and removed...<span class="Italic">without regard to civil-service laws</span>...." Pub. L. No. 79-636, &#x00A7; 2(e), 1946 USCCAN 853, 854 (emphasis supplied). In 1982, Congress substituted the language "without regard to the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service" for the broader language "without regard to civil-service laws." <span class="Italic">See</span> Technical Amendments to 10, 14, 37 and 38 USCA (hereinafter "the Act"), Pub. L. No. 97-295, &#x00A7; 4(88), 1982 USCCAN (96 Stat.) 1287, 1312. Section 4(88) of the Act also substituted reference to chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, for reference to the Classification Act of 1949, and substituted the provision that relevant employees are subject to the provisions of title 5 relating to a preference eligible described in section 2108(3) of title 5, subchapter I of chapter 81 of title 5, and subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, for the provision that such employees shall be subject to the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, laws administered by the Bureau of Employees' Compensation applicable to civilian employees of the United States, and the Civil Service Retirement Act<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Section 5(a) of the Act provides that sections 1-4 "restate, without substantive change, laws enacted before December 2, 1981, that were replaced by those sections."<span class="Italic"> Id.; see</span> 10 USC 101, note. Section 5(a) further provides that sections 1-4 of the Act "may not be construed as making a substantive change in the laws replaced."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An amendatory act is not to be construed to change the original act or section further than expressly declared or necessarily implied. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1A Sutherland Stat. Const. &#x00A7; 22.30 (5th Ed.). Here, Congress expressly declared that section 4(88) of the Act "restate[s], without substantive change," 38 USC 4202(5) as it existed prior to December 2, 1981, and that section 4(88) "may not be construed as making a substantive change" in 38 USC 4202(5). This express declaration in the statute is reinforced in the legislative history of the Act, which provides that the bill "makes no change in the substance of existing law" except to correct an inadvertent error in the codification of title 10 in 1956. H.R. Rep. No. 388, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. (1982), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1982 USCCAN 2598. Further, the legislative history of the Act provides that clause (A) of section 4(88) makes "technical and conforming changes." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2617. Construing the Act as a whole, we <span id="Page_315"></span>find that Congress did not intend to make a substantive change to 38 USC 4202(5) when it substituted the language "without regard to the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service," for the broader language "without regard to civil-service laws." Thus, in accordance with the statute, we may not construe section 4(88) as making a substantive change to the earlier language of 38 USC 4202(5).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal because the appellant's position has been excluded from the appointing provisions of title 5 by separate statutory authority in the absence of any provision placing the appellant within the coverage of chapter 75, title 5, United States Code<span class="Italic">.

The question we address is whether the MSPB has jurisdiction over an appeal of removal by an employee, such as Bennett, who was appointed by the VCS pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7802. The resolution of this question depends on (1) whether 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7802(e) excludes VCS employees from the right to appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d); and (2) whether the amendments to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), (b) remove any limitations on the right to appeal imposed by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7802(e).</p>

These principles guide the analysis below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin with the plain language of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7802(e), which states that "[VCS p] ersonnel shall be...<span class="Italic">removed by the Secretary without regard to the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service</span>...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphases added). Bennett contends that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7802(e) only permits the Secretary to ignore the provisions of title 5 governing competitive service appointments, rather than all of title 5. When analyzing the plain language of the statute in the context of the VCS's legislative history, as the MSPB did in <span class="Italic">Chavez,</span> the true meaning of this language to exclude non-preference eligible employees in the excepted service from appeal rights under title 5--is clear.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Congress adopted the VCS Act in 1946, section 2(e), which would eventually be codified as section 7802(e), stated that "[p]ersonnel...shall be...removed by the Administrator without regard to civil-service laws...[p]rovided, [t]hat such employees shall be subject to the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944." VCS Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-636, &#x00A7; 2(e), 60 Stat. 887, 888 (1946). Section 2(e) therefore provided that individuals appointed under the VCS could be removed by the Administrator regardless of civil service laws providing otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Secretary's ability to remove VCS employees distinguishes the present case from <span class="Italic">King v. Briggs,</span> 83 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 1996), on which Bennett relies. The petitioner in <span class="Italic">Briggs</span> was appointed Executive Director of the National Council on Disability pursuant to 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 783(a)(1), an authority that, at that time, was silent as to the National Council's removal power over that position. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 783(a) (amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, 105 P.L. 220, &#x00A7; 403, 112 Stat. 936, 1200-01 (1998)). The court found that an employee appointed under section 783(a)(1) was therefore not precluded from appealing an adverse action under section 7513(d). <span class="Italic">Briggs,</span> 83 F.3d at 1388. Here, section 7802(e) gives the Secretary removal power over employees appointed under that section, thus excluding them from appeal rights under section 7513(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1982, Congress amended section 4202(e) (previously section 2(e)) of the VCS Act to read as it does today (as section 7802(e)), replacing the language "without regard to civil-service laws" with "without regard to the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service" and eliminating the provision that employees under the VCS Act would be subject to the VPA. Pub. L. No. 97-295, &#x00A7; (4)88, 96 Stat. 1287, 1312 (1982) ("1982 Amendments"). The 1982 Amendments also included a section on legislative purpose and construction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; (5), 96 Stat. at 1313. According to section (5)(a), "[s]ections 1-4 of [the 1982 Amendments] restate, without substantive change, laws enacted before December 2, 1981, that were replaced by those sections. Those sections may not be construed as making a substantive change in the laws replaced." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; (5)(a), 96 Stat. at 1313.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress could not have stated more clearly that its amendment to section 4202(e) did <span class="Italic">nothing</span> to change that section's meaning. <span class="Italic">See Chavez,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. at 594. As before the 1982 amendment, individuals appointed under the VCS could be removed by the Administrator regardless of the protections of title 5. When the Secretary removes a VCS employee, that employee is not entitled to the same rights that would be afforded under title 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bennett also contends that the VCS Act's reference to the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 ("VPA") means that VCS employees were included in the due process provisions of the VPA later codified in chapter 75 of title 5. The VPA originally provided that a "<span class="Italic">preference eligible</span> [employee] shall have the right to appeal to the Civil Service Commission from an adverse decision of the administrative officer...." VPA, 78 Pub. L. No. 359, &#x00A7; 14, 58 Stat. 387, 388 (1944) (emphasis added). By a 1962 executive order, the President "extend[ed] to all employees in the <span class="Italic">competitive</span> civil service rights identical in adverse action cases to those provided preference eligibles under section 14 of the [VPA]." Exec. Order No. 10,988, 3 C.F.R. 130, 136 (1963) (emphasis added). Thus, only preference eligible employees and those in the competitive service had the right to appeal adverse decisions. Non-preference eligible members of the excepted service, like Bennett, were not included. As discussed below in section I.B., the subsequent amendments to the VPA did nothing to change this. Thus, unless the subsequent amendments to the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ("CSRA") award employees appointed under section 7802(e) appeal rights, Bennett's claim will fail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bennett claims that, as a result of amendments to the CSRA in 1990, she is entitled to appeal her removal under section 7513(d). The CSRA, which codified section 14 of the VPA in chapter 75 of title 5, was amended after the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto,</span> 484 U.S. 439 (1988). In <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, the Supreme Court decided that the CSRA's silence regarding appeal rights for non-preference eligible members of the excepted service reflected congressional intent to preclude any review under chapter 75 for such employees. 484 U.S. at 448. In response, Congress passed the Civil Service Due Process Amendments in 1990 ("1990 Amendments") to provide MSPB appeal rights for some, but not all, non-preference eligible excepted service employees. Pub. L. No. 101-376, 104 Stat. 461 (1990). Section 7511(a)(1)(C) was amended to define an "employee" as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]n individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--(i) who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or (ii) who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). The 1990 Amendments also amended section 7511(b) and listed certain employees as excluded from the coverage of chapter 75. Bennett's position at the VCS is not listed in section 7511(b). Bennett argues that because she meets the definition of employee under section 7511(a)(1)(C) and is not specifically excluded by section 7511(b), she should be entitled to appeal her removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government correctly responds that although the list of employees in section 7511(b) does not include VCS employees, this omission does not create any new rights for employees previously excluded from the statute. In <span class="Italic">Todd v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 55 F.3d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1995), Todd was hired pursuant to 20 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 241(a) (repealed 1994) and challenged a reduction in pay, claiming that the MSPB had jurisdiction because she met the newly added definition of employee under section 7511(a)(1)(C). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1575-76. This court disagreed, finding that the amendment to section 7511 did not implicitly repeal section 241(a), which allowed the agency to employ individuals "without regard to...sections...7511, 7512, and 7701 of title 5." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 55 F.3d at 1577. The court reasoned that while Todd met the provisions of both statutes, nothing in section 7511 indicated that it was meant to substitute for or to override section 241(a). <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_316"></span>Similar reasoning applies here sections 7511(a) and (b) do not explicitly give employees appointed under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7802(e) MSPB appeal rights, and therefore these individuals continue to lack such rights. To the extent there is any ambiguity, the relevant regulation that was enacted and adopted by the agency, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12), provides a permissible interpretation. Section 752.401(d)(12) states that adverse action appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-13 "do I] not apply to [a]n employee whose agency or position has been excluded from the appointing provisions of title 5, United States Code, by separate statutory authority in the absence of any provision to place the employee within the coverage of chapter 75, title 5, Untied States Code...." According to the regulation, because individuals appointed to the VCS under section 7802(e) have always been excluded from appeal rights, the amendments to sections 7511-13 did nothing to change this. To be afforded the rights under sections 7511-13, a VCS employee would have to be granted those rights affirmatively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, Bennett has failed to carry her burden to show that the MSPB has been granted jurisdiction over her appeal. The MSPB properly dismissed her appeal because she was a non-preference eligible employee appointed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7802(e) and therefore has no right to appeal an adverse action to the MSPB under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d).</p>
