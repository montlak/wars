<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-42"><span class="space">f.</span> Incarceration</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant is incarcerated, the AJ may DWOP the appeal or grant a continuance of the hearing. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 427, 429, 4 MSPB 479 (1980). In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. VA</span>, 45 MSPR 206, 209-10 (1990), the Board decided that it favored continuances, when possible, rather than DWOPs for incarcerated appellants:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is the policy of the Board, in accordance with the mandate of Congress in passing the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978), that cases be processed in an expeditious manner. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(i)(4); <span class="Italic">see also Toma v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Labor,</span> 5 MSPR 408, 409 (1981). In keeping with this practice, an administrative judge is not required to postpone a hearing for an indefinite period of time under all circumstances, even where some showing of good cause is made. <span class="Italic">E.g., Williams v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 4 MSPR 427 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, we reject the agency's argument that the Board should consider the case based on the record before it, without providing the appellant with a hearing. The agency asserts that the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recommended that the Board follow this approach in <span class="Italic">Callahan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 748 F.2d 1556, 1560 (Fed. Cir. 1984). However, the Court in <span class="Italic">Callahan</span> specifically held that the petitioner's reason for his nonappearance at a scheduled hearing "was inexcusable," and its holding was specifically limited to cases "where an employee is absent from a Board hearing without justification." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1556 (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The holding in <span class="Italic">Callahan</span> is inapposite to the instant case because the administrative judge did not find that the appellant's failure to appear for the scheduled hearing "was inexcusable." The appellant's request for postponement was due to his uncertainty over the length of his incarceration pending trial. This was an adequate reason to grant the appellant's request to postpone the hearing<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Starkey v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 3 MSPR 289, 292 (1980). In <span class="Italic">Starkey,</span> the Board relied on the Seventh Circuit's rationale in <span class="Italic">Heidelberg v. Hammer,</span> 577 F.2d 429 (7th Cir. 1978), which noted that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In a case in which it appears that plaintiff will be released from incarceration within a reasonable time, postponement of the trial is a sensible alternative to requiring plaintiff's presence in court....&#8197;When, however, plaintiff will be incarcerated for many more years,...postponement of the trial is not a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 431; <span class="Italic">see also Starkey,</span> 3 MSPR at 292. Moreover, the appellant in <span class="Italic">Callahan</span> told the administrative judge <span class="Italic">after</span> the hearing had begun that he was having difficulty getting to the hearing location. Here, in contrast, the appellant advised the administrative judge that he could not appear <span class="Italic">before</span> the scheduled hearing date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find, upon consideration of the facts of the instant case, that the administrative judge did not err in dismissing the appeal without prejudice to a later filing. It would have been a better practice, however, to grant only a limited postponement. This is so because the decision on whether to delay the ultimate resolution of the appeal must, in every case, weigh the possible prejudice to the agency's position caused by the delay, against the appellant's right to a hearing in his appeal. <span class="Italic">E.g., Heidelberg,</span> 577 F.2d at 430-31. Thus, before dismissing an appeal due to a potentially lengthy delay, we hold that an administrative judge should determine a reasonable length of time within which the hearing should be held. Where, as here, the appellant is unsure when he will be released from incarceration or will otherwise be available to proceed, the length of delay is uncertain. In such a case, the administrative judge should, instead of or in addition to scheduling a date for refiling, impose a reporting schedule. This will allow the administrative judge a better opportunity to determine either when the appellant might be available for hearing, or when, due to any then-unforeseen circumstances, the agency will be prejudiced by a further delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, on remand, the administrative judge should determine whether the hearing may be held at that time. If the appellant remains unavailable, the administrative judge should, if possible, determine when the situation will change and set an appropriate reporting schedule.</p>

Dept. of Interior</span>, 98 MSPR 349, 350 &#x00B6; 5 (2005) (approving, as to an appellant who requested a hearing in an IRA case, a DWOP during the appellant's incarceration when the appellant was without access to the Internet or telephone).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant's incarceration is to continue for a long time, a telephonic hearing, rather than a continuance, may be appropriate, <span class="Italic">Dunn v. OPM</span>, 60 MSPR 426, 430-31 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges in his petition for review that, even though he was incarcerated, his right to a Board hearing was violated because he was not present at his telephonic hearing. He appears to argue that the administrative judge erred in denying his motion for a continuance of the hearing.</p>

Where the appellant will be incarcerated for a number of years, however, postponement is not an appropriate solution. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 45 MSPR 206, 209 (1990). The appellant's right to a hearing must be balanced against Congress' mandate that the Board process cases in an expeditious manner and, therefore, an administrative judge is not required to postpone a hearing indefinitely, even where a showing of good cause is made<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant was sentenced in February of 1992 to 5 years of imprisonment. We find that the appellant had no absolute right to have the hearing postponed until he was released from prison. We find further that the appellant was afforded a hearing and that his presence at the hearing and the option of a dismissal without prejudice were waived by his attorney below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge denied the appellant's motion for a postponement of the hearing based on his incarceration because the motion lacked specificity. The administrative judge advised the appellant that he could, however, have the appeal decided on the record, request a telephonic hearing, or move for a dismissal of the appeal without prejudice to refiling subsequently. The appellant's attorney requested a telephonic hearing in lieu of an in-person hearing, and stated that he did not want the appeal dismissed without prejudice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge conducted a telephonic hearing on April 1, 1993, at which the appellant was represented by counsel and his wife testified on his behalf. At the beginning of the hearing, the administrative judge stated that "[T]he appellant is not present and not available to be contacted by telephone and...his attorney has indicated that he will proceed without the availability of" the appellant. The appellant's counsel did not object to the administrative judge's statement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant may believe that his attorney erred in making these decisions, having chosen his representative, he is bound by his representative's action....&#8197;Similarly, the appellant's further contention that material evidence that could have been produced was not presented below, due to the ineffective assistance of his counsel, provides no basis for reversing the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Telephonic hearings are not ordinarily favored. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-10-075.html#sec3-75">Videoconference, Telephone Hearing</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most of the cases just discussed involve an appellant who is faced with a hearing on charges that have led to both an adverse action and a criminal action. If the appellant becomes involved in unrelated criminal proceedings that make him temporarily unavailable for Board proceedings, the AJ should consider the length of the delay and the prejudice that may result to the appellant if a continuance is not granted, <span class="Italic">Nunez v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 15 MSPR 476, 477-80 (1983):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly after the hearing was convened, appellant was arrested on the basis of two outstanding traffic warrants, by a San Bernardino County Sheriff. At the time of the arrest appellant was offering testimony on his affirmative defense of national origin discrimination. Appellant's union representative objected to the disruption of the hearing and requested that the hearing be postponed until the appellant could be present. The presiding official agreed to postpone the hearing until the following day if the appellant's representative could arrange for appellant to be present.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the hearing was reconvened on August 5, 1981, the appellant's representative stated for the record that the appellant was unable to raise the $1000.00 bail necessary for his release, and that appellant was being moved to Los Angeles that evening where his criminal case would be disposed of. He asserted that without the appellant's presence and his notes, appellant's case would be severely prejudiced. He then requested a further postponement of the hearing until the appellant could be present.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official denied the request on the grounds that unless the arrest was illegal, appellant had no valid excuse for being absent. The hearing was concluded in appellant's absence. At the close of the <span id="Page_1339"></span>hearing, the presiding official left the record open so that appellant's representative could obtain a statement in affidavit form from appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision dated September 29, 1981, the presiding official sustained the appellant's removal finding that the agency had proven all charges by preponderant evidence and the appellant failed to establish his affirmative defenses of discrimination on the basis of national origin (Mexican) and physical handicap (alcohol and drug dependence).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to appellant's motion to postpone the hearing, the presiding official stated that appellant's absence from the hearing, due to his arrest while the hearing was in progress, did not constitute good cause for delay because the arrest was caused by appellant's own neglect in failing to pay his traffic tickets.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant now petitions the Board for review of the presiding official's initial decision alleging that he was denied a fair hearing because the presiding official erroneously denied his motion to postpone the hearing. The Board hereby GRANTS the petition for review under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1) for the reasons set forth below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">In Risher v. Department of the Army,</span> 10 MSPB 372 at 373 (1982), we reiterated our determination that the basis for a continuance of a hearing before the Board rests on the strong policy considerations that employees be given a hearing on the merits of their cases and be ensured a fair opportunity to secure an independent review of an agency's action. Notwithstanding the competing interests of avoiding unwarranted delays and expediting the administrative resolution of an employee's appeal, <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 MSPB 262 (1980), if a motion for a continuance clearly relates to a matter that is material to the case, the motion should be granted, in the absence of a showing that it would be unduly burdensome, harassing, or cause unwarranted delay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pedersen v. Department of Transportation,</span> 8 MSPB 535 at 537 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision dated September 29, 1981, the presiding official, in effect, held that appellant failed to show good cause for delay, because the circumstances which led to his arrest and subsequent removal from the hearing were not beyond his control. He held further that since the appellant's arrest was due to his own negligence in failing to pay his traffic tickets, he was not entitled to a continuance beyond the one day period which was granted. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Starkey v. Department of Air Force,</span> 3 MSPB 377 (1980) (quoting <span class="Italic">Heidelberg v. Hammer,</span> 577 F.2d 429, 431 (7th Cir. 1978)), we stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In a case in which it appears that plaintiff will be released from incarceration within a reasonable time, postponement of the trial is a sensible alternative to requiring plaintiff's presence in court. When, however, plaintiff will be incarcerated for...years, as in this case, postponement of the trial is not a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is nothing in the record which would indicate that appellant would be incarcerated for an extended period of time. Nor does the record indicate that appellant's absence was motivated by bad faith, bad planning, or procrastination. On the contrary, appellant was ready, willing, and able to fully participate in the hearing, but was prevented from doing so by a fortuitous event. In addition, there is nothing in the record which indicates that the agency would be prejudiced by postponement of the hearing for a reasonable amount of time. Accordingly, we find that appellant established good cause for postponement of the hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record also indicates that appellant was prejudiced by the denial of his motion to postpone. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 46 (1981). Although the presiding official left the record open for three weeks after the close of the hearing so that appellant's representative could obtain appellant's affidavit, we find that this form of gathering testimony was not an effective alternative to appellant's personal appearance for two reasons. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Starkey, supra</span> at 379.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, it appears that appellant's presence and testimony were necessary to the accurate and complete presentation of appellant's case. The presiding official was conducting a preliminary examination of appellant when appellant was arrested and removed from the hearing room. Appellant had raised an allegation of discrimination based on his national origin for the first time at the hearing and the presiding official was trying to determine when appellant became aware of the basis for that allegation. Although the presiding official allowed appellant to allege such discrimination, he ultimately held that appellant failed to prove that affirmative defense because the only evidence put forward in that regard was appellant's own testimony. Appellant's representative asserted that without appellant's presence and his notes, appellant's case would be severely prejudiced. He also asserted that he was not aware until some time after the petition for appeal was filed that appellant felt discriminated against on the basis of his national origin.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Secondly, the record indicates that appellant was transferred to Los Angeles, CA, a city approximately 130 miles from Barstow, CA where the hearing was held. Therefore, consultation with appellant's representative for the purpose of preparing an affidavit for the appellant would be difficult.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we find that good cause for delay was shown and that the presiding official erred by failing to grant appellant's motion for postponement. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(7)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant is in custody and cannot attend his hearing, he must act promptly, not wait months, to tell the AJ of what occurred; otherwise, the appellant waives his right to a hearing. <span class="Italic">McAllister v. Dept. of Army</span>, 11 MSPR 57, 59 (1982).</p>
