<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-371"><span class="space">f.</span> Disability Discrimination; Reasonable Accommodation; Treatment of Medical Records</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2921 and DOD, AAFES, Dallas</span>, 50 FLRA 69, 72 (1994), provides general analysis of Rehabilitation Act cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Rehabilitation Act prohibits Federal agencies from discriminating against qualified handicapped employees and imposes a duty to make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of those employees unless an agency can show that to do so would impose undue hardship on its operations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg, North Carolina and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1770</span>, 42 FLRA 1186, 1192 (1991) (<span class="Italic">citing Rodgers v. Lehman</span>, 869 F.2d 253, 258 (4th Cir. 1989)). Here, the Arbitrator determined that the Agency's attempts to accommodate the grievant by reducing her workload in her present position and then by offering her other positions within her unit at the next lower grade met its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act. We find no support for the Union's claims that there were vacant positions outside the grievant's unit to which she could have been assigned or that the Agency's refusal to reassign the grievant outside her unit was based on her handicap. As such, the Union has not established that the award is deficient as inconsistent with the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 12 and U.S. Department of Labor</span>, 24 FLRA 139, 143-44 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2206 and SSA Birmingham</span>, 59 FLRA 307, 310 (2003), further described the basics of disability discrimination analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 701 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, Federal agencies must provide reasonable accommodations for qualified handicapped employees unless they can show that to do so would impose undue hardship on their operations. <span class="Italic">See United States DOJ, INS</span>, 57 FLRA 254, 255 (2001). The relevant regulation defines "reasonable accommodation" as "[m]odifications or adjustments to the work environment, or to the manner or circumstances under which the position held or desired is customarily performed, that enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of that position[.]" 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question whether a proposed accommodation is reasonable is "fact-specific" and must be evaluated on a "case-by-case basis." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Austin Serv. Ctr.</span>, 58 FLRA 546, 548 (2003) (citing <span class="Italic">Wernick v. Fed'l Reserve Bank of N.Y.</span>, 91 F.3d 379, 385 (2d Cir. 1996) (<span class="Italic">IRS Austin</span>)). An employer is not obligated to provide an employee the accommodation requested; the employer need only provide some reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Zivkovic v. S. Cal. Edison Co.</span>, 302 F.3d 1080, 1089 (9th Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc.</span>, 253 F.3d 943, 951 (7th Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Aka v. Wash. Hosp. Ctr.</span>, 156 F.3d 1284, 1305 (D.C. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency reasonably accommodated the sight-impaired and learning-impaired probationary employees. With regard to the sight-impaired probationary employee, the Arbitrator noted that employee's testimony that although she was not given the reader she requested when she was first hired, she was given one when she was assigned to the training module. With regard to the learning-impaired probationary employee, the Arbitrator found that the Agency did not act unreasonably in denying that employee training in areas where she was performing adequately. The Union does not state that the accommodations that were provided to these probationary employees were insufficient to enable them to perform the essential functions of their positions, nor does the Union explain why any other accommodations would have been necessary for that purpose. Accordingly, we conclude that the Union has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's finding of reasonable accommodation is deficient, and we deny the exception. <span class="Italic">Cf. IRS Austin</span>, 58 FLRA at 548 ("where an accommodation was provided, the grievant was able to perform her duties with that accommodation, and the [a]rbitrator provided no legally recognizable basis for concluding that the accommodation was not proper[,]" the Authority set aside the finding that the agency failed to reasonably accommodate the grievant).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to the Rehabilitation Act (the Act). In particular, the Union argues that the Agency knew of the grievant's need for an accommodation before it suspended him, and therefore, the suspension was discriminatory.

<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;Although the initial inquiry in a discrimination case usually focuses on whether the complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, following this order of analysis is unnecessary when the agency has articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. <span class="Italic">Rowland v.

<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Arbitrator erred by finding that the Agency met its obligations under the Act to accommodate the grievant.&#x2003;On this point, the Union contends that, by the time the grievant engaged in the incident for which he was suspended, the Agency "kn[e]w...that an accommodation was warranted." It argues that the Agency therefore discriminated against the grievant when it failed to grant the requested accommodation before the incident occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union has failed to demonstrate that the award should be vacated on these grounds.&#x2003;The Arbitrator found that the Agency could not have provided the requested accommodation sooner because required documents were not submitted until after the incident. Moreover, the Union does not dispute that the grievant's failure to include a physician's statement verifying his medical condition with his initial FMLA request was a contributing factor to the request being delayed. Because the record shows that the Agency participated in the interactive process, acted in good faith, and otherwise met its obligations under this process, the Arbitrator did not err by rejecting the Union's discrimination claim.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under the Act, a grievant must show that he or she: (1) has a disability within the meaning of the Act; (2) is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) was discriminated against because of his or her disability. <span class="Italic">See Austin Service Ctr.</span>, 58 FLRA at 547–48 (citing <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc.</span>, 117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997)).

<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute in this case as to whether the grievant is a qualified individual with a disability. The issue raised by the Agency's exception concerns whether the Arbitrator applied the proper legal framework to support his conclusion that the agency failed to provide the grievant with a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, it should be noted that an agency's duty to provide reasonable accommodation is an ongoing one. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ralph v. Lucent Technologies, Inc.</span>, 135 F.3d 166, 171–72 (1st Cir. 1998) (<span class="Italic">Ralph</span>); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v.

Consequently,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[c]ertain individuals require only one reasonable accommodation, while others may need more than one. Still others may need one reasonable accommodation for a period of time, and then at a later date, require another type of reasonable accommodation. If an individual requests multiple reasonable accommodations, s/he is entitled only to those accommodations that are necessitated by a disability and that will provide an equal employment opportunity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> at 3. <span class="Italic">See also Ralph</span>, 135 F.3d at 172 ("The duty to provide reasonable accommodation is...not exhausted by one effort.") (citing <span class="Italic">Bultemeyer v. Fort Wayne Community Sch.</span>, 100 F.3d 1281, 1285 (7th Cir. 1996) (<span class="Italic">Bultemeyer</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"Determining an appropriate reasonable accommodation for an employee with a disability should be an interactive process involving both the employee and the employer." <span class="Italic">Billman v.

The process involves a dialogue between the employee and employer, a sharing of information back and forth, the goal of which is to identify the employee's needs and the most effective accommodation of those needs. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Barnett v. U.S. Air, Inc.</span>, 228 F.3d 1105, 1114–15 (9th Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Hendricks-Robinson v.

<p class="noindent-1">The dialogue is usually initiated when an employee indicates in some way, or it is otherwise obvious, that he or she has a disability for which an accommodation is needed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hendricks-Robinson</span>, 154 F.3d at 693; <span class="Italic">Guidance</span>, "Requesting Reasonable Accommodation" (Question 1). An agency's duty to provide reasonable accommodation is triggered at that point. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> "The exact nature of the dialogue will vary depending on the employee's disability, but, where the disability and/or need for accommodation is not obvious, the employer may ask for information and documentation about the employee's disability and functional limitations." <span class="Italic">Wilbourne</span> at 4. <span class="Italic">See also Guidance</span>, "Requesting Reasonable Accommodation" (Question 6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[B]oth parties bear responsibility for determining what accommodation is necessary." <span class="Italic">Bultemeyer</span>, 100 F.3d at 1285 (citing <span class="Italic">Beck v. Univ. of Wisconsin Bd. of Regents</span>, 75 F.3d 1130, 1135 (7th Cir. 1996) (<span class="Italic">Beck</span>)). In determining whether an agency has met its obligation to provide reasonable accommodation for a qualified employee with a disability, it is important to "look for signs of failure to participate in good faith or failure by one of the parties to make reasonable efforts to help the other party determine what specific accommodations are necessary." <span class="Italic">Beck</span>, 75 F.3d at 1135. More specifically, it is important to "isolate the cause of the breakdown" in the communication between the parties "and then assign responsibility." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In this regard, "the cause of the breakdown might be missing information." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> "Where the missing information is of the type that can only be provided by one of the parties, failure to provide the information may be the cause of the breakdown and the party withholding the information may be found to have obstructed the process." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1136.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, where the failure to provide a reasonable accommodation for a qualified employee with a disability is traceable to the fact that the employee did not provide necessary information, the agency is not liable for that failure. <span class="Italic">Beck</span>, 75 F.3d at 1136–37 (court found that "responsibility for failure to isolate the necessary specific accommodations" fell on the employee because "the information required" to determine those accommodations "was of the type that only" the employee could provide and the employee did not provide that information). <span class="Italic">See also Conneen v. MBNA America Bank, N.A.</span>, 334 F.3d 318, 333 (3rd Cir. 2003) (<span class="Italic">Conneen</span>) (no violation because parties understood accommodation was temporary and employee would, if condition persisted, need to provide further documentation to employer to substantiate need for <span id="page_2388"></span>additional accommodation, but employee failed to do so); <span class="Italic">Templeton v. Neodata Services Inc.</span>, 162 F.3d 617, 618–19 (10th Cir. 1998) (<span class="Italic">Templeton</span>) ("the employee's failure to provide medical information necessary to the interactive process precludes her from claiming that the employer" committed a violation "by failing to provide reasonable accommodation."). Stated differently, where an agency properly attempts to engage in the interactive process but is unable to determine what, if any, accommodation would be reasonable due to the failure of the employee to provide necessary information, the agency will be found to be in compliance with the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Billman</span> at 4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the circumstances of this case, the grievant requested, as a new or additional accommodation for her disability, a parking place at the rear of the building in which she worked. The Agency, which had provided the grievant an accommodation of her disability in the 1993 NSA, under which the grievant had worked for 8 years, requested information about the current state of her disability. When the grievant provided the medical information upon which the accommodation in the 1993 NSA was based, the Agency requested more current information, but the grievant did not provide any. Thus, the Agency was unable to assess whether there had been any change in her condition sufficient to warrant the accommodation which she requested. As the breakdown in the interactive process is traceable to the failure of the grievant to update the information on her disability, under the applicable legal framework the burden of that breakdown falls on the grievant and precludes her from claiming that the Agency failed to provide her a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Conneen, Tempelton, Beck</span>, and <span class="Italic">Billman.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, under the applicable legal framework, the Arbitrator's conclusion that the Agency failed to comply with the Rehabilitation Act, as required by the contract, is legally deficient. Accordingly, we find that the Arbitrator's award, insofar as it requires the Agency to provide the grievant a parking place at the rear of its building, is contrary to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and deficient under &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1) of the Statute. Therefore, we set aside that portion of the award.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, certain legal principles govern the process of requesting reasonable accommodations and responding to those requests. As relevant here, when a qualified individual with a disability requests a reasonable accommodation, this triggers an "interactive process" that requires an employer to (among other things) act in good faith to assist the employee in seeking accommodation.[22] In this regard, "when the duty to reasonably accommodate arises, both employee and employer must ‘exchange essential information[,] and neither side can delay or obstruct the process.'"[23] Under Executive Order (E.O.) 13,164, "[e]ach [f]ederal agency shall establish effective written procedures for processing requests for reasonable accommodation by employees and applicants with disabilities."[24] In its Policy Guidance on E.O. 13,164, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) states that an agency may not "require that a request for reasonable accommodation be made to a certain agency official[.]"[25] Further, EEOC regulations implementing the Act provide that even if a particular, requested reasonable accommodation that is otherwise appropriate is not possible at a given time, an employer's knowledge that it will be possible in the near future obligates the employer to offer that accommodation once it does become possible.[26]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Member Pizzella suggested in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1992</span> that EEOC is a more appropriate tribunal to resolve accommodation issues, 69 FLRA at 571:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">This case demonstrates the strange results that can occur when employees and unions fail to direct their grievances and workplace complaints to the jurisdictional body which has the legal and technical expertise to best render a determination on a complaint which pertains to a request for reasonable accommodation. In this case, it is the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) which is the jurisdictional entity which has the best, and most extensive, legal expertise to render a decision on the responsibilities of agencies and employees with respect to requests for reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">My observation is based in common sense and is supported by the fact that Congress created several quasi-judicial authorities--the Authority, the EEOC, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), and the Office of Special Counsel (OSC)--to adjudicate different and complex bodies of law. Whereas the Authority is entitled to deference in matters concerning the collective-bargaining process, it is the EEOC which is the recognized expert in matters concerning Title VII and requests for reasonable accommodation (among others), the MSPB in matters concerning adverse actions and reductions in force (among others), and the OSC in matters concerning whistleblower complaints and prohibited personnel practices (among others).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">But my observation of this notion is supported by more than common sense. The notion that specific complaints are best left to the jurisdictional body with the most expertise is supported by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit which has reminded the Authority on more than one occasion (but most recently this majority) that the Authority has no business using our "organic" Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute) to interpret federal statutes that fall outside of our purview and expertise. When the Authority goes beyond our "area of expertise" the Authority generally adds even more confusion to an area of law that is already complex.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">By choosing the grievance forum, rather than using the complaint procedures set forth in Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act, the Union gets the result one might expect--an erroneous award by an Arbitrator who did not apply the correct legal standard and an erroneous determination by the Authority which misapplies the legal requirements imposed by the Rehabilitation Act and which assumes facts and makes factual findings which are unnecessary to resolve this case.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;However, the framework for analyzing Title VII cases does not apply where an "employer challenges a plaintiff's claim that he [or she] is a qualified handicapped person' who, with reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question[,]'" or "the employing agency offers the affirmative defense of 'undue hardship on the operation of its program.'" <span class="Italic">Gelb</span>, 2 F.3d at 1186.

In the context of a claim of discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established if the plaintiff shows that he or she: (1) is a handicapped person within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act; (2) is otherwise qualified for the position; (3) works for a program or activity covered under the Rehabilitation Act; and (4) was adversely treated attributed solely to the presence of a handicap. <span class="Italic">See Doe v.

<p class="noindent-1">Once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is shown, the burden of production shifts to the defendant, who must produce evidence of a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for taking the challenged action. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 52 FLRA at 362; <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 44 F.3d at 718.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's exceptions challenge the Arbitrator's finding that the Union met its burden of persuasion on the issue of intentional discrimination. In particular, the Agency states that the Arbitrator erred in failing to find that the Agency's asserted reason for the delay in obtaining a neurological examination--administrative problems in obtaining approval for that examination--justified the amount of time that it took to arrange the examination. As the Authority recently stated in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the Supreme Court concluded in <span class="Italic">Hicks</span> that "'[t]he factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant...may, together with the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, suffice to show intentional discrimination.

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator applied this standard in determining, based on inferences from the record, that the Union demonstrated that the Agency discriminated against the grievant. First, she found that the Union established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. She then examined all of the evidence and rejected the Agency's proffered reason for the 4-month delay in procuring the grievant's neurological examination, which ultimately caused the Agency to delay the grievant's return to work. Based on the evidence in the record, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency intentionally discriminated against the grievant. As we recently stated in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the Authority does not look behind an arbitrator's finding of fact. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 369. In light of the Arbitrator's factual findings, under properly allocated burdens, we conclude that the evidence supports the Arbitrator's ultimate finding of intentional discrimination. Accordingly, the Agency's exceptions are denied.</p> 
<p class="noindent">Disability discrimination was explored in greater depth, and FLRA imposed a rigorous standard for arbitrators who would find that discrimination, <span class="Italic">OPM and AFGE Local 32</span>, 61 FLRA 358, 361-63 (2005), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied,</span> 61 FLRA 657 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Applicable standards of law</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving exceptions pertaining to disability discrimination, we apply the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. As noted earlier, the Rehabilitation Act addresses disability discrimination in federal employment. The ADA does not apply because the United States is not an "employer[,]" within the meaning of the ADA. <span class="Italic">See </span>42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(5)(B)(i). However, in resolving whether an award is contrary to the Rehabilitation Act, we apply the standards of the ADA because Congress has specifically adopted the standards of the ADA for determining whether there has been disability discrimination in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See </span>29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(g); <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </span>57 FLRA 254, 255 (2001) (<span class="Italic">INS</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Rehabilitation Act defines an "individual with a disability" as, in pertinent part, "any person who--(i) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities[.]" 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 705(20)(B). Under the regulations implementing the Rehabilitation Act, the definitions under the ADA set forth in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2 are applied to determine whether a claimant has an impairment and whether the impairment substantially limits a major life activity. <span class="Italic">See </span>29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203. Accordingly, in assessing whether the Arbitrator correctly concluded that the grievant was an "individual with a disability[,]" we will apply the definitions of &#x00A7; 1630.2. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Rev. Serv., Austin Serv. Ctr., </span>58 FLRA 546, 547-48 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 1630.2, "[p]hysical or mental impairment" means:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1) Any physiological disorder, or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss...; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2) Any mental or psychological disorder....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(h). "Major [l]ife [a]ctivities" means "functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630(2)(i). "Substantially limits" means:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i) Unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii) Significantly restricted as to the condition, manner or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform that same major life activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1). On the basis of this definition, courts have held that a claimant must introduce evidence showing the capabilities of an average person for comparison purposes. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lusk v. Ryder Integrated Logistics, </span>238 F.3d 1237, 1241 (10th Cir. 2001) (<span class="Italic">Lusk</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a claimant is substantially limited in a major life activity, the regulations instruct that the following factors should be considered: "(i) [t]he nature and severity of the impairment; (ii) [t]he duration...of the impairment; and (iii) [t]he permanent or long[-]term impact...of[,] or resulting from[,] the impairment." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2 (j)(2). The regulations also provide that a claimant is substantially limited in the major life activity of "working" when the claimant is "significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(i). The regulations specify that "[t]he inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court has discussed many of these definitions.&#x2003;The Court held that "substantially" in the phrase "substantially limits" means that the limitation must be "considerable" or "to a large degree." <span class="Italic">Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky, v. Williams, </span>534 U.S. 184, 196 (2002). The Court held that "[m]ajor" in the phrase "[m]ajor [l]ife [a]ctivities" means "important[,]" and "[m]ajor [l]ife [a]ctivities" are "activities that are of central importance to daily life." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 197. After reviewing the legislative findings and purposes that motivated the ADA, the Court stated that "these terms need to be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the Court held that for an impairment to have a substantial limitation on a major life activity, the impairment must "prevent[&#8197;] or severely restrict[&#8197;] the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 198. The Court also held that "[i]t is insufficient for individuals attempting to prove disability status under this test to merely submit evidence of a medical diagnosis of an impairment. Instead, the ADA requires those 'claiming the Act's protection...to prove disability by offering evidence that the extent of the limitation [caused by their impairment] in terms of their own experience...is substantial.'" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(quoting <span class="Italic">Albertson's Inc. v. Kirkingburg,</span> 527 U.S. 555, 567 (1999)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Court has held that the determination of whether a claimant is an individual with a disability must take into consideration whether the person is substantially limited in a major life activity when using a mitigating measure, such as medication. <span class="Italic">See Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </span>527 U.S. 471 (1999). Consequently, claimants may be considered disabled when their substantial limitations are attributable to the negative effects of medication. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gasser v. Ramsey, </span>125 F. Supp.2d 1 (D.D.C. 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Application of standards of law</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have assessed the Arbitrator's award and the record under these standards. With recognition of the Supreme Court's admonition that the standards of the ADA need to be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled, we conclude that the finding of discrimination is deficient. The Arbitrator's summary conclusions fail to establish that the grievant is an individual with a disability, and the record does not support such a conclusion. Consequently, we find that the Arbitrator's conclusion that the grievant is an individual with a disability is contrary to the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of her conclusion that the grievant was an individual with a disability, the Arbitrator relied on the grievant's testimony and "a great deal of medical documentation, dated September 5, 2002, stating the presence of migraine headaches and the effects of...medications[.]" On the basis of "these physical and mental limitations, th[e] Arbitrator [found] that the [g]rievant is an individual with a disability that substantially limits one (1) or more of his major life activities, which include his ability to take care of himself, and his performance of manual tasks, as well as learning and working."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the record shows that the only medical documentation dated September 5, 2002, is the grievant's request for 8 hours of sick leave for September 4, 2002, on which he remarked "Severe Head Pain/Migraine" with a note from a medical group, which stated only that the grievant was released to work on September 5, 2002, but was "Unable to work on 9/4/02/[.]" The grievant testified to "an injury to [his] head" and that his <span id="page_2390"></span>doctor explained to him that he "probably w[ould] have some long-term debilitating side effects" from the injury and "probably would experience points or periods of memory loss, or sometime...have problems with [his] equilibrium or balance[.]" The grievant further testified that his memory had been affected and that he needed to keep a notepad to "keep pace with the daily activities as far as grocery shopping[&#8197;] and things like that." The grievant also testified to head pain that his doctor told him were like migraines.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to questions about medications, the grievant answered that he took medications both before and after his head injury. When asked about side effects to "those medications[,]" he answered "diarrhea" and "fatigue[&#8197;][.]" The grievant was also asked the reasons for requesting an accommodation to his work schedule and he explained that he "was still under...doctor's care, and the medication and activity made [him] drowsy, fatigued."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of the record demonstrates that the Arbitrator's summary conclusion of discrimination is unsupported. For example, the record does not establish that the grievant was substantially limited in the major life activities of "his ability to take care of himself, and his performance of manual tasks, as well as learning and working." In this regard, the Arbitrator did not specifically discuss the nature and severity of the impairment, its duration or expected duration, or its permanence or long-term impact. <span class="Italic">See </span>29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(2). Moreover, the Arbitrator did not explain, and the record does not demonstrate, how the grievant's impairment or the effect of medication for the impairment prevents or severely restricts him from engaging in activities that are of central importance to most people's lives. <span class="Italic">See Toyota, </span>534 U.S. at 198.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also does not support a conclusion that the grievant is unable to perform a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform.&#x2003;There is no indication of any significant restrictions on the grievant as to the condition, manner, or duration under which he can perform the specified major life activities, as compared to the condition, manner, or duration under which the average person in the general population can perform these major life activities. Indeed, the Arbitrator does not discuss, and the record does not contain any evidence showing, the capabilities of an average person for purposes of comparison with the grievant. <span class="Italic">See Lusk, </span>238 F.3d at 1241. As the Court held in <span class="Italic">Toyota</span>, it is insufficient for claimants attempting to prove disability status to merely rely on a medical diagnosis of an impairment. Instead, they must prove disability by offering evidence that the extent of the limitation caused by the impairment is substantial in terms of their own experience. <span class="Italic">See </span>534 U.S. at 198. There is no such proof in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, with respect to the major life activity of working, the award fails to satisfy the requirements of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3). The Arbitrator did not explain, and the record does not demonstrate, how the grievant's impairment or the effect of medication for the impairment substantially limited the grievant in the major life activity of working. There is no discussion in the award or indication in the record of any significant restrictions on the grievant's ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills, and abilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For all of these reasons, we conclude that the finding that the grievant is an individual with a disability is deficient.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Legal framework: reasonable accommodation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under the Act, a grievant must show that he or she: (1) has a disability within the meaning of the Act; (2) is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position in question, with or without reasonable accommodation; [10] and (3) was discriminated against because of his or her disability.[11] <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Army, Corps of Engr's, Huntington Dist., Huntington, W.

An agency commits unlawful discrimination by failing to reasonably accommodate a qualified individual with a known disability unless the agency demonstrates that such accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the agency. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;Under the Act, the phrase '"position in question' is not limited to the position actually held by the employee, but also includes reassignment to vacant positions at the employee's current grade level, or if none, positions at the highest available grade level or level below the employee's current grade or level." <span class="Italic">Yarbrough v.

No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (2008)). <span class="Italic">See also,</span> EEOC Notice Concerning the [ADA] Amendments Act of 2008. As these amendments became effective January 1, 2009, courts have concluded that such amendments cannot be applied retroactively to conduct that preceded the effective date. <span class="Italic">See Moran v. Premier Educ. Group,</span> 599 F. Supp 2d 263, 271 (D. Conn. 2009) (citing <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film Prods.,</span> 511 U.S. 244 (1994)) and <span class="Italic">Fernandez-Vargas v.

<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute in this case that the grievant is: (1) a qualified individual with a disability; and (2) qualified to perform the essential functions of the positions in question, with or without accommodation. The issues that are the focus of the Agency's exceptions concern whether the grievant properly invoked the accommodation process so as to render the Agency liable for failure to provide him with a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Oct.&#x2003;17 Guidance [EEOC "Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the American with Disabilities Act," No. 915.002 (October 17, 2002) (EEOC October 17 Guidance)] provides that requests for reasonable accommodation do not need to be in writing, and an individual need not mention the Act or reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See also </span>EEOC Oct. 20 Guidance ["Reasonable Accommodation Policy Statement" and EEOC's "Policy Guidance on Executive Order 13164: Establishing Procedures to Facilitate the Provision of Reasonable Accommodations," No. 915.003 (October 20, 2000)], which provides that an individual need not mention the Act or the phrase "reasonable accommodation." As the court stated in <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[While the notice does not need to be in writing,...or formally invoke the magic words "reasonable accommodation," the notice must nonetheless make clear that the employee wants assistance for his or her disability. In other words, the employer must know of both the disability and the employee's desire for accommodation for that disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">These rules are consistent with the statute[,] which says that the employer must make reasonable accommodations to an employee's "known" disability....&#8197;What matters under the [Act] are not formalisms about the manner of the request, but whether the employee...provides the employer with enough information that, under the circumstances, the employer can be fairly said to know of both the disability and desire for an accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 184 F.3d at 313.[12] It is not necessary that the employer have actual knowledge of an employee's disability, or his or her need for assistance, for the request to be legally sufficient. <span class="Italic">See Conneen v. MBNA America Bank, N.A.,</span> 334 F.3d 318, 332 (3rd Cir. 2003) (<span class="Italic">Conneen</span>) ("...circumstances must at least be sufficient to cause a reasonable employer to make appropriate inquiries about the possible need for an accommodation."). "The quantum of information that will be required will...often depend on what the employer already knows." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 332.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">EEOC v. Sears, Roebuck &#x0026; Co.,</span> 417 F.3d 789, 803 (7th Cir. 2005) (<span class="Italic">Sears,</span> <span class="Italic">Roebuck &#x0026; Co.</span>), the court stated that "the 'initial duty to inform the employer of a disability[&#8197;]'...requires at most that the employee indicate to the employer that [he or] she has a disability and desires an accommodation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an employee's request carries with it sufficient information to put the employer on notice that the employee is seeking an accommodation for his or her disability, an interactive process between the employer and the employee is triggered.[13] Given sufficient notice, the employer has a mandatory obligation to engage in the process. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vinson v. Thomas,</span> 288 F.3d 1145, 1154 (9th Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;"Once the employer knows of the disability and the employee's desire for accommodations, it makes sense to place the burden on the employer to request additional information that the employer believes it needs." <span class="Italic">Taylor,</span> 184 F.3d at 315.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the disability and/or need for accommodation is not obvious, the employer may ask for information and documentation about the employee's functional limitations. <span class="Italic">Huntington Dist.,</span> 59 FLRA at 797.[14] <span class="Italic">See also </span>EEOC Oct. 17 Guidance, Question 6 under "Requesting Reasonable Accommodation." For example, because there must be a connection between the disability, and the limitations resulting from the disability, and the requested accommodation, the employer may need to obtain, and the employee to provide, information and/or explanation that would establish the requisite nexus. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Felix v. N.Y. City Transit Auth,</span> 324 F.3d 102, 107 (2nd Cir. 2003) (employee "must show a causal connection between the specific condition which impairs a major life activity and the accommodation.'")</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_2391"></span>[14]&#x2003;As the court stated in <span class="Italic">Sears, Roebuck &#x0026; Co,</span> 417 F.3d at 804: "Where notice is ambiguous as to the precise nature of the disability or desired accommodation, but it is sufficient to notify the employer that the employee may have a disability that requires accommodation, the employer must ask for clarification....In other words, an employer cannot shield itself from liability by choosing not to follow up on an employee's requests for assistance, or by intentionally remaining in the dark."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employer's duty to provide reasonable accommodation, and potential liability for failure to provide such accommodation, arises when the interactive process is triggered. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Huntington Dist.,</span> 59 FLRA at 797 (citing <span class="Italic">Hendricks-Robinson v. Excel Corp.,</span> 154 F.3d 685, 693 (7th Cir. 1988)). An employer must act in a timely manner through the process, and an agency that obstructs or delays the interactive process is not acting in good faith.[15] Under the framework outlined above, an employee demonstrates that an employer violated its obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation because it failed to participate in good faith in the interactive process by showing that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;the employer knew about the employee's disability; (2) the employee requested accommodations or assistance for his or her disability; (3) the employer did not make a good faith effort to assist the employee in seeking accommodations; and (4) the employee could have been reasonably accommodated but for the employer's lack of good faith.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Williams v. Phila. Hous. Auth. Police Dept.,</span> 380 F.3d 751, 772 (3rd Cir. 2004) (citing <span class="Italic">Taylor,</span> 184 F.3d at 319-20).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15]&#x2003;See EEOC Oct. 17 Guidance, Question 10 under "Requesting Reasonable Accommodation":</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An employer should respond expeditiously to a request for reasonable accommodation. If the employer and the individual with a disability need to engage in an interactive process, this too should proceed as quickly as possible. Similarly, the employer should act promptly to provide the reasonable accommodation. Unnecessary delays can result in a violation of the [Act].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Application of the reasonable accommodation framework: the Arbitrator's award finding that the Agency failed to provide the grievant reasonable accommodation is not contrary to law</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this framework to the Arbitrator's award in this case, the Arbitrator properly concluded that the Agency failed to provide the grievant with a reasonable accommodation for his disability. Specifically, the Arbitrator found that the Agency was on notice as to the grievant's disability at the time the grievant requested an accommodation, at least as early as the June letter. In this regard, he found that supervisor 1 "was well aware of the [g]rievant's asthma" as early as January 2002 because of his absence from work as a result of that condition. The Arbitrator noted that supervisor 1 admitted to that knowledge. The Arbitrator's factual findings show that Supervisor 1 testified that she knew the grievant's asthma '"was considered a disability.'"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Arbitrator found that "stress" factors the grievant experienced as a result of his work in the Refund 1 unit exacerbated his asthma. The Arbitrator's factual findings also show that supervisor 1 had reason to know of the connection between the grievant's work and his disability because of her discussions with the labor relations office. In particular, the Arbitrator's factual findings referring to the content of this e-mail reveal Supervisor 1 was aware that the grievant took leave for health reasons when he experienced stress as a result of difficulty in learning his new job in that unit. Thus, the Arbitrator's factual findings establish not only that the Agency knew of the grievant's medical disability--"problems with asthma"--but had reason to know that there was a connection between that disability and the "stress" he experienced in his job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the "grievant's "discussion" with supervisor 1 in May, indicating a need to be "reassigned] for reasons of health, and the supervisor's existing knowledge of the grievant's asthma and the effect of job stress on his asthmatic condition demonstrates that the Agency was aware that the grievant's request for a reassignment in his June letter was a request for an accommodation due to a medical disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the Agency claim that the Arbitrator's definition of "a reasonable accommodation request" is inadequate based on the EEOC October 17 Guidance concerning how an individual requests a reasonable accommodation, that is, an individual must let the employer know that an adjustment in work is needed for a reason related to a medical condition, the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's application of that phrase as applied in the EEOC October 20 Guidance or the EEOC October 17 Guidance is inconsistent with such Guidance. As discussed above, the Arbitrator's factual findings show that, in the circumstances of this case, the Agency was aware that the grievant's request for a reassignment in his June letter was a request for an accommodation for his disability--problems with asthma. Also, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Chavis</span> provides no basis for finding that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the grievant's request for a reassignment in his June letter was a request for an accommodation of his disability. According to the Agency, in <span class="Italic">Chavis</span> the EEOC "determined that a complainant's transfer request to another state was not a request for reasonable accommodation. The EEOC's finding in <span class="Italic">Chavis</span> was based on facts that are distinguishable from the instant case. In this regard, the EEOC found that the employee failed to provide medical documentation or to otherwise prove that he sought a transfer to another location as an accommodation for a disability. On the other hand, in this case, the record contains sufficient evidence that establishes that the grievant sought the reassignment as an accommodation for his disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, based on the above, the Agency's assertions do not establish that the June letter was insufficient to put the Agency on notice that the grievant was requesting an accommodation for a disability, and that there was no connection between the disability and the requested accommodation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Taylor,</span> 184 F.3d. at 314-15 (when employer has more than enough background information, the amount of information in an employee's request for accommodation need not be specific and detailed).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that the Agency was obligated to engage in an "interactive process" with the grievant beginning at least with the June letter, the Arbitrator found that, from the point at which the Agency received sufficient notice of the grievant's request for accommodation in the June letter, the Agency "did nothing[&#8197;]" to provide a reasonable accommodation. In particular, the Arbitrator found that EEOC directives implementing the Act require agencies to ""expeditiously"' process a request for accommodation and that the Agency violated its obligation to act quickly with respect to the request. Thus, the Arbitrator found that Supervisors 1 and 2 "were both culpable and should have attempted to find a reasonable accommodation for the [g]rievant no later than...June of 2002." Given this, as the Arbitrator found, the Agency's reliance on its later actions does not constitute a defense to its earlier failure to act in good faith towards the June 2002 request. Also, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Beck v. Univ. of Wis. Bd. of Regents,</span> 75 F.3d 1130, 1135 (7th Cir. 1996) (once an employer has knowledge of an employee's disability and the employee has requested accommodation, the employer should engage in an interactive process with the employee).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Agency's arguments do not establish that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the Agency failed to reasonably accommodate the grievant's request for accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Legal framework: retaliation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator did not apply the appropriate legal framework in determining that the Agency acted in reprisal against the grievant for the grievant's EEO activity and further asserts that as the Arbitrator "did not differentiate the Agency's actions he believed were motivated by prior EEO activity from those actions he believed were evidence of' hostile work environment]'...[it would] assume that the Arbitrator listed all of these incidents as support for each claim."...&#8197;[W]e construe the Agency's claim as an assertion that the Arbitrator's finding of reprisal on the basis of the grievant's involvement in the EEO process and his disability violates title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e <span class="Italic">et</span> seq. (Title VII) and the Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Singletary v. D. C, et al,</span> 351 F.3d 519, 524 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (<span class="Italic">Singletary</span>); <span class="Italic">Quiles-Quiles v. Henderson,</span> 439 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">Quiles-Quiles</span>) ("The Rehabilitation Act prohibits retaliation against employees for complaining about violations of the Act."); <span class="Italic">Coons v. Sec'y of the Treasury,</span> 383 F.3d 879, 887 (9th Cir. 2004) ("the ADA prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee who seeks an accommodation in good faith") (citing <span class="Italic">Heisler v. Metro. Council,</span> 339 F.3d 622, 630 n.5) (8th Cir. 2003)). Also, a retaliation claim under the ADA is analyzed under the same framework employed in Title VII cases. <span class="Italic">Lovejoy-Wilson v. Noco Motor Fuel, Inc.,</span> 263 F.3d 208 (2nd Cir. 2001). As the Authority applies the standards of the ADA in applying the Act, we consider the Agency's arguments based on the same framework.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A complainant "can establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal discrimination" under title VII by presenting facts that, if unexplained, reasonably give rise to an inference of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Buggs v. Powell,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A24607 (November 17, 2003) (<span class="Italic">Buggs</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Shapiro v. Social Security Administration,</span> EEOC Request No. 05960403 (December 6, 1996)). Consistent with the burden-shifting formula set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792 (1973), a complainant may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal by showing that: (1) he or she engaged in a protected activity; (2) subsequently, he or she was subjected to adverse treatment by the agency; and (3) a nexus, or causal connection, exists between the protected activity and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Holcomb v. FDIC,</span> 433 F.3d 889, 903 (D.C. Cir. (2006). <span class="Italic">See also Buggs,</span> which adds the additional element that it must be shown that the employer is aware of the complainant's protected activity. In particular, a violation will be found if an employer retaliates against a worker for engaging in protected activity through threats, harassment in or out of the workplace, or any <span id="page_2392"></span>other adverse treatment that is reasonably likely to deter protected activity by that individual. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Burlington N. &#x0026; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White,</span> 548 U.S. 53, 59-66 (2006). <span class="Italic">See also Jensen v. Potter,</span> 435 F.3d 444, 448 (3rd Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">Jensen</span>) (majority of Federal circuit courts of appeal hold that a retaliation claim predicated on a hostile work environment is cognizable under title VII).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, in <span class="Italic">Jensen,</span> the court stated that "[retaliatory conduct...violates Title VII when it '"alters the employee's compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,' deprives him or her of employment opportunities,' or 'adversely affect[s] his [or her] status as an employee.'" <span class="Italic">Id. See also Buboltz v.

Geithner,</span> 2009 EEOPUB LEXIS 234 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Geithner</span>) (direct evidence is an action or statement of an employer which reflects a discriminatory or retaliatory attitude, and which correlates to the challenged act). A violation may also be established indirectly, through circumstantial evidence, where such evidence gives rise to an inference of retaliation and the employer is unable to "produce evidence of a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged action, or if the reason advanced" by the employer "is a pretext to hide the retaliatory motive." EEOC Compliance Manual, Section 8, "Retaliation," at 8-17. Initially, this inference arises "where there is proof that the protected activity and the adverse action were related." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8-18. "Typically," the relation is demonstrated by evidence that: (1) the adverse action occurred shortly after the protected activity, and (2) the person who took the adverse action was aware of the complainant's protected activity before taking the action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Generally speaking, for "mere temporal proximity" to constitute "sufficient evidence of causality to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the "temporal proximity must be 'very close.'" <span class="Italic">Clark County School Dist. v. Breeden,</span> 532 U.S. 268, 273 (2001). However, an inference of retaliation may arise even if the time period between the protected activity and the adverse action was long, if there is other evidence that raises an inference of retaliation. <span class="Italic">Howard v. Potter,</span> 2008 EEOPUB LEXIS 1580.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;Application of the retaliation framework: the Arbitrator's award finding that the Agency retaliated against the grievant is not contrary to law</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that the grievant satisfies the first part of the test for retaliation, as he sought a reasonable accommodation in good faith as well as initiated an EEO complaint under the Agency process. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McGinest v. GTE Service Corp.,</span> 360 F.3d 1103, 1124 n.19 (9th Cir. 2004) (simply meeting with an EEO counselor is protected activity). It is clear, as well, that supervisor 2, at least, knew of the grievant's EEO activity because he gave a deposition in the EEO case and, as discussed above, the Agency was aware of the grievant's request for a reasonable accommodation for his health.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Arbitrator's factual findings demonstrate that the employee was subjected to adverse Agency action. In this regard, the Arbitrator's factual findings show that, after the grievant submitted a letter, expressing concerns about, among other things, his health and requesting a reassignment, through supervisor 1 to supervisor 2, that supervisor required the grievant to "rewrite the letter...and to leave out any references to his health. Such action adversely affected the grievant in that it delayed action on his reassignment request for accommodation of his medical condition until November 2002, some six months later and "ultimately caused the [g]rievant's health to deteriorate to the point he had to medically retire."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Arbitrator's factual findings show that, in response to the earlier EEO complaint, supervisor 2 "characterize[ed]" the grievant as a "complainer" without any "specific examples[,]" and that such characterization indicated a "pre-existing negative bias" by this supervisor. The Arbitrator's factual findings show that subsequent to the grievant's request and while the EEO complaint was pending, the Agency "began to seek ways to get rid of the grievant[,]" including seeking an investigation of the grievant's attendance at his second job. Further, the Arbitrator found that the supervisors gave the grievant "negative narratives and all 1s on his mid-year [and] annual...ratings of record." He also found that supervisor 2 "testified [that] he requested negative documentation specifically aimed at supporting a performance based action against the [g]rievant." As the Arbitrator found, these actions were concurrent with the grievant "seeking" a reassignment to accommodate his medical condition and also took place under a supervisor, who the factual findings show, characterized the grievant as "a complainer[,]" after he filed the EEO complaint, and who the Arbitrator further found showed a "pre-existing negative bias" for the grievant. <span class="Italic">See Fabela,</span> 329 F.3d at 415 (the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas </span>test is inapplicable where the employee presents direct evidence of a retaliatory motive); <span class="Italic">Geithner</span> (once the trier of fact has accepted the direct evidence, liability is established). Accordingly, the Arbitrator's findings establish directly the causation element of the grievant's claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the Agency's claim that the Arbitrator failed to address any of its legitimate non-discriminatory bases for its actions, the Arbitrator's factual findings reveal that the Arbitrator evaluated the parties' arguments with respect to the claim of reprisal as well as hostile work environment, discussed below, but found the Agency's arguments and theory were "not convincing. Accordingly, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's award finding that the Agency retaliated against the grievant for filing an EEO complaint and a request for reasonable accommodation is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5.&#x2003;Legal framework: hostile work environment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purposes and remedial frameworks of title VII, the ADA, and the Act are similar. Because title VII and the ADA provide relief from a hostile work environment for persons in a protected class, courts have recognized that the Act also provides a cause of action for disability-based harassment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Quiles-Quiles,</span> 439 F.3d at 7; <span class="Italic">Mannie v. Potter,</span> 394 F.3d 977, 982 (7th Cir. 2005) (<span class="Italic">Mannie</span>); <span class="Italic">Neudecker v.

<p class="noindent-1">A claim of a hostile work environment, or harassment, based on disability requires a showing that: (1) the grievant is a qualified individual with a disability under the Act; (2) he/she was subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based on his/her disability or a request for an accommodation; (4) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his/her employment and to create an abusive working environment; and (5) the Agency knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt effective remedial action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Soledad,</span> 304 F.3d at 506; <span class="Italic">Walton,</span> 168 F.3d at 667; <span class="Italic">Hiller,</span> 95 F. Supp.2d at 1023. To demonstrate a hostile work environment, the grievant must show that the environment is "objectively hostile or abusive" and that he/she "perceived it as a hostile or abusive environment." <span class="Italic">Walton,</span> 168 F.3d at 667 (citing <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Sys. Inc.,</span> 510 U.S. 17, 22 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Harris</span>)).

"An objectively hostile environment is one that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive.'" <span class="Italic">Mannie,</span> 394 F.3d at 982.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing whether any given circumstances are objectively hostile, "the disability based harassment must 'be sufficiently pervasive or severe to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment.'" <span class="Italic">Flowers,</span> 247 F.3d at 236 (citing <span class="Italic">McConathy v.

In making that assessment, it is necessary to consider all the circumstances, including '"the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.'" <span class="Italic">Walton,</span> 168 F.3d at 667 (quoting <span class="Italic">Harris,</span> 510 U.S. at 23). <span class="Italic">See also Flowers,</span> 247 F.3d at 235; <span class="Italic">Fox,</span> 247 F.3d at 178; <span class="Italic">Silk,</span> 194 F.3d at 804.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">6.&#x2003;Application of the hostile work environment framework: the award is consistent with law</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, there is no dispute that the grievant is a qualified individual with a disability under the Act. With respect to the second element of the framework, the Arbitrator concluded that the supervisors were motivated by hostility to the grievant because of their deliberate efforts to establish the basis for an adverse action against the grievant. Specifically, the Arbitrator noted the following: (1) supervisor 2 "characterized" the grievant as a "complainer[;]" (2) supervisor 1 and 2 discussions with the labor relations staff which indicated management's efforts to rid themselves of the grievant through an "adverse action[;]" and (3) the monitoring of the grievant's performance through "100 % reviews" of his work with the intent to "remove the [g]rievant based upon [his] performance reviews[.] The Arbitrator found that the grievant felt the impact of these pressures on his health because, as the testimony of the grievant's doctor and other medical evidence reveal, the grievant's deteriorating health was "directly related to the stress caused by the hostile work environment he worked in." Moreover, "objective evidence" in the record indicates that the grievant subjectively felt the impact of the supervisors' hostile actions because, as the Arbitrator found, their actions "created an atmosphere and work environment which ultimately caused the [g]rievant's health to deteriorate to the point [that] he had to medically retire." The Arbitrator's findings and conclusions therefore meet the second requirement of the hostile environment framework.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2393"></span>The Arbitrator found that the actions evidencing the supervisors' hostile intent toward the grievant were "on[-]going and concurrent" with the grievant's request for reasonable accommodation. Specifically, the Arbitrator found that the supervisors did "nothing" in response to the grievant's initial request for reasonable accommodation, instead placing barriers in the way of that request. The supervisors' failure to act on the request, following closely on the request itself, establish a temporal nexus between the supervisors' hostile actions and the grievant's request and his disclosure of his disability. The Arbitrator's findings in this regard support the conclusion that the supervisors' hostile actions toward the grievant were because of his disability and his request for accommodation of that disability, the third requirement of the hostile work environment framework.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the fourth requirement, the Arbitrator specifically found that a "reasonable person" would have found the grievant's work environment to be hostile. The Arbitrator found that the supervisor's delay in acting on the grievant's request for accommodation exacerbated his medical condition. The Arbitrator also found that the supervisors worked together to put pressure on the grievant through negative performance reviews. As noted above, undisputed evidence in the record indicates that: (1) the grievant's performance was consistently documented by means of 100% review during the time the grievant worked under supervisor 1; and (2) the grievant's mid-performance year, annual, and close out ratings of record were the lowest possible ratings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McPherson v. Michigan High School Athletic Assoc, Inc.,</span> 119 F.3d 453, 460 (6th Cir. 1997) ('"[f]ailure to consider the possibility of reasonable accommodation for [known] disabilities, if it leads to discharge for performance inadequacies resulting from the disabilities, amounts to a discharge solely because of the disabilities.'") (quoting <span class="Italic">Borokowski v. Valley Central School Dist.,</span> 63 F.3d 131, 143 (2nd Cir. 1995)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also concluded that the actions to alienate others towards the grievant were motivated by hostility toward the grievant related to his request for an accommodation of his disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator concluded that the cumulative effect of all these "pressures" on the grievant resulted in the "deteriorat[ion]" of his physical condition. Failing to act on the grievant's request, and subjecting him to consistent documentation of his performance by 100% review of his work product, all in the face of evidence that these pressures were resulting in job-related stress that "exacerbated his medical condition"--asthma--and caused him to take significant amounts of leave, demonstrates that the "negative, hostile environment" to which the grievant was subjected was severe and pervasive and altered his working conditions. The effect of all these circumstances is such that a "reasonable person" would "conclude" that they were sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of his employment and to create an abusive working environment that "contribute[ed] to the [gjrievant's medical retirement at approximately age 45." Thus, the Arbitrator's findings and conclusions meet the fourth requirement of the framework.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the Agency's challenges to the Arbitrator's hostile work environment finding do not establish that the award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">7.&#x2003;Legal framework: compensatory damages</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To receive an award of compensatory damages, the grievant must demonstrate that he has been harmed as a result of the Agency's discriminatory action; the extent, nature, and severity of the harm; and the duration or expected duration of the harm. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance: Compensatory and Punitive Damages Available Under Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 [Section 102]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">,</span> EEOC Notice No. 915002 (July 14, 1992), at 11-12, 14 (<span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance</span>). <span class="Italic">See also Campbell v. Gonzales,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A40538 (September 1, 2005). Section 102 provides, however, that "an agency is not liable for compensatory damages in cases of disability discrimination where it demonstrates that it made a good faith effort to accommodate the complainant's disability." <span class="Italic">See Mack v. West,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01983217 (June 23, 2000) (<span class="Italic">Mack)</span>. The amount of compensatory damages awarded should reflect the extent to which the Agency's discriminatory action directly or proximately caused harm to the grievant and the extent to which other factors may have played a part. <span class="Italic">Enforcement Guidance</span>, at 8, 11-12. <span class="Italic">See also McCoy v. Nicholson,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A43628 (September 22, 2005); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Potter,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A50008 (March 30, 2005) (award reduced because complainant had other stressors in her life); <span class="Italic">Hartley v. Veneman,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01972242 (December 22, 2002) (<span class="Italic">Hartley</span>). Moreover, the amount of non-pecuniary damages should reflect the nature and severity of the harm to the grievant, and the duration or expected duration of the harm. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hartley.</span> Awards of non-pecuniary compensatory damages in excess of $100,000 have resulted when the emotional damage has been catastrophic, leaving an employee unable to work for years to come, if ever. <span class="Italic">See Mack.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a complainant has a pre-existing condition, such as the grievant in this case, the agency is liable only for the additional harm or aggravation caused by the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Heffley v. Potter,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A40138 (March 17, 2005). <span class="Italic">See also McDonnell v. Johnson,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A33904 (December 4, 2003); <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Slater,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01971161 (March 17, 2000) (agency's discriminatory conduct severely exacerbated employee's pre-existing problems). Moreover, where that pre-existing condition inevitably would have worsened, the agency is entitled to a reduction in damages reflecting the extent to which the condition would have worsened even absent the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The burden of proof is on the agency to establish the extent to which it is entitled to a reduction in the award. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Conversely, the fact that a complainant suffered from a pre-existing condition does not in and of itself serve to reduce the amount of compensatory damages suffered by an employee where there has been no showing that the employee suffered from the aggravated physical manifestations of the condition at issue in the case prior to the discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Durrant v. West,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01971885 (Septembers, 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, "[a]n award of compensatory damages must be based on objective evidence." <span class="Italic">PTO,</span> 52 FLRA at 373 (citing <span class="Italic">Lawrence v. Runyon,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01952288) (<span class="Italic">Lawrence</span>)). Objective evidence includes:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">statements from the complainant concerning his/her emotional pain or suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, injury to professional standing, injury to character or reputation, injury to credit standing, loss of health, and any other nonpecuniary losses.... Statements from others, including family members, friends, and health care providers could address the outward manifestations or physical consequences of emotional distress, including sleeplessness, anxiety, stress, depression, marital strain, humiliation, emotional distress, loss of self-esteem, excessive fatigue, or a nervous breakdown. Objective evidence also may include documents indicating a complainant's actual out-of-pocket expenses related to medical treatment, counseling, and so forth, related to the injury allegedly caused by discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> Further, "[t]he grievant's own testimony, along with the particular circumstances of the case, may be sufficient to sustain [his] burden of proving damages due to emotional distress." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, an award of compensatory damages should not be "monstrously excessive" standing alone, should not be the product of passion or prejudice, and should be consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">See Hartley </span>(citing <span class="Italic">Jackson v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01972555 (April 15, 1999); <span class="Italic">Cygnar v. City of Chi.,</span> 865 F.2d 827, 847-48 (7th Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">8.&#x2003;Application of the compensatory damages framework: the record is insufficient to determine whether the award of compensatory damages is contrary to law</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator awarded the grievant $200,000 in compensatory damages because he found that: (1) the Agency did not make a good faith effort to accommodate the grievant's disability prior to November 15, 2002; (2) during the period May to November 2002, the Agency subjected the grievant to harassment and a hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator cited no evidence as the basis for this award and made none of the findings that would be necessary under the legal framework outlined above in order to substantiate the award.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See PTO,</span> 52 FLRA at 374. Specifically, the Arbitrator did not rely on any of the testimonial or documentary evidence in the record that establishes that the grievant is entitled to compensatory damages or to the amount of those damages. When an arbitration award does not sufficiently explain an arbitrator's determination on a pertinent statutory requirement, the Authority examines the record to see if it permits the Authority to resolve the matter. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United Sates Dep't of the Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi, Tex.,</span> 58 FLRA 87, 91-92 (2002). If it does not, the Authority remands for further proceedings to assure that the resolution of the matter is consistent with law. <span class="Italic">See id. See also, United States Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin.,</span> 61 FLRA 634, 636 (2006). Here, the record does not permit us to make the determination of whether the amount of compensatory damages awarded is consistent with law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the award, we further note that, although the Arbitrator did not set forth specific findings as required, his findings and the size of the award suggest that a part of this sum may be punishment for the Agency's conduct toward the grievant and for his loss of future earnings. In this regard, we note that punitive damages are not available in discriminatory conduct cases brought against Federal agencies. <span class="Italic">See Castillo v. Norton,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01990818 (July 16, 2002); <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance</span> at Section II. B. Further, as to loss of future earning, we note that "proof of entitlement to loss of future earning[s] capacity involves 'evidence suggesting that [an individual's] injuries have narrowed the range of economic opportunities available to [them].'" <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Jackson,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01A53933 (March 24, 2006) (citing <span class="Italic">Gorniak v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp.,</span> 889 F.2d 481, 484 (3d Cir. 1989)). Also, courts require evidence that the impairment of earning capacity be shown with reasonable certainty or reasonable probability and there <span id="page_2394"></span>must be evidence which will permit the factfinder to arrive at a pecuniary value for the loss. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the portion of the award concerning compensatory damages is remanded to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for his clarification of the grievant's entitlement to compensatory damages based on the framework outlined above. <span class="Italic">Id. See also United States Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Oxon Hill, Md.,</span> 56 FLRA 292, 300 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency's claim that the Arbitrator erred in restoring the grievant's leave for the period 2002-2003 appears to be a claim that the award is inconsistent with legal limitations on the Arbitrator's remedial authority, rather than an essence exception. As noted above, an agency is liable for the harm directly or proximately caused by its actions. The Arbitrator made no findings linking the scope of the leave awarded and the scope of the Agency's illegal activity and the record does not permit the Authority to make such determination. To this extent, the award must also be remanded. On remand, the Arbitrator should specify the amount of leave awarded the grievant and the manner in which the Agency's illegal actions are responsible for the use of that leave.</p>
<p class="noindent">Following remand, and further consideration by the arbitrator, <span class="Italic">IRS</span> returned on exceptions, and this time around FLRA sustained an award of compensatory damages but remanded as to leave restoration, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 72</span>, 65 FLRA 939, 940-941 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In awarding compensatory damages, the Arbitrator found that an award of $200,000 was supported by Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) case law. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 15-16 (citing <span class="Italic">Franklin, </span>EEOC Appeal Nos. 07A00025 &#x0026; 01A03882 (2001); <span class="Italic">Rivers, </span>EEOC Appeal No. 01992843 (2002); <span class="Italic">Ellis</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A13314 (2003); <span class="Italic">Munno</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01A01734 &#x0026; 01A03001 (2001); <span class="Italic">Mack</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01983217 (2000), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01983217 (2000); and <span class="Italic">Santiago</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01955684 (1998)). For instance, the Arbitrator noted that, in <span class="Italic">Franklin</span>, $150,000 in non-pecuniary damages was "based upon...evidence of emotional distress and the proven disability discrimination based upon a lack of reasonable accommodation." The Arbitrator found that the record here "showed a lack of any good faith by the Agency to make any reasonable accommodation to prevent the stress which, according to testimony, was increased by" the grievant's supervisors. Moreover, the Arbitrator stated that, in <span class="Italic">Ellis</span>, the complainant's supervisor, like the grievant's supervisor here, "'picked apart her work[,]'" "'ostracized her in the work place'" and "'insinuated publicly that she was abusing sick leave.'" The Arbitrator stated that this "treatment made the complainant's [medical condition] much worse, caused her intense physical and emotional pain and ultimately, compelled her to take disability retirement from the agency."<span class="Italic"> </span>The Arbitrator found that record evidence shows that, like the grievant in <span class="Italic">Ellis</span>, the grievant here "was forced into an approved medical retirement by the actions of the Agency."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator further found that one physician's (Dr. 2's) examination of the grievant "provided the medical nexus between the increased severity of the [g]rievant's physical impairment to the increased stress he experienced at work." <span class="Italic">Id.; see also id. </span>at 16 (finding that the medical assessment of Dr. 2, "in and of itself, substantiates...that the [g]rievant was entitled to the compensatory award of $200,000"). In this regard, the Arbitrator found that Dr. 2 determined, among other things, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-&#x2003;At the time of the examination, the grievant "'ha[d] not been able to work for several months. Each time he goes [back] to work, he develops increased wheezing and dyspnea which he attributes to the stress of his job'";</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-&#x2003;"'[T]he pattern of deterioration'" that he observed in the grievant's condition from when he first saw him in September 2002 until May 2003 "'is consistent with his report of unrelieved stress, and he related that stress to what was happening to him at his job'"; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">-&#x2003;"'Had the amount and consistency of [the grievant's] stress been eliminated or greatly reduced, it is likely that the degree and rate of deterioration in [the grievant's] condition that precipitated Dr. [1's] referral of [the grievant] to [him] and that continued...would have been lessened or prevented altogether."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 13-15 (quoting Dr. 2's Letters dated May 18, 2003 (May 18 Letter) &#x0026; April 6, 2004 (April 6 Letter); <span class="Italic">see also </span>Opp'n, Attach., Union Exs. 105 (May 18 Letter) &#x0026; 128 (April 6 Letter).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In awarding restoration of the grievant's leave, the Arbitrator noted that the EEOC has held that a claim for restoration of sick leave hours allegedly taken because of discriminatory actions is recoverable under Title VII as a request for equitable damages and that, if an employee takes leave "'to avoid or recover from discriminating harassment, sick leave must be treated as excused leave in order to make the appellant whole and place [the employee] in a position [he/she] would have been absent the discrimination.'" Remand Award at 13 (quoting <span class="Italic">Merriell</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01890072 (1989)). After reviewing the evidence, including the medical findings of Dr. 2 described above and an audit of the grievant's leave forms, the Arbitrator found that the grievant took sick leave "to avoid or recover from discriminating harassment." The Arbitrator noted that the record indicates that the grievant's leave usage increased from 37% in 2002 to over 70% in 2003. As a result, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's "sick leave must be treated as excused leave in order to make the [grievant] whole or in the position [he] would have been absent the harassment." Accordingly, the Arbitrator found that the grievant "was to receive an award of all lost benefits or other concurrent benefits of employment he would have earned."</p>
<p class="noindent">Having summarized the remand award of the arbitrator, FLRA continued its analysis in <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU Chap. 72</span> to sustain an award of $200,000 for nonpecuniary compensatory damages, 65 FLRA at 942-44:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In remanding the original award, the Authority stated that the record did not permit the Authority to determine whether the amount of compensatory damages is consistent with law. <span class="Italic">IRS, Austin</span>, 64 FLRA at 57. The Authority noted that the Arbitrator's "findings and the size of the award suggest that a part of this sum may be punishment for the Agency's conduct toward the grievant and for his loss of future earnings." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 55. In the remand award, the Arbitrator indicated that the award of $200,000 is for "non-punitive compensatory" damages. Based on the Arbitrator's award, we find that the award of $200,000 is limited to non-pecuniary compensatory damages. As set forth above, the Agency asserts that the award of $200,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The portion of the award encompassing non-pecuniary damages is not contrary to law.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a claim for compensatory damages, a grievant must demonstrate, through appropriate evidence, the harm suffered as a result of the agency's discriminatory action; the extent, nature, and severity of the harm suffered; and the duration or expected duration of the harm. <span class="Italic">See IRS, Austin, </span>64 FLRA at 54. The amount of compensatory damages awarded should reflect the extent to which the Agency's discriminatory action directly or proximately caused harm to the grievant and the extent to which other factors may have played a part. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>and authorities cited therein. An award of compensatory damages should not be "monstrously of passion or prejudice, and should be consistent with the amount awarded in similar cases. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 55. Awards of non-pecuniary damages in excess of $100,000 have resulted when the emotional damage has been catastrophic, leaving an employee unable to work for years to come, if ever. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 54 (citing <span class="Italic">Mack</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the evidence presented, the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator erred in awarding non-pecuniary damages. Medical and testimonial evidence show that the cumulative effect of the Agency's discriminatory actions resulted in the deterioration of the grievant's health and lead to his developing COPD. Remand Award at 14 (quoting April 6 Letter) (noting that, in diagnosing the grievant's condition, Dr. 2 stated that "anxiety leads to flare-ups; flare-ups make controlling the asthma extremely difficult or impossible; poor control of severe asthma leads to COPD; COPD results in irreversible lung damage"); <span class="Italic">see also </span>April 6 Letter (letter from Dr. 2 concerning the relationship between stress experienced at work by the grievant and the exacerbation of his medical condition). Further the record shows that, because of the increased deterioration of the grievant's health that resulted from the Agency's discriminatory actions, the grievant "was forced into...medical retirement" at approximately age forty-five, with irreversible lung damage. [<span class="Italic">S</span>]<span class="Italic">ee also IRS, Austin</span>, 64 FLRA at 43.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases where victims of discrimination have suffered harm similar in degree to the grievant, the EEOC has awarded compensatory damages ranging from $100,000 to $200,000. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mack </span>($185,000 in non-pecuniary damages where, as a result of agency discrimination, complainant was left homeless for two years and suffered depression, emphysema, migraines and insomnia, and harm to family relationships); <span class="Italic">Franklin </span>($150,000 in non-pecuniary damages where, as a result of agency's discriminatory actions, complainant experienced extensive symptoms of emotional distress, resulting in changes in complainant's personality, the ending of his marriage, severe strains in his relationships with those close to him, including his children, and diminished enjoyment of life); <span class="Italic">Glockner </span>($200,000 in non-pecuniary damages where complainant suffered migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, depression, and stress that caused her to bite her cheeks so badly that surgery was required); and <span class="Italic">Blount, </span>EEOC Appeal No. 0720070010 (2009), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0720070010 (2010) ($200,000 in non-pecuniary damages where agency failed to accommodate complainant resulting in his inability to work; complainant suffered from severe depression, for which he had taken medication).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator does not explain why the harm suffered by the grievant is comparable to that suffered by the complainant in <span class="Italic">Mack </span>and argues that the Arbitrator identified no evidence that showed <span id="page_2395"></span>that the grievant suffered harm that totally incapacitated him for work or in his personal life. As stated above, awards of non-pecuniary damages in excess of $100,000 have resulted when the emotional damage has been catastrophic, leaving an employee unable to work for years to come, if ever. Here, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's discriminatory actions caused the grievant's health to deteriorate to the point where he was "forced into...medical retirement" at age forty-five. Medical evidence also showed that the grievant's increased stress at work resulted in irreversible lung damage. Remand Award at 14 (citing April 6 Letter); <span class="Italic">see also </span>May 18 Letter at 2 (stating that he believed that "much of [the grievant's] lung disease is fixed and not reversible" and that he did "not expect significant recovery in the future").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's contention that the harm suffered by the grievant is more similar to the harm suffered by the complainant in <span class="Italic">Carpenter </span>also does not provide a basis for finding the Arbitrator erred. In that case, the EEOC, in awarding the complainant a lower amount of damages than he had sought, found that much of the damages about which he complained pre-dated the Civil Rights Act of 1991.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that the amount of damages awarded is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also contends that award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator "did not cite any evidence to establish a connection between the Agency's discrimination and the harm" to the grievant and, thus, the grievant did not meet his burden of proof. Contrary to the Agency's contention, the Arbitrator examined the record regarding the nature, severity, and duration of the harm suffered by the grievant as a result of the Agency's discriminatory actions and found that the medical evidence provided a "nexus between the increased severity of the [g]rievant's physical impairment to the increased stress he experienced at work." (finding that the medical assessment of Dr. 2, "in and of itself, substantiates...that the [g]rievant was entitled to the compensatory award of $200,000").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the medical evidence, the Arbitrator also found that the "record showed a lack of any good faith by the Agency to make any reasonable accommodation to prevent the stress, which according to testimony, was increased by [the grievant's] supervisors...." In this regard, the record shows, among other things, that: (1) the grievant requested a reassignment from supervisor 2 because of stress and was instructed by that supervisor to revise the letter, leaving out any references to his health, and resubmit it to supervisor 1; (2) the grievant's supervisors put pressure on him through "negative performance reviews despite his known medical problems"; (3) the grievant's appraisals were based upon a review of all the work he produced, instead of random samples; and (4) supervisor 1 shared the grievant's comments about on-the-job instructions he received from fellow workers with employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator "disregarded the testimony" of Dr. 1, who testified that "other factors beyond the [g]rievant's working environment contributed to the exacerbation of [his] asthma problems[,]" such as mold in his home and a seriously ill mother. However, there is nothing in the testimony referenced by the Agency that shows that Dr. 1 testified that the external factors mentioned increased the severity of the harm suffered by the grievant. The testimony shows that Dr. 1 responded to specific questions asked of him, but did not state that such external factors actually exacerbated the grievant's health problem.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency's contention that the grievant did not provide any proof that the delay between June 2002, when the grievant first requested a reasonable accommodation, and November 2002, when the Agency ultimately processed his request, was the direct or proximate cause of his health impairment also provides no basis for finding that the Arbitrator erred. During the period of June 2002 through November 2002, the Agency subjected the grievant to discrimination and harassment and created a hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">See also IRS, Austin</span>, 64 FLRA at 57. <span class="Italic"></span>Moreover, evidence in the record shows that the cumulative effect of the Agency's actions resulted in the deterioration of the grievant's health. For example, Dr. 2 stated "'the pattern of deterioration'" that he observed in the grievant's condition "'from when [he] first saw him in September 2002 until...May 2003 is consistent with his report of unrelieved stress, and [that the grievant] related that stress to what was happening to him at his job.'" Dr. 2 further stated that, "[h]ad the amount and consistency of [the grievant's] stress been eliminated or greatly reduced, it is likely that the degree and rate of deterioration in [the grievant's] condition...would have been lessened or prevented altogether."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, the Agency has not established that the Arbitrator failed to address causation. Accordingly, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that the Arbitrator erred in awarding the grievant $200,000 in non-pecuniary compensatory damages and deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA remanded the case to the arbitrator on the issue of leave restoration, <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU Chap. 72,</span> 65 FLRA at 944-45:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">A remand of the portion of the award restoring leave to the grievant is necessary.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that, contrary to <span class="Italic">IRS, Austin</span>, the Arbitrator did not make any findings linking the scope of the leave awarded to its actions, but "attribute[ed]" such usage to its discriminatory conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">IRS, Austin</span>, the Authority directed the Arbitrator to specify the amount of leave awarded the grievant and the manner in which the Agency's illegal actions are responsible for the use of that leave. 64 FLRA at 56; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Harrison, </span>EEOC Appeal No. 01A14848 (2002) (complainant provided sufficient documentation showing hours requested related to discrimination). "Whenever an agency is liable for unlawful employment discrimination, it must provide complainant with full, 'make-whole' relief to restore the complainant as nearly as possible to the position he or she would have been in absent the discrimination." <span class="Italic">Ellis </span>at * 2 (citation omitted). In the "federal sector, the agency's efforts in this regard should include (where appropriate) equitable relief...." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(citation omitted). Restoration of leave taken because of discrimination suffered is a legitimate form of equitable relief. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Arbitrator found, the record establishes that the grievant took leave to "avoid or recover from discriminating harassment." The Arbitrator directed the Agency to restore the grievant's leave for the "years 2002-2003." However, while the evidence presented by the Union shows that the grievant used leave during the period that he was discriminated against by the Agency, the Arbitrator did not specify the amount of such leave or indicate when such leave was required because of the Agency's illegal activities. Moreover, the evidence submitted by the Union does not indicate clearly whether the grievant used leave for such purpose. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., </span>Opp'n, Attachs., Union Exs. 70(2) &#x0026; 77 (notes from Dr. 1 requesting that the grievant be excused for certain days due to flu); Exs. 68, 69 (leave audit forms show grievant's leave usage, but do not explain reason for leave); Exs. 71-104 (medical certifications for grievant's use of sick leave include some pre-dating Agency's unlawful actions).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we remand this portion of the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement. On remand, the Arbitrator should specify the amount of leave awarded the grievant and the manner in which the Agency's illegal actions are responsible for the use of that leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency requests that the award not be remanded to the Arbitrator.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Alabama Association of Civilian Technicians</span>, 56 FLRA 231, 235 (2000) (Chairman Wasserman dissenting), the Authority noted "that a new arbitrator may be appointed to hear a matter where the original arbitrator resigns, dies, or is otherwise unable to act upon the issue." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 235 (citing <span class="Italic">Elkouri and Elkouri, How Arbitration Works, </span>188 (5th Ed. 1997)); <span class="Italic">see also How Arbitration Works, </span>175-176 (6th Ed. 2003)). Here, the Agency has not explained why the award should not be remanded to the Arbitrator. Because the Agency has not provided any specific reasons why the award should not be remanded to the Arbitrator, there is no basis to conclude that this matter should be submitted to a new arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCC Englewood and AFGE Local 709</span>, 69 FLRA 474, 476-79 (2016), sustained an arbitrator's finding of disability discrimination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving exceptions pertaining to disability discrimination, the Authority applies the Act, which addresses disability discrimination in federal employment.[25] However, in resolving whether an award is contrary to the Act, the Authority applies the standards of the ADA because Congress has specifically adopted the standards of the ADA for determining whether there has been disability discrimination in violation of the Act.[26] Applying these ADA standards, to show a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under the Act, a grievant must show that he or she: (1) has a disability within the meaning of the Act; (2) is qualified to perform the essential functions of the position in question, with or without a reasonable accommodation; and (3) was discriminated against because of his or her disability.[27]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">OPM</span>, 61 FLRA 358, 361 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(f); <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, INS</span>, 57 FLRA 254, 255 (2001)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[27]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Huntington Dist. Huntington, W. Va</span>., 59 FLRA 793, 797 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Austin Serv. Ctr</span>., 58 FLRA 546, 547-48 (2003)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency argues that the grievant has failed to show a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination because he did not have a disability within the meaning of the Act at the time the Agency instructed the grievant to return to full-time duty as a senior correctional officer. The Act defines an "individual with a disability" as, in pertinent part, any individual who has "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual," or any individual who has "a record of such an impairment."[29] Congress passed the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), which significantly expanded the definition of "disability" under the ADA to ensure that the law "shall be construed in favor of broad coverage."[30] Accordingly, regulations issued pursuant to <span id="page_2396"></span>the ADAAA provide that the language of the ADA "shall not be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for disability."[31]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[29]&#x2003;29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 705(20)(B) (cross-referencing 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1)(A) &#x0026; (B)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(k)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[30]&#x2003;42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(4)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[31]&#x2003;29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to the Act because the Arbitrator erred in finding that the grievant was disabled.&#x2003;Specifically, the Agency claims that the grievant failed to demonstrate that he was substantially limited in any major life activity at the time the Agency ordered him to return to full duty. The Agency bases this on the January letter from the private physician, who stated that the grievant was "able to perform the duties of his position" and "reassur[ed the Agency] that [the grievant] will be able to perform the duties" of his position. According to the Agency, because this letter "did not indicate that the grievant was substantially limited in any major life activity," the grievant has failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Arbitrator based her finding that the grievant was disabled on the ample evidence presented at the hearing--which the Agency does not dispute--demonstrating that the grievant has a history of impairment that substantially limited his ability to work. The Arbitrator begins her award with a thorough description of the grievant's injuries, and finds that the pain resulting from those injuries "still continues and has increased over time." Additionally, the evidence considered by the Arbitrator includes three separate medical evaluations establishing that the grievant suffered from a significant physical impairment. The Arbitrator also emphasized that the January letter from the private physician did not unequivocally resolve the questions surrounding the grievant's medical status. For example, the Arbitrator observed that the private physician expressed concern over the lack of diagnostic testing to determine the full extent of the grievant's injuries, and took issue with the complex form of the Agency's inquiry into the grievant's medical history. The January letter also expressed frustration that the grievant had not received all of the medical treatment that was necessary to address his injuries throughout the workers' compensation process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the grievant's undisputed recent history of medical impairment and the ambiguous nature of the January letter from the private physician, as well as the expansive coverage of the term "disability" following the enactment of the ADAAA, we conclude the Arbitrator did not err in finding that the grievant was a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA and the Act. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that Congress "intended to provide for more generous coverage and application of the ADA's prohibition on discrimination" when passing the ADAAA.[42]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[42]&#x2003;29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(i).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement for two reasons. First, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator ignored the plain language of Article 22 of the parties' agreement. The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 22 insofar as it "prohibit[s] unlawful discrimination in accordance with federal anti-discrimination laws and executive orders." According to the Agency, this finding was in error because "Article 22 incorporates federal anti-discrimination laws but has little independent force," and the Arbitrator's reliance on Article 22 is "disconnected from the plain meaning of the contract provision."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 22 instructs the parties to "prohibit unlawful discrimination," and the parties agreed at arbitration that Article 22 incorporates the ADA and the Act into the parties' agreement. Thus, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency violated the ADA and the Act supports a finding that the Agency also violated this portion of Article 22, and the Agency fails to show how the Arbitrator's construction of Article 22 does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement.[56]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[56]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See DOD Irving</span>, 60 FLRA at 30 (citing <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, 34 FLRA at 575).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator improperly relied on Article 31 of the parties' agreement, which requires the parties to make "a reasonable and concerted effort" to informally resolve disputes. The Agency claims that the Arbitrator unfairly interpreted this language to "impose a duty on the Agency, even in the face of Union inaction," to make additional efforts to resolve the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitration award is based on separate and independent grounds when more than one ground would independently support the remedy that the arbitrator awards.[59] When an arbitrator has based an award on separate and independent grounds, an appealing party must establish that all of the grounds are deficient in order to have the Authority find the award deficient.[60] In those circumstances, if the excepting party has not demonstrated that the award is deficient on one of the grounds relied on by the arbitrator, and the award would stand on that ground alone, then it is unnecessary to address exceptions to the other ground.[61]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, as explained above, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the ADA, the Act, and Article 22 of the parties' agreement.

<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The standards required to determine the existence of a violation under the Rehabilitation Act are the same as those established under the American with Disabilities Act (ADA). <span class="Italic">See </span>29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 791(g), 794(d); 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112.

On September 25, 2008, Congress amended the ADA (ADA Amendments of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (2008)), effective January 1, 2009.

<p class="noindent-1">At the time relevant to this case, the Rehabilitation Act defined an "individual with a disability" as "any person who--(i) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities[.]" 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 705(20)(B)(i). In the Agency's view, the grievant did not demonstrate that her medical condition substantially limited her in the major life activity of working and/or seeing. Accordingly, the Agency argues, as one of the three elements required to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination has not been met, the Agency should not be required to provide the grievant with a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator appropriately found that the grievant has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of her major life activities under the Rehabilitation Act.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute concerning what is required under the Rehabilitation Act to demonstrate that an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity.&#x2003;Under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j), an impairment is "substantially limit[ing]" when it prevents an individual from performing a major life activity or when it significantly restricts the "condition, manner, or duration" under which an individual can perform a major life activity. An individual's ability to perform the major life activity must be restricted as compared to the ability of the average person in the general population to perform the activity. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Whether a grievant is "substantially limited in a major life activity" is dependent upon "(i) [t]he nature and severity of the impairment; (ii) [t]he duration...of the impairment; and (iii) [t]he permanent or long[-]term impact...of[,] or resulting from[,] the impairment." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2 (j)(2). "Major life activities" include caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i). A grievant is substantially limited in the major life activity of "working" when he or she is "significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(i). The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's evidence as set forth at arbitration, which was not contested by the Agency or discredited by the Arbitrator, forms the basis for the <span id="page_2397"></span>Arbitrator's conclusion that the grievant has a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. The testimonial evidence provided by the grievant and other witnesses explained the extent and impact of the limitations that the grievant's impairment has on her major life activity of working. The evidence identified by the Arbitrator and included in the award shows that, as a result of performing data entry and transcription work, which at any given time comprised at least half of the grievant's duties, the grievant suffered from headaches, eyestrain, and dizziness that substantially limited her ability to perform her job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, both the grievant's and the Agency's doctors recommended that the grievant spend as much time as possible on scanning work while limiting her duties performing data entry or transcription work, which required repeated reading of small print size. Specifically, the grievant's doctor recommended that the Agency limit the grievant's time spent performing transcription and data entry work. The Agency's doctor recommended that the Agency modify the grievant's work so that she could "spend as much time scanning as possible." The record does not show that other employees with comparable training, skills, and abilities experienced similar limitations restricting them from performing the transcription and data entry work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, as found by the Arbitrator, the facts demonstrate that the grievant's symptoms that resulted from her performing data entry and transcription work "significantly restricted" her ability "to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities."[8] <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(i). Accordingly, as we defer to arbitrators' factual findings, <span class="Italic">see Army</span>, 55 FLRA at 40, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that the Arbitrator erred when she found that the grievant has a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;As the Rehabilitation Act requires only that there be a substantial limitation in one major life activity, we decline to address the Agency's claim that the grievant did not show that she is substantially limited in the major life activity of "seeing."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator did not mistakenly determine that the grievant is entitled to a reasonable accommodation because she was "regarded as" having a disability by the Agency under the Rehabilitation Act.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also claims that the Arbitrator mistakenly determined that the grievant is entitled to a reasonable accommodation because she was "regarded as" having a disability by the Agency. The Agency argues that employers are not required to provide a reasonable accommodation in "regarded as" cases. As discussed in section V.A.1., <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Arbitrator based her conclusion that the grievant is entitled to a reasonable accommodation on evidence of the grievant's disability. In this regard, the Arbitrator determined that the grievant has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of her major live activities under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 705(20)(B)(i). Because this determination is a legally sufficient basis for the award, we find that it is unnecessary to resolve the Agency's claim that the award is deficient because employers are not required to provide a reasonable accommodation merely because an individual is "regarded as" having a disability.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator's conclusion that the Agency violated Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act is not contrary to law.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 508 requires agencies to ensure that employees with disabilities have equal access to, and use of, information and data communicated through EIT, when the agencies procure, develop, maintain or use that EIT. <span class="Italic">See </span>29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794d(a)(1)(A). Section 508 only applies to EIT that is "procured by a Federal department or agency not less than six months after the date" Section 508 became enforceable. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794d(f)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that Section 508's requirements do not apply to SCRIPS technology because SCRIPS was procured before Section 508 became effective in 2001. However, even assuming this to be true, the undisputed facts in the record demonstrate that, in order for the grievant to adequately perform her work using SCRIPS, she needed adaptive equipment. Section 508 requires an agency to ensure that its procurement of EIT allows employees with disabilities to "have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of the information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794d(a)(1)(A). Accordingly, the Agency's Section 508 liability is not necessarily limited to SCRIPS, but also includes any EIT that would provide the grievant with access to SCRIPS that is comparable to that of employees without disabilities. Such EIT would include adaptive equipment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that in 2003, approximately two years after Section 508's effective date, the Agency ordered adaptive equipment necessary for the grievant to access and use SCRIPS. This adaptive equipment included the Zoom Text magnification software. Because of the date it was procured, there is no issue that this magnification software is subject to the requirements of Section 508.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Agency failed to satisfy Section 508's requirements with regard to the Zoom Text software. The Arbitrator found that the Agency ordered Zoom Text in 2003, but that this software did not become compatible with SCRIPS for years after the grievant first attempted to use it. These findings are undisputed. As this adaptive equipment was needed for the grievant to "have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of the information and data by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities," 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794d(a)(1)(A), and as the Agency failed to timely meet Section 508's requirements, the Agency has failed to establish that the Arbitrator's determination under Section 508 is deficient. Accordingly, we find that the Agency has not established that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the Agency violated Section 508.</p>

<p class="noindent">A stress-related disability was sufficient for an arbitrator to determine that the grievant was impaired and deserving of an accommodation requiring restructuring of the means of interaction with the grievant's supervisor (to reduce or minimize stress), <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 68 FLRA 779, 782-84 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator's finding that the grievant is a qualified individual with a disability is not contrary to the ADA.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its first contrary-to-law exception, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to law because he erroneously found that the grievant is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA. In making this claim, the Agency does not except to the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant has an impairment. Rather, the Agency argues that the grievant's impairment--or "inability to deal with her supervisor"--is not sufficient to render her substantially limited in the major life activity of working.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, &#x00A7; 12102(1)(A) of the ADA provides that a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA must (1) have "a physical or mental impairment that [(2)] substantially limits one or more major life activities."[36] And &#x00A7; 12102(4)(D) of the ADA provides that a "disability" includes "[a]n impairment that is episodic or in remission...if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active."[37] As acknowledged by the Agency and federal circuit courts,[39] the ADA was amended by Congress, in part, to broaden the interpretation of the term "disability."[40]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator determined--and the Agency does not challenge--that the grievant was suffering from a mental impairment. Specifically, he found that the grievant suffered from major depression and PTSD because she had "consistently high levels of hostility, social withdrawal, and [she] fail[ed] to communicate when necessary" when meeting with her supervisor face-to-face. However, as mentioned above, having an impairment does not make one disabled.[42] In order for a physical or mental impairment to rise to the level of an ADA-qualifying disability, the impairment must substantially limit one or more major life activities when active.[43] Under &#x00A7; 12102(2)(A) of the ADA, "major life activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating...and working."[44] The Arbitrator found that "the grievant was substantially limited in the major life activit[y] of...working."</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to the ADA because the grievant's impairment is insufficient to render the grievant substantially limited in the major life activity of working. The Agency gives two reasons: (1) "instructive" case law has "emphatically held that the inability to work with certain people does not constitute a substantial limitation on working"; and (2) "similarly to most people in the general population, [the g]rievant was still able to do her job, and to work for and with other people," and therefore can still perform the major life activity of working.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of its first argument, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">Palmer v. Circuit Court of Cook County</span>,[49] <span class="Italic">Weiler v. Household Financial Corp</span>.,[50] and <span class="Italic">Byrnes v. Lockheed-Martin, Inc</span>.,[51] for the proposition that numerous courts have found that conditions suffered by employees similar to the grievant "do[&#8197;] not constitute a substantial limitation on working."

<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2398"></span>The Agency's cited cases are inapplicable here because they were decided under the ADA <span class="Italic">before</span> the 2008 amendments. As the Agency concedes, the pre-amendment ADA interpreted qualifying "disabilities" much more narrowly than the amended ADA. Section 12102(4)(D) of the ADA now provides that a "disability" includes "[a]n impairment that is episodic or in remission...if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active."[54] The Agency does not provide any additional authority to counter the Arbitrator's conclusion, and concedes that it is "unable to find any case law analyzing what constitutes a substantial limitation on the major life activity of working post-[amended ADA]."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[54]&#x2003;42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(4)(D).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Instead, we find that the Arbitrator's analysis is consistent with applicable legal principles. The Arbitrator found that "the grievant was substantially limited in the major life activities of...working." The Agency does not challenge the factual bases for the Arbitrator's finding. The factual bases for the Arbitrator's finding were that "the grievant had difficulty communicating face-to-face with her supervisor, and in some cases was unable to do so. Face-to-face meetings with her supervisor were characterized regularly by severe problems, consistently high levels of hostility, social withdrawal, and the grievant's failure to communicate when necessary."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Arbitrator's conclusion that the grievant's impairment qualified her as "disabled" under the ADA accords with the ADA's plain language. Section 12102(1)(A) defines a "disability" as "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities."[59] Here, the Arbitrator determined that the grievant's major depression and PTSD qualified as a mental impairment, and that her mental impairment substantially limited her major life activity of working, for the reasons previously described. Because the Arbitrator correctly applied the applicable ADA provisions, we reject the Agency's first argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[59]&#x2003;42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the Agency's second argument, the Agency asserts that the award is contrary to law because, "similar[&#8197;] to most people," the grievant was "still able to do her job, and...[that her] type of impairment did not sufficiently impair [her] ability to work." We find the Agency's second argument unconvincing for two reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Arbitrator compared the grievant "to most people," and found "that the Agency misjudged the nature or degree of the grievant's disability." Specifically, he found that her "relationship with her supervisor deteriorated substantially beyond the normal range of supervisor/employee difficulties." The Agency does not challenge these factual findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the record does not support the Agency's contention that the grievant's "type of impairment did not sufficiently impair [her] ability to work." Rather, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's impairment negatively affected her work performance and her appraisals. Specifically, the Arbitrator found that an essential part of the grievant's job is communicating with her supervisor, and that the grievant's mental impairment contributed to her negative appraisals and ability to function at work. He further found that the grievant's impairment: (1) caused her to hyperventilate when in close quarters with her supervisor; (2) caused her to suffer "consistent[&#8197;] high levels of hostility [and] social withdrawal"; and (3) resulted in her "not readily discuss[ing] her cases with her supervisor[, which] diminished her performance." As the Agency fails to show that the Arbitrator's findings in this respect are contrary to law, or based on a nonfact, we reject the Agency's second argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator's finding that the Agency failed to reasonably accommodate the grievant is not contrary to law.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its second contrary-to-law exception, the Agency argues that the award is erroneous because, contrary to the Arbitrator's finding, the Agency offered the grievant RAs--specifically alternative-meeting arrangements--in accordance with law. Although the Agency concluded that it was not obligated to give the grievant an RA because she was not disabled under the ADA, it asserts that even if the grievant was a qualified individual with a disability--as the Arbitrator concluded--then the Agency's alternative-meeting arrangements "enabled [the grievant] to perform the essential functions of her position."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that it provided two adequate alternative-meeting arrangements. First, the Agency moved the grievant's meetings from her supervisor's office to a larger vacant office. Then the Agency modified that arrangement by moving the meetings to an even larger conference room, requiring the grievant and the supervisor to sit six feet apart with the door open, and providing for a third party to attend any closed-door meetings. The Agency also argues that an individual with a disability is not entitled to an RA merely because he or she prefers it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ADA requires that an agency must provide RAs for the known limitations of a qualified individual with a disability unless doing so would create an undue hardship.[73] Section 12111(9)(B) of the ADA provides that RAs may include "job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, reassignment to a vacant position...and other similar accommodations for individuals with disabilities."[74] Section 12111(10) (A)-(B) of the ADA defines "undue hardship" as an "action requiring significant difficulty or expense, when considered in light of...(i) the nature of the accommodation needed...(ii) the overall financial resources of the facility...(iii) the overall financial resources of the covered entity...and (iv) the type of operation or operations of the covered entity."[75]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[73]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a), (b)(5)(A).</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[75]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 12111(10)(A)-(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's argument that the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law when he rejected the Agency's RAs lacks merit. The Arbitrator determined that the Agency's alternative-meeting arrangements were not RAs under the ADA because they not only were ineffective to deal with the grievant's disability, but also contributed to the disability. Specifically, he found that the grievant's disability "required some relief from face-to-face meetings with her supervisor, and the [Agency's] alternative[-meeting arrangements] continued the interaction that caused the disability." Further, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's alternative-meeting arrangements not only exacerbated the grievant's disability, but also "negatively impacted the grievant's performance." The Agency does not challenge these findings as nonfacts. As the Agency provides no additional arguments to support its position beyond those set forth in its first contrary-to-law exception above--which we deny--we find the Agency's argument that the Arbitrator erred by rejecting its RAs unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, regarding the Agency's argument that the grievant is not entitled to the RA of her choice, the Agency does not allege that the grievant's requested RAs would have created an undue hardship under &#x00A7; 12111(10)(A)-(B). Indeed, as the Arbitrator found, the Agency "permitted similar, even more extensive, accommodations" to other Agency employees. Specifically, the Agency allowed, for decades, a subordinate of the grievant's supervisor to work remotely for at least two months each year and to work at home every morning as a RA. Based on the findings, which the Agency does not challenge as nonfacts, we conclude that the Arbitrator correctly determined that the grievant's requested RAs "would have been effective, and would not have imposed an undue hardship." Consequently, we find the Agency's argument concerning the grievant's requested RAs unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator was sustained who determined that a grievant was not denied reasonable accommodation through denial of telework, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1698 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Supply Sys. Command</span>, 70 FLRA 96, 98 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, case law supports the Arbitrator's reliance on the grievant's misconduct and performance issues to uphold the Agency's denial of the grievant's RA request to telework full time. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has held that "telework...[is] not an effective accommodation--i.e., one that would enable [an individual] to perform the essential functions of [the individual's] position"--where there is "credited...testimony...finding that [the individual] had previous difficulties with time and attendance, telework, and time and attendance during telework."[30] The Arbitrator's findings in this case concerning the grievant's misconduct and performance issues are analogous, and support the conclusion that full-time telework for the grievant would not be an effective accommodation under the ADA.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Davis v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of America</span> (<span class="Italic">Davis</span>)[31] is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, the court found that teleworking was an RA because the employee in <span class="Italic">Davis</span> could perform the essential job functions "well, or at least competently."[32] Here, the Arbitrator determined that the grievant was unable to perform the essential job functions of her position while teleworking, and that the Agency's evidence supported its decision to deny the grievant's RA request to telework full time. Therefore, <span class="Italic">Davis</span> does not support the Union's position that the award is contrary to the ADA. Consequently, we find that the Union's contention--that the Arbitrator erred by failing to find that the Agency discriminated against the grievant when the Agency denied her RA request to telework full time--is without merit.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">To be eligible for a reasonable accommodation, an employee must be a qualified individual with handicaps.[5] The Agency argues that it was under no duty to provide the grievant, an employee whom the Arbitrator found it regarded as handicapped, with a reasonable accommodation, as the "regarded as" prong of the definition of individual with handicaps <span id="page_2399"></span>is meant to be used only in intentional discrimination cases, and not in cases alleging a failure to accommodate such an individual. We agree.

Runyon,</span> 1997 WL 348684 (E.E.O.C.).

<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(c) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">An agency shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an applicant or employee who is a qualified individual with handicaps unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operations of its program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that the grievant was an individual with handicaps only because the Agency regarded her as handicapped. The Agency, then, was under no duty to provide her with a reasonable accommodation. Therefore, the Arbitrator's determination that the Agency improperly failed to reasonably accommodate the grievant is contrary to the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator did not determine whether the employee was actually handicapped within the meaning of the Act, even though the parties presented evidence to her on that issue. If the Arbitrator had so found, the grievant might be eligible for the damages awarded by the Arbitrator. Therefore, we remand the case to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to determine whether the grievant was actually handicapped within the meaning of the Act, and whether she was entitled to work at home as a reasonable accommodation. In making this determination, the Arbitrator should consider the Supreme Court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Toyota Motor v. Williams, </span>122 S. Ct. 681 (2002) (discussing standards for determining whether employees are substantially limited in performing major life activities) and <span class="Italic">Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., </span>527 U.S. 471 (1999) (holding that the determination of whether an individual is disabled should be made with reference to measures that mitigate the individual's impairment).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award was sustained determining that an agency's accommodation of a hearing impaired employee was insufficient, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 68</span>, 63 FLRA 202, 205-07 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">E.g., NTEU Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995). In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def., Dep'ts of the Army and the Air Force, Ala. Nat'l Guard, Northport, Ala.</span>, 55 FLRA 37, 40 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Ala. Nat'l Guard</span>). In making this assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>More specifically, in resolving whether an award is contrary to the Rehabilitation Act, the Authority applies the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 12101-12300. In this regard, Congress has specifically adopted the standards of the ADA for determining whether there has been disability discrimination in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(g); <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management</span>, 61 FLRA 358, 361 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the ADA and EEOC regulations, an agency must make reasonable accommodation to the known limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability unless the agency can show that the accommodation would cause an undue hardship. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9(a); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv.</span>, 57 FLRA 254, 255 (2001). A reasonable accommodation is a modification or an adjustment that enables an individual with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by other similarly situated employees without disabilities. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(iii). To be entitled to a reasonable accommodation, employees must first establish that they are a "qualified individual with a disability" within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. &#x00A7; 1630.4; &#x00A7; 1630.2(m).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In numerous cases, the EEOC has assessed whether an agency has met its obligation to reasonably accommodate its hearing-impaired employees. In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. United States Postal Serv., </span>EEOC Request No. 05880750 (April 18, 1989) (<span class="Italic">Jackson</span>), the EEOC specified the following accommodation for hearing-impaired employees during work-related activities where they are expected to be present:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[F]or a severely hearing impaired employee who can sign, reasonable accommodation, at a minimum, requires providing an interpreter for safety talks, discussions on work procedures, policies, or assignments, and for every disciplinary action so that the employee can understand what is occurring at any and every crucial time in his [her] employment career, whether or not [s]he asks for an interpreter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 89 FEOR 3176 at 6. Since <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, the EEOC has found in numerous cases that agencies failed to reasonably accommodate their hearing-impaired employees by failing to provide interpreters. <span class="Italic">E.g., Gunn v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120053293 (June 15, 2007); <span class="Italic">Kelly</span>; <span class="Italic">Feris v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01934828 (Aug. 10, 1995) (<span class="Italic">Feris</span>). Moreover, as relevant here, the EEOC concluded in <span class="Italic">Feris </span>that "the availability of an interpreter on a short notice is necessary if the employee is expected to fully participate in daily work related activities." <span class="Italic">Feris</span>, decision at 53. The EEOC has also concluded that an agency cannot escape its obligation to provide interpreters for work-related meetings simply because of difficulty scheduling interpreter services in a timely manner. <span class="Italic">E.g., Haggard v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal Nos. 01A12221 and 01A21876 (Jan. 7, 2003), decision at 6; <span class="Italic">accord Kelly</span>, decision at 6. Likewise, agencies cannot satisfy their obligations merely through "good faith efforts" at accommodation. <span class="Italic">Feris</span>, decision at 45.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the grievant is hearing impaired and uses sign language for communication. It is not disputed that he is a qualified individual with a disability under the Rehabilitation Act. It also is not contested in this case that the disputed meetings concerned work procedures, policies, and assignments. Nevertheless, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator's award is deficient because <span class="Italic">Mueller </span>and <span class="Italic">McNeil </span>control in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both <span class="Italic">Mueller </span>and <span class="Italic">McNeil</span> involved "emergency" meetings. <span class="Italic">Mueller</span>, decision at 1; <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>, decision at 5. In particular, both involved events that occurred "unexpectedly" and, as a result, management's good-faith efforts to contact a certified interpreter were unsuccessful. <span class="Italic">Mueller</span>, decision at 6;<span class="Italic"> McNeil</span>, decision at 5. In <span class="Italic">Mueller</span>, after the agency was unsuccessful in obtaining an interpreter, the agency accommodated its hearing-impaired employees by using employees with some sign language skills, by having the information of the meeting conveyed to the hearing-impaired employees by their managers, and by presenting and reviewing at the next group meeting every point that was presented in the disputed meeting. <span class="Italic">Mueller</span>, decision at 7-8. In <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>, the agency similarly accommodated its hearing-impaired employees by subsequently providing them with a written report of what occurred at the meeting and by reviewing the meeting at the next group meeting. <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>, decision at 5-6. In concluding that the agencies reasonably accommodated hearing-impaired employees in both<span class="Italic"> Mueller </span>and <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>, the EEOC distinguished <span class="Italic">Kelly </span>on the ground that,<span class="Italic"> </span>in <span class="Italic">Kelly</span>, the agency failed to make any alternative attempt to relay the necessary information to its hearing-impaired employees. <span class="Italic">Mueller</span>, decision at 8 n.1;<span class="Italic"> McNeil</span>, decision at 6-7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the meetings in <span class="Italic">Mueller </span>and <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>, the disputed meetings in this case were not "emergency" meetings, and did not result from events that occurred "unexpectedly[.]" <span class="Italic">Mueller</span>, decision at 6; <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>, decision at 5. As found by the Arbitrator, these meetings were regularly called on a frequent basis. Also, unlike <span class="Italic">Mueller </span>and <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>, the Arbitrator found that the Agency here did not make any good-faith efforts to secure the services of an interpreter. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 6. Consistent with our denial of the Agency's nonfact exception to this finding, the finding further distinguishes this case from<span class="Italic"> Mueller </span>and <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>. <span class="Italic">See Ala. Nat'l Guard</span>, 55 FLRA at 40 (in assessing arbitrator's legal conclusions, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the written notes provided by the grievant's supervisor in this case are distinguishable from the accommodations provided in<span class="Italic"> Mueller</span> and <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>. Here, the Arbitrator determined that the supervisor's notes were ineffective and that the grievant "was forced to rely on the jottings of his supervisor as to what she filtered from the exchanges, and questions as worthy of his notice. The Agency disputes the Arbitrator's concern with such exchanges and questions, arguing that "it is hard to imagine that the emergency meetings in <span class="Italic">McNeil</span> and<span class="Italic"> Mueller </span>did not contain such side bar exchanges and questions." However, the EEOC has specifically found ineffective accommodations similar to what the Agency provided. <span class="Italic">See Bratsch v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, Appeal No. 01A40695 (Sep. 15, <span id="page_2400"></span>2006) (written transcripts of work-related meetings not a reasonable accommodation because the transcripts did not provide opportunity to ask questions and participate in discussions); <span class="Italic">Taylor</span> (providing a note taker not a reasonable accommodation because note taking did not allow employee meaningful participation in the training and resulted in isolation and inability to understand what was happening). Further, the EEOC has found that recurring work-related meetings obligate an agency "under the Rehabilitation Act to secure reliable interpretive services on an ongoing basis." <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01973231 (Oct. 16, 1998)<span class="Italic">, </span>decision at 12. In so doing, the EEOC emphasized that "selective written summaries or ineffective or unreliable interpretive services will not suffice to satisfy [the] obligation" to provide "effective interpreter services during work-related activities...so that hearing[-]impaired employees can understand what is going on at any time." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Agency was obligated to provide a sign language interpreter for the grievant at the disputed meetings unless doing so would have caused an undue hardship. To establish undue hardship, the Agency must show that providing an interpreter "would be unduly costly, extensive, substantial or disruptive or that it would fundamentally alter the nature of the agency's operation." <span class="Italic">Yost v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A51457 (June 13, 2006) (<span class="Italic">Yost</span>), decision at 19 (citing &#x00A7; 1630.2(p)). Further, "[c]laims of undue hardship must be based on an individualized assessment of current circumstances that show providing an interpreter...would cause a significant difficulty or expense to the agency." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 19-20 (citing <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act </span>(Oct. 17, 2002), part 1630, App. A)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts undue hardship based solely on the argument that postponing the meeting until a sign language interpreter was provided "would have altered the nature of the Agency's operations since it would require the Agency to keep on staff excess employees during periods of shortage of work and/or not have enough employees to work overtime during an overflow of work." This summary assertion, which is not supported by any evidence, does not demonstrate an individualized assessment of the grievant's circumstances showing that providing an interpreter would cause a significant difficulty or expense to the Agency. Consequently, the Agency fails to establish that undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See Yost</span>, decision at 19.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 72</span>, 58 FLRA 546, 547-48 (2003), rejected an award of back pay when the arbitrator concluded that the agency either failed to accommodate the grievant or failed to engage in appropriate discussions with the grievant concerning a possible accommodation. With no discussion of controlling EEOC or court law, FLRA determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When interpreting and applying the Act, the Authority applies the standards of the ADA, which are to be given precedential effect. <span class="Italic">See </span>29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 791(g), 794(d); 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(9). To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case of discrimination under the Act, a grievant must show that he or she: (1) has a disability within the meaning of the Act; (2) is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) was discriminated against because of his or her disability. <span class="Italic">See, e.g, Stewart</span> <span class="Italic">v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, Inc., </span>117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir. 1997). An agency commits unlawful discrimination by failing to reasonably accommodate a qualified individual with a disability unless the agency demonstrates that such accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the agency. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>(citing 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(5)(A)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, a reasonable accommodation is a modification or adjustment to the work environment that "enable[s] a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of [the] position[,]" including "[j]ob restructuring [or] reassignment to a vacant position...." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o). The question whether a proposed accommodation is reasonable is "fact-specific" and must be evaluated on a "case-by-case basis." <span class="Italic">Wernick v. Fed'l Reserve Bank of N.Y.</span>, 91 F.3d 379, 385 (2d Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude, based on the Arbitrator's factual findings and the record as a whole, that the Agency in this case provided the grievant a reasonable accommodation and, as a result, that the Arbitrator's award to the contrary is deficient. In reaching this conclusion, we rely on the Arbitrator's factual finding that the grievant's doctor released the grievant "to return to service under the 'adjusted' workload initiated by the Agency." We also rely on the fact that the grievant did return to work, and was able to perform her work, under the adjusted workload. Finally, examining the award as a whole leads us to conclude that the Arbitrator's award that the Agency did not reasonably accommodate the grievant was not, in fact, based on a finding that the adjusted workload was unreasonable. Instead, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency's accommodation was not reasonable based on his finding that the Agency was obligated to continue to search for a more reasonable accommodation. In this respect, the Arbitrator erred. It is well-established, in this regard, that an accommodation "does not have to be the 'best' accommodation possible, so long as it is sufficient to meet the job-related needs of the individual being accommodated." <span class="Italic">See </span>29 C.F.R. pt. 1630 app. &#x00A7; 1630.9, p. 362.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the grievant told the Agency that the accommodation was ineffective.&#x2003;However, the Union has provided no evidence to support this claim. More importantly, the Union has not established how a claim that an accommodation is ineffective, standing alone, supports a conclusion that the accommodation is, in fact or law, actually unreasonable. Further, the Union's reliance on the fact that the Arbitrator found that the grievant's workload was reduced by 50 cases, which the Union argues did not comply with the doctor's recommendation that the workload be reduced by 50%, is misplaced. Even if the Agency did not provide the accommodation suggested by the doctor, this would not establish that the grievant was unable to perform the essential functions of her job with the accommodation, or that the accommodation was otherwise unreasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances--where an accommodation was provided, the grievant was able to perform her duties with that accommodation, and the Arbitrator provided no legally recognizable basis for concluding that the accommodation was not proper--we conclude that the award finding that the Agency violated the Act by not reasonably accommodating the grievant is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">Provisions of negotiated agreements may establish accommodative requirements (substantive or procedural) beyond those required by the ADA. Those contract requirements may be enforced through arbitration and they may provide entitlements under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See EEOC and AFGE Local 3504</span>, 60 FLRA 83, 87 (2004). A contract provision calling for accommodations was enforced through an award granting leave restoration, and that award was determined to be unobjectionable, <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 3509</span>, 63 FLRA 661, 663 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Restoration of leave is an appropriate remedy when an employee has incurred the use of leave as a result of, or for reasons related to, an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596 (&#x00A7; 5596). <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 51,</span> 40 FLRA 614, 627-29 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Chapter 51</span>); <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Philadelphia Serv. Ctr., Philadelphia, Pa.,</span> 41 FLRA 710, 718-23 (1991) (IRS) (administrative leave appropriate remedy for contract violation). The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 18 by failing to accommodate the grievant's disability and by delaying the grievant's reassignment to the Whiteville office. Specifically, he found that if the Agency had accommodated the grievant's request to work at Whiteville, then the grievant would have performed at an acceptable level and would not then have used leave during the period July 15 to July 31. The Agency's violation of Article 18 constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under &#x00A7; 5596. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Chapter 51,</span> 40 FLRA at 628</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to law because 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(c) provides that an employee is not entitled to back pay for any period during which she was not ready, willing, and able to perform her duties due an incapacitating illness or injury, or for other reasons unrelated to the unjustified personnel action. However, the Authority has held that &#x00A7; 550.805(c) does not preclude restoration of leave when an employee has incurred the use of leave for reasons related to an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Health and Human Services, Gallup Indian Medical Ctr., Navajo Area Indian Health Serv.,</span> 60 FLRA 202, 211 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Educ,</span> 50 FLRA 34, 37 (1994)) (<span class="Italic">Navajo Area</span>) (then Member Pope dissenting as to other matters). <span class="Italic">Accord Ghannam v. Natsios,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01990574 (June 22, 2004) (employee entitled to back pay for period in which she was unavailable for performance of her duties due to unlawful discrimination); 63 Comp. Gen. 20 (1983) (same). The Authority has stated in this regard that an agency remedying an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action by restoring leave "generally must record the absence as administrative leave[.]" <span class="Italic">IRS.,</span> 41 FLRA at 719.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the above precedent, because the grievant used the leave as a result of the Agency's contract violation, the Arbitrator's award of administrative leave for the period of the violation is not contrary to &#x00A7; 550.805(c). The Agency has therefore failed to demonstrate that the award is deficient. Accordingly, we deny the Agency's exception that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 550.805(c).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1045 and VAMC Biloxi</span>, 64 FLRA 520, 522 (2010), decided that liability could be established through the grievance procedure based on record-handling requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the ADA, &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4) and 29 C.F.R. part 1630 (part 1630) prescribe requirements with respect to medical records that are similar to provisions of the Privacy Act. Consequently, for the same reasons that the Authority concluded that the Privacy Act affects federal employee conditions of employment, we similarly conclude that &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4) and part 1630 also are, respectively, a law and a regulation affecting conditions of employment within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii). In <span id="page_2401"></span>this regard, we note that the ADA imposes obligations, similar to the obligations of the Privacy Act, on employers in the maintenance and protection of information regarding the medical condition or history of their employees. Further, the ADA provisions apply to the Agency and unit employees through the Rehabilitation Act. As explained by the Authority, although the United States is not an employer within the meaning of the ADA, Congress has specifically adopted the standards of the ADA for determining violations of the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(g); <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Mgmt.</span>, 61 FLRA 358, 361 (2005) (then-Member Pope dissenting as to other matters). This adoption specifically includes the medical records provisions of &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4). <span class="Italic">Leach v. Mansfield</span>, 2009 WL 3190463 (S.D. Tex.). Accordingly, we conclude that the award is deficient insofar as the Arbitrator determined that the alleged violations of the ADA and implementing regulations are not arbitrable.</p>
