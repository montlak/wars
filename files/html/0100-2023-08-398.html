<p class="Body-Text">Some decisions predating the 2008 OPM regulations will no longer be of controlling significance in Board appeals.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Harrington v. Dept. of Army</span>, 19 MSPR 571, 573-74 (1984), OPM suitability disqualification actions are based on conduct, not lack of qualifications:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant timely petitioned for appeal from the action of the Department of the Army Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, which resulted on December 14, 1981, in: (1) the cancellation of appellant's appointment to the career-conditional competitive service position of Logistics Management Specialist, GS-346-9, serving subject to completion of a probationary period, effective retroactively to May 4, 1981, the date of the appointment, and; (2) his return to a term appointment in the position of Training Specialist (Automotive), GS-1712-9. The alleged basis for the agency's action was that the career-conditional appointment to the GS-346-9 position was in error because, according to a subsequent evaluation performed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), appellant was not qualified for the competitive service position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A presiding official of the Board's Philadelphia Regional Office found in an initial decision that the action constituted an appeal by a candidate for employment from an examination rating by the agency under authority delegated by OPM under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 300.104(b). Therefore, the presiding official dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction in the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Grigg v. Department of Interior,</span> 5 MSPB 446 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant timely petitioned for review, asserting, in relevant part, that the Board has jurisdiction over the action as an appeal from a negative suitability determination under 5 CFR Part 731. However, the action appealed was not brought by OPM, but by appellant's employing agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.201. Further, suitability disqualification actions are effected by OPM based on the conduct of an individual, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202, and not on his or her lack of skills, education or experience, as is the situation alleged in the instant case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mattson v. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management,</span> 7 MSPB 639, 640-41 (1981); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy,</span> 4 MSPB 113, 115-16 (1980)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under regulations effective before 2008, it might be unclear whether the employing agency simply nonselected the appellant for a position (not an appealable action) or whether the nonselection resulted from the agency's <span id="Page_775"></span>adverse (and appealable) suitability determination. An AJ would conduct a jurisdictional hearing if the appellant submitted nonfrivolous allegations that the agency made a suitability determination under delegated authority from OPM, <span class="Italic">Botello v. DOJ</span>, 76 MSPR 117, 121-23 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over appeals of negative suitability determinations under 5 CFR 731.103(d) and 731.501. In <span class="Italic">Dillingham v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 73 MSPR 538, 541 (1997), the Board stated that, if an appellant makes allegations which, if proven, show that an agency made a negative suitability determination, he has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of Board jurisdiction and is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing. In <span class="Italic">Dillingham</span>, the appellant claimed that the agency withdrew its offer of a career SES position after making a negative suitability determination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 540. The agency denied that a suitability determination had been made. In support of his assertion, the appellant alleged that a report by an agency consultant who had investigated his background discussed factors that are listed as relevant to a suitability determination in 5 CFR Part 731. He further contended that the agency had used the term "suitability" in connection with the background investigation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 543. Finally, he claimed, the fact that he had been on a list of those "eligible" for the position, and had been "ranked" by the agency, indicated that OPM had delegated authority to the agency to make a suitability determination under the applicable regulations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board found that these contentions constituted nonfrivolous allegations that the agency had made a negative suitability determination, and remanded the case for a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the appellant was informed that he had been selected for the position of investigative Research Specialist, and that "[t]he next phase of the hiring process for this position is the completion of the required background investigation." Subsequently, the agency informed the appellant that, as a result of "unfavorable information" uncovered during a preliminary investigation, he was denied the position. The appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that he failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency made a negative suitability determination in connection with its withdrawal of the offer of employment. He asserts that the evidence that he submitted below was sufficient to entitle him to a jurisdictional hearing on the question of whether the agency's withdrawal of the offer was based on a negative suitability determination or was simply an unappealable nonselection. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a February 13, 1996 internal agency memorandum regarding the appellant's background investigation, the Chief of the Internal Security Division for the U.S. Marshals Service stated that derogatory information had been developed regarding the appellant's past employment history, and that "the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) advised this office that they had sustained a pass over request by the U.S. Customs Service based on suitability issues." Because OPM's regulations specifically list "misconduct or negligence in prior employment" as a factor in making a suitability determination, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR 731.202(b)(1), we find that the memo lends support to the appellant's claim that the investigation was actually a suitability determination, <span class="Italic">see Dillingham</span>, 73 MSPR at 542. The record also includes a letter from the appellant to the agency stating that, "[o]n June 20, 1996 I was contacted by telephone by Patricia A. Lowrey of the Adjudications &#x0026; Suitability Division. She advised me that there were 'many issues' which my unsuitability was based and that she could not advise me of any of these." The agency did not rebut this assertion below. As in <span class="Italic">Dillingham</span>, we find that the agency's use of a form of the word "suitable" in the context of the pre-employment investigation bolsters the appellant's position that the agency made a suitability determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may only conduct a suitability determination upon a grant of authority by OPM. <span class="Italic">See Stiles v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 646, 648 (1988). Thus, the appellant must also make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency had delegated authority from OPM when it made the suitability determination. A February 13, 1996 memorandum referencing the appellant's application for the Investigative Research Specialist position mentions that the appellant was a contract guard in the United States Marshals Service and states that <span class="Italic">"suitability issues</span> were developed which preclude [the appellant] from employment as a contract guard." (emphasis added). Although this reference to "suitability issues" pertains to the appellant's employment as a contract guard, it indicates that the agency may have had delegated authority to conduct suitability determinations, since it appears to have made such a determination with regard to another position the appellant held. Moreover, in an October 16, 1996 letter to the appellant, an employee in the Suitability Adjudications Branch of OPM stated that all applicants or appointees to positions in the competitive Federal service "must have a suitability determination made at some point during the examination and appointment process." If this statement is accurate, either OPM or the agency was required to make such a determination prior to withdrawing the offer of the Investigative Research Specialist position to the appellant. Since there is no evidence that OPM made a suitability determination, OPM's letter supports an inference that the agency made the determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations that the agency had delegated authority from OPM to make suitability determinations and that it exercised that authority in the matter of his application for the Investigative Research Specialist position. The appellant is entitled to a hearing on this matter since, while the evidence establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, it is insufficient for us to resolve the issue here. <span class="Italic">See Dillingham</span>, 73 MSPR at 543.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nakshin v. DOJ</span>, 98 MSPR 524, 526-29 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-11 (2005), presents another appeal that led to a remand to determine whether an agency with delegated authority to make suitability determinations rejected an applicant for a job for lack of basic qualifications for the job or for failure to meet OPM suitability criteria:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant applied and was tentatively selected for a GS-11 competitive service position of Automated Litigation Support Specialist with the agency's U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO) for the Eastern District of New York, subject to the completion of a background investigation. The agency has a general delegation of authority from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to conduct suitability determinations pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In preparation for a background investigation, which was to be conducted by OPM, the agency ran a credit and reference check on the appellant. Prior to forwarding the appellant's information to the agency's headquarters office in Washington, D.C., Charlene Carter, Human Resources Assistant, was assigned to review the appellant's packet, which included a Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions, and his credit report. Upon review of the appellant's credit history, Carter determined that the appellant would be required to provide written responses to explain delinquencies on his accounts with Chase and Bank of America. Carter then forwarded the packet to Linda Spencer, USAO's liaison to OPM in the agency's Executive Office in Washington, D.C., who confirmed that the appellant would need to explain the delinquencies and added specifically that an explanation was needed for a credit card bill that was 90 days past due.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant initially responded by stating that he no longer had receipts pertaining to the two matters. In his next response, the appellant disputed these delinquencies by stating that one of the items was not his obligation, while the other item was a late payment, which subsequently was paid in full. In his final response, the appellant stated that both the Bank of America and Chase accounts were in dispute and that his statements regarding his credit history were verified during a previous clearance investigation conducted by the Department of Defense (DOD). He further stated that he was in the process of disputing the erroneous information with Equifax credit reporting agency with the full intent of removing the derogatory information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ultimately, the appellant received a letter from Rosetta Cargin, USAO Personnel Officer, notifying him that the agency was withdrawing the tentative offer of employment as a result of the evaluation of information received during the initial background check. According to the agency, after providing the appellant with numerous opportunities to submit information necessary to conduct an effective background investigation, it determined that his failure to cooperate and provide the requested information was a basis for rescinding the job offer. The agency allegedly determined that the appellant's lack of cooperation, failure to provide information, and poor attitude and communication skills were of concern because the position he applied for required the employee to provide customer service to others in the office, including requests for assistance from attorneys. Thus, the agency allegedly concluded that the appellant's lack of cooperation, failure to produce the requested information, and poor attitude and communication skills indicated that he was not qualified for these aspects of the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal of the agency's rescinded, tentative job offer. He alleged that the agency improperly found him unsuitable for employment and that its decision was based on discrimination on the basis of his national origin (Russian). The agency moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. It argued that the appellant established his lack of qualifications for the position prior to the completion of the background investigation. Because it never completed its background investigation, the agency argued, it never made a suitability determination.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We are unable to determine on this record whether the agency's action is a nonappealable nonselection or an appealable suitability determination. While the appellant's alleged lack of communication skills could be considered a qualification consideration, both his credit history and the allegedly unsatisfactory nature of his attempts to explain problems with his credit history appear to be suitability considerations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 518 &#x00B6; 14. The record includes conflicting evidence as to the reasons for the agency's withdrawal of its job offer. At the hearing, Carter testified that, in her dealings with the appellant, he was cooperative in supplying explanations for his financial delinquencies, and that she didn't perceive that he was withholding information from her. Carter also stated that the Headquarters Office delayed in responding to the information that she supplied to them regarding the appellant. Barbara Hemmingway who is the Deputy Human Resources Officer, testified that the Human Resources Office did not have any issue with the information the appellant supplied, but that the Headquarters Office deemed the information to be insufficient to support a favorable suitability determination. Hemmingway further testified that she had no discussions with either Cargin or Joy Fairtile, USAO Administrative Officer, concerning any alleged lack of cooperation by the appellant, and that she had no foreknowledge that the letter rescinding the offer of employment was to be issued. Moreover, Cargin testified that she had no information that the appellant was uncooperative or that he did not respond to inquiries; Fairtile testified that she had no information that the appellant had ever withheld information relating to his credit history; and Fairtile also stated that the decision to withdraw the offer of employment was based not on the appellant's attitude but on his inability to obtain a waiver[*] and a favorably adjudicated background investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] According to the agency, its Justice Management Division could grant a waiver permitting the appellant to work after the initial screening process while OPM completed the full background investigation.</p>

This assessment may depend in part on the demeanor of the hearing witnesses. Because the AJ who held the hearing in this case had an opportunity to observe the demeanor of these witnesses while testifying, and because a supplemental hearing may need to be held, we find that remanding this case for the AJ's further consideration is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v.

<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, in <span class="Italic">Nakshin v. DOJ,</span> 104 MSPR 604, 606 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5, 2007 MSPB 37 (2007), the Board affirmed the AJ's conclusion that the agency improperly separated the appellant for suitability reasons, but the Board clarified some intervening law, overruling <span class="Italic">Duggan v. Dept. of Interior,</span> 98 MSPR 666 (2005), <span class="Italic">post</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish the Board's jurisdiction over an alleged constructive suitability determination, an appellant must establish that: (1) The position for which he was not selected was in the competitive service; (2) the agency had delegated authority from the Office of Personnel Management to make suitability determinations; and (3) the agency's decision not to select him was a finding that he was unsuitable for employment within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. part 731. <span class="Italic">See Saleem v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 151, &#x00B6; 7 (2001); <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Department of Justice</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6; 12 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the present appeal was remanded for further adjudication, the Board issued a decision in <span class="Italic">Duggan v. Department of the Interior</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 666, &#x00B6; 7 (2005), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 190 Fed. Appx. 963 (2006) (NP). In <span class="Italic">Duggan</span>, the Board cited to <span class="Italic">Saleem</span> and <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, and stated that the third criterion that the appellant must demonstrate is that "his nonselection for the position was based on the agency's determination that he was unsuitable due to one or more of the factors set forth under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202." <span class="Italic">See Duggan</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 666, &#x00B6; 7 (emphasis added). In other words, the Board in <span class="Italic">Duggan</span> determined that, unless the agency's reasoning for its nonselection falls within one of the specific categories that is discussed in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b), its action cannot be characterized as a constructive suitability determination over which the Board has jurisdiction. This holding is contrary to the Board's reasoning in its prior decisions concerning suitability determinations, including <span class="Italic">Saleem</span> and <span class="Italic">Edwards,</span> and is hereby OVERRULED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Duggan v. Dept. of Interior,</span> 98 MSPR 666 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11 (2005) (overruled by <span class="Italic">Nakshin v. DOJ,</span> 104 MSPR 604, 2007 MSPB 37 (2007), <span class="Italic">supra</span>), added the qualification to the agency-delegated suitability analysis that the separation of the appellant must be specifically for one of the reasons established in 5 CFR 731.202(b):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual whom OPM, or an agency acting under delegated authority from OPM, finds unsuitable for employment in the competitive service under 5 C.F.R. part 731 has a right to appeal to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.101, .103(g), .501(a); <span class="Italic">see Edwards v. Department of Justice</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6; 5 (2001). A suitability inquiry under part 731 examines whether "an individual's character or conduct...may have an impact on the integrity or efficiency of the service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(a). Among the factors that might support a negative suitability determination are "[m]isconduct or negligence in employment," "[c]riminal or dishonest conduct," and "[m]aterial, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b). The AJ found, and the parties do not dispute, that neither OPM nor the agency formally made a suitability determination under part 731. Rather, the appellant has alleged below and on review that the agency made a "<span class="Italic">de facto</span>" or "constructive" suitability determination. Because the AJ did not adjudicate the issue of whether the agency made a constructive suitability determination, we do so here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish the Board's jurisdiction over an alleged constructive suitability determination, an appellant must establish that: (1) The position for which he was not selected was in the competitive service; (2) the agency had delegated authority from OPM to make suitability determinations; and (3) his nonselection for the position was based on the agency's determination that he was unsuitable due to one or more of the factors set forth under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202. <span class="Italic">See Saleem v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 151, &#x00B6; 7 (2001); <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6; 12. In determining whether an agency's action was an unappealable nonselection or an appealable suitability determination, the Board looks to the substance of the action, rather than the form. <span class="Italic">See Saleem,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 151, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Edwards,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record shows that the Park Ranger position is in the competitive service. In addition, the agency has not disputed the appellant's contention that the agency, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(a), had delegated authority to make suitability determinations pertaining to competitive service positions in the agency. Regarding whether the appellant's nonselection was based on the agency's determination that the appellant was unsuitable due to the factors set forth under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202, the record shows that the agency completed a Standard Form (SF) 62, Agency Request to Pass Over a Preference Eligible or Object to an Eligible, "object[ing] " to the appellant's eligibility because he was "unsuitable for a law enforcement position." The agency contended, however, that the form was never sent to OPM for approval. For the reasons discussed below, we find that, regardless of whether OPM approved the agency's SF-62 request to remove the appellant from the certificate of eligibles, the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency made a suitability determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the agency used the term "unsuitable" in completing the SF-62. The Board has stated that "the agency's use of a form of the word 'suitable' in the context of the pre-employment investigation bolsters the appellant's position that the agency made a suitability determination." <span class="Italic">Botello v. Department of Justice</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 117, 122 (1997). On the other hand, the Board also has held that the agency's use of the term "qualifications," rather than "suitability," to categorize its reason for nonselecting an appellant did not necessarily preclude a finding that the agency made a constructive suitability determination. <span class="Italic">Edwards,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 10. Therefore, the agency's own categorization of its reason for not selecting the appellant here, as based on reasons of "suitability" rather than "qualifications," is not dispositive of whether the agency made a suitability determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the agency's having taken steps to initiate an objection to the appellant's eligibility by completing the SF-62, the Board has held that an appellant raised a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency made a constructive suitability determination in a situation where OPM sustained <span id="Page_777"></span>an agency's SF-62 request to pass over an eligible "based on suitability issues." <span class="Italic">Botello</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 122. In <span class="Italic">Botello,</span> however, the agency's SF-62 request was based on "derogatory information...regarding the appellant's past employment history" which the agency refused to divulge to the appellant, and the Board found, under those circumstances, that the derogatory information could pertain to "misconduct or negligence in prior employment" which is among the reasons to be considered in making a suitability determination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> And after <span class="Italic">Botello</span> was issued<span class="Italic">,</span> the Board emphasized, as noted above, that the substance of the action, rather than its form, governs in determining whether an agency made a constructive suitability determination. <span class="Italic">See Saleem,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 151, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Edwards,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6; 10. Unlike in <span class="Italic">Botello</span>, where the agency did not reveal the specific reason for the appellant's "derogatory" past employment history, it is undisputed here that: The specific reason for the agency's refusal to select the appellant was his prior failure to complete successfully the FLETC training required for the Park Ranger position; the agency informed the appellant of this specific reason; and the appellant did fail to complete the FLETC training successfully. The undisputed record evidence further shows that: Successful completion of FLETC training is mandatory for the Park Ranger (Law Enforcement) position; an individual "will be given one opportunity to complete this training"; and if he fails to "satisfy this qualification requirement, [he] will become ineligible for th[e] position[, and the agency] is under no obligation to offer alternate employment opportunities." Failure to complete training successfully is not among the factors to be considered under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b) in making a suitability determination. Although "[m]isconduct or negligence in employment" is a factor to be considered under section 731.202(b), failure to complete training successfully constitutes neither misconduct nor negligence.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] Although misconduct or negligence potentially could be peripherally involved in an individual's failure to complete the necessary training, nothing in the current record suggests that the appellant's failure to complete FLETC training was due to misconduct or negligence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find that the appellant's allegations, even if true, would not establish that the agency made a constructive suitability determination because the agency's reason for not selecting him was not "the sort of reason ordinarily relied on to support a suitability determination under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Edwards,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 9, 14; <span class="Italic">cf. id.</span> (the appellant raised a nonfrivolous allegation of a constructive suitability determination where his nonselection was due to his failure to disclose his prior probationary termination for "Failure to Follow Office Procedures and Dress Code," "the sort of reason ordinarily relied on to support a suitability determination under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202"); <span class="Italic">Saleem,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 151, &#x00B6; 11 (the appellant raised a nonfrivolous allegation of a constructive suitability determination where she was nonselected "based on the agency's belief that she lied about her drug use," a type of reason that would support a negative suitability determination under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b)). Because the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction, we DISMISS his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Dillingham v. Department of Justice</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 538, 541 (1997) (nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction are allegations of fact that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Under the pre-2008 regulatory revisions, <span class="Italic">Edwards v. DOJ</span>, 87 MSPR 518, 521-25 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-15 (2001), attempted to distinguish a nonappealable nonselection by an agency from an appealable suitability determination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, an unsuccessful candidate for a federal civil service job, has no right to appeal his non-selection<span class="Italic">. See Tines v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 56 MSPR 90, 93 (1992). However, an individual who is found unsuitable for employment in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service by OPM or an agency acting under a delegation of authority has a right to appeal to the Board<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.101, 731.103(d), 731.501(a). A suitability inquiry is directed toward whether the "character or conduct" of a candidate or current employee is such that employing or continuing to employ him would adversely affect the efficiency of the service. 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.101, 731.201. Among the many factors that might be relied upon in rendering a negative suitability determination are falsification, deception or fraud in the examination process, and "Misconduct or negligence in prior employment which would have a bearing on efficient service in the position in question." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 7311.202(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case bears a strong similarity to two Board decisions that deal with the distinction between a simple non-selection, which cannot be appealed, and a negative suitability determination, which can be appealed. The two decisions are not entirely consistent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Vislisel v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 MSPR 679, 680 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 802 F.2d 472 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Table), the agency filed an SF-62 with OPM, asking that a candidate be removed from, a certificate of eligibles based on his "suitability." OPM sustained the objection, although it noted that the reasons cited by the agency--the candidate's argumentative behavior during interviews--related to his "qualifications" and not his suitability. <span class="Italic">Vislisel</span>, 29 MSPR at 680. The candidate then appealed, claiming that he had been subjected to a suitability determination. The AJ found that the reasons considered by OPM in removing the appellant from the certificate of eligibles were of the sort normally relied upon in making suitability determinations, and held that the appellant had therefore been subjected to a "constructive suitability determination" that could be appealed to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 680-81.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the Board disagreed. It explained that the procedure for objecting to an eligible whose name appears on a certificate is governed by 5 CFR &#x00A7; 332.406(a), is initiated by an agency, and is "separate and apart from the OPM-initiated suitability determination process governed by 5 CFR] &#x00A7; 731.201." 29 MSPR at 681. The Board also remarked that the "potential consequences" of an adverse suitability determination--termination of current employment and/or debarment from employment anywhere in the competitive service for up to 3 years are much more severe than when OPM sustains an objection to an eligible; the latter procedure results only in the candidate not being considered for a specific position or type of position in a specific agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 681-82. The Board concluded that it lacks authority to review a decision to sustain an objection to an eligible under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 332.406, and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

Department of Justice,</span> 86 MSPR 365 (2000), also arose from a sustained objection to an eligible; the eligible there happened to be the same appellant in the case now before us, but a different position was involved. Relying on <span class="Italic">Botello v. Department of Justice,</span> 76 MSPR 117 (1997), and <span class="Italic">Dillingham v. Department of Justice,</span> 73 MSPR 538 (1997), we held that when an agency with delegated authority to render suitability determinations removes an eligible from a certificate based on a sustained objection to the candidate's qualifications, the Board will scrutinize the agency's true reason for its action. If the evidence shows that the candidate had actually been found qualified for the position at issue, and the agency later removed him from consideration based on one of the reasons set forth under OPM's suitability guidelines, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202, then the Board may conclude that the candidate was subjected to an appealable constructive suitability determination. <span class="Italic">Edwards,</span> 86 MSPR 365 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our decision in <span class="Italic">Edwards</span> did not mention <span class="Italic">Vislisel</span> or 5 CFR &#x00A7; 332.406. While the post-<span class="Italic">Vislisel</span> decisions relied on in <span class="Italic">Edwards</span> did not involve the objection-to-an-eligible procedure, they did make clear that in deciding whether an action was an unappealable non-selection or an appealable suitability determination, what matters is the substance of the action, not the form. <span class="Italic">See Botello,</span> 76 MSPR at 121-23 (the fact that the agency withdrew an offer of employment after a background investigation had uncovered "unfavorable information" of the sort normally relied upon in suitability determinations tended to support the appellant's claim that he had been subjected to a constructive suitability determination; the appeal was remanded for a hearing on the issue); <span class="Italic">Dillingham</span>, 73 MSPR at 541-43 (evidence showing that the appellant had been found qualified for a Senior Executive position, and that the agency later canceled his appointment after a background investigation had revealed negative information of the sort normally relied upon in suitability determinations, tended to support the appellants claim that he had been subjected to a constructive suitability determination; the appeal was remanded for a hearing on the issue). <span class="Italic">Vislisel</span> did not hold that a non-selection which purports to be based on the candidate's qualifications, or which takes the form of the objection-to-an eligible procedure, can never be deemed a suitability determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Still, one aspect of <span class="Italic">Vislisel</span> cannot be squared with <span class="Italic">Edwards, Botello,</span> and <span class="Italic">Dillingham</span>. In <span class="Italic">Vislisel</span> the Board appeared to hold that an appealable suitability determination must involve a finding of ineligibility for competitive-service employment government-wide, and must be more than a position-specific or agency-specific decision. 29 MSPR at 681-82. It is true that OPM "in its discretion" may impose the sanction of debarment <span id="Page_778"></span>when it renders a negative suitability determination. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.304(a). However, OPM's rules make clear that some negative suitability determinations are based on a finding that an individual's conduct or character may interfere with efficient service in <span class="Italic">"the position</span> applied for or employed in." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.101 (emphasis supplied); <span class="Italic">accord</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202(a)(1); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202(b)(1), (2) (linking some suitability factors to "the position"). Given that OPM's rules contemplate position-specific suitability determinations, we hold that a government-wide bar to competitive-service employment is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to a suitability appeal. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Vislisel</span> is inconsistent with this holding, it is overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn back to the present case. Under <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, <span class="Italic">Botello</span>, and <span class="Italic">Dillingham</span>, the appellant can establish jurisdiction by showing that the agency had delegated authority from OPM to make suitability determinations, and that its decision not to select him, although purportedly based on his "qualifications" for the Correctional Officer position, was in actuality a finding that he was unsuitable for employment in that position within the meaning of 5 CFR Part 731. We agree with the appellant that the record does not support the AJ's finding that the agency lacks delegated authority to make suitability determinations. The AJ relied on a document from OPM's website explaining when agencies should refer issues to OPM for suitability investigations. The document is general in scope, and does not touch on what authority the agency may or may not have in the realm of suitability determinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of his contention that the agency has delegate authority to conduct suitability determinations, the Appellant has filed a 1999 U.S. Department of Justice Inspector General (IG) report discussing existing agency procedures for background investigations of job candidates, throughout which the IG refers to how the agency resolves "suitability" issues. He has also reproduced what appear to be excerpts from guidelines governing agency suitability determinations, as well as what appears to be an excerpt from an interagency agreement between OPM and the agency concerning suitability determinations. Based on these documents, discussed in <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, we hold, just as we did in <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency has delegated authority to render a suitability determination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 86 MSPR 365 &#x00B6; 6-8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we conclude that the appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations of fact that, if proven, would permit the inference that the agency made a constructive suitability determination. We base this conclusion on the apparent fact that the appellant was considered qualified for the Correctional Officer position, and on the undisputed fact that the agency's reason for having him removed from the list of eligibles--its belief, drawn from his employment history, that he did not possess the "dependability, stability, maturity, responsibility, and reliability" needed to perform Correctional Officer duties--was the sort of reason ordinarily relied on to support a suitability determination under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...If the agency did not just use an OPM form for its own internal purposes, but instead obtained OPM's approval for removing the appellant from the certificate of eligibles, then on remand the AJ should apply the principles of <span class="Italic">Edwards, Botello,</span> and <span class="Italic">Dillingham</span> to ascertain whether OPM made a constructive suitability determination. As stated above, an individual who is found unsuitable for employment in the competitive service by an agency acting under a delegation of authority from OPM, or by OPM itself, has a right of appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.103(d), 731.501(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Saleem v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 88 MSPR 151, 154-56 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (2001), also required the AJ to provide a hearing to an appellant to sort out whether the agency failed to select the employee, or whether the employee was tentatively selected and then disqualified for selection because of suitability concerns:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who is found unsuitable for employment in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service by OPM, or an agency acting under delegated authority from OPM, has a right to appeal her nonselection to the Board. A suitability inquiry is directed toward whether the "character or conduct" of a candidate is such that employing her would adversely affect the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Among the factors that might be relied upon in rendering a negative suitability determination are falsification, deception or fraud in the examination process, and misconduct or negligence in prior employment which would have a bearing on efficient service in the position in question. <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Department of Justice,</span> 87 MSPR 518 &#x00B6; 5 (2001). In deciding whether an action is an unappealable nonselection or an appealable suitability determination, what matters is the substance, not the form, of the action. A government-wide bar to competitive service employment is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to a suitability appeal<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11. Thus, the appellant can establish Board jurisdiction by showing that the Special Agent position was in the competitive service, that the agency had delegated authority from OPM to make suitability determinations, and that the agency's decision not to select her was a finding that she was unsuitable for employment within the meaning of 5 CFR Part 731. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an appellant makes a nonfrivolous allegation that an agency made a suitability determination covered by 5 CFR part 731, she is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">Mesbah v. Department of Justice</span>, MSPB Docket No. SF-3443-00-0268-1-1, slip op. &#x00B6; 7 (Jan. 6, 2001). Nonfrivolous allegations of Board jurisdiction are allegations of fact that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter. In determining whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling her to a hearing, the administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary submissions; however, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive. <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To support her allegation that the Special Agent position was in the competitive service or that she was entitled to a competitive service appointment to the position, the appellant submitted a copy of the position description for Criminal Investigator, GS-1811-7, which indicated that the position status was "competitive." Furthermore, the agency had evidence that the appellant had served as a GS-1811-5 Special Agent with the Internal Revenue Service from September 1995 to May 1998. The appellant also submitted evidence that that was a career-conditional appointment, and, thus, that she may be entitled to reinstatement eligibility. The administrative judge, however, relied on Burgess's affidavit in finding that the position was not in the competitive service and that the appellant was not entitled to a competitive service appointment. In doing so, she improperly viewed the agency's evidence as dispositive. <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 MSPR at 329. We find, in contrast, that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that the position was in the competitive service or that she is entitled to a competitive service appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To support her allegation that the agency had delegated authority from OPM to make suitability determinations, the appellant correctly asserted that there is a general delegation from OPM to agencies to make suitability determinations on direct hires. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.103(a). Again, we find that this constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation. <span class="Italic">Edwards</span> &#x00B6; 13 n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To support her allegation that the agency made a constructive suitability determination, the appellant submitted evidence that she was considered qualified for the Special Agent position and was not offered the position based on the agency's belief that she lied about her drug use, that is, for the types of reasons ordinarily relied on to support a negative suitability determination under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202(b)(3), (6). Specifically, the appellant submitted evidence that she had passed the agency's examination and that it extended her a conditional offer of employment as a Special Agent. She further averred as follows: After this offer, she had a second interview before an agency panel, completed a writing exercise, and was told by an agency official that she had done very well and that he would review her papers again "to make sure nothing held her up." However, during her subsequent polygraph examination, the examiner concluded that she was being deceptive when she truthfully denied prior illegal drug use, and he informed her that she had failed the examination. The agency then informed her that she had not been selected for the Special Agent position. After the appellant contacted an agency equal employment opportunity counselor, the agency told the counselor that it withdrew its conditional offer of employment to the appellant because of the polygraph examination. Thus, we find that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency withdrew its conditional offer based on a negative suitability determination<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Botello v. Department of Justice</span>, 76 MSPR 117, 121-22 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Revisions in regulations governing suitability actions by OPM in 2008 sought to overrule <span class="Italic">Edwards</span> and preclude the Board from refashioning an agency action based on the Board's view of the purpose or effect of that action. Under the 2008 regulation, 5 CFR 731.501, the Board looks only to the charges brought by the agency, and the action must be sustained if at least one charge is sustained. In comments accompanying the regulation, 73 Fed. Reg. 20149, 20152-53 (April 15, 2008), OPM stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the proposed rule, OPM discussed the basis for concluding that the procedures an agency decides to use to take an action, e.g., objecting to an eligible under 5 CFR part 332 or taking a suitability action under this part, determine whether an agency's action may be appealed. The Board recognized this clear distinction in <span class="Italic">Vislisel v. OPM,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 679 (1986) when it observed that a sustained objection is an agency-initiated procedure separate and apart from a suitability determination under part 731. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 682. In <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Department of Justice,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 518 (2001), the Board abandoned its approach in <span class="Italic">Vislisel,</span> holding that, in deciding whether an action was an appealable suitability determination, "what matters is the substance of the action, not the form." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 522. OPM noted that this is an incorrect reading of the authority that OPM conferred upon the Board and proposed to adjust the suitability regulations accordingly. <span id="Page_779"></span>Consequently, OPM concluded that, when adjudicating an appeal of an agency action, the Board must assess the agency's action under the procedures elected by the agency and may not hold the agency to standards relating to a legal authority that the agency did not invoke. The Board may not create an appeal right where neither Congress nor OPM has expressly granted it. <span class="Italic">King v. Jerome,</span> 42 F.3d 1371, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1994). OPM proposed changes to the regulations to reflect this conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One commenter stated that OPM's proposed changes would administratively overrule <span class="Italic">Edwards</span> and that change would be tampering with what is now settled MSPB precedent. While agreeing that the proposed change would overrule <span class="Italic">Edwards,</span> OPM is not "tampering" with MSPB precedent. Rather, OPM is correcting case law that is clearly erroneous and well beyond the intent of Congress--which is that MSPB's jurisdiction is limited to actions appealable under "any law, rule, or regulation" as provided by 5 U.S.C. 7701(a). OPM strongly disagrees that this stands on its head the decision in <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Navy,</span> 767 F.2d, 8326 (Fed. Cir. 1985), which provides an agency may choose whether to use 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 or 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 to take a performance-based action. Just as in <span class="Italic">Lovshin,</span> when the choice is between using suitability authority or some other authority, whatever action taken under the chosen authority is subject to review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another commenter agreed with the notion that MSPB cannot hold an agency to standards relating to a legal authority the agency did not invoke and concluded that an agency's action "should rise or fall on how that agency characterizes the action, not how MSPB could characterize the agency's action." OPM agrees and notes that this is precisely our rationale for clarifying the authority of MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, OPM strongly disagrees with one commenter's claim that OPM is "setting up a system that it and agencies will be free to manipulate without a check by MSPB." OPM has carefully structured a system that protects the rights of persons by providing for MSPB review of agency actions. Whatever action an agency chooses to take, there is a process for ensuring the rights of those affected are protected.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Malone v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3261), distinguished an appealable suitability action and a nonselection resulting from an agency policy of not hiring an individual who was previously removed for cause from federal employment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether a person is refused government employment because of nonselection, as opposed to being nonselected because of unsuitability, makes a difference when it comes to Board jurisdiction. The Board has long held that it lacks jurisdiction to consider the merits of a case in which an agency has simply not selected someone for employment. <span class="Italic">See Mello v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 20 MSPR 45, 47 (1984). Mr. Malone does not contest the Board's holdings on this point. Instead, he invokes the Board's regulations and precedent that confer jurisdiction on the Board when an agency has determined that an applicant lacks suitability for employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.103(d) (2001); <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 86 MSPR 365, 367 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his appeal to the Board, Mr. Malone pointed to the regulations and Board cases that establish jurisdiction to hear cases involving suitability determinations. From those decisions, in particular the <span class="Italic">Edwards</span> case cited by Mr. Malone, Mr. Malone knows that suitability determinations are fact-driven and concern the suitability of the individual employee. In <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, for example, the Board pointed to the long list of factual inquiries at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202(b) that establish the criteria for assessment of when a suitability determination has been made by an agency. <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, 86 MSPR at 369. Each of those criteria focuses on the person's conduct, rather than on the person's status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board in this case determined that Mr. Malone had been nonselected for employment and that the agency had not made an appealable suitability determination. In deciding the question, the Board pointed to the statement in the July 27 letter that the agency was applying its policy not to hire a person who had been removed for cause from previous federal employment. As such, the focus of the agency's action was not on the precise conduct that had led to Mr. Malone's removal; instead it was his status as a removee that precluded his selection. In the Board's view, Mr. Malone thus had been nonselected, a matter over which it lacked jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this court, Mr. Malone asserts that he at least has made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was denied employment for want of suitability, thus entitling him to a hearing on the question of whether he was nonselected or denied employment for want of suitability. In order to sustain his burden of establishing Board jurisdiction over his appeal, Mr. Malone must point to some factual considerations that would key the agency's July 27 action to issues relating to his conduct, with such previous matters of conduct being the reason why the agency would have found him unsuitable for employment. This burden for Mr. Malone is heavy, for it is clear that the agency's July 27 letter resulted from his status as a removee rather than from any examination of the particular conduct that he may have displayed when previously employed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Malone however has not pointed to any such factual evidence that would support the proposition that the agency deemed him not suited for employment, as defined in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202. Absent such factual allegations in the record, we are left with the decision of the Board, which points to the July 27 letter, denying Mr. Malone employment as a matter of enforcing agency policy. Mr. Malone cites, in support of his petition, a provision in Postal Service Handbook EL-311, April 1990, which states, "[i]n making <span class="Italic">selections</span> for any type of accession, determination must be made whether an eligible [employee] or applicant might be <span class="Italic">disqualified</span> for reasons such as the following: a. Dismissal from prior employment for cause" (emphases added). This provision, however, supports the Board, for it indicates that the Postal Service has a long-standing policy of not selecting an applicant because of the applicant's status as a removee, regardless of what prompted the prior removal. The Postal Service's action here is consistent with a straightforward implementation of this policy, unlinked to any particular conduct of Mr. Malone. We see no reason to convert implementation of a generic employment policy into a case-specific examination of a person's former conduct as it bears on current employment suitability. We thus conclude that the record provides substantial evidence to support the Board's factual conclusion that Mr. Malone has suffered a nonselection and not an adverse suitability determination. As such, we can detect no error in the Board's final decision, and, accordingly, we affirm.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fortenberry v. MSPB</span>, 287 Fed. Appx. 869, 871 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) (alleged policy of USPS barring employment of ex-felons, even if a misinterpretation of labor laws, does not create an action appealable to the Board).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a constructive suitability appeal, under suitability regulations extant before 2008, if an agency had delegated authority to make suitability determinations for positions, the Board's authority extended to directing corrective action if the agency did not apply proper suitability standards, as in <span class="Italic">Prehoda v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/PREHODA_DAVID_BN_0731_04_0071_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_246487.pdf">98 MSPR 418</a>, 421-26 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-17 (2005), a decision that also examined the timing (prematurity) of a suitability appeal as well as the remedy and possible mootness of an appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board generally lacks jurisdiction to consider an appeal regarding a nonselection for a vacant position, it has jurisdiction to consider the denial of an appointment that is the result of a negative suitability determination made by OPM or by an agency operating under delegated authority from OPM. <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum v. General Services Administration</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 243 &#x00B6; 4 (1999). Here, the agency had such delegated authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.103(a), 731.203(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the standard for suitability determinations, an applicant or appointee, such as the appellant, may be denied Federal employment "only when the action will protect the integrity or promote the efficiency of the service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.201. The agency conceded below that its action was based upon the appellant's character and the "impact it would have on the integrity and efficiency of the Agency." Therefore, the administrative judge properly found that the agency made a constructive suitability determination in this matter. <span class="Italic">See Edwards v. Department of Justice</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 518 &#x00B6; 10 (2001) (in deciding whether an action is an unappealable nonselection or an appealable suitability determination, the substance, rather than the form, of the action will be determinative). While the Board recognizes that the administrative judge may have made this finding prematurely, i.e., before the agency had submitted its file, the agency did not contest the finding that it had made a constructive suitability determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant contends that the administrative judge wrongly dismissed his appeal as moot and that he was improperly denied a hearing. The appellant correctly asserts that his appeal should not have been dismissed as moot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board reverses a negative suitability determination where the appellant had been tentatively selected for a position before the suitability determination was made, the proper remedy is to order the agency both to cancel the unsuitability rating and to return the affected individual to all appropriate eligibility lists for employment. <span class="Italic">See Dow v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 355 &#x00B6; 12 (2003); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. General Services Administration</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 120, 123 (1992). However, the Board generally will not require the agency to appoint the applicant retroactively to the position for which it found him to be unsuitable. <span class="Italic">See Dow</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 355 &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued before the administrative judge that no formal suitability determination was ever made with regard to the appellant because the suitability investigation was never completed, so there was no unsuitability determination of record to be cancelled. Additionally, it alleged that there was no eligibility list to which the appellant could be returned because the Public Job Notice for which the appellant was selected was closed. It further asserted that OPM has no nationwide eligibility list for Center Adjudications Officers at the GS-9/11/12 levels, and that the only eligibility list for Center Adjudications Officers is at the GS-5/7 levels, with different testing requirements than the GS-9/11/12 level positions. The administrative judge accepted the agency's <span id="Page_780"></span>assertions and concluded that the appeal was moot because the Board could not grant the appellant effective relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While an action is generally considered moot if the Board cannot grant effective relief, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Dellera v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 636, 642 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 82 F.3d 434 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table), the Supreme Court of the United States (Supreme Court) has permitted otherwise moot cases to continue under the "capable of repetition, yet evading review" exception to mootness</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">only in the exceptional situations where the following two circumstances are simultaneously present: (1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Lewis v. Continental Bank Corporation</span>, 494 U.S. 472, 481-82 (1990) (internal citations omitted). This exception requires that there is a reasonable expectation or demonstrated probability, rather than a mere physical or theoretical possibility, that the same controversy will recur involving the same complaining party. <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Hunt</span>, 455 U.S. 478, 482 (1982). Moreover, the Supreme Court and the Board have held that, for this exception to apply, recurrences of the action would have to be likely to forever evade review. <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 494 U.S. at 481-82; <span class="Italic">Department of Agriculture v. Palmer</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 586, 589 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's action was not fully litigated prior to the agency's closing the eligibility list for the particular position for which the appellant had been tentatively selected. Additionally, given the fact that the appellant has alleged that he has applied for over 500 positions with the agency and its predecessors, there is a reasonable expectation that the agency may again deny him employment based upon the finding that his prior testimony lacked credibility. Without a final Board decision, what occurred in this case is likely to occur again. While the appellant could file a new appeal if he were denied employment on the same basis in the future, the agency could again claim that it has no suitability determination to cancel because it never made one and that it has no eligibility list to which it could return the appellant. If such contentions are sufficient to render the appeal moot in this matter, they would be sufficient to render future appeals moot as well, thereby preventing any similar appeals submitted by the appellant from ever being fully adjudicated. This process would deny the appellant the possibility of ever obtaining a Board decision in his favor. Without such a decision, nothing would preclude the agency from relitigating the issue of whether a finding of lack of credibility may serve as a basis for a suitability determination, a matter that was not decided below, in subsequent appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 235, 239 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is appropriate when (1) an issue is identical to that involved in the prior action, (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action, (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment, and (4) the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, if the Board issued a final decision finding that the constructive suitability determination was improper, the agency would be precluded from relying on the lack of credibility issue to find the appellant unsuitable for the same position under different vacancy announcements and from relitigating that issue in subsequent appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kroeger</span>, 865 F.2d at 239;<span class="Italic"> cf. Dow</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 355 &#x00B6; 15 (OPM regulations allow for position-specific suitability determinations based on a finding that the applicant's conduct or character may interfere with efficient service in a particular position; the fact that the Board overturned OPM's negative suitability determination regarding a particular position would not necessarily preclude OPM from using the same facts to support a negative suitability determination for another position). If the agency merely cancelled the constructive suitability determination voluntarily, that would not be the case. For these reasons, the appeal should not have been dismissed as moot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that the agency made a constructive suitability determination and that the appeal is not moot, we address the merits of the appeal. As a preliminary matter, we note that there is a question regarding whether the administrative judge was correct in finding that the constructive suitability determination could not be sustained because it was not in accordance with the law. The administrative judge based this finding on the fact that the agency did not use a proposing official as required under the internal delegation of suitability authority from the Executive Associate Commissioner of the Office of Management to the Administrative Center Directors. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.402. Under the circumstances, the agency's failure to use a proposing official might be more appropriately characterized as a procedural error, rather than an action that is contrary to law. In any event, the Board need not decide this issue because an alternative reason exists for not sustaining the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPM suitability regulations provide as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a) <span class="Italic">General</span>. In determining whether its action will protect the integrity or promote the efficiency of the service, OPM, or an agency to which OPM has delegated authority, shall make its determination on the basis of the specific factors in paragraph (b) of this section with appropriate consideration given to the additional considerations outlined in paragraph (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b) <span class="Italic">Specific factors.</span> When making a determination under paragraph (a) of this section, the following may be considered a basis for finding an individual unsuitable:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Misconduct or negligence in employment;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Criminal or dishonest conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;Material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;Refusal to furnish testimony as required by &#x00A7; 5.4 of this title;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(5)&#x2003;Alcohol abuse of a nature and duration which suggests that the applicant or appointee would be prevented from performing the duties of the position in question, or would constitute a direct threat to the property or safety of others;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(6)&#x2003;Illegal use of narcotics, drugs, or other controlled substances, without evidence of substantial rehabilitation;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(7)&#x2003;Knowing and willful engagement in acts or activities designed to overthrow the U.S. Government by force;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(8)&#x2003;Any statutory or regulatory bar which prevents the lawful employment of the person involved in the position in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency denied the appellant an appointment to the position for which it tentatively selected him, not for any of the reasons set forth above, but because a Board administrative judge found that the appellant provided certain testimony regarding his prior employment with the Department of Justice that was not as credible as the testimony of other witnesses. Under the maxim of statutory interpretation <span class="Italic">expressio unius est exclusio alterius</span>, the mention of one thing in a statute implies the exclusion of another thing not so mentioned. <span class="Italic">See King v. Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d 1384, 1388 (Fed. Cir. 1996), <span class="Italic">distinguished in Stewart v. Department of Defense</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 649 (1999); <span class="Italic">Hamlett v. Department of Justice</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 674 &#x00B6; 9 (2002); <span class="Italic">Lomax v. Department of Defense</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 585 &#x00B6; 9 (2001); <span class="Italic">see also Andrus v. Glover Construction Co.</span>, 446 U.S. 608, 616-17 (1980). The same principle may be applied to the regulation at issue here, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(a) and (b). <span class="Italic">See Villante v. Department of the Navy</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 542, 545, n.4 (1987). That regulation expressly provides that an "agency to which OPM has delegated authority, <span class="Italic">shall</span> make its determination on the basis of the specific factors in paragraph (b) of this section." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(a) (emphasis supplied). Lack of credibility in prior testimony is not listed among the specific factors for making a suitability determination cited in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;An administrative judge's finding of lack of credibility is not tantamount to a finding of "dishonest conduct" within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b). "Credibility" is defined as "[t]he quality that makes something (as a witness or some evidence) worthy of belief." Black's Law Dictionary 374 (7th ed. 1999). "It is not exclusively synonymous with veracity, but it encompasses conviction, a lack of uncertainty, and has such weight as to the truth of the fact to leave little room for doubt." Barron's Law Dictionary 111 (3d ed. 1991) (citations omitted). "Dishonest," on the other hand, means "characterized by lack of truth, honesty, or trustworthiness: unfair, deceptive." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 332 (10th ed. 2002). The administrative judge in question did not find that the appellant's testimony was perjurious. Rather, he found that, in certain respects, the appellant's testimony lacked credibility in light of other evidence. Furthermore, at the time he testified, the appellant was no longer an agency employee and the agency did not allege that he was performing official duty pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.4 while he was testifying. Therefore, even if the appellant's testimony might be viewed as some type of misconduct due to the fact that the administrative judge who considered such testimony determined that it was not credible, the agency has not argued, nor established, that the appellant's testimony qualifies as misconduct or negligence in employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency made a constructive suitability determination by denying the appellant an appointment based on conduct that purportedly impacted the integrity and efficiency of the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.201. However, the negative suitability determination cannot be sustained because it was not based upon one of the exclusive factors specified in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b). Accordingly, the agency must cancel the constructive suitability determination and return the appellant to all appropriate open eligibility lists. If the agency does not return the appellant to the eligibility lists to which he believes he is entitled to be returned, he may <span id="Page_781"></span>file a petition for enforcement with the New York Field Office as described below.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On review in the Federal Circuit, <span class="Italic">Prehoda v. DHS,</span> 157 Fed. Appx. 311, 313-14 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), the court concluded that the Board need not, when it directs cancelation of a negative suitability determination, order immediate placement, front pay, or other damages for or to the applicant.</p>
