<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-264"><span class="space">b.</span> Bad Faith; Arbitrary Conduct; Distribution of Settlement Proceeds; Seniority Adjustments; Agency Liability</h5>
<p class="noindent">One decision distinguishing negligence from bad faith, albeit in a conclusory fashion, is <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1857 and Neill</span>, 28 FLRA 677, 689-90 (1987) (ALJ Decision). The charging party was a meatcutter who became a work leader. The union filed a grievance requesting pay for the time spent by meatcutters who were required to don safety clothing before the start of the working day. While the grievance was being settled, on a basis favorable to the employees, management's counsel suggested that the name of the charging party be added to the group of grievants eligible for back pay under the settlement; the charging party seemed to be entitled to the benefits of the grievance. The union representative insisted that the charging party be deleted from the list. During the ULP hearing, union witnesses testified they believed that the charging party was treated differently because he allegedly had not used safety clothing or had not changed into that clothing during his own time, and because the grievance did not cover employees at his grade. The charging party's testimony was credited and the ALJ determined that the charging party wore protective clothing and changed into it in the same manner as the other employees covered by the grievance. It was also determined that the union had not interviewed the charging party. Although he was in the unit, it seemed he provided information that could lead to discipline of the employees within his group. The charging party was responsible for having some of the other employees placed on AWOL. He was also said to have made some ethnic remarks. The union's defense appeared to be that its conduct was no more than negligent. FLRA's ALJ found otherwise, and the union was ordered to make the charging party whole if management would not agree to include him in the grievance settlement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...I find that the Union's action in having Mr. Neill's name deleted from the list of unit employees eligible for overtime payment breached the duty of fair representation....&#8197;In reaching this conclusion I rely particularly on the fact that the Union was aware, at the time it decided to rely on information submitted by Mr. Neill's co-workers relative to his eligibility for overtime, that such co-workers bore animosity to Mr. Neill predicated on the fact that they believed that he had made ethnic remarks and participated in activity which resulted in a number of such co-workers being charged AWOL. Having notice of such animosity, the Union nevertheless opted to rely on such information, and without more, insisted that Mr. Neill's name be deleted from the list of eligibles to his, Mr. Neill's, detriment. Being aware of the animosity existing between Mr. Neill and his fellow employees, I find that Respondent should have checked with Mr. Neill for his position on the matter. This is particularly true when the Union, which attempts to justify its position on the ground that the grievance was only applicable to WG-8 Meatcutters, knew or should have known, that during part of the pertinent period in question Mr. Neill had served as a WG-8 Meatcutter. Finally, one knowledgeable in labor relations must be highly suspicious of a Union's motive when it gratuitously removes a unit employee who is also a union member from eligibility for monetary payments to be borne solely by management.</p>
<p class="noindent">An unusual case, <span class="Italic">Air Force, Loring AFB, Limestone and AFGE Local 2943</span>, 43 FLRA 1087, 1093-1102 (1992), concluded that both membership considerations and arbitrary conduct justified a finding of a breach of the DFR as well as joint liability on the part of the union and management resulting from the manner that a settlement was reached, and settlement proceeds determined and distributed, through a grievance obtaining retroactive environmental differential pay for a group of employees. FLRA explained as to the distribution of settlement proceeds, determined to unjustifiably favor some union officials and to arbitrarily discriminate among the recipients:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A labor organization which has been accorded exclusive recognition is the exclusive representative of the employees in the unit it represents and is entitled to act for, and negotiate collective bargaining agreements covering, all employees in the unit. An exclusive representative is responsible for representing the interests of all employees in the unit it represents without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By this provision, "Congress adopted for government employee unions the private sector duty of fair representation." <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 800 F.2d 1165, 1171 (D.C. Cir. 1986). Consistent with the plain wording of section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute, and the scope of the duty of fair representation in the private sector, union representational activities grounded in the union's status as exclusive representative must be undertaken without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where it is alleged that a union failed to comply with section 7114(a)(1) by discriminating on the basis of membership in the union, the Authority first determines whether the union's disputed activities were undertaken in the union's role as exclusive representative of unit employees....&#8197;If the activities were undertaken in that role, then the duty of fair representation under section 7114(a)(1) "attache[s]" and the Authority determines whether the union unlawfully discriminated on the basis of union membership....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where union membership is not a factor, the standard for determining whether a union has violated section 7114(a)(1) is whether the union "deliberately and unjustifiably treated one or more bargaining unit employees differently from other employees in the unit." <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1453</span>, 23 FLRA 686, 691 (1986) (<span class="Italic">NFFE</span>). That is, the union "must have acted arbitrarily or in bad faith, and the action must have resulted in disparate or discriminatory treatment of a bargaining unit employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It is clear, in this regard, that the union's actions "must amount to more than mere negligence or ineptitude[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted previously, the Judge concluded that the EDP payments to Union President Labbe, Vice-President R. Gagnon, and Chaplain Keaton were based on their status as Union officers and, by its actions in connection with those payments, the Union failed to represent all unit employees without regard to membership or status in the Union. We agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to Union President Labbe and Vice-President R. Gagnon, the record supports the Judge's undisputed finding that they "took advantage of their offices...." Moreover, Vice-President Gagnon formulated the second, final list despite his belief that his and Labbe's payments were improper....&#8197;In fact, based on these payments, Gagnon was "shocked" when the Agency accepted the second list...and after the list was accepted, Gagnon tried to shield the list from disclosure to unit employees....&#8197;Accordingly, we reject the Union's argument that its actions in this regard constituted only "simple negligence."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, we reject the Union's argument that the Judge erred because there is no record evidence attributing Union Chaplain Keaton's payment to his Union office. Instead, we agree with the Judge that a "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case exists for finding that Keaton's office explains, in the absence of any other apparent reason, the decision to compensate him for exposure he never even claimed to have experienced." We note, in this regard, Vice-President Gagnon's concession that Keaton "was not entitled to anything[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1533"></span>The Judge's findings with respect to Labbe, R. Gagnon, and Keaton, based on record evidence, support the Judge's conclusion that the Union failed to comply with section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute by discriminating in the payment of EDP on the basis of membership and status in the Union and, thereby, violated section 7116(b)(1), (2), and (8) of the Statute. In this regard, there is no support for the Union's argument that, as the Activity distributed the EDP payments and could otherwise have influenced the formulation of the list of payouts, the Activity alone should be found to have violated the Statute. Instead, the record is clear that the parties agreed that the $125,000 settlement was to be "divided by the [U]nion...." Vice-President Gagnon acknowledged, in this connection, that "the list [the Union] came up with and gave to management was [the Union's] responsibility."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, we reject the Union's argument that it did not violate the Statute because it reasonably relied on the Activity to ensure that the EDP payments were lawful. As noted previously, the Union agreed to assume, and in fact assumed, the responsibility to divide the settlement. Also as noted previously, the division, at least with respect to Labbe, Gagnon, and Keaton, was made despite Vice-President Gagnon's belief that the payments to these individuals were improper. Although Vice-President Gagnon testified that he "really believed that if there was anything wrong with that list, management would look it over and they would kick it back,"...he testified also that he was "hoping" that the Activity would reject the list, <span class="Italic">id</span>....and was "shocked" when the list was accepted....&#8197;In these circumstances, the Union's argument that the Activity alone should be held responsible for the violation of the Statute is meritless.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find, contrary to the Judge, that the Union violated section 7116(b)(1), (2) and (8) of the Statute by violating its duty of fair representation in a manner unconnected to considerations of union membership or status....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, when union membership is not a factor, a union violates its duty of fair representation if the union acts "arbitrarily or in bad faith" and the action results in "disparate or discriminatory treatment of a bargaining unit employee." <span class="Italic">NFFE</span>, 23 FLRA at 691. Applying this standard to the facts and circumstances of this case, we find that the Union violated the Statute. We note two things.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, as is evident from the Appendix, there are substantial discrepancies between the amounts of EDP paid to various unit employees, pursuant to the Union's second list, and the number of allowable hours of exposure of those employees. For example, although five unit employees (Chasse, R. Clair, Dahlgren, Koch, and R. Mulherin) were each credited with approximately 3,500 allowable hours of exposure to asbestos, the EDP payments to these employees ranged from $300 to $3,500. Similarly, although two unit employees were each credited with approximately 2,500 allowable hours of exposure, one employee (H. Boucher) received $4,000 more than the other (Ala). Two other employees both received $5,300 even though one employee (Canning) had 3,792 more allowable hours of exposure that the other (H. Boucher).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the discrepancies are unexplained. We note, in this regard, that the record is devoid of any explanation of the basis or bases on which the first list was prepared. President Labbe, who prepared the first list, did not testify at the unfair labor practice hearing. Moreover, although Vice-President Gagnon speculated that Labbe developed the list "not using the questionnaires or the audit" but, instead, Labbe used "his own judgment and his own discretion[,]." Vice-President Gagnon testified also that he did "not know" the bases on which the first list was developed....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that the first list formed the basis for the second, final list. In fact, Vice-President Gagnon testified that he simply "recopied some of the first list to "come up with some money for the supervisors."...&#8197;Vice-President Gagnon provided no reasons for the changes he made in the second list, however....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrary conduct on the part of a union can violate the duty of fair representation.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Air Line Pilots Association, International v. O'Neill</span>, 111 S. Ct. 1127, 1130 (1991) ("a union breaches its duty of fair representation if its actions are either 'arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith'")...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, "a union's actions are arbitrary only if, in light of the factual and legal landscape at the time of the union's actions, the union's behavior is so far outside a 'wide range of reasonableness,'...as to be irrational." <span class="Italic">ALPA v. O'Neill</span>, 111 S. Ct. at 1130 (quoting <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co. v. Huffman</span>, 345 U.S. 330, 338 (1953)). We note, in this regard, that unexplained conduct can constitute arbitrary conduct that violates the duty:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[I]f a duty to avoid arbitrary conduct...means anything, it must mean at least that there be a reason for action taken. Sometimes the reason will be apparent, sometimes not. When it is not the circumstances may be such that we will have no choice but to deem the conduct arbitrary if the union does not tell us what it is.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Local 315</span>, 217 NLRB at 618....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the Union's actions are "so far outside a 'wide range of reasonableness,'...as to be irrational." <span class="Italic">ALPA v. O'Neill</span>, 111 S. Ct. at 1130. Put simply, the record before us demonstrates that, apart from the EDP distributions to the three Union officers discussed previously, the disputed EDP was divided by the Union among employees based on unexplained and concededly arbitrary changes to an already unexplained list, resulting in disparate and discriminatory treatment of unit employees. These actions, in our view, amounted to more than mere negligence or ineptitude and constituted a breach of the Union's duty of fair representation under section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute, in violation of section 7116(b)(1), (2), and (8).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Judge, for the reasons stated by the Judge, that Respondent Activity violated section 7116(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute by its actions in connection with the distribution of EDP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject as misplaced the Activity's arguments that it should not be found to have violated the Statute because it could have paid the settlement as a lump sum to the Union. The Activity did not pay, or seek to pay, the settlement directly to the Union. We likewise reject as misplaced the Activity's argument that it did not violate the Statute because its representative who negotiated the settlement with the Union did not "have the authority to make decisions relating to the disbursement of [G]overnment funds[&#8197;]" and could not delegate such authority to the Union....&#8197;The Union did not disburse Government funds and there is no contention that the Union was delegated authority to do so. Finally, we reject the Activity's argument that the Union should be held solely responsible for the EDP distribution because it had no authority to interfere with the Union's proposed distribution. At the time it executed the final agreement and disbursed the EDP, the Activity already had rejected one proposed distribution. Moreover, the Activity was aware that the final distribution might be unlawful. In fact, in reviewing the second list, Activity officials specifically discussed and questioned, among themselves, Union President Labbe's and Vice-President Gagnon's shares and "suspected an impropriety at that time." Moreover, the Activity's representative acknowledged that, with respect to individuals who had no allowable asbestos exposure, "there was no lawful basis to pay them a penny[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 63. No authority is cited, and none is apparent, for finding that the Activity did not violate the Statute in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Remedy</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge's recommended order provides that the Respondents are "jointly and severally liable for making whole those [employees] whose shares were reduced in order to unlawfully compensate Labbe, Gagnon and Keaton."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree that the Respondents are jointly and severally liable for making affected employees whole.&#x2003;We note, in this regard, that no basis is argued or apparent for finding one Respondent primarily and the other secondarily liable....&#8197;Moreover, as both Respondents knew, or should have known, that their actions were unlawful, joint and several liability is appropriate....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the Judge, however, that the make-whole remedy should be limited to those employees who were affected by the unlawful payments to Union President Labbe, Vice-President R. Gagnon, and Chaplain Keaton. As discussed previously, the remainder of the EDP distribution was unexplained and arbitrary. In these circumstances, we conclude that the entire distribution must be recalculated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we will direct the Respondents to recalculate the EDP distribution and make employees whole. In so doing, we reject the Activity's argument that the Judge "erred in failing to establish the amount of liability and in failing to allocate liability between the [p]arties." With respect to the latter assertion, the Judge, and the Authority, have specified joint and several liability. Accordingly, liability has been allocated between the parties. With respect to the former assertion, there is no support for the argument that it is necessary in these proceedings to determine amounts of backpay due individual employees. Instead, in agreement with the Judge, we conclude that these matters may appropriately be resolved in compliance proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3354 and Lang</span>, 58 FLRA 184, 189-90 (2002), decided that the union violated the DFR through administration of a settlement of a grievance claiming FLSA overtime benefits for unit employees. The settlement created a fund of $75,000, although the union recognized that the fund would likely be insufficient to cover all the claims of unit members. The fund was to be distributed to employees who filed applications with union representatives on a first-come, first-served basis. The union violated its DFR by giving preference to union members in the administration of the claims process. FLRA directed the union to provide financial restitution to the nonunion unit members who were discriminated against by the union in the processing of the claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, the complaint alleges that the Respondent violated its duty of fair representation in two ways: (1) by acting in an arbitrary, discriminatory, or bad faith manner in implementing the settlement <span id="page_1534"></span>agreement, resulting in the disparate treatment of unit employees; and (2) by discriminating against unit employees, based on considerations of Union membership, in implementing the settlement agreement. We address the second allegation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where it is alleged that a union violated its duty of fair representation by discriminating on the basis of membership in the union, the Authority first determines whether the union's disputed activities were undertaken in its role as exclusive representative. If so, the duty of fair representation attaches, and the Authority determines whether the union discriminated on the basis of union membership<span class="Italic">. NATCA</span>, 55 FLRA at 604.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the GC alleges that a union violated its duty of fair representation by discriminating on the basis of membership in the union, and the union contends that its actions were taken for legitimate motives, the Authority applies the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny </span>framework<span class="Italic">. AFGE Local 1345, Ft. Carson, CO (In Trusteeship) and AFGE, AFL-CIO</span>, 53 FLRA 1789, 1793-95 (1998). If the GC establishes that an employee was engaged in protected activity and that the activity was a motivating factor in the union's treatment of the employee, the GC has made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of improper discrimination. Once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established, the respondent may seek to establish an affirmative defense by showing that there was a legitimate justification for its action and that it would have acted in the same way even in the absence of the protected activity<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1793.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The GC Established A <span class="Italic">Prima Facie</span> Case Of Discrimination Based On Union Membership</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found, and it is undisputed, that the Union's participation in arrangements for implementing the settlement agreement was undertaken in its role as exclusive representative. Therefore, the Union's duty of fair representation attaches. We next examine whether the Union discriminated on the basis of union membership against unit employees who were not members of the Union. Such employees were engaged in the protected activity of refraining from joining or assisting a labor organization, as provided in &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute. The Judge found it unnecessary to determine whether the GC established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that all of the Union members who submitted claims were paid, and that all of the employees who submitted claims but were not paid were nonmembers. Similarly, there is no dispute that 8 employees who joined the Union at about the time that their claims were submitted were also paid. In addition, 6 other Union members who also served as Union representatives were paid, despite the fact that other employees, including non-members, were in line to submit their claims before these Union representatives. This evidence is sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on protected activity; that is, based on the employees' exercise of their right to refrain from joining or assisting a labor organization as provided in &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's assertion that since several employees who were not Union members were among the unit employees who were paid, there was no <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. This does not alter the fact that all of the Union members who submitted claims were paid, and all of the employees who submitted claims but were not paid were not Union members. Similarly, the Union's argument that it attempted to have the $75,000 ceiling raised does not change the fact that given the limit that the Union agreed to and was unsuccessful in changing, all Union members who filed claims were paid, while all of those who were not paid were nonmembers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we conclude that the GC established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Union discriminated on the basis of Union membership.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Union Has Failed To Establish An Affirmative Defense</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to refute the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the Union must demonstrate that there was a legitimate reason for its action and that it would have acted in the same way absent the protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, in connection with the allegation that the Union discriminated on the basis of Union membership, the Judge applied the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> test to determine whether the Union had established an affirmative defense, assuming, without finding, that the GC had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of a violation. He concluded that the Union had established an affirmative defense by demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that it had a legitimate basis for its disparate treatment of Union members and nonmembers, and concluded that Union membership played no part in any deviations from the first come, first served principle. He noted that although the numbers were "suspicious," 10 nonmembers were among those whose claims were paid.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge rejected the GC's arguments that the Union made hostile remarks to nonmembers about their nonunion status; that the Union's August memorandum demonstrated hostility to nonmembers; and that the failure to honor the first-come, first-served principle was not done in good faith.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC contests the Judge's finding that the Union established an affirmative defense. In support, the GC argues that the Union deviated from its first-come, first-served principle so as to benefit 12 Union members, and no nonmembers. The Union acknowledges that it did not follow its first-come, first-served policy in all instances, but asserts that it had a legitimate reason for each of its actions. We now examine the reasons asserted by the Union for its actions, as found not to be discriminatory by the Judge, and the GC's contentions that the favoritism of Union members is evidence of discrimination against nonmembers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union allowed 3 employees who were Union members to file their claims before the opening time stated in the memo.&#x2003;It allowed these employees to file early because they were on the night shift.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Six Union members who were asked by the Union to assist in collecting the claims information were given priority over other employees, including non-members, who were in line at the designated time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Three additional Union members (Buffington, Harris, and Milton) were given special treatment by being put on the list before actually filing their claims. The Union accepted Buffington's claim late when she said she was sick and asked to bring her documentation the next day. The Union permitted Harris to bring in her information the next day when she said she left her documentation home. Finally, the Union gave Milton extra time because she had not received the notice of filing. We note that Harris and Milton joined the Union on February 18. There is no indication that the Union granted similar consideration to nonmembers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, other unit employees, who were not Union members, arrived early but were not allowed to file until later, depriving them of being high enough on the list to be among those whose claims were paid. In this regard, 4 employees who were not Union members (Cline, Hodgson, Lang, and Unfried) arrived shortly before 9:00 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> on February 19 at the 1520 Market Street office. They were told that the Union was not ready to receive their information and were asked to leave their names and telephone numbers. Lang testified that while she was waiting for Cline to provide his name and telephone number, 15 to 20 employees formed a line. These employees were not told, unlike Cline and the other individuals mentioned, to come back later. Some of those identified were Union members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other Union conduct demonstrates that it treated nonmembers differently in unexplained ways.&#x2003;When Sloan was asked to complete the survey when the Union finally did take her claim, she was asked if she would like to consider joining the Union, to which she answered, "No." Nonmember Ivanovich was required to fill out the survey before her claim would be considered. However, not all Union members were required to fill out a survey in order to have their claims considered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the record as a whole demonstrates that the Union has not met its burden under <span class="Italic">Letterkenny </span>of establishing that it had legitimate reasons for disregarding the first-come, first-served principle to the benefit of 12 Union members and disadvantage of nonmembers for whom the Union did not take similar action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to arguing that the Union discriminated by the above specific acts of favoring its members, the GC also contends that the Union's method of compiling its list generally was inconsistent with the first-come, first-served principle. The Union acknowledged that it did not keep track of the specific times at which employees submitted claims at each location, but stated that it kept track of the order in which claims were submitted. The Union compiled the master list by inserting 2 or 3 employees from 1520 Market Street on the list for each employee from 4300 Goodfellow Street or 2350 Market Street, without regard to which claims were filed first. However, the claim of at least one nonmember (Sloan) was not paid, even though she had submitted her claim before a particular member, whose claim was honored. Sloan signed her name after another nonmember (Senter) whose claim was not paid. This indicates that both of these nonmember employees would have been high enough on the list to be paid, based on the Judge's fording that it appeared "likely" that they submitted their documentation before the Union member.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note the GC's argument that further evidence of the Union's discriminatory motive is that the Union "was openly hostile toward non-members." The GC notes, in this regard, the Union's August memorandum. The memo stated that Union members did not want to do all the work for the benefit of nonmembers, and that if more unit employees became Union members, they would "be able to have full knowledge, voice, and vote on issues affecting their working conditions, such as whether to accept a settlement with a cap, or to go to arbitration." The memo also stated that "many union members...contacted the union--in advance of the general letter to bargaining unit employees, to make arrangements to have their claims processed at the top of the list. These requests were accommodated." Finally, the memo explained that the Union did its best to be fair to everyone in compiling the list <span class="Italic">seriatim</span>, but stated that "[i]n some cases, this differed, but only slightly, from the order in which people lined up."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These statements indicate that Union membership would confer the benefit of "full knowledge" concerning matters that the Union is obligated to inform all unit members about, quoting Union memorandum, and that <span id="page_1535"></span>members were given favored treatment in filing claims when requested. This supports a conclusion that the Union violated the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the foregoing, we are not persuaded that the Union has established a legitimate justification for the difference in its treatment of employees who were Union members and those who were not. In sum, we conclude that the Union has not established an affirmative defense to the GC's showing of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Union discriminated in the administration of the settlement agreement on the basis of Union membership.</p>
<p class="noindent">The DFR was breached by a union that controlled seniority determinations of unit members and acted to set seniority so as to retroactively deny seniority accrual to unit members who became supervisors and returned to the unit. The union offered no reason for the change in seniority policy other than to punish individuals who fell into disfavor by holding supervisory jobs and leaving the unit. The union was required to restore seniority retroactively. The employer, FAA, was not guilty of a statutory violation, because it was not aware of the union's improper purpose. Seniority adjustments were left for compliance proceedings, <span class="Italic">NATCA and Santa Cruz</span>, 66 FLRA 467, 467-68, 472-76 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When NATCA and the FAA failed to reach a new collective-bargaining agreement, the FAA cited 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(a)(2) and imposed new work rules on bargaining-unit employees.[3] This action "infuriated NATCA."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(a)(2) provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">If the Administrator [of the FAA] does not reach an agreement...with [an] exclusive bargaining representative[&#8197;]...[and] the services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service do not lead to an agreement, the Administrator's proposed change to the [FAA's] personnel management system shall...take effect...[sixty] days...after the Administrator has transmitted the proposed change...to Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Like the parties' prior collective-bargaining agreements, the new work rules continued to grant NATCA the authority to determine the method for calculating bargaining-unit employees' seniority. <span class="Italic">See also NATCA, MEBA/AFL-CIO</span>, 55 FLRA 601, 601 (1999). Seniority, in turn, affected employees': (1) annual leave selections, <span class="Italic">see </span>"Contract between [NATCA] and the [FAA]" (June 5, 2006) at 59 (Art. 24, &#x00A7; 8); (2) holiday-duty assignments, <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 70 (Art. 28, &#x00A7; 7); (3) watch schedules and shift assignments, <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 75 (Art. 32, &#x00A7; 2); (4) temporary assignments, <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 96 (Art. 44, &#x00A7; 1); (5) reassignments or retraining, <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 98 (Art. 46, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4-5); and (6) overtime-work opportunities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the time that the FAA imposed the new work rules, NATCA's national constitution provided, as relevant here, that employees' "[c]umulative NATCA" seniority would be "derived by totaling all [of the employee's] time...spent in [any]...NATCA bargaining units." Under this policy, an employee who left a NATCA bargaining-unit position and later returned to such a position would receive "[c]umulative" seniority credit for all of her or his prior service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More than two years after the new work rules took effect, delegates to NATCA's national convention voted to amend their constitution. The amendment provided that any employee who left a NATCA bargaining-unit position and thereafter worked for the FAA in "a supervisor/management job" would lose all previously acquired NATCA bargaining-unit seniority, and his or her "cumulative seniority date" would be reset to the day on which he or she returned to the unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NATCA applied this amendment retroactively to the date on which the new work rules took effect.&#x2003;As a result, all former NATCA bargaining-unit employees who had worked for any length of time in an FAA "supervisor/management job" following the imposition of the new work rules--including those who were reassigned or temporarily promoted by the FAA--lost their previously acquired NATCA seniority, even if they had already returned to the unit before the amendment was adopted.<span class="Italic"> </span>The FAA then recalculated unit employees' seniority "[c]onsistent with NATCA's guidance" on the amendment's intended operation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nine parties filed ULP charges against NATCA, and one party filed a charge against the FAA. The GC issued a consolidated complaint against NATCA and a separate complaint against the FAA, both of which were consolidated before the Judge. The GC, NATCA, and the FAA each filed with the Judge a motion or cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">VI.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;NATCA violated &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) and &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1) and (8) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute provides that "[a]n exclusive representative is responsible for representing...all employees in the unit it represents without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1). This provision incorporates in federal labor relations the duty of fair representation recognized for unions in the private sector. <span class="Italic">See NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 800 F.2d at 1171; <span class="Italic">accord, e.g., AFGE, Local 1857, AFL-CIO</span>, 46 FLRA 904, 910 (1992). Under the duty of fair representation, unions are required to "serve the interests of all members [of a bargaining unit] without hostility or discrimination toward any, to exercise discretion with complete good faith and honesty, and to avoid arbitrary conduct." <span class="Italic">NATCA, MEBA/AFL-CIO</span>, 55 FLRA at 604 (quoting <span class="Italic">O'Neill</span>, 499 U.S. at 76 (quoting <span class="Italic">Vaca v.

"[W]hen a union uses a power which it alone can wield, it must do so for the benefit of <span class="Italic">all </span>employees within its bargaining unit." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(quoting <span class="Italic">AFGE v.

<p class="noindent-1">NATCA argues that its amendment to the seniority policy was not so far outside a "wide range of reasonableness" that it would constitute "arbitrary" conduct in violation of the duty of fair representation. However, as mentioned above, the Supreme Court has held that a union may breach its duty of fair representation by acting arbitrarily, <span class="Italic">or </span>discriminatorily, <span class="Italic">or </span>in bad faith. <span class="Italic">See O'Neill</span>, 499 U.S. at 75 (Court has "repeatedly identified three components of the duty" of fair representation); <span class="Italic">Vaca v. Sipes</span>, 386 U.S. at 190-91; <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. Air Line Pilots Ass'n, Int'l</span>, 604 F.3d 703, 709-10 (2d Cir. 2010). The "wide range of reasonableness" standard applies <span class="Italic">only </span>to allegations that a union violated its duty of fair representation by acting arbitrarily--not to allegations that a union violated its duty by acting discriminatorily or in bad faith. <span class="Italic">See O'Neill</span>, 499 U.S. at 67, 76-78; <span class="Italic">accord AFGE, Local 3354, AFL-CIO</span>, 58 FLRA 184, 201-02 (2002) (citing <span class="Italic">Marquez v.

Unlike the "wide range of reasonableness" standard for allegedly arbitrary conduct--which involves an objective inquiry--determining whether a union acted discriminatorily or in bad faith requires a subjective inquiry into motives. <span class="Italic">See Simo v.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has recognized that when "personal animosity" causes a union to "deliberately and unjustifiably treat[&#8197;]" some bargaining-unit members "differently from other unit employees," that animosity evidences bad faith that violates the duty of fair representation. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3615, AFL-CIO</span>, 53 FLRA 1374, 1388 (1998); <span class="Italic">see AFSCME, Local 2477</span>, 22 FLRA 739, 753-54 (1986) (disadvantaging bargaining-unit employee because of "resent[ment]" or "animosity" violates &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1)). Several courts have reached similar conclusions regarding the duty of fair representation under the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 151-188, and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 151-169. <span class="Italic">E.g., Ramey v.

Glover</span>, 503 F.2d 878, 885 (5th Cir. 1974) ("A legally cognizable breach...could stem from proof of [u]nion hostility towards the plaintiff class.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NATCA excepts to the Judge's finding that it amended the seniority policy and applied that amendment retroactively because it wanted to "punish" those employees who left the bargaining unit and worked in supervisory or managerial positions with the FAA. However, NATCA explicitly stated before the Judge that it changed the seniority policy to "discourage the actions of bargaining unit members who sided with, and joined the ranks of FAA management." In this regard, NATCA provides no reason to recognize a legally significant distinction between "discouraging" <span id="page_1536"></span>and "punishing" employees in the circumstances of this case, and &#x00A7; 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations precludes NATCA from changing, in its exceptions, the position it took before the Judge regarding its motives for amending the seniority policy and applying the amendment retroactively. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.5; <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, FCI Danbury, Danbury, Conn.</span>, 55 FLRA 201, 204-05 (1999) (<span class="Italic">FCI Danbury</span>). Moreover, NATCA's assertion that its actions were not designed to "punish" particular employees is belied by the Judge's finding--to which NATCA does not except--that for more than two years <span class="Italic">prior to </span>the amendment of the seniority policy, any "employee who worked as a part of management in any capacity...became the subject of [NATCA's] wrath, scorn, [and] spite." In this regard, such a lengthy period of ongoing NATCA hostility toward the same group of employees harmed by the amended seniority policy (i.e., employees who worked in a "supervisor/management job") supports the Judge's finding that NATCA amended its constitution to "punish" employees "vindictive[ly]." Consequently, we adopt the Judge's findings regarding NATCA's motives--specifically, that NATCA acted in bad faith when it "deliberately [and maliciously] changed its seniority policy...to punish bargaining[-]unit employees" whom NATCA saw as having "sided with, and joined the ranks of management." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;NATCA's bad-faith conduct establishes by itself that, under the standards of <span class="Italic">Vaca v. Sipes </span>and <span class="Italic">Local 1453</span>, NATCA violated &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) and &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1) and (8). Thus, we find it unnecessary to adopt the Judge's alternative reasoning for finding NATCA in violation the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for NATCA's assertion that it changed the seniority policy to encourage unit solidarity, the Judge found this explanation to be pretextual because NATCA stripped seniority from only certain employees who left the unit--specifically, those employees who took supervisory or managerial positions with the FAA. As the Judge explained, employees who left the unit to work for another agency or to work in the private sector did not lose their cumulative seniority for prior work in NATCA bargaining-unit positions. Further, the Judge found that retroactively applying the changed policy could not incentivize unit solidarity because employees would not have known, when they left the unit, that they would lose their seniority for doing so.<span class="Italic"> </span>NATCA's exceptions do not address, or identify any record evidence that undermines, these findings of pretext. As such, we adopt the Judge's finding that NATCA's assertion that it amended its seniority policy in order to promote unit solidarity is pretextual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we: (1) find that NATCA acted in bad faith by deliberately amending its seniority policy and applying the amendment retroactively in order to harm certain bargaining-unit employees to whom NATCA owed a duty of fair representation; and (2) deny NATCA's exceptions to the Judge's findings that its conduct violated &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) and &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1) and (8). In doing so, we emphasize that we do not question the discretion due to NATCA when dealing with seniority matters generally. However, in this case, NATCA breached the duty of fair representation required by &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) because of its bad-faith motives for amending the seniority policy and discriminatorily and retroactively applying that amendment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The FAA did not violate &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the GC, the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Loring</span>, 43 FLRA 1087, requires finding that the FAA violated the Statute. In <span class="Italic">Loring</span>, a union provided an agency with a list of employees entitled to receive a portion of an environmental-differential-pay settlement, and the agency at first rejected the list as inaccurate. 43 FLRA at 1089. When the union provided a revised list, agency "officials <span class="Italic">specifically discussed and questioned</span>...[the amounts distributed to union officials] and '<span class="Italic">suspected</span>...<span class="Italic">impropriety</span>,'" but they nevertheless distributed the settlement in accordance with the list. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1100 (emphasis added). Under those circumstances, the Authority found that the agency "knew, or should have known, that [its] actions were unlawful." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1101.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The circumstances of this case are distinguishable from those in <span class="Italic">Loring</span>. As the FAA correctly observes, "the record contains no testimony and no direct evidence...[of] the FAA's <span class="Italic">knowledge </span>of any...unlawful motivation[&#8197;]" behind NATCA's change to the seniority policy. Although the GC argues that the FAA "should have known," that NATCA's decision to retroactively apply the changed seniority policy was "obvious[ly]" unlawful, absent proof of arbitrariness, discrimination, or bad faith, unions may retroactively deprive employees of previously accrued seniority without breaching the duty of fair representation, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Hass v. Darigold Dairy Prods. Co.</span>, 751 F.2d 1096, 1099 (9th Cir. 1985) ("A union...may renegotiate seniority provisions...<span class="Italic">even though the resulting changes are essentially retroactive</span>." (emphasis added)).[12]. Although we have found that NATCA acted in bad faith, the GC did not establish that <span class="Italic">the FAA </span>knew or should have known that NATCA's actions constituted arbitrary, discriminatory, or bad-faith conduct in violation of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1). Thus, we reject the GC's argument that the Judge should have found the FAA in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8).</p>

NLRB</span>, 409 F.2d 395, 397-99 (7th Cir. 1969) (absent bad faith, entering into agreement that required the transfer of certain employees with a <span class="Italic">total loss of seniority </span>did not breach duty of fair representation); <span class="Italic">Int'l Longshoremen's &#x0026; Warehousemen's Union v. Kuntz</span>, 334 F.2d 165, 171 (9th Cir. 1964) (although contract amendment that stripped clerks of preferred seniority status operated "ex post facto," clerks had to show "bad faith motive [or] intent to hostilely discriminate" to obtain relief from amendment) (internal quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">Hardcastle v.

<p class="noindent-1">We do not mean to suggest that agencies act unlawfully <span class="Italic">merely </span>because they know or should know that an exclusive representative of their employees has acted unlawfully. In this regard, we note that private-sector precedent generally suggests that an employer does not act unlawfully unless it takes actions that amount to cooperation in a union's unlawful purpose. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Davenport v. Teamsters</span>, 166 F.3d 356, 362 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (noting requirement that "employer somehow acted improperly and infringed the rights of the individual aggrieved employees" (quoting <span class="Italic">Am. Postal Workers Union, Headquarters Local 6885 v. Am. Postal Workers Union</span>, 665 F.2d 1096, 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1981)). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Loring</span>, we found that the agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (2) not just because it "was aware" that a distribution of EDP funds might be unlawful but because the agency also controlled the distribution of the settlement funds, and therefore could be deemed to have cooperated in the union's unlawful purpose. 43 FLRA at 1100.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the complaint against the FAA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;We grant in part and deny in part the GC's exceptions to the Judge's recommended remedies, and we adopt the Judge's recommended dismissal of the allegations in Case No. SF-CO-09-0030.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC asserts first that relief for NATCA's ULP should be extended beyond those employees who were unit members when the seniority policy was amended and the amendment was applied retroactively.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NATCA's duty of fair representation extends only to those employees in the unit, and the duty attaches only when NATCA is acting as their exclusive representative. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Merk v. Jewel Companies, Inc.</span>, 848 F.2d 761, 766 (7th Cir. 1988) (because union does not have duty to represent former bargaining-unit employees <span class="Italic">at all</span>, it does not have a duty to represent them <span class="Italic">fairly</span>).[13] Consequently, at the time NATCA amended the seniority policy and decided to apply that amendment retroactively, NATCA did not owe a duty of fair representation to former members of the unit, and it did not owe an anticipatory duty of fair representation to future members of the unit. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Allen v. CSX Transp., Inc.</span>, 325 F.3d 768, 770-71, 772, 775 (6th Cir. 2003) (union for trainmen owed no duty to former trainmen who became engineers, even though engineers retained their trainmen seniority and could be furloughed back to trainmen positions).[14] The same principle regarding the absence of a duty to former unit members applies even in those cases--such as that of Charging Party Steven D.--where a unit employee accepts a supervisory position in reliance on the seniority rules that exist at that time. Employees working in supervisory positions are not unit members, and, thus, the union owes them no duty of fair representation when changing its seniority rules. <span class="Italic">See Cooper</span>, 651 F.2d at 250. Because the remedy sought in this case is for NATCA's breach of its duty of fair representation, and as NATCA owes a duty only to members of the unit it represents, we find that the only employees whose rights were violated--and the only employees entitled to relief--are those who both left and returned to the unit by the time NATCA amended the seniority policy and decided to apply that amendment retroactively, and we deny the GC's exception arguing otherwise. As Steven D.'s rights were not violated, we adopt the Judge's recommended dismissal of the allegations in Case No. SF-CO-09-0030.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The GC contends further that the Judge erred by recommending against relief for employees like Charging Party Jim H.&#x2003;The Judge found no remedy appropriate for such employees because they worked in supervisory positions <span class="Italic">after </span>the policy was amended and thereby knowingly forfeited their NATCA seniority, including any seniority that might have been restored as relief for the improper retroactive application of the amended policy. The Judge's decision to exclude these employees from the scope of recommended relief is consistent with the GC's position before the Judge that the GC did "not challenge or question [NATCA's] ability" to apply the amended policy prospectively. To the extent that the GC is attempting to change that position in its exceptions, as stated earlier, the Authority's Regulations preclude the GC from doing so. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.5; <span class="Italic">FCI Danbury</span>, 55 FLRA at 204-05. Therefore, we deny the GC's exception contending that relief should be afforded to those employees who lost seniority as a result of the prospective application of the amended seniority policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC also argues that the Judge erred by limiting his recommended remedies to named charging parties, rather than providing relief to all bargaining-unit employees affected by NATCA's ULP. The GC requests that the Authority order compliance proceedings to determine employees' individual entitlements to relief. The FAA argues that the Authority should deny the GC's request for compliance proceedings because such proceedings are appropriate only when backpay is owed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge did not explain why he recommended limiting relief to named charging parties, and the Authority's case law does not support such a limitation. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv., L.A., Cal.</span>, 59 FLRA 387, 389 (2003) (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>) (ordering leave restoration for all employees adversely affected by ULP, despite that record did not identify any specific employees who lost leave); <span class="Italic">cf. Dep't of Def. Dependents Schs.</span>, 54 FLRA 259, 270 (1998) (rejecting judge's recommended denial of relief to two affected employees, since they were "entitled to be placed in the positions they would have been in had the [ULP] not occurred"). In this regard, the Authority has ordered relief for all individuals adversely affected by a ULP even when the original ULP charge named only a single such individual. <span class="Italic">See Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, Cal.</span>, 33 FLRA 196, 204 (1988) (ordering agency to "[m]ake whole <span class="Italic">any </span>employee, <span class="Italic">including but not limited to </span>[the employee identified in the charge], for any charge to annual leave" resulting from ULP (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, because compliance proceedings are available to determine the specific remedial entitlements of affected employees, the Authority has rejected the argument that a remedy is inappropriate unless its contours can be precisely identified when resolving exceptions to a judge's decision. <span class="Italic">Loring</span>, 43 FLRA at 1101-02; <span class="Italic">accord DOJ</span>, 59 FLRA at 389 (ordering compliance proceedings to determine the specific leave-restoration entitlements of affected employees). For example, in <span class="Italic">Loring</span>, the Authority ordered that the "entire [settlement] distribution" be recalculated and found that any questions about implementing that remedy could be "appropriately...resolved in compliance proceedings." 43 FLRA at 1101-02.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the FAA's contention that the Authority's compliance proceedings are limited to cases involving backpay, it is not supported by Authority precedent. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Ralph H. Johnson Med. Ctr., Charleston, S.C.</span>, 60 FLRA 446, 446 (2004) (proceedings to implementing <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy regarding parking); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Ill.</span>, 51 FLRA 675, 694 (1995) (proceedings to determine scope of agency's obligation to provide documentation to union); <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, Cal.</span>, 47 FLRA 454, 457 (1993) (proceedings to determine which vending machines were affected by order to lower price of soda purchased by bargaining-unit employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we grant this portion of the GC's exception to the Judge's recommended remedies and leave for compliance proceedings the determination of employees' individual entitlements to relief.[15]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15]&#x2003;We note that, for the reasons already discussed, the only employees entitled to relief are those who were in the unit when NATCA amended its constitution and who lost their seniority solely as the result of the <span class="Italic">retroactive </span>application of that amendment.</p>
