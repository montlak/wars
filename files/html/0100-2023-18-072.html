<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fryer v. Dept. of Energy,</span> DC-0752-10-0364-I-1 (NP 9/16/2011), summarized the law concerning the adequacy of agency efforts to serve the appellant with notice of a proposed adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that she did not receive a notice of proposed action. However, the agency's notification does not have to be actually received by the employee; rather, the agency's attempts to notify the appellant must be diligent and reasonable under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Lavelle v. Department of Transportation</span>, 17 M.S.P.R. 8, 15 (1983), <span class="Italic">modified by</span> <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 672 (1991); <span class="Italic">Cephas v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 27 M.S.P.R. 69, 72, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 785 F.2d 321 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table); <span class="Italic">Pangarova v. Department of the Army,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. 319, 325 (1989). An appellant cannot create a procedural error by intentionally avoiding delivery of a notice. <span class="Italic">Pangarova</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 325. In this case, the agency sent the notice of proposed action by regular mail, certified mail, and email. The administrative judge correctly concluded that under the circumstances, this attempt at notification was reasonable and diligent and no procedural error occurred.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A removal will not be set aside for failure of the agency to provide the appellant with a copy of the notice of proposed removal if the employee is incarcerated, the notice was sent to his home and received by his relatives, the employee was told by the agency to contact his attorney in a criminal case if there were questions about his leave status, and the agency provided the attorney a copy of the proposal. The agency took "intelligent and diligent" steps to serve the notice, avoiding error. <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 16 MSPR 408, 411 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Stockton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 11 MSPR 440, 442 (1982) (notice was mailed to the appellant's home; the appellant was absent from his house for a time and should have notified the agency of his whereabouts or made arrangements to have his mail checked; once the appellant learned of the notice, effective attempts were not made to secure an extension of the reply period). Although a proposal notice is delivered to someone, e.g., an estranged wife, who throws the notice away instead of forwarding it to the employee, if the agency has made intelligent and diligent efforts to serve the employee and if the employee and his lawyer have actual notice of the proposed action and have been allowed an opportunity to respond at a predisciplinary interview, no harmful error occurs. <span class="Italic">Benjamin v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3261).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wright</span> was distinguished in <span class="Italic">Cabarloc v. VA</span>, 110 MSPR 695, 699-700 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11, 2009 MSPB 52 (2009), involving another appellant who, while in jail, missed receipt of the adverse action decision notice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Wright v. Department of the Navy</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 408, 410-11 (1983), the appellant claimed that his agency failed to properly insure that he received the proposed removal notice while he was jail. The agency in <span class="Italic">Wright</span> knew the appellant was in jail when it sent the letters to his home address. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 410. In addition, the administrative judge found that Wright did not personally receive the proposal letter or the removal decision letter before his release from jail. However, the Board found that the agency in <span class="Italic">Wright</span> took "intelligent and diligent" steps to serve the appellant based upon evidence that a relative of the appellant received copies of the proposed removal and the removal decision notices by certified mail at the appellant's home address, and that the agency sent a copy of the proposal letter to his criminal lawyer. <span class="Italic">Wright</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. at 410-11. Unlike the agency in the instant case, the agency in <span class="Italic">Wright</span> attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to serve Wright with the proposal notice at the jail after he was transferred to a prison camp, and provided proof that his relative actually received both the proposal letter and the removal decision letter sent to his home.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's indication on his appeal form that he did not receive the removal decision letter until August 25, 2008, coupled with the circumstantial evidence of non-receipt--the appellant was in jail, he did not respond to the removal letter, previous mail sent to his home address was returned, and the agency did not produce evidence of delivery--are sufficient to overcome the standard presumption of receipt in the due course of the mail. Based on this evidence, we find that the appellant received the agency's final decision letter on August 25, 2008. Therefore, the filing deadline in this case was September 24, 2008, the 30th day after August 25, 2008. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.23<span class="Italic"></span> ("In computing the number of days allowed for filing a submission, the first day counted is the day after the event from which the time period begins to run."). The appellant hand delivered his petition for appeal to the Board's Western Regional Office on August 27, 2008. Because the evidence of record establishes that the appellant filed his appeal before the September 24, 2008 filing deadline, the appeal was timely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board expanded its analysis of notice rights in <span class="Italic">Givens v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 374, 377-79 (1991), adopting a minimal due process approach:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where a party's property interest is affected by state action, he is entitled to at least minimum due process.... Due process requires that those whose rights are to be affected are entitled to be heard, and so that they may enjoy that right, they must first be notified. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fuentes</span>, 407 U.S. at 80-81, 92 S. Ct. at 1994....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Competitive service employees who have completed their probationary <span id="Page_3217"></span>periods, and preference-eligible Postal Services employees with one year of current continuous service, have a constitutionally protected property interest in their employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(A) and (B); <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 1495, 84 L. Ed.2d 494 (1985); <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 680-81 (1991). Thus, before an agency may take an adverse action against a nonprobationary employee, due process requires--at a minimum--that the agency: (1) Afford the employee prior written notice of the charges against him; (2) explain the basis for its action; and (3) grant the employee an opportunity to present his side of the story.... The appellant's right to minimum due process is absolute, and does not depend upon the merits of his claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carey v. Piphus</span>, 435 U.S. 247, 266, 98 S. Ct. 1042, 1053, 55 L. Ed.2d 252 (1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard must be granted at a meaningful time, and in a meaningful manner. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 547, 105 S. Ct. at 1496. The agency must make diligent and intelligent efforts--such as might reasonably be adopted by one desirous of actually informing the employee--to provide such minimum due process prior to the effective date of its action.... These fundamental due process requirements operate not only to ensure that Federal employees receive abstract fair play, but also to protect the employee's enjoyment of his property interest from arbitrary encroachment, and to minimize substantively unfair or mistaken deprivations....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency's efforts to notify the appellant in this case were not reasonably diligent.... The agency issued its notice of proposed removal on July 17, 1989, and sent it to the appellant's home address in Virginia. In August 1989, the appellant informed the agency, in writing, that he was in Panama City, Florida, undergoing tests and receiving medical treatment, and that he did not know when he would be able to return to Virginia. In that letter, he gave the agency a specific street address where correspondence could be sent to him, and also a telephone number where he could be reached.... Postmaster Dempsey J. White testified that the agency received this correspondence in September 1989. Thus, the agency could not have continued reasonably to regard the Virginia address as the appellant's proper mailing address, when it had been advised otherwise over one month before it issued its October 26, 1989, decision letter, and when other correspondence it had sent to the appellant's Virginia address was returned as "unclaimed." The agency should have promptly sent the appellant a copy of the notice of proposed removal at his Panama City address to grant him, in a reasonable manner, his due process right to notice and an opportunity to be heard. If the agency still was uncertain of the appellant's whereabouts, it could have telephoned him at the telephone number he provided, in order to ascertain where he could receive correspondence from the agency. This would have required no extraordinary effort on the agency's part, but would have been such as might reasonably have been adopted by one desirous of actually informing the appellant.... However, the agency made no attempt to communicate with the appellant until his return to Virginia in October 1989. The agency's negligence in failing to make intelligent and diligent efforts properly to notify the appellant, provide him with an explanation for its action, and afford him a meaningful opportunity to respond, constitutes an abridgment of his constitutional right to due process of law, and therefore its action must be reversed....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reasonable diligence in the service of a proposal notice was considered, and the Board remanded for possible credibility determinations involved on that issue, in <span class="Italic">Yinat v. Dept. of Army</span>, 101 MSPR 328, 334-36 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-22 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the AJ erred in failing to make a finding on the material issue of whether the agency properly served the appellant with the notice of the proposed removal. an agency's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action that deprives him of his property right in his employment constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law, i.e., prior notice and an opportunity to respond<span class="Italic">. Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). Because the notice of proposed removal was not, in itself, insufficient to notify the appellant of the charge against him, we agree with the agency that the Board must address his claim that he was denied due process because he did not receive the notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts, as it did below, the following: It had to use U.S. Postal Service certified mail to send the notice because the appellant would provide it with only a post office box address and other couriers cannot deliver to a post office box. The appellant refused to accept the certified mail. The appellant was represented by Charles Fitzwilliam when he was removed; the agency successfully served Fitzwilliam with the notice; and it also served the AJ who adjudicated the appellant's first Board appeal with the notice. In addition, it served the appellant with a second notice advising him of its failure to receive a written response to the first notice and of the consequences. The agency submitted below copies of the front of a package sent by certified mail to the appellant and marked "refused"; a certified mail receipt signed by Fitzwilliam; and an October 14, 2003 letter from Chen to the appellant informing the appellant that Chen had not received a response to the notice of proposed removal. It contends that it offered to present the "refused" package to the AJ for inspection and argues that the Board should not countenance a deliberate refusal to accept official mail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that he did not receive the notice of proposed removal. In that regard, he testified that he refused a package because it was significantly damaged and, since "there was no return address on the document[, it] was returned to wherever it was sent from." He also testified that he did not receive the "reminder letter" from Chen informing him that he had not responded to the notice of proposed removal. He further testified that his relationship with Fitzwilliam ended when his first removal was reversed and that Fitzwilliam did not provide him with the copy of the notice of proposed removal in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency must "make diligent and intelligent efforts--such as might reasonably be adopted by one desirous of actually informing the employee--to provide such minimum due process prior to the effective date of its action." <span class="Italic">Givens v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 374, 378 (1991); <span class="Italic">see Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 6 (2000). Although the record includes a copy of the front of the package, we cannot determine whether the package had a return address and whether the package was damaged, as the appellant claimed. In any event, the parties were not informed of the <span class="Italic">Givens</span>'<span class="Italic"></span> standard and, thus, should be given an opportunity to address it before the Board makes a decision on a possibly outcome-determinative issue. Relevant factors on that issue include whether the package bore a return address or any other indication of the sender and whether the agency's actions in sending the notice to Fitzwilliam and the reminder notice to the appellant, at the same post office box address to which it sent the package, constituted "diligent and intelligent efforts." In addition, a decision may require a credibility determination concerning the appellant's testimony that the agency's efforts were insufficient, possibly including an assessment of his demeanor. Such a determination is best made by the AJ. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Barnes v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 242, &#x00B6; 7 (2005).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Schmitt v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 40, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-21 (2022) (removal reversed; due process denied when the agency had the appellant's correct address, sent the removal notice to the wrong address, and later presented him with the proposal and decision letters at the same time with an effective date a week later; the agency was on notice that its earlier mailing was returned as undeliverable: "The appellant is not responsible for the agency having multiple human resources record systems containing differing addresses for the appellant that the agency failed to reconcile before sending the proposed removal to an address that was outdated."; the agency could have rescinded the decision notice and provided appellant the required due process).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCauley v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MCCAULEY_LINDA_DC_0752_09_0694_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER__612104.pdf">116 MSPR 484</a>, 487-88 &#x00B6; 5-7, 2011 MSPB 59 (2011), illustrates the need for credibility determinations when receipt of a removal proposal is disputed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues, as she did below, that she did not receive the agency's notice of proposed removal, and therefore was denied due process. In support of her claim, she submits for the first time on review a certified letter from the agency, bearing a postage meter imprint dated July 15, 2009, regarding her failure to contact an EEO Counselor. She also submits a U.S. Postal Service "Track &#x0026; Confirm" search result showing that letter was delivered on December 9, 2009. She asserts that, "because the late delivery of this letter demonstrates that mail from the Agency failed to arrive properly, the preponderance of the evidence did not support a determination of proper delivery of mail from the Agency." Thus, the appellant argues, there was insufficient evidence to support the administrative judge's determination that she received the proposal notice. Because the appellant's evidence submitted on review postdates the initial decision and because it is relevant to the important issue of whether the appellant received the proposal notice, we will address it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we assume <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the July letter took nearly five months to reach the appellant, that fact does not establish that any other letter the agency sent to her took a longer than normal time to arrive or did not arrive at all. Furthermore, the administrative judge deprived the agency of the presumption of delivery and receipt based on the proposing official's testimony that he did not personally observe the letter being stamped and mailed. However, the administrative judge held that delivery and receipt was shown by hearing testimony. She cited the credible testimony of an agency official that, in his contacts with the appellant, the appellant made statements indicating she had received the notice of proposed action. An agency human resources specialist also testified that she called the appellant six times, and that she left voice-mail messages for the appellant regarding the proposal notice and the deadline for responding to it. The agency employee made contemporaneous documentation of these attempts, which were also included in the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the administrative judge found the appellant's testimony was not credible on this subject and stated that her testimony was "confusing <span id="Page_3218"></span>and evasive and her demeanor was disingenuous." The Board must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing; the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The appellant fails to offer sufficiently sound reasons for overturning the administrative judge's credibility determinations. Thus, we conclude that the appellant has not shown error in the initial decision in this regard.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The Board has held that an agency must make intelligent and diligent efforts--such as might reasonably be adopted by one desirous of actually informing the employee--to provide an employee notice of a proposed removal. <span class="Italic">Givens v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 374, 378 (1991). In the instant case, the appellant challenges the administrative judge's finding that the agency's attempt to deliver the notice of proposed removal was "intelligent and diligent." In finding that the agency's effort met that standard, the administrative judge noted that the agency mailed the proposal notice to the appellant's post office box and e-mailed it to both her office and home addresses. The proposing official testified that the post office box to which the agency mailed the proposal notice was the appellant's address of record. The administrative judge further found that "[b]ecause the proposal notice was sent in the same manner as other correspondence with the appellant and because the agency was not shown to have had any other method of corresponding with the appellant, the delivery was intelligent and diligent." [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee Wright v. Department of the Navy</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 408, 411 (1983) (service method consistent with the appellant's instructions to the agency and the agency's past practice with that appellant was "intelligent and diligent"). We agree with the administrative judge that the agency's mailing of the proposal notice to the appellant's address of record, in the same manner it had successfully sent her other correspondence, was intelligent and diligent. The appellant's arguments to the contrary are without merit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 162, 165-68 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1-6 (2000), reversed a removal when the appellant was incapable of comprehending the removal proposal at the time it was offered to him, took no copy of it with him, and the agency made no later efforts to serve the notice on the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because it is dispositive, we begin by addressing the issue of whether the appellant properly received the proposal notice. It is well established that the government's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an action that deprives him of his property right in his employment constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to due process of law. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 105 S. Ct 1487, 84 L. Ed.2d 494 (1985). The minimum requirements are notice of the charges, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity for the employee to present his side of the story. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 546, 105 S. Ct. 1487. Thus, under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> an agency's failure to provide a nonprobationary federal employee with prior notice and an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an agency action appealable to the Board that deprives him of his property right in his employment constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law. <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 680 (1991). A preference eligible employee who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in the U.S. Postal Service, like the appellant in this case, has a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(ii). When such an employee is deprived of a constitutionally protected property interest, the right to minimum due process is "absolute" in the sense that it does not depend on the merits of his claim. <span class="Italic">See Stephen,</span> 47 MSPR at 681. Thus, the AJ's analysis of this matter as one of harmful error was incorrect. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 685.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, her finding that the appellant's failure to receive a copy of the proposal notice was due to his own actions, not those of the agency, is not supported by the record. In this regard, the following facts are not disputed: (1) The appellant was referred to the agency's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) in February 1997, based on his complaints of job-related stress and depression; (2) according to his counselor, Carolyn Johnson, tests showed that, at that time, he was suffering from mild mood disturbance; (3) by April, his condition, had deteriorated to that of moderate clinical depression; (4) in August, his primary physician prescribed an anti-depressant for him, and, at that time, he also agreed with Ms. Johnson's recommendation that he consult a psychiatrist; (5) Ms. Johnson had ten visits with the appellant, and continued to see him, after the initial visits had concluded; (6) his symptoms included, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, poor concentration, increased irritability, isolation, and feeling anxious; (7) Ms. Johnson advised Jenial Wright of these matters through a meeting and by follow-up letter of, September 15, 1997; (8) the appellant was found not fit for duty due to major depression for the period from September 30, through October 14, 1997; (9) early on November 17, 1997, prior to the time the agency attempted to give him the notice of proposed removal, the appellant, complaining that he was "under a lot of stress," sought and received permission to go to the Medical Unit, whereupon he was instructed to go home; (10) he returned to his unit and explained the situation to Barbara Weaver, his work supervisor, who insisted that he could not go home until he saw Ms. Wright; and (11) he reluctantly complied, explaining to Ms. Wright that he had just come from the Medical Unit and had been told to go home.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that Ms. Wright said she had a letter for him, and that he was to read it and sign it. He testified that he told her that he was in no condition to do either, "that he was so upset at the time, that he could not focus on any documents, as far as being able to read and comprehend what [he] was reading," and that, since he could not read it "for any kind of understanding," he could not sign it. The appellant further testified that Ms. Wright summoned Supervisor Beverly Brown to witness his refusal to sign, which she did. Afterward, the appellant testified, he left without a copy of the proposal notice, went to see Ms. Johnson "because I was at the end of my rope" and needed to talk, and then went home. According to the appellant, he did not receive the proposal notice until April 1998, when a copy of the agency's file in this case was served upon him. Ms. Wright testified that the appellant did not tell her that he was experiencing any stress on November 17, 1997, or that he could not read or sign the proposal notice, and, although acknowledging that he did not take a copy of the notice with him when he left, she asserted that he did, in fact, read it in her presence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As such, Ms. Wright's testimony directly opposes the appellant's as to the circumstances surrounding the issuance, or attempted issuance, of the proposal notice. Unlike Ms. Wright's version, however, the appellant's version of events is somewhat supported by other evidence in the record....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the agency has not shown, nor does it assert, that it sent the proposal notice to the appellant, either by certified or regular mail, anytime after November 17, 1997. Nor does it suggest that it hand-delivered the proposal notice to him on any other day, despite the fact that he returned to work on November 18, 1997, and worked his regular schedule until December 31, 1997, the effective date of his removal, and despite the fact that the agency did hand-deliver to him on December 29, 1997, a copy of the decision letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, therefore, that, under these circumstances, the agency did not make a diligent effort to deliver the proposal notice to the appellant in advance of the effective date of his removal. Nor did it constructively deliver the notice to him. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Pangarova v. Department of the Army</span>, 42 MSPR 319, 324-25 (1989) (constructive delivery found even though appellant refused to accept the proposal notice without a union representative present, where she was told what was in the letter and the date of her deadline for responding). Because the appellant was denied the opportunity to present a response to the proposed action, he was thereby denied the minimum procedures that satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and, as such, the action must be reversed.</p>
