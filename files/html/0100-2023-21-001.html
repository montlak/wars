<p class="Body-Text">The retirement system for federal employees comprises two major systems: the Civil Service Retirement System, a defined benefits program; and, for employees hired into the federal government after January 1, 1984 (and for employees with earlier CSRS coverage who decided to shift into the newer system), the Federal Employees Retirement System, involving a modest basic annuity, an investment program called the Thrift Savings Plan, funded by contributions from both employees and federal agency employers, and Social Security benefits. Each program--established by statute, and implemented by regulations of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB), and the Social Security Administration (SSA)--is complex; the operational and actuarial details of the programs are beyond the scope of this <span class="Italic">Guide</span>. Detailed handbooks and other information on FERS, CSRS, and the TSP are available on the websites of OPM, <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/">www.opm.gov/retirement-services</a> and the FRTIB, <a href="https://www.frtib.gov/">www.frtib.gov</a> and SSA, <a href="https://faq.ssa.gov/en-US/">www.faq.ssa.gov</a>. These agencies employ individuals who provide guidance on retirement and benefits law for federal agency lawyers, human relations offices, employees, soon-to-be retired individuals, and annuitants. Deadlines apply to some retirement applications and to reconsideration requests to OPM and appeals to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Cf. Clark v. DOJ</span>, CH-0752-15-0288-I-2, n.2 (NP 10/21/2022) ("The CSRS and FERS Handbook is a public document, of which we take administrative notice. <span class="Italic">See Azdell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 319, 323 (2001).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Decisions of the Board and the Federal Circuit address isolated problems that arise in the administration of the two retirement systems. The decisions do not provide a broad picture of how the two systems operate. The statutes and implementing regulations are convoluted. OPM synthesizes the operation of the statutes and its regulations governing the CSRS and FERS systems through publications on its website. Readers should first refer to the OPM descriptions to get an idea of how the major components of the retirement systems are administered: <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/csrs-information">www.opm.gov/retirement-services/csrs-information</a> for information about CSRS <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/">opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information</a> for information about FERS. Detailed information, designed for personnel offices, on CSRS and FERS operations is in the CSRS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices, at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/csrsfers-handbook/">opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/csrsfers-handbook</a>. A series of booklets, called "Retirement Facts," covering CSRS matters, are at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/pamphlets/#url=CSRS">opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/pamphlets/#url=CSRS</a> (CSRS) and counterpart FERS Facts are at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/pamphlets/#url=FERS">opm.gov/retirement-services/publications-forms/pamphlets/#url=FERS</a>. Links at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/my-annuity-and-benefits/related-federal-benefits/">opm.gov/retirement-services/my-annuity-and-benefits/related-federal-benefits/</a> provide resources for OWCP benefits, SSA programs, Military Retired Pay, Medicare, and the Thrift Savings Plan. Insurance references are located at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/">opm.gov/healthcare-insurance</a>. Regulations of OPM governing the retirement systems are distributed through 5 CFR Parts 831-850 (2022). The first couple of months before or after retirement could be spent reviewing these materials.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to OPM statistics, <a href="https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/retirement-statistics/">opm.gov/retirement-services/retirement-statistics</a>, for each of the years from 2000 through 2013, between about 74,000 and 138,000 employees retired. Relying on 2010 statistics for the Executive Branch: about 85% of retirements are voluntary, about 9 % of the retirements occur through disability, 3% of the employees retiring did so through early retirement, and about 1% of the retirements were mandatory based upon statutory age limitations. Most retirements occur through submissions of retirement applications that lead to benefits without any litigation. But some retirement applications are denied by OPM and some retirements that are granted produce collateral problems concerning the proper amount of benefits or the manner that benefits are distributed to beneficiaries, e.g., spouses or former spouses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A complex system becomes more so when retirement annuities, present or future, are affected by divorce decrees that seek to apportion, or withhold apportionment, of annuity interests; the complexities often occur because lawyers and state court judges are not familiar with OPM or FRTIB regulations and do not undertake the research necessary to properly draft divorce decrees and associated marital property settlements. In this as well as other areas of retirement law involving vested benefits, there is little leeway for equitable adjustments. The eligibility requirements for retirement are substantive legal requirements and allow for no administrative discretion by OPM or the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Oliveros v. OPM</span>, 49 MSPR 360, 363 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Difficulties may occur because beneficiaries may not understand the benefit scheme or may lack the capacity to engage with federal agencies responsible for administering benefits. To their credit, many MSPB AJs understand the complexities of retirement law and appreciate the significance of the vested benefits of individuals who appear <span class="Italic">pro se</span> before them. Those AJs actively seek to assist the appellants by informing them of the law and, when necessary, determining how best to protect the interests of appellants who lack the mental capacity to properly pursue an appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM is the administrator of annuities under FERS and CSRS (FRTIB administers the TSP), and when retirement disputes over benefits or overpayments of benefits arise, OPM is the respondent in the ensuing MSPB appeal. OPM's role is dual. It is a trustee for retirement funds, acting in the interests of the beneficiaries who invested sufficient service time to warrant an annuity entitlement. OPM also serves and conserves the interests of the fund as a whole. OPM, as a public agency, must act with regard to the public interest and conservation of taxpayer funds. As administrator of the retirement systems, OPM maintains records bearing on retirement interests. "OPM is the custodian of the employment records necessary for determining whether a position is covered by the CSRS, however, and it must specifically explain how these documents support a denial of retirement benefits." <span class="Italic">Sanez v. OPM</span>, 58 MSPR 184, 186 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In most retirement appeals, the sole respondent is OPM. An agency employer may be joined when the claim includes a constructively adverse retirement, a subject covered in <a href="0100-2023-13-001.html#sec6-1">Chapter 6</a> of the <span class="Italic">Guide</span>. Although the MSPB docket includes many retirement appeals, often involving claims for disability retirement or challenges to overpayment claims made by OPM, the volume of litigation represents a tiny fraction of the number of retirement applications that are adjudicated by OPM favorably, without a ripple. Most individuals who are entitled to an annuity get it, and they enter into and continue through their retirements with no thought of litigation, lawyers, or the MSPB. Credit is given where credit is due, but it is also true that many Board appeals involving OPM are met with less than diligent attention by OPM to the appellate process. Too frequently, OPM receives a Board appeal, rescinds the underlying annuity determination leading to the appeal so as to again consider its decision, and the Board dismisses the appeal as moot or beyond its jurisdiction. The appellant does not get an annuity and must await the pleasure of OPM to issue another, appealable decision. The Board's approach is unacceptable. Individuals whose annuity claims are denied and who timely appeal to the Board should have their cases adjudicated. The Board can and should continue, maintain, and actively manage the appeal on its active docket should OPM desire, during a set period of time, to reevaluate its position. [Refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-020.html#sec2-21">Negative OPM Reconsideration Decision Appeal.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Going beyond OPM's interaction with the Board during the appellate process, <span class="Italic">Clark v. OPM</span>, 40 MSPR 517, 520 (1989), explained OPM's obligations as administrator of the retirement system:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...OPM has an affirmative duty to fully and accurately inform claimants of their rights and obligations. <span class="Italic">See Potter v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 21 MSPR 476, 478 (1984); <span class="Italic">Keefe v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 19 MSPR 609, 611 (1984). In fact, OPM's own guidelines to agencies provide, in pertinent part, that agencies must fulfill their general responsibilities, including "counseling and informing employees on their rights and obligations under the law, giving assistance to claimants, including survivors of deceased employees...." FPM Supp. 831-1, Section S1-4(d) (Sept. 21, 1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies provide retirement advice to their employees and often initially receive and process their retirement applications as they are assembled for transmittal to OPM. Agency retirement counselors or human relations specialists who provide annuity estimates and advice on benefit entitlements may make mistakes. When they do, a person may end up separating from employment based on the expectation that he is retirement-eligible or that a retirement benefit will be at a certain financial level. When one or another of these eventualities does not occur, that individual may choose to challenge the retirement determination of OPM and file an involuntary retirement appeal as to the employing agency. The two claims--the appeal challenging OPM's denial of an annuity or OPM's determination of the level of the annuity, and the constructive adverse action appeal against the employing agency--can be joined before the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Siedschlag v. OPM</span>, 38 MSPR 517, 520 (1988); <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. OPM</span>, 40 MSPR 689, 692 (1989) (remanding to permit OPM to determine whether appellant should have been able to elect a new retirement date if otherwise consistent with law).

<p class="Body-Text">An employee may appeal the decision to deny voluntary early retirement if the agency controls the program. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cohn v. DOD,</span> DC-0752-14-0966-I-1 (NP 6/25/2015); <span class="Italic">Dawson v.

Ordinarily, such an appeal is from an OPM decision. <span class="Italic">Mandarino v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 118 M.S.P.R. 510, &#x00B6; 7 (2012). Here, however, the agency approved or denied early retirement applications <span id="Page_4072"></span>from Rural Development employees pursuant to an express delegation of authority from OPM, and the appellant challenges the agency's failure to grant his application pursuant to that authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.114. Our reviewing court has held that an appeal from an adverse VERA determination under such circumstances falls within the Board's jurisdiction as 'an administrative action or order' under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d). <span class="Italic">Adams v. Department of Defense,</span> 688 F.3d 1330, 1335-36 (Fed. Cir. 2012)."). [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-21-150.html#sec14-148">Voluntary Early Retirement Authority</a>," for these and related decisions.] Earlier law was that he failure of an agency to offer an employee an early retirement option would not be directly appealable. <span class="Italic">Adams v. DOD,</span> DC-0752-10-0741-I-1 (NP 3/4/2011) ("The appellant also asserts that the agency should have provided him with the opportunity to retire under the Voluntary Early Retirement Authority (VERA) and that the Board must have jurisdiction over the agency's decision not to authorize VERA....&#8197;However, the appellant offers no statutes, cases, or regulations to support his proposition that the Board has jurisdiction. In fact, in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 573, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 65 F.3d 186 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table), the Board held that it was unaware of any statute or regulation that gives the Board jurisdiction over such offers. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 577."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Morano v.

<p class="Body-Text">Although there may be little leeway for adjustment of the laws or regulations that govern awards and amounts of annuities, through the chapter that follows readers will see how the courts, particularly the Federal Circuit, and the Board, often at the urging of that court, find inventive legal solutions to skirt a particular regulatory or statutory provision when the circumstances are particularly compelling. In other appeals the adjudicator finds no means to accommodate the appellant's situation, expresses sympathy with the appellant's plight, but announces that the problem presented by the appeal cannot be favorably resolved through the litigation process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"An individual seeking retirement benefits bears the burden of proving entitlement to those benefits by preponderant evidence." <span class="Italic">Jordan v. OPM</span>, 100 MSPR 623, 626 &#x00B6; 7 (2005) (citing 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)] ). <span class="Italic">Martinez v. OPM</span>, AT-0831-15-0749-I-1 (NP 8/19/2016), advises:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence his entitlement to a retirement annuity benefit. <span class="Italic">Allen v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 212, 216 (1998); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(2)(ii). Payments of money from the civil service retirement fund are limited to those authorized by statute. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 216. Neither the Board nor OPM has discretion to change the eligibility requirements for any retirement benefit.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Moreover, OPM's interpretation of the statutes that it administers is entitled to considerable weight, especially when there are no compelling reasons to conclude that such an interpretation is erroneous or unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Andrada v.

<p class="Body-Text">Employees and annuitants and their survivors or dependents must be aware of deadlines, especially those set by statute. There is little forgiveness for missing deadlines governing retirement entitlements. The problem of missed deadlines is a common one. Although there are varying results, depending on the circumstances, <span class="Italic">Demello v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 574, 576-77 (1991), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are only three bases for waiving a filing deadline prescribed by statute or administrative regulation: The statute or regulation may specify circumstances in which the time limit will be waived; the agency's affirmative misconduct may preclude it from enforcing an otherwise applicable rule under the doctrine or equitable estoppel; and the agency's failure to provide a notice of election rights and the filing deadline as required by statute or regulation may warrant a waiver of the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Individuals seeking relief from the Board must meet the Board's filing deadlines, discussed in <a href="0100-2023-09-001.html#sec2-1">Chapters 2 (appeals)</a> and <a href="0100-2023-12-001.html#sec5-1">5 (petitions for review)</a>. Too often, the Board defaults a person with an arguably vested retirement interest because the Board appeal was not filed in time after the benefit was denied by OPM. Estoppel is not a strong basis for waiver of a deadline. Under <span class="Italic">OPM v. Richmond</span>, 110 S. Ct. 2465 (1990), the federal government cannot be equitably estopped from enforcing a statutory provision governing a claimant's eligibility for public funds.</p>
