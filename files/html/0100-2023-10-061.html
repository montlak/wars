<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-61"><span class="space">a.</span> Preservation of Objection; Incomplete Summary</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">AJs have wide discretion in regulating the course of proceedings before them, including prehearing conferences. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vandesande v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 190, 194 n.1 (1997). In the exercise of his discretion, to bind parties to directions contained in the prehearing conference memorandum or order, the AJ should ensure that the order is accurate, particularly if it is based on a memorandum written by a party who summarizes the prehearing conference for the AJ, and that the parties who will be bound by the order are given the chance to object concerning its accuracy, <span class="Italic">Miles v. VA</span>, 84 MSPR 418, 420-21 &#x00B6; 8 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge had the agency's representative prepare a memorandum summarizing the pre-hearing conference. Although this memorandum discusses the agency's motion to compel, it does not mention whether the appellant's similar allegation against the agency was discussed or resolved. "When a written memorandum summarizing the conference is prepared, the [administrative Judge] (or the party given the task of preparing the summary) must serve the memorandum on the parties giving a specific number of days, normally at least 5 days, for filing corrections or objections to the memorandum. If a party is designated to prepare the summary, the [administrative judge] must annotate the party's memorandum to show his or her agreement with its accuracy before it is placed in the record." <span class="Italic">MSPB Judges' Handbook</span>, Chapter 9--Prehearing and Status Conferences. The appellant was provided no opportunity to challenge the agency's summary. Nor did the administrative judge indicate that the summary was accurate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Orders or decisions made by AJs as part of the prehearing process are not immune from Board review. If a party is dissatisfied with the conduct of a prehearing conference, objections should not be raised for the first time in a PFR from an adverse initial decision. The dissatisfied party should enter a formal objection during the conference. <span class="Italic">Vires v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 38 MSPR 569, 572 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ordinarily, objections to the AJ's directives must be made once the appellant receives a prehearing order or conference summary, if those objections are not stated in the conference summary or order. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wagner v. Dept. of Army,</span> DE-0752-11-0033-I-1 (NP 4/18/2012) ("The administrative judge afforded the parties an opportunity to object to his rulings by a specified date, or any such objections would be deemed waived. The appellant and his counsel did not object to the administrative judge's prehearing summary that identified the elements of the charge including the requirement that the delay be unreasonable. Thus, he may not do so for the first time on review.&#8197;...In any event, by adding the adjective 'unreasonably' before the word 'delayed,' the administrative judge provided additional protections to the appellant's benefit, which did not prejudice him."); <span class="Italic">Burge v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 82 MSPR 75, 91 &#x00B6; 30 (1999) ("The appellant did not file an objection to the administrative judge's ruling within 15 days of the prehearing conference or at the beginning of the hearing, even though he was specifically afforded an opportunity to do so. Therefore, he did not preserve this matter for review, and the Board will not consider it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCarty v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 177, 180-81 (1995)."); <span class="Italic">Alexander v. OPM</span>, 58 MSPR 358, 367 (1993) ("The January 29, 1993 order summarizing the prehearing conference indicates no objection by the appellant to any of the administrative judge's rulings. Further, we note that the order directed the parties to immediately file any additions or corrections to the summary....&#8197;She did submit a written opening statement at the hearing, but that statement contained no objections to the administrative judge's rulings."); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DOJ</span>, 58 MSPR 96, 101 n.4 (1993) (Board would not consider disparate penalties on a PFR when the appellant failed to object to omission of that issue from the prehearing conference summary); <span class="Italic">Crowe v. SBA,</span> 53 MSPR 631, 635-36 (1992) (representative did not object to a prehearing summary omitting a sex discrimination defense (that was earlier struck as frivolous) and the successor representative did not attempt to reassert any of the appellant's affirmative defenses; the appellant abandoned his affirmative defenses). The need to preserve issues through objections to prehearing determinations that omit or incorrectly decide issues extends to enforcement proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Paxton v.

<p class="Body-Text">The statement of issues in the conference summary binds agencies as well as appellants, as <span class="Italic">Litton v. DOJ</span>, DC-0752-14-1110-I-2 (NP 10/13/2022), demonstrated when the agency argued that the AJ mischaracterized a charge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although the agency filed submissions addressing rulings on exhibits and witnesses, it did not object to the description of the lack of candor charge. Thus, it may not object on review to that description, and any additional specification under that charge is not properly before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Kingsley v.

<p class="Body-Text">The conclusive nature of the prehearing summary depends on notice by the AJ to the parties that the summary binds the parties by limiting their hearing <span id="Page_1351"></span>presentations to the procedures, issues, witnesses, and exhibits (depending on the treatment of exhibits) identified in the summary. The summary should include instructions on how and when objections to it may be lodged with the AJ. When the AJ did not inform an appellant that she needed to document in writing any objection she had to the AJ's rulings, the Board could entertain an objection first raised in the PFR. <span class="Italic">Ayers-Kavtaradze v. OPM</span>, 91 MSPR 397, 403 &#x00B6; 14 (2002) (objection to telephonic hearing when credibility at issue); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Machulas v.

VA</span>, 81 MSPR 26, 30-31 &#x00B6; 13 (1998) ("Generally, an appellant is deemed to have abandoned a prohibited personnel practice claim if it is not included in the list of issues in a prehearing conference summary, or status conference, and the party was afforded an opportunity to object to the conference summary"; the general rule was inapplicable when the AJ failed to limit the issues in the summary, leaving the appellant without notice that a claim of reprisal would not be considered); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Diefenderfer v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 108 MSPR 651, 660-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 22-24, 2008 MSPB 105 (2008) (although an issue may not have been specifically raised in the prehearing submission, it was raised in response to a jurisdictional show-cause order; the prehearing order was insufficiently specific as to what was being excluded from appellant's claims).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The process of making an objection is simple enough. If the AJ disallows a chosen witness or makes some other incorrect ruling, just ask the AJ to note your objection on the record, and the AJ should do exactly that. The conference summary that follows should note the objection. That summary may also provide the parties a period of days to note their objections to rulings or the accuracy of the summary. The best practice is to make your objections, succinctly, without argument, and politely during the conference and ask the AJ to note the objection in the conference summary. The AJ will take no offense at an objection. It is just the Board's way of ensuring that the record shows that the AJ was made aware of a dispute with a ruling that the AJ could have changed at the time the objection was made. The Board occasionally rules that an objection is preserved for review in a PFR only if reconsideration is requested of, or "exception" stated to, the ruling on the objection. Although the Board's notion of the preservative power of a reconsideration request or exception is questionable given the relatively informal level of Board adjudication, one might as well comply. State the objection, request reconsideration when the objection is overruled. The objection and request for reconsideration can also be submitted by pleading after the AJ's conference summary is received, as long as the objection is filed within the time permitted by the summary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The formalities of reconsideration requests to preserve points of argument for a PFR aside, a party may also ask the AJ to reconsider his or her ruling if there is another reason in support of the party's position not earlier stated in the prehearing submission or during the prehearing conference. If a party believes that a witness was improperly excluded, the objection to the exclusion could be accompanied by an offer of proof. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lee v. EPA</span>, 115 MSPR 533, 543-44 &#x00B6; 15, 2010 MSPB 240 (2010). If the AJ made a ruling in a prehearing conference that is particularly egregious from the perspective of a client, for example, the AJ denied a request for an important witness, one technique that may be helpful is to write a letter to the AJ (or file a motion), served on opposing counsel, requesting reconsideration of the ruling and adding any additional information or arguments that may help to bring the AJ around to the correct point of view. If an objection is not preserved by being timely raised following an adverse ruling from the AJ, it will not be heard by the AJ following the close of the record or by the Board on PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. DHHS</span>, 52 MSPR 669, 671 (1992); <span class="Italic">Smith v. VA</span>, 47 MSPR 297, 302-03 (1991) (because the appellant did not file an exception or objection to the prehearing order in the time allowed by the AJ, he did not preserve those matters for Board review); <span class="Italic">Hill v. DHHS</span>, 28 MSPR 91, 92-93 (1985) (if the appellant did not make an objection to the AJ concerning irrelevant evidence introduced by the agency, she is precluded from presenting the objection to the Board for review through a PFR).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Use of an objection should suffice to preserve an issue for review through a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schneider v. DHS</span>, 98 MSPR 377, 388 &#x00B6; 21 (2005). ("The appellant objected to the administrative judge's denial of Ramirez as a witness, arguing that Ramirez should at least be available to testify as a rebuttal witness, depending on Bulger's testimony regarding the circumstances around Ramirez' refusal to assist the investigator. Thus, the appellant preserved her objection to the administrative judge's denial of Ramirez as a witness."). Decisions requiring a party to "preserve" an objection or "exception" to an AJ's adverse prehearing ruling impose considerable nonregulatory formality (harkening back to practice in the courts in the early 1900s) upon what is supposed to be informal adjudication often involving <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants or lawyers whose fine law schools never made mention of "exceptions" in trial practice courses. The unwary party or counsel may find himself on the receiving end of an announcement such as that in <span class="Italic">Guillory v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 244, 249 (1991): "The record does not indicate whether the appellant preserved an exception to the administrative judge's ruling on the harmful procedural error issue." To its credit, the Board searched the record in <span class="Italic">Guillory</span> to determine whether the appellant dropped the procedural error allegation or accepted the AJ's preclusive prehearing ruling as final. The better practice would be to permit a party to challenge any adverse ruling in a PFR without the necessity for a formal exception, reconsideration request, or objection to the ruling. That party would still be free to request reconsideration by the AJ of the adverse ruling. The Board determined in <span class="Italic">Greenspan v. VA</span>, 94 MSPR 247, 251-52 &#x00B6; 11 (2003) (on later review,<span class="Italic"> Greenspan v. VA</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1182057.html">464 F.3d 1297</a> (Fed. Cir. 2006)), that the appellant preserved an objection to prehearing rulings when the AJ made no record of the conference, and stated, contrary to the later assertion of the appellant in a PFR, that the appellant waived his opportunity to object to the summary of the telephonic prehearing conference.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Exceptions may be made to the rule excluding issues not properly preserved before the AJ when important issues of statutory interpretation are presented. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pastor v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/PASTOR_JOAN_L_PH_1221_99_0089_P_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_251004.pdf">87 MSPR 609</a>, 613 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2001) (considering the availability of future medical damages under the consequential damages provisions of WPA). If the Board concludes that the prehearing summary or order from the AJ is not complete, or was not meant to be complete, the Board may decide that, even without an objection to the order from a party, an issue that the party clearly intended to litigate was not abandoned. That situation arose in <span class="Italic">Varner v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/VARNER_EUNICE_L_CH_0752_05_0421_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_246783.pdf">101 MSPR 155</a>, 157-59 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-7, 2006 MSPB 27 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge held a prehearing conference at which he described the issues to be litigated at the hearing as the merits of the agency's charges and the appellant's two allegations of harmful procedural error. His summary of the prehearing conference did not mention the appellant's allegations of disability discrimination and retaliation. Although the administrative judge afforded the parties an opportunity to respond to his written summary of the conference, neither party responded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After holding the requested hearing, the administrative judge affirmed the agency's removal action, finding that the agency had proven its charges by preponderant evidence. The administrative judge further found that the appellant failed to establish that the agency committed harmful procedural errors. Finally, the administrative judge found that the removal penalty promoted the efficiency of service and was reasonable. The initial decision did not address the appellant's allegations of disability discrimination and retaliation, and did not provide the appellant with notice of mixed-case appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant, who is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, reiterates her claim that the agency removed her based on her disability and in retaliation for her EEO activity, and explains that she failed to submit detailed medical documentation below because she did not know how to submit such evidence. The agency has not responded to the appellant's petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an administrative judge issues a prehearing order or a status conference summary in which the judge identifies an exhaustive list of issues to be decided in the appeal and affords the parties an opportunity to object to the order or summary, an appellant is generally deemed to have abandoned any issues that were not identified by the judge unless the appellant raises an objection. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Crowe v. Small Business Administration</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 631, 635-36 (1992). Here, the administrative judge's summary of the prehearing conference listed the issues to be considered at the hearing without mentioning the appellant's EEO retaliation and disability discrimination claims, and the appellant failed to file an objection. The summary, however, did not purport to be exhaustive with regard to the issues to be decided, and there is no indication in the summary, or in the record below, that the administrative judge informed the appellant that her discrimination and reprisal affirmative defenses would not be heard. Indeed, after the prehearing conference, the parties proceeded under the assumption that the appellant's affirmative defenses would, in fact, be adjudicated. For example, following the issuance of the summary, the agency filed a motion for clarification on jurisdiction, which it later amended, arguing that the appellant's affirmative defenses should not be heard on the basis of her alleged election to first proceed through the EEO process. In addition, during the hearing, the appellant asked the deciding official questions relating to her retaliation claim without objection from the agency or the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the foregoing, we find that the administrative judge failed to place the appellant on notice that her reprisal and disability discrimination claims would not be considered, and, therefore, she cannot be deemed to have abandoned these claims. <span class="Italic">See Kokkinis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 26, &#x00B6; 13 (1998) (where an administrative judge fails to put the appellant on notice that her affirmative defenses would not be heard, the appellant cannot be deemed to have abandoned the affirmative defenses). Thus, the administrative judge erred in not addressing these claims in the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980) (an initial decision must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, resolve issues of credibility, and include the administrative judge's conclusions of law and his legal reasoning, as well as the authorities on which that reasoning rests).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1352"></span><span class="Italic">Smart v. Dept. of Army</span>, 105 MSPR 475, 480-81 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12, 2007 MSPB 111 (2007), also showed an inclination to avoid implied exclusion of issues from a nonexclusive listing of issues in a prehearing order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that, when an administrative judge issues a prehearing order or a status conference summary that identifies an exhaustive list of issues to be decided in the appeal and affords the parties an opportunity to object to the order or summary, an appellant is generally deemed to have abandoned any issues that were not identified unless the appellant raises an objection. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Crowe v. Small Business Administration</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 631, 635-36 (1992). Here, the administrative judge's summaries of the two conferences listed the issues to be considered at the hearing without mentioning the appellant's discrimination and retaliation claims, and the appellant failed to file an objection. Neither summary, however, purported to be exhaustive with regard to the issues to be decided. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> They did not, for example, state that no other issues would be considered. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In light of the foregoing, we find that the administrative judge failed to place the appellant on notice that his discrimination and retaliation claims would not be considered, and, therefore, he cannot be deemed to have abandoned these claims. <span class="Italic">See Varner v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 7 (2006); <span class="Italic">Kokkinis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 26, &#x00B6; 13 (1998) (where an administrative judge fails to put the appellant on notice that her affirmative defenses would not be heard, the appellant cannot be deemed to have abandoned the affirmative defenses).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, at no time did the administrative judge apprise the appellant of the burdens and elements of proof on his discrimination and retaliation claims, as she was required to do. <span class="Italic">See Varner</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Kokkinis</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 26, &#x00B6; 14. Because the administrative judge failed to provide the appellant with such notice, and then failed to adjudicate those claims, we must remand the appeal for further adjudication.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] The appellant's petition for review indicates that he may have had independent knowledge of the elements to prove a retaliation claim as he addresses some of those elements in his petition. Specifically, he argues that he proved that he "engaged in EEO protected compliant [sic] activity," that Ortega and Shanahan "were made aware" of his prior EEO filings, and that, shortly thereafter, the agency notified him that he was not selected for the Security Guard position. In its opposition to the appellant's petition for review, the agency argues that, even if the administrative judge erred by failing to apprise the appellant of the relevant burdens of proof, such error was "harmless" because the appellant had knowledge of those burdens and elements as a result of his "wealth of experience in filing and prosecuting <span class="Italic">pro se</span> EEO and MSPB complaints, appeals and requests for reconsideration." The agency states that the "appellant has filed at least nine <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appeals and requests for reconsideration to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC]" and "has appeared <span class="Italic">pro se</span> in at least nine MSPB published cases." Our review of the published EEOC decisions relating to the appellant's EEOC complaints indicates that he raised allegations of race discrimination and retaliation as part of those complaints. The agency, however, has not identified any document or pleading that sets forth the burdens and elements of proof relevant to the appellant's affirmative defenses, nor have we been able to locate any such document. Based on the record before us, we therefore cannot conclude that the appellant had knowledge of the relevant burdens of proof as a result of his prior dealings with the Board or the EEOC. In any event, regardless of whether the appellant had such knowledge, the fact remains that, in this case, not only has the appellant not received notice of the relevant burdens and elements of proof, but his discrimination and retaliation claims were not adjudicated below and the record is not sufficiently developed for the Board to rule on those claims at this time. Remand is therefore necessary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Issues of implied waiver of issues aside, the AJ's acknowledgment order and prehearing memo or order should identify issues and summarize the parties' burdens of proof. If there's an omission, and an issue is decided by the AJ that was not earlier identified, the error is harmless if the party can raise the issue on PFR, <span class="Italic">Samuels v. VA</span>, NY-0752-14-0293-I-1 (NP 2/24/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not notify the appellant of his burden of proof and the elements to show harmful procedural error or a due process violation prior to issuing the initial decision; however, this error was not prejudicial to the appellant's substantive rights because the initial decision was sufficient to place the appellant on notice of his burden to prove harmful procedural error and due process violations. <span class="Italic">See Sabio v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 6 n.2 (2017) (noting that, although the appellant was not notified of the correct standard and burden of proof applicable to her affirmative defense, the initial decision set forth the correct standard and provided her with notice and an opportunity to meet her burden on review); <span class="Italic">Caracciolo v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 663, &#x00B6; 11 (2007) (holding that the failure to provide the appellant with proper notice on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue can be cured if the initial decision itself puts the appellant on notice of what she must do to establish jurisdiction so as to afford her the opportunity to meet her burden for the first time on review), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Brookins v. Department of the Interior</span>, 2023 MSPB 3.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Wilson v. VA</span>, 63 MSPR 63, 66-67 (1994), the appellant pleaded disability discrimination in his appeal, but the AJ did not identify disability discrimination as an issue in her memo summarizing the prehearing conference. Although the AJ took evidence concerning discrimination, she did not adjudicate the issue. The initial decision contained mixed case appeal rights. The Board concluded that "[w]e will not deem the appellant to have abandoned his affirmative defense of disability discrimination, notwithstanding the fact that he did not expressly object to the administrative judge's failure to identify disability discrimination as an issue for adjudication in the memorandum summarizing the prehearing conference." Similarly, <span class="Italic">Henson v. USPS</span>, 110 MSPR 624, 630 &#x00B6; 10, 2009 MSPB 38 (2009), determined that an EEO defense was not waived through implication without the appellant being placed on clear notice in a prehearing order, with a notice of the right to object to the order, that failed to discuss whether there was or was not an EEO defense that would be adjudicated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Generally, an appellant is deemed to have abandoned a discrimination claim if it is not included in the list of issues in a prehearing conference summary, or status conference summary, and the party was afforded an opportunity to object to the conference summary. <span class="Italic">Yovan v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 264, &#x00B6; 7 (2000). The order here, however, did not offer the parties any opportunity to challenge the AJ's rulings and it was not a prehearing conference or status conference summary. We cannot conclude that the appellant, who is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, simply abandoned his USERRA claim. <span class="Italic">Cf. Yovan</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 264, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (finding that where the AJ did not prepare a prehearing conference summary, the appellant could not have abandoned his discrimination claim and the Board would remand the appeal for further adjudication). The appellant's specific allegations about the agency's USERRA violations suggest he may have intended them as an affirmative defense. Accordingly, we REMAND this appeal for consideration of the USERRA claim. On remand, the AJ shall notify the appellant of the USERRA burdens and methods of proof.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Guzman v. VA</span>, 114 MSPR 566, 572 &#x00B6; 17, 2010 MSPB 170 (2010) ("Because the order and summary neither set forth a list of issues to be decided, nor gave the appellant notice that his affirmative defenses had been waived, it did not on its face bar the appellant from raising his whistleblower defense. For these reasons, we find that the administrative judge abused her discretion when she imposed the sanction of waiver on the appellant, precluding him from presenting his whistleblower defense.").
