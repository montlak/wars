<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-205"><span class="space">a.</span> Strength of Agency's Case; Probationer; Term Employee; Reemployed Annuitant</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wadhwa v. VA</span>, 110 MSPR 615, 622-23 &#x00B6; 15, 2009 MSPB 33 (2009) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Wadhwa v. VA</span>, 353 Fed. Appx. 435 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP)), described an agency's clear and convincing evidence supporting reassignment of a physician:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ correctly concluded that the agency presented clear and convincing evidence that it would have reassigned the appellant even absent any protected disclosures. In that regard, the AJ relied on the credibility of the agency's witnesses, as demonstrated by the straighforwardness and consistency of their statements, their calm and assured demeanor, and the absence of any motivation for them to prevaricate or of any bias against the appellant for any improper reason. The AJ was satisfied that the unrebutted testimony of these witnesses established that the appellant was reassigned (1) to address a backlog in the department to which he was assigned that had developed during his absence from the PVAMC; (2) in response to the appellant's own request that he not be returned to work for the Director of the Primary Care Clinic; (3) in light of the large number of patient complaints the appellant had received while working in his original department; and (4) to prevent the communication and collaboration problems that had arisen between the appellant and the nurses and other staff at his original department. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Significantly, there was evidence that agency management believed that the appellant had performance problems before he sent his letter to the VA IG.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reassignment was also justified in <span class="Italic">Keys v. DHUD</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the first Carr factor, substantial evidence supports the Board's finding of strong evidence of HUD's reason for the reassignment--namely, a broad reorganization consolidating certain functions in the EEO of HUD--independent of the disclosure at issue. The evidence reflects a "[p]lan for ensuring that the EEO DCM [Discrimination Complaint Manager] function is shifted back to EEO." S. Appx. 285; see also S. Appx. 290 (identifying 21 Discrimination Complaint Managers, including Mr. Keys). The record also contains testimony regarding Mr. Keys's light workload when under Mr. Breg&#x00F3;n's supervision and the contrasting need for additional personnel in the EEO under Ms. Morales-Romero's supervision. Ms. Morales-Romero's division in fact increased from six employees in early 2015 to ten by September 2015.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. DOJ</span>, <span class="blue">842 F.3d 1252</span>, 1259 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (Concurring Opinion by Judge Reyna; Dissenting Opinion by Judge Hughes) ("The first <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor is 'the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action.' <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1323. We do not focus our review of this <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor on whether the agency has put forward some evidence purporting to show independent causation, but instead we focus on whether such evidence is strong. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1323-24."); <span class="Italic">cf. Soto v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 6, n.4 (2022) (the agency's burden is not to prove its charges by clear and convincing evidence; but the strength of its proof bears on the motivational analysis).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Inappropriate handling of confidential information in VA medical records was clear and convincing evidence of misconduct sufficient to defeat a whistleblower's challenge to a removal, <span class="Italic">King v. VA</span>, 276 Fed. Appx. 993, 995-96 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board found, and the parties do not dispute, that King made protected disclosures, that she was removed from service following such disclosures, and that the disclosures were a contributing factor in <span id="Page_4009"></span>the removal action. Before us is whether the board's decision that the agency met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed her even in the absence of her protected disclosures is correct, <span class="Italic">see Marano v. Department of Justice</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1141 (Fed. Cir. 1993), and whether the penalty was within the tolerable limits of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After receiving evidence and live testimony that agency policy defines microbiology worksheets as medical records, the board concluded that the worksheets at issue are medical records, and that the agency proved the facts of the sustained charges. The board also concluded that the agency met its burden of proof because it demonstrated that it would have taken the removal action regardless of the protected disclosures due to the seriousness of her misconduct--altering, copying, and removing confidential medical records--compounded by incidents of previous misconduct that resulted in reprimands and disciplinary action, including making false statements about VA personnel, disrespectful conduct, and failing to comply with a request from her immediate supervisor. It also concluded that the agency officials involved were not motivated to retaliate against King for her protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Substantial evidence supports the board's conclusion that King violated agency policy when she (1) took the records to her home, thus removing the agency's property from its custody without authorization, and (2) added post-hoc critical documentation to the medical record a month after the patient's death occurred. She could have disclosed her first-hand knowledge regarding the alleged specimen mishandling and cover-up she perceived to OSC without altering, copying, removing to her home, and releasing confidential agency-owned medical records to OSC without following agency procedures for doing so. With respect to the removal penalty, the board balanced the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, including King's prior disciplinary history, the gravity of her misconduct, and its relation to the efficiency of the service and determined that the penalty of removal was within the tolerable limits of reasonableness. Because the board applied the appropriate legal standards, and substantial evidence supports its conclusions, its decision must stand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Prolonged, unjustified absence from the job constituted clear and convincing evidence sufficient to rebut an inference of reprisal, <span class="Italic">Gerges v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 89 MSPR 669, 682 &#x00B6; 29 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not address the findings that the appellant made protected disclosures and that those disclosures were a contributing factor in his removal. Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that those findings are correct, the record includes clear and convincing evidence that the agency would have removed the appellant in the absence of his disclosures. As indicated above, by the time the agency proposed that action, the appellant had been absent for more than 8-1/2 months; he had refused to return to work after having been ordered to do so; he had made clear his intention not to return to his position or any other in the Environmental Division; and attempts to find other suitable positions had proved unsuccessful. Under these circumstances, the agency had compelling reasons for removing the appellant. Moreover, there is no indication that the agency official who would have had the strongest motive to retaliate against the appellant--i.e., Mr. Caruthers--had any opportunity to influence the action; he had resigned from the agency more than 10 months before the removal was proposed. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's removal does not constitute reprisal for any protected disclosures he may have made.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we find that the nature of the charges provided strong support for the agency's decision to select removal as the appropriate penalty in this case. The facts upon which the agency's charges and specifications were based suggested that the appellant's relationship with her supervisors was adversarial and that her attitude toward the workplace had deteriorated to the point where she had become disrespectful, intentionally disruptive, physically abusive, and discourteous, even to those co-workers who had no connection to any of the allegedly retaliatory personnel actions the agency imposed on the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Caddell,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. at 351 (in assessing the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its reassignment of an agency manager, the Board considered the fact that the manager was deeply involved in the interpersonal problems in the district). In addition, neither the agency nor the appellant identified another agency employee who committed the type of misconduct involved in this case. Thus, there is no evidence showing that the agency treated the appellant any differently than it treats similarly situated employees who are not whistleblowers. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yunus v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether the agency has established, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken its personnel action even absent the appellant's protected disclosures, the Board will consider the following criteria: (1) The strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar action against employees who are not whistleblowers, but who are otherwise similarly situated<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Brewer v. Department of the Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 363, 370 (1997); <span class="Italic">Jones v.

Department of Agriculture</span>, 64 MSPR 46, 66 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Brewer</span> and <span class="Italic">Caddell</span>, the Board applied only the first two criteria in its "clear and convincing" analysis. In <span class="Italic">Brewer</span>, it found that the agency failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have given the appellant unsatisfactory performance ratings, even absent his whistleblowing, because (1) the appellant's supervisor could not identify any specific aspects of the appellant's performance that caused him to rate him as he did, and (2) the rating officials were the subjects of the appellant's protected disclosures<span class="Italic">. See Brewer</span>, 76 MSPR at 370-71. In <span class="Italic">Caddell</span>, the Board found that the agency showed by clear and convincing evidence that it would have reassigned the appellant, even absent his protected disclosures, where the evidence established that (1) the appellant was deeply involved in the interpersonal problems of a factionalized office; and (2) his disclosures were not directed at the officials who reassigned him<span class="Italic">. See Caddell</span>, 66 MSPR at 351-52.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Degraaff v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 73 MSPR 224 (1997), the Board resolved the appellant's individual right of action (IRA) claim, which the administrative judge incorrectly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, solely on the basis of the first criterion, i.e., the strength of the agency's evidence supporting its action. There, the Board found that, even if the appellant were to meet the "contributing factor" standard, the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action, even absent the appellant's whistleblowing, where the evidence established that the appellant left his assigned workplace without informing his supervisor, and did not return to work until more than ten days later. <span class="Italic">See Degraaff,</span> 73 MSPR at 230.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the dispositive factor in this case is the strength of the agency's evidence supporting its removal action. The agency proved the following charges: (1) Undermining the credibility of the safety program; (2) engaging in threatening and retaliatory behavior; (3) failing to carry out assigned work; (4) insubordinate defiance of authority; and (5) performing unauthorized activities while purportedly incapacitated for duty. There is no question but that the sustained misconduct was serious. Further, we have reviewed the record evidence supporting these charges, and we agree with the administrative judge's assessment that the evidence supporting the sustained charges, and consequently, its personnel action, was overwhelming.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Our review of the record has not disclosed any evidence that the agency imposes the penalty of removal on similarly-situated employees who are not whistleblowers but who engage in equally serious misconduct. Nevertheless, the lack of such evidence is not dispositive. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Brewer,</span> 76 MSPR at 370-71; <span class="Italic">Degraaff,</span> 73 MSPR at 230; <span class="Italic">Caddell,</span> 66 MSPR at 351-52.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, we conclude that the evidence of retaliatory motive in this case is insufficient to outweigh the evidence supporting the agency's removal action. Accordingly, we further conclude, on the basis of the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action, that the agency has established, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same action, even absent the appellant's protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Degraaff,</span> 73 MSPR at 230.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nonselection was justified by clear and convincing evidence, <span class="Italic">Giddings v. VA</span>, PH-1221-15-0411-W-1 (NP 8/10/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the agency met its burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the appellant's complaint. As the administrative judge found, the two agency managers who interviewed the appellant for the position provided a detailed explanation as to why <span id="Page_4010"></span>the appellant was not selected. One stated that the appellant's answers during the interview were not strong or detailed enough to support a referral for hire. The other stated that the appellant's responses were incomplete, light on substance, and failed to provide thorough examples describing her professional experience which would better enable her to succeed in the position. Both interviewers noted that the appellant failed to submit her writing sample on time. Further, both interviewers stated that they were unaware of the appellant's OIG complaint. The appellant's speculative assertion in her petition for review that they must have known because they spoke with C.M. on the day of the interview is unavailing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, there is no evidence that the interviewers or the selecting official, who also was unaware of the appellant's OIG complaint, were biased against the appellant. Further, there is no evidence that C.M. was biased against the appellant, and, in any event, there is no evidence that she influenced the interviewers or the selecting official, or manipulated the scoring process. Additionally, there were two nonselected applicants who did not file OIG complaints, indicating that other nonwhistleblowers were treated similarly. <span class="Italic">See Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1323.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brewer v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 363, 370-71 (1997), restating the timing test and measure of rebuttal evidence, determined that the agency did not present clear and convincing evidence that the appellant's performance appraisal was untainted by the reprisal that was presumed through application of the timing test. The evidence from the agency in support of its action, involving a performance rating, was inconclusive or contradictory. The agency was directed to raise elements of the appellant's performance rating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Latkovitch testified that when he rated the appellant for the period of his performance covered by the third disputed evaluation, he based his rating on the appellant's performance during the 12-month period covered by the evaluation. He did not, however, specifically identify any aspects of the appellant's performance that caused him to rate the appellant as he did. Similarly, Shope testified that the appellant's rating for the third disputed evaluation was based on his performance during the relevant time period. Shope testified that he agreed with the rating because, after reviewing the information provided by Latkovitch in the rating itself and during the rating period, he felt that the rating was correct. Shope reviewed the text of the rating and applied his own experience based on information gathered outside of what was written. As previously noted, however, an independent <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> agency panel disagreed with these agency officials and recommended that a majority of the narrative comments be deleted from the evaluation, and that certain ratings be raised. Under these circumstances, we find that the agency's evidence in support of the personnel action is not particularly strong. <span class="Italic">Cf. Jones</span>, 74 MSPR at 676-77 (where the appellant's supervisor did not specifically identify the areas in which the appellant's performance needed improvement, and did not recall all of the specific details of the appellant's performance, the agency did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have given the appellant an "exceeds fully successfully" rating absent his protected disclosures). In addition, the rating and reviewing officials, who essentially were the subjects of the appellant's disclosure by virtue of their managerial positions and responsibility for the "misunderstanding" regarding the proper use of agency funds, were not asked about their motive to retaliate. Moreover, the agency presented no evidence that it gave similar performance evaluations to employees who were not whistleblowers, but who were otherwise similarly situated to the appellant. Thus, the agency did not meet its burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence, and the appellant established that his 1994-95 performance rating was based on reprisal for his protected disclosure....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Evaluation of the agency's case includes evaluation of the agency penalty determination, <span class="Italic">Butler v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-1221-19-0077-W-1 (1/20/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Independent of proffering strong evidence in support of its charges, the agency must also submit strong evidence in support of its penalty determination. <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Department of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (stating that "the agency must still prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have imposed the <span class="Italic">exact same penalty</span> in the absence of the protected disclosures") (emphasis in original). Here, the agency's penalty determination betrays some weaknesses. At the hearing, the agency proffered virtually no <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> testimony beyond pointing out that the appellant's absence had an adverse impact on the agency because others had to perform his duties and because determining whether he was going to report to work each day was disruptive and time consuming.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a "Brief Sheet," apparently prepared by the agency's human resources office for the benefit of the deciding official, the deciding official was informed that the appellant was a 9-year employee with no prior discipline. The deciding official's written <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis mentions that the appellant has no prior discipline but does not mention his length of service and states that there are no mitigating factors. In his most recent performance rating of record, the appellant was rated "Excellence" in two critical elements and "Success" in the two remaining critical elements, with a summary rating of "Successful." Despite this good record of recent performance, the written <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis refers to the appellant's "sub-par performance" and his failure to correct his performance. The removal penalty is consistent with the agency's table of penalties, and with the penalty imposed on other employees, generally for longer periods of AWOL as discussed below, but the agency does not appear to have considered whether a lesser penalty might have had a corrective effect on the appellant's behavior.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the written <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis stated that the appellant's misconduct caused "irreparable" damage. At the hearing, the deciding official explained that the reason for the policy against male employees having one-on-one closed-door meetings with female cadets is to reduce the possibility that something might happen that could cause irreparable harm. There is no evidence, however, that anything untoward happened during the closed-door meeting underlying charge 1. Thus, although there is certainly support for the proposition that the appellant's absences from the workplace caused extra work for others and that his failure to cooperate with his supervisor over leave matters had an impact on his working relationships, we see no support for the statement that the appellant's misconduct caused "irreparable" damage.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In considering the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action, the administrative judge incorporated by reference his thorough analysis of all 25 specifications under the agency's charge. We find that the administrative judge gave due consideration to the evidence for and against each specification, and we agree that the agency's failure to prove a majority of the specifications is a sign of overreach. Moreover, contrary to the agency's suggestion in its petition for review, the administrative judge did acknowledge the extent to which the sustained conduct was disruptive to the work environment. The question, however, is not whether the appellant's conduct could have warranted discipline, but whether the agency would have removed her in the absence of her whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Savage v. Department of the Army,</span> 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 52 (2015) (remanding for further adjudication on the "clear and convincing" test even though at least one specification was sustained).

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the remand initial decision, the administrative judge also reiterated her prior finding that the agency largely ignored evidence relevant to the severity of the appellant's misconduct as it was moving forward with disciplinary action, as evidenced by the following factors:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">No one in the agency expressed contemporaneous concerns about the appellant's solicitation of record destruction; some of the solicitations predated any specific agency rule forbidding them; the appellant was unaware of the impropriety of the solicitations; the appellant stopped the solicitations as soon as he was ordered to do so; the appellant's improper arrangement with [the outside attorney] was of limited scope; and the appellant's conduct was based on the [outside attorney's] advice.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Neither the Board nor the Federal Circuit has articulated the relation of the "clear and convincing" evidentiary standard, the low threshold basis for termination of a probationary employee, and the "efficiency of the service" standard applicable to removal of an employee with ordinary MSPB adverse action appeal rights. But in <span class="Italic">DiLorenzo v. VA</span>, 296 Fed. Appx. 57 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP), the court commented on treatment by the agency of other probationary employees, along with consideration of managerial motivation, in sustaining termination of an employee who made protected disclosures but who also exhibited personal characteristics that troubled his coworkers:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 2, 2005, DiLorenzo was appointed as a certified respiratory-therapy technician by DVA for the VA Medical Center in Miami. The appointment was subject to an initial probationary period of one year. On March 23, DiLorenzo approached his supervisor, James Vance, with his concern that the staff was not using the proper methods for dispensing certain medications. This was the protected disclosure. DiLorenzo then asked for permission to approach the pharmacy students about the subject. Before the Board, Vance granted the request. Later on that same day, Vance testified, he met with DiLorenzo to ask him what he found out from the pharmacy students. According to Vance, DiLorenzo stated that the hospital had been "doing them all wrong" and that the staff hospital was guilty of "culpable negligence." DiLorenzo also purportedly explained to Vance the appropriate method that should have been employed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After DiLorenzo left the room, Vance testified that Eli Germane, a respiratory therapist who had been assigned to work with DiLorenzo that day, approached him and stated that he (Germane) overheard a pharmacist student say "that they would look into it"--not that the procedures in question were improper. Both Vance and Germane documented the incident with notes on March 30. Vance testified that he felt "lied" to by DiLorenzo.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On two occasions, DiLorenzo was alleged to have acted outside the scope of his respiratory-therapy duties. <span class="Italic">First</span>, Dixianne Marchant (Vance's supervisor) testified that on March 21, Marlene Acosta, a respiratory therapist, told her that she was with DiLorenzo at the nurses' station when she left to get some equipment. When Acosta returned, DiLorenzo informed her that he was called by housekeeping to a patient's room because the patient had pulled out his IV from his arm. DiLorenzo stated that he proceeded to apply pressure to the arm, which Acosta replied was an appropriate measure. DiLorenzo then told Acosta that he was also an EMT and knew how to reconnect the IV. Acosta then advised DiLorenzo that connection of IVs was something the nurses had to handle and was outside the scope of his duties as a respiratory therapist. Costa summarized the incident in an email written to Marchant on March 31.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Second</span>, on March 24, DiLorenzo was assigned to work with Christina Calvo, another therapist. In an email dated April 4 sent to Marchant, Calvo stated that she observed DiLorenzo checking various connections for the IVs, catheters, and unit monitors for a patient. Calvo then told DiLorenzo that he should not interfere with the connections because it was the responsibility of the registered nurses. DiLorenzo, according to Calvo's email, ignored her and continued to check the connections until the patient's nurse reiterated Calvo's remarks. Vance testified he was called to intervene and subsequently reassigned DiLorenzo to another therapist. As a result of the incident, Marchant testified, she setup a meeting with DiLorenzo and Adrian Balaguer, an administrative officer, to remind DiLorenzo the appropriate scope of his job duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Marchant also testified that several members of her team reported being "uncomfortable" around DiLorenzo and noted that one shift supervisor, Emilia Diaz-Bencomo, told her that DiLorenzo was not a "team player." In an email dated March 30 to Michael Kraus, in human resources, Marchant summarized the complaints:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This morning I have been made aware of several other issues, which have my staff on edge, understandably so. This morning he came in early and was making copies of policies, which in itself is nothing, he has told some RT staff that he works part-time for a malpractice lawyer doing case reviews and he is reviewing charts here to a degree more then [sic] would be expected and finally, the staff are under the impression that he is using his cell phone to record things being said. It seems, and I have seen it also, when he is in conversation he starts handling his cell phone. When asked he says he is putting numbers in, which is what he told me. I told him I had already given him my numbers several times. He put the phone away at that point. Jim has told me he is using legal terms for things he is "finding" and has made statements to him that we (RT) are doing things "against the law."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">My staff is paranoid when he is around, I have already had staff calling and coming to my office with their feeling regarding this individual. Needless to say the working environment is not pleasant in RT and is getting worst [sic] each day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I realize we have to follow rules and for good reason and in this case more so, but something has to be done as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Marchant then testified that her Medical Director, the Service Chief, and Krause all agreed that DiLorenzo "could potentially become a safety hazard."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kraus then forwarded the matter to Larry Brinkman, chief of human resources, who ultimately made the decision to terminate DiLorenzo. The termination letter, dated May 2, stated the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Chief, Medical Service has recommended that you be terminated during your trial period based on the following reasons:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">During your time with the VA, you have demonstrated behaviors which do not promote the efficiency of the service. You also have acted outside the scope of your duties and management instructions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Brinkman testified that the VA Medical Center terminated roughly 25 probationary employees a year--many for "very similar" reasons as DiLorenzo. Brinkman also testified that he was aware of DiLorenzo's disagreement over how medication was dispersed and checked with a specialist who advised that the VA Medical Center was doing nothing wrong. Regardless of the disagreement, however, Brinkman stated that DiLorenzo would have been terminated based on his "inability to get along with others" and his "problem following instructions."</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">After exhausting his administrative remedies before the Office of Special Counsel ("OSC"), DiLorenzo filed an individual right of action ("IRA") appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board alleging that DVA had violated the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 U.S.C. 1211. In a decision dated February 10, 2006, the administrative judge dismissed DiLorenzo's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The full board then vacated the decision and remanded the case for further adjudication of the jurisdictional issues and, if necessary, adjudication on the merits. After holding two hearings, the administrative judge determined that jurisdiction was established because DiLorenzo had made non-frivolous allegations that he made a protected disclosure and that the disclosure was a contributing factor to DVA's decision to terminate. The administrative judge also found, however, that DVA had established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have terminated DiLorenzo's employment absent his protected disclosures. DiLorenzo's request for corrective action was therefore denied. The decision was rendered final on February 6, 2008, and the full board denied DiLorenzo's petition for review with one board member dissenting on the ground that DVA had not carried its burden by clear and convincing evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;Legal Standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal where the petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies and has made non-frivolous allegations that: (1) he or she engaged in whistleblowing activity by <span id="Page_4012"></span>making a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8) and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action as defined by 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Fields v. DOJ,</span> 452 F.3d 1297, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Once jurisdiction is established, the petitioner must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the protected disclosure was a contributing factor to the personnel action. If the disclosure was a contributing factor, then the burden shifts to the agency to show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5. U.S.C. 1221(e). With respect to evidence expressly relied on by the administrative judge, we must affirm a finding of independent causation unless the petitioner establishes that it is unsupported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 7703(c)(3). When determining whether the agency has satisfied its burden the following three factors will be considered: (1) the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Sec. Admin.,</span> 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge determined that DiLorenzo had satisfied his initial burden to show that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the decision to terminate his employment. We therefore limit review to the Board's determination that DVA satisfied its burden by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;The AJ's Decision Was Supported by Ample Evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Evaluating the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors here, we affirm the AJ's findings. <span class="Italic">First</span>, the agency's decision to terminate DiLorenzo's employment is supported by substantial evidence. On two separate occasions, DiLorenzo had to be told not to involve himself with the connections of IVs, catheters, and unit monitors. The first incident involving Marlene Acosta, by itself, was not particularly alarming. Three days after the first episode, however, DiLorenzo once again had to be told that his responsibilities did not include IVs, catheters, and unit monitors. This time, his assigned respiratory therapist for the day, Christine Calvo, stated in email that DiLorenzo "disregarded [her] statements" until a registered nurse stepped in. Although the record is unclear as to whether DiLorenzo actually connected or disconnected any IV, Calvo believed DiLorenzo was ignoring her instructions. Vance testified that he was soon called to intervene and assigned DiLorenzo to another respiratory therapist. The AJ also credited Vance's testimony that DiLorenzo had lied to him about the conversation with the pharmacy students regarding whether the medications were being properly administered. Vance's version of the incident was evidenced by a note written by Eli Germane who overheard the conversation with the pharmacy students. Vance subsequently reported the incident to his supervisor, Marchant. Next, Marchant testified that DiLorenzo had problems working with the rest of the staff, was not a team player, and was making other employees generally feel uncomfortable. She then spoke to her Medical Director, the Service Chief, and Krause who advised her that DiLorenzo's problems could potentially be a safety hazard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Second</span>, there is no evidence indicating any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials involved in the decision to terminate. Significantly, DiLorenzo was never admonished when he approached Vance to discuss his concerns over implementing the proper methods for dispensing medications. To the contrary, Vance <span class="Italic">encouraged</span> DiLorenzo to approach the pharmacy students to address the subject. In addition, although Brinkman (the official in charge of making the final decision to terminate) admitted he was aware of DiLorenzo's challenges, there is no evidence that he took them into account when making his decision. Brinkman instead testified that DiLorenzo was primarily released because he could not get along with his co-workers and supervisors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Third</span>, there is substantial evidence demonstrating that the agency treated DiLorenzo no differently than other employees who did not make protected disclosures. Brinkman testified that approximately 25 probationary employees were terminated each year--many for similar reasons as DiLorenzo. While DiLorenzo argues that Brinkman's testimony was lacking and unsubstantiated, there is simply no other evidence on the record indicating otherwise.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Lucchetti v. Dept. of Interior,</span> 754 Fed. Appx. 542 (9th Cir. 2018 NP) ("Lucchetti agrees that a 'similarly situated' employee in this case would be a 'probationary employee with a good work record.' The Board correctly found there were no such employees.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Watkins v. DOD</span>, DC-1221-13-0230-W-3 (NP 1/31/2023), offered oblique commentary on the relation of probationary status and assessment of agency retaliatory motive:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We agree with her conclusion that it was reasonable for the agency to expect a higher standard of decorum and diplomacy from a supervisor, especially at the appellant's level, and that it was entirely appropriate for the agency to use the probationary period[8] to assess the appellant's ability to perform the functions of his position, including his ability to form productive professional relationships. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">De Cleene v. Department of Education</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 651, 655 (1996) (finding that an employee who engages in misconduct may be held to a higher standard if he encumbers a supervisory position). This factor weighs heavily in the agency's favor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The appellant contended below that the agency had an illegal double standard for probationary and permanent employees. The purpose of the probationary period is to allow a Federal agency to assess an employee's conduct and performance and to be able to terminate an unsatisfactory employee's employment quickly before the due process rights of a tenured civil servant vest. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Calixto v. Department of Defense</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 557, &#x00B6; 14 (2014) (explaining the purposes of the probationary period for nonsupervisory employees under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.803(a)). This will inevitably mean that, sometimes, a probationer will lose his job when a permanent employee who commits the same or a more serious offense might not. This is not "illegal," but by design. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a) (excluding probationers from the statutory definition of "employee" for purposes of the Board's adverse action jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Less obliquely, <span class="Italic">Watkins,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> discounted comparisons of conduct of probationers and tenured employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor involves comparing employees who are similarly and not identically situated. <span class="Italic">Soto</span>, 2022 MSPB 6, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">see also Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1373. Nevertheless, there is a vast difference between probationary employees and permanent employees, not least of which is that they are subject to different standards governing discipline. Permanent employees can only be disciplined for reasons that promote the efficiency of the service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7503(a), 7513(a). If a permanent employee is disciplined, he has the right to appeal adverse actions to the Board, provided he meets the statutory definition of "employee" set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a). There is no statute containing standards governing the discipline of probationers and, therefore, no limits on an agency's discretion in this area so long as the agency's action does not violate some other statute, such as one of the anti-discrimination statutes or the Whistleblower Protection Act. In other words, an agency can terminate a probationary employee for any reason or no reason, so long as that reason is not an illegal reason. A prudent agency, therefore, ensures that it has amassed sufficient evidence to support its case, is careful to provide due process rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution, and affords a tenured employee the procedural rights set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 and any other law, rule, regulation, or union contract that might be applicable in a particular case. A probationer is entitled to none of these things. Because an agency does not need a reason to terminate a probationer, it need not collect any evidence or prepare itself to prove anything, although it would be prudent to do so in most cases. The fact that the law permits the agency to terminate the appellant's employment during his probationary period for any reason that is not illegal means that he is not similarly situated to permanent employees, who can only be removed for reasons that promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chavez v. VA</span>, 120 MSPR 285, 298-301 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28-35, 2013 MSPB 83 (2013), concluded that a VA probationary nurse was terminated as a result of whistleblowing reprisal after she reported substandard medical procedures at a medical center:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In determining whether an agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of whistleblowing, the Board generally considers the agency's evidence in support of its action; the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the first <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, we agree with the appellant that the agency's action was procedurally defective. Both agency policy and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations at 5 C.F.R. part 315 require that the information contained in a probationary termination notice "shall, at a minimum, consist of the agency's conclusions as to the inadequacies of [the probationer's] performance or conduct." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.804; VA Handbook 5021/6, Part III, Chapter 2, &#x00B6; 4. Here, the agency indicated in its termination notice that the appellant was being terminated due to "inappropriate behavior and unprofessional conduct," but it provided no detail whatsoever as to the nature of those alleged inadequacies. While it was permissible for the agency to state the reasons for its action in conclusory fashion, the information provided was so vague as to convey scarcely more than the bare fact that the agency was terminating the appellant for alleged unsatisfactory conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, the agency's failure to provide a procedurally adequate termination notice does not by itself indicate that the agency lacked <span id="Page_4013"></span>evidence in support of its action. In that regard, the administrative judge found that the evidence available to the agency at the time of its action was "not weak, but [was] not particularly strong." As the administrative judge observed, OPM regulations mandate that agencies use the probationary period "as fully as possible" to determine an employee's fitness and "terminate [a probationer's] services during this period if he fails to demonstrate fully his qualifications for continued employment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.803(a). The record reflects that the appellant had excellent nursing skills, did not take any annual or sick leave, and often worked overtime. However, Wyatt testified that, while the appellant's clinical performance was good, her "personality" caused problems. According to Wyatt, the appellant failed to be a team player and constantly found fault with others. Wyatt testified that other employees felt intimidated by the appellant, that the team was always in an "uproar," and that, while there was drama before and after the appellant's employment at the CLC, it increased while the appellant was there. Tordini testified that, after consulting with the CLC Director, she felt it was necessary to terminate the appellant because the tenor of the unit and relationships among the staff were getting worse rather than improving.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent the tensions cited by Wyatt and Tordini were the result of the appellant's alleged inability to work with others, we agree that, notwithstanding the appellant's excellent performance, the agency's rationale was consistent with the purpose of the probationary period as set forth in OPM's regulations. However, the administrative judge did not consider the extent to which the dysfunctional work environment at CLC was the result of the appellant's coworkers' hostile reaction to her whistleblowing and was exacerbated by Wyatt's failure to maintain confidentiality with regard to the appellant's disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Whitmore v. Department of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (the administrative judge erred in failing to give serious consideration to the fact that the appellant's whistleblowing marked the beginning of seriously strained relationships with agency officials). We therefore conclude that the administrative judge overestimated the strength of the evidence in support of the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the second <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, the strength of the agency's motive to retaliate, the appellant testified that Wyatt stated that on more than one occasion that she would never forget that the appellant "went over her head" by reporting issues to Tordini and that on the day she was terminated Wyatt asked her, "Remember how I told you I would never forgive you for going over my head?" Although Wyatt denied ever making that statement and testified that the appellant's complaints to Tordini played no role in the termination decision, the administrative judge found based on Wyatt's demeanor at the hearing that her testimony on this point was not credible. <span class="Italic">See Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the Board must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing). Nonetheless, the administrative judge found Wyatt's motivation to retaliate against the appellant was "weak" because her own conduct was not implicated in the appellant's disclosures and no corrective action was taken against her. The administrative judge further found no indication that the appellant's disclosures reached anyone higher in the chain of command than Tordini, and no evidence that the appellant's protected disclosures implicated Tordini's conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the administrative judge erred in taking an overly restrictive view of the second <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor. Although neither Wyatt nor Tordini were directly implicated or harmed by the disclosures, the appellant's criticisms reflected on both in their capacity as managers and employees, which is sufficient to establish a substantial retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">See Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1370-71 (the appellant's criticisms cast the agency, and by implication all of the responsible officials, in a highly critical light by calling into question the propriety and honesty of their official conduct); <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 69 (2011) (finding motive to retaliate because the appellant's disclosures reflected on the responsible agency officials as representatives of the general institutional interests of the agency); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of Transportation</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 73, &#x00B6; 23 (2010) (finding that comments generally critical of the agency's leadership would reflect poorly on officials responsible for monitoring the performance of the field staff and making sure that agency regulations are carried out correctly and consistently). Accordingly, we conclude the second <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor weighs significantly against a finding that the agency would have terminated the appellant in the absence of her whistleblowing activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, the appellant contended that the agency did not take similar action against another probationary LVN who, according to the appellant, reported to work late and talked on her cell phone to the detriment of performing her duties. Our reviewing court has held that, under <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, the requirement that comparator employees be "similarly situated" does not require "virtual identity" and that "[d]ifferences in kinds and degrees of conduct between otherwise similarly situated persons within an agency can and should be accounted for." <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1373. This is particularly true where, as here, there is only a single person in the record for which a comparison can be made. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1373-74. Here, the appellant and the other LVN were similarly situated in that both were probationary LVNs supervised by Wyatt. Even in light of <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, however, we agree with the administrative judge that the other LVN's deficiencies were not sufficiently similar to the reasons for the appellant's termination to provide persuasive evidence regarding the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor. <span class="Italic">Cf. Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1373 (the comparator employee's hostile conduct "could well be considered the very same kind of disruptive and intimidating behavior, conduct unbecoming a supervisor, and inappropriate conduct in the workplace for which Whitmore was charged").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our review of the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors, we conclude that, contrary to the initial decision, the agency has not met its burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that it would have terminated the appellant absent her protected disclosures. The appellant is therefore entitled to corrective action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Erwin v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-1221-15-0418-W-1 (NP 9/7/2016) (Separate Opinion of Chairman Grundmann: responding to the distinctions between the reasons cited in the proposal and decision, and concentrating on the reason sustained by the agency but not, in the estimation of Ms. Grundmann, proved: "Without evidence to support its action, the agency cannot meet its burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action in the absence of the appellant's protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Armstrong v.

Dept. of Transp.</span>, 511 Fed. Appx. 984 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP), implied that differences in the types of appointments held by employees may distinguish them for IRA analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also disagrees with the administrative judge's determination that there was no indication that the agency treated non-whistleblowers more favorably because a supervisory air traffic controller was punished but not removed from his position based on allegations that he engaged in inappropriate behavior in the workplace. The appellant does not, however, allege that this individual was serving a term appointment when he engaged in the conduct that led to his punishment, like the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (in determining whether an agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of whistleblowing, the Board will consider all of the relevant factors including, among other things, evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But <span class="Italic">Soto v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 6 (2022), determined that the whistleblower analysis does not vary for a reemployed annuitant who is generally terminable at the will of the appointing authority.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant is mistaken in his impression that the agency must prove the elements of its charges by clear and convincing evidence. In a chapter 75 adverse action appeal involving an affirmative defense of whistleblowing reprisal, proof of the agency's charges may lend support to a finding that the agency proved by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the appellant's protected disclosures or protected activity. <span class="Italic">See Shibuya v.
