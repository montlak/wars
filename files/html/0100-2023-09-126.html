<p class="Body-Text">Mootness is avoided, even if an agency rescinds an action, if an appeal includes a claim for compensatory damages based on a nonfrivolous affirmative defense of discrimination, <span class="Italic">Currier v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 191, 195-99 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The mootness doctrine, which stems from the "case or controversy" requirement of Article III of the Constitution, is also jurisdictional in nature. <span class="Italic">See Nasatka v. Delta Scientific Corp.</span>, 58 F.3d 1578, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 116 S. Ct. 912, 133 L. Ed.2d 843 (1996). Although the Board is not an Article III court, it is governed by an analogous statutory provision that prohibits it from issuing advisory opinions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(h). A case is moot when the issues presented are no longer "live" or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the case. <span class="Italic">Powell v. McCormack</span>, 395 U.S. 486, 496, 89 S. Ct. 1944, 1950-51, 23 L. Ed.2d 491 (1969); <span class="Italic">Horner v. MSPB</span>, 815 F.2d 668, 670-71 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Occhipinti v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 61 MSPR 504, 507 (1994). Mootness can arise at any stage of litigation, and an appeal will be dismissed as moot when, by virtue of an intervening event, the Board cannot grant any effectual relief whatever in favor of the appellant, <span class="Italic">viz.</span>, when the appellant, by whatever means, obtained all of the relief he could have obtained had he prevailed before the Board, and thereby lost any legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Calderon v. Moore</span>, 116 S. Ct. 2066, 135 L. Ed.2d 453 (1996); <span class="Italic">Perisho v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 55, 58 (1995); <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 68 MSPR 439, 441 (1995); <span class="Italic">Mascarenas v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 60 MSPR 320, 323 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Put another way, once Board jurisdiction has attached, it cannot be divested based on mootness unless the appellant has received all of the possible relief he sought before the Board, i.e., unless it is impossible for the Board to grant any further effectual relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nasatka</span>, 58 F.3d at 1580; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Dalton v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 66 MSPR 429, 434 (1995); <span class="Italic">Hatler v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 3 MSPB 406, 3 MSPR 322, 325 (1980) (stating that mootness is determined by reference to the allegations of the complaining party (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Network Project v. Corp. for Public Broadcasting</span>, 561 F.2d 963, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1977), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 434 U.S. 1068, 98 S. Ct. 1247, 55 L. Ed.2d 770 (1978)). <span id="Page_1046"></span>The available remedy need not be "fully satisfactory" to avoid mootness: a partial remedy is sufficient. <span class="Italic">Calderon</span>, 116 S. Ct. at 2067.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA), compensatory damages[4] were not available in Board appeals. <span class="Italic">See Nordhoff v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The CRA does not authorize compensatory damages for age discrimination prohibited by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v.

Thus, the holding here does not preclude a dismissal for mootness where the action appealed is completely rescinded, the appellant's only discrimination claim is under the ADEA, and there are no other viable claims for relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to the CRA, when a personnel action was appealed to the Board, the available relief was limited to complete rescission of the action appealed, consisting of cancellation of the action; the appellant's restoration (if applicable) to his former or other substantially equivalent position, as appropriate; back pay; interest on back pay; and other employment benefits that he would have received had the action not occurred. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Green v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 34, 35 (1994). This type of relief has been described as <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief. <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The Board has therefore stated that an appeal must be dismissed as moot when the agency completely rescinds the action appealed, or when the appellant has been returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">E.g., Ferguson v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 23 MSPR 55, 56 (1984); <span class="Italic">Himmel</span>, 6 MSPR at 486; <span class="Italic">see Bruning v. Veterans Administration</span>, 834 F.2d 1019, 1021 (Fed. Cir. 1987). None of these cases, however, involved the issue of potential compensatory damages. As further discussed below, we find that such descriptions of the mootness standard--i.e., descriptions in terms of "complete rescission" or "return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>"--are no longer apt in those mixed-cases where the issue of potential compensatory damages is raised. This is because such descriptions were based on the pre-CRA limits on the Board's remedial authority, and do not reflect all of the relief now available before the Board in mixed cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To reiterate, the standard for mootness is whether the appellant has received all of the possible, effectual relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Church of Scientology of California v.

Where, as here, an appellant has outstanding, viable claims of compensatory damages before the Board, the agency's complete rescission of the action appealed does not afford him all of the relief available before the Board, so that the mere rescission does not render the appeal moot. <span class="Italic">See Consolidated Rail Corp. v.

Moreover, the Board has held in pre-CRA cases that it is required to review discrimination claims in mixed cases, such as this, even where the discrimination claims could not afford any further relief because the Board had already determined that the action appealed should be reversed for other reasons. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Marchese v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 461, 464 (1987); <span class="Italic">see also Totten v.

Nor has the appellant consented to the divestiture of Board jurisdiction; in fact, he has vigorously opposed it. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Himmel</span>, 6 MSPR at 486. We therefore find that this appeal may not be dismissed.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;We note that an AJ is not precluded from striking a discrimination claim as frivolous, even before a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Crawford v.

Once any discrimination claims have been properly stricken as frivolous, and assuming there are no other types of outstanding, viable claims for relief before the Board, <span class="Italic">cf. supra</span> n.5, the AJ may dismiss an appeal as moot upon the agency's complete rescission of the action appealed. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Powell v.

Dept. of the Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 386, 388-89 (1996) (dismissing as moot an IRA appeal in which the appellant was afforded an opportunity to prove his claim for consequential damages but failed to do so).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We further note that where an appellant has raised a nonfrivolous claim of discrimination, but has not specifically raised any claim for compensatory damages, the AJ should afford him a specific opportunity to raise such a claim before dismissing his appeal as moot based on the agency's complete rescission of the action appealed. <span class="Italic">Cf. Yates v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 172, 180 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's argument below and on review that his claim for attorney fees also precluded the dismissal of this appeal as moot, we find that it is without merit. The Board has held that outstanding attorney fee issues do not prevent the dismissal of an appeal as moot. <span class="Italic">Koerner v. OPM</span>, 51 MSPR 365, 367 (1991); <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 689, 690 (1991); <span class="Italic">Young v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 21 MSPR 541, 543 (1984). In addition, the Board has held that attorney fees may be awarded in an appeal that is dismissed as moot<span class="Italic">. Garstkiewicz</span>, 46 MSPR at 690. Unlike attorney fees, compensatory damages could not be awarded in an appeal such as this, if it is dismissed as moot without addressing discrimination issues. Although an AJ has the discretion to bifurcate the compensatory damage issues for administrative convenience[9], such a bifurcation should not have the effect of depriving the appellant of his right to compensatory damages based on his discrimination claims. We therefore conclude that attorney fee issues are distinguishable from compensatory damages issues for purposes of determining mootness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;An AJ has wide discretion to control the proceedings before her. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(b); <span class="Italic">Wildberger v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, because the agency rescinded the appellant's removal and returned her to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, we must determine whether the Board has authority to award compensatory damages for discrimination and EEO reprisal claims.

<p class="Block-Quote1">This practice of awarding of damages is consistent with the structure of the CSRA. The CSRA provides for a complex interplay between the Board and the EEOC.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with their relative roles in adjudicating appealable actions, the Board generally defers to the EEOC on issues of substantive discrimination law unless the EEOC's decision rests on civil service law for its support or is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law. <span class="Italic">Southerland</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 51, &#x00B6; 12.

<p class="Block-Quote1">This reasoning is equally applicable here, particularly because, as discussed above, an employee's only right to an administrative hearing on a discrimination claim related to an otherwise appealable action is before the Board.

Department of the Air Force</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 590, 593-94 (1997). Although it reasonably may be argued that the question of whether compensatory damages are available in the administrative process involves the Board's jurisdiction, and therefore is a matter of civil service law, the Board previously has found that, at base, the issue is one of discrimination law. <span class="Italic">Crosby v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 263, &#x00B6; 8 (1998). The Board reasoned that the authority for compensatory damages derives from the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which is discrimination law, and implicates not just the Board's authority, but that of the EEOC. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, if an appellant prevails in an appeal before the Board based on a finding of discrimination, she may recover compensatory damages from the agency pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1991. <span class="Italic">Hocker v. Department of Transportation</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 497, 505 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd per curiam</span>, 64 F.3d <span id="Page_1048"></span>676 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(c) (reflecting the Board's authority to award compensatory damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1991). We continue to defer to the EEOC's interpretation of the Board's ability to award compensatory damages, which we find is not so unreasonable as to amount to a violation of civil service law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of our finding that <span class="Italic">Savage</span> does not alter the Board's previous practice of awarding compensatory damages, we find that the appeal is not moot.</p>

VA</span>, 72 MSPR 470, 472-73 (1996) ("[W]here an appellant has raised a nonfrivolous claim of discrimination, but has not specifically raised any claim for compensatory damages, the administrative judge should afford him a specific opportunity to raise such a claim before dismissing his appeal as moot based on the agency's complete rescission of the action appealed.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An exception to principle that an EEO damages claim avoids mootness of a canceled action, if the action leading to the appeal is based on loss of a security clearance, no damages will be available and the claim for damages will not avoid mootness, <span class="italic">Daujotas v. DOD</span>, CH-0752-19-0455-I-1 (NP 2/23/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, if an appellant raises a claim of compensatory damages over an appealable action, the agency's complete rescission of the action appealed does not afford her all of the relief available before the Board and the appeal is not moot. <span class="italic">Hess v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 40, &#x00B6; 8 (2016). Lack of mootness in such circumstances is premised on the Board's ability to award compensatory damages. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 19. The Board lacks authority to review allegations of prohibited discrimination or reprisal related to the revocation or suspension of a security clearance. <span class="italic">Putnam v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 532, &#x00B6; 19 (2014). Because the Board cannot consider such allegations, it cannot make a finding that the agency violated the appellant's rights under the Rehabilitation Act. Such a finding is a prerequisite to awarding compensatory damages for disability discrimination in Federal employment. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(2). Thus, the fact that the appellant raised a disability discrimination claim does not prevent a mootness finding here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the appellant to establish a viable claim of discrimination after an agency cancels an appealable action, the AJ must permit the appellant to engage in discovery, <span class="Italic">Deas v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 108 MSPR 637, 648-49 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-20, 2008 MSPB 101 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant has yet to allege facts that, if true, would support an inference that the agency's action of placing him on enforced leave was a pretext for race discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, an appellant is entitled to engage in discovery in attempting to obtain relevant information in support of his discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">Redd,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 182, &#x00B6; 15. Relevant information includes information that appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. <span class="Italic">McGrath v. Department of the Army,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 7 (1999); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(a). What constitutes relevant material in discovery is to be liberally interpreted, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. 170, 174 (1981), but an AJ has broad discretion in ruling on discovery matters, and, absent a showing of abuse of discretion, the Board will not find reversible error in such rulings, <span class="Italic">Key v. General Services Administration,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 66, 68 (1993); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant's allegations on the current record are insufficient to allege a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination on the basis of disparate treatment, we find that the AJ abused her discretion in denying the appellant the opportunity to engage in discovery regarding the suspension proposal. Such information would have been reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence in this appeal. Moreover, even if the appellant were to make nonfrivolous discrimination allegations pertaining only to the suspension proposal and not to the final agency decision, such allegations would still be adequate to create a discrimination issue for which the appellant would be entitled to a hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under law developed before <span class="Italic">Currier,</span> If the agency withdrew an adverse action and the Board dismisses the appeal as moot, the Board had no obligation to remand to the agency related claims of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Maestas v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 86-822).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A claim for consequential damages for a violation of law that did not establish the right to those damages did not prevent dismissal for mootness of a canceled action, <span class="Italic">Tawadrous v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> DA-0752-10-0493-I-1 (NP 8/8/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the administrative judge also correctly determined that the appellant's affirmative defense under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) does not preclude dismissal of the instant appeal as moot. When an appellant has raised what appears to be a further claim for compensatory damages before the Board, the agency's complete rescission of the adverse action does not afford the appellant all the relief that he could receive if the matter had been adjudicated and he had prevailed. <span class="Italic">See Antonio v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 626, &#x00B6; 13 (2008). Although the appellant raised an affirmative defense of reprisal under section 2302(b)(9), it would provide no further relief, even if proven. Alleged violations of section 2302(b)(9) are not an independent source of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Booker v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 53 M.S.P.R. 507, 510, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 982 F.2d 517 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Although the Board is authorized to adjudicate a claim of reprisal for activities protected under section 2302(b)(9) when such a claim is interposed as an affirmative defense to an otherwise appealable action, <span class="Italic">see Moss v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 309, &#x00B6; 10, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 230 F.3d 1372 (Fed.

Further, the Board lacks the statutory authority to award consequential damages in cases where, as here, a claim of reprisal for activities protected under section 2302(b)(9) is interposed as an affirmative defense. Such relief may only be awarded in the context of a petition for corrective action brought by the Office of Special Counsel under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(g).</p>
