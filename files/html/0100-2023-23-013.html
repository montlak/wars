<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-15"><span class="space">f.</span> Oral Agreement to Be Followed by Written Agreement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The parties may agree that an oral settlement will be superseded by a written agreement. The written agreement may then add terms not contained in the oral settlement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 371, 374 (1997). If there is no reservation that the written agreement will be the only agreement, an oral agreement is binding. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gray v. DOD</span>, 91 Fed. Appx. 137, 140 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP) (oral agreement recorded by AJ was binding when AJ made clear that the oral agreement, not a subsequent written agreement, controlled disposition of the appeal); <span class="Italic">Ali v. Dept. of Army</span>, 50 MSPR 563, 569 (1991) ("Although the appellant states that he did not sign the agreement, we find nothing in the record that would support a finding that it was not to be binding until it was reduced to writing and signed by all of the parties."); <span class="Italic">Foster v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3212) (oral settlement controlled despite the appellant's unwillingness to later sign a written agreement memorializing the oral agreement); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Futrell-Rawls v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 322, 2010 MSPB 238 (2010) (although it was not the dispositive point of the case, the parties reached what appeared to be a complete verbal settlement, recorded and accepted in a "close of record" telephone conference between the parties and the AJ, and the agency later submitted to the appellant a more detailed settlement document; the Board implied that the agency's more detailed settlement suggested that the verbal agreement was not a meeting of the minds of the parties).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If, after an AJ reaches what the parties believe to be an acceptable settlement through a telephone conference, the parties then want their own signed agreement placed into the record rather than the AJ's summary of the conference agreement, the AJ should inform the parties both of the date the record will close and of the need for them to submit any agreement to the Board before that date if it is to be considered part of the record. <span class="Italic">Moore v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 237, 240 (1988). The operative agreement, however, if the case is settled through an oral agreement, remains the oral agreement, unless it is superseded by a different written agreement. If the parties provide a firm oral settlement to the AJ, the fact that they inform the AJ that they wish to reduce the agreement to writing does not detract from the effect of the oral settlement. <span class="Italic">Durham v. TVA</span>, 42 MSPR 480, 486 (1989) (implying that matters would be different had the parties stated that there was no agreement without a written agreement); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Tiburzi v. DOJ</span>, 269 F.3d 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (discussed earlier in the chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-23-011.html#sec16-13">Specific Oral Settlement Agreement Entered into the Record</a>"). The AJ may set a date for receipt of the written agreement; a prior, recorded oral agreement will be given effect if the written agreement is not received by the date set by the AJ. <span class="Italic">Shean v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 27, 29 (1996) ("The oral settlement agreement is the official settlement agreement of record in this appeal. That the appellant has subsequently declined to sign a written document memorializing the terms of the earlier oral agreement is of no legal consequence."); <span class="Italic">Lavertue v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 110, 113 (1992) (AJ made it clear that, without the submission of a timely written settlement, the taped oral agreement would be the final and enforceable settlement agreement of record); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 179, 183 n.4 (1997) ("We find nothing in the record that would support a finding that the oral settlement was not to be binding until it was reduced to writing and signed by all of the parties.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the parties reach an oral settlement, accepted by the AJ, but then quickly submit to the AJ a written agreement signed by both parties, the written agreement supercedes the oral agreement if neither party contends that the oral agreement is controlling. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOD</span>, 94 MSPR 669, 673 n.2 (2003) (before the AJ issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal as settled based on the oral agreement, the written agreement was submitted to the AJ). If the parties want a signed, written agreement as a condition to disposition of the appeal, to avoid the finality of oral settlement discussions with the AJ, the record must reflect that the settlement is not to be binding until it is reduced to writing and signed by all of the parties. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ali v. Dept. of Army</span>, 50 MSPR 563, 569 (1991). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-011.html#sec16-13">Specific Oral Settlement Agreement Entered into the Record</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Army,</span> 157 Fed. Appx. 295, 296-98 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), pointed out the need to keep in mind that an oral settlement binds the parties, even if they are given leave to submit a later written agreement, unless it is made explicit to the AJ that the appeal is not settled without the written, signed agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts are undisputed. After the Department of the Army ("Army") removed its employee Brown, he appealed that action to the Board. At the opening of the hearing on October 13, 2004 before the Board's administrative judge, that official announced that the parties had reached a settlement, which the government's attorney read into the record. The settlement agreement contained sixteen paragraphs. It included provisions in which the Army agreed to change the action it had taken against Brown "from removal to resignation for personal reasons," and Brown to "withdraw with prejudice" his appeal to the Board and other litigation he had instituted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After government counsel stated that he had "agree[d] to" the terms of the agreement read into the record, Brown (who is represented by counsel) stated, in response to questions by the administrative judge, that he had had an opportunity to discuss the terms with his counsel and that he "agree[d] to these terms." Brown's lawyer stated that he also "agree[d] to the terms of the agreement as read."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge then stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"I will accept this settlement agreement into the record, and I will dismiss the appeal based on that settlement. However, if the parties choose to supplement the record with a written settlement agreement, I will keep the record open through October 22, 2004."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the close of the hearing, the administrative judge stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I'm making clear that I don't need a supplemental written agreement to settle the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I have accepted that the settlement as you've just agreed to as the settlement agreement, and I'm just allowing the parties the opportunity through the 22nd. If they want to supplement it with a written agreement that's consistent with those terms, that's fine.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">But the case is settled based on the written agreement--I mean, based on the settlement agreement the parties just entered into the record. Okay?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At no point during the administrative hearing did Brown contend, or even suggest, that the agreement would not be effective unless and until the parties signed it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision dismissing the appeal because of the settlement agreement, the administrative judge stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I have reviewed the agreement, and I am satisfied it is lawful on its face, it was freely reached by the parties, and the parties understand its terms. Accordingly, the agreement is enforceable by the Board and will be entered into the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Brown, represented by different counsel, filed with the full Board a petition to review the initial decision. He made various contentions, including the claim that the settlement agreement was ineffective because it had not been signed by the parties. The Board denied the petition for review, thus making the administrative judge's initial decision the final decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Brown contends that the settlement agreement was ineffective because it was not signed by the parties. Because Brown did not raise that issue before the administrative judge, it is not properly before us. <span id="Page_4762"></span>"Where, as here, the Board denied review of the administrative judge's initial decision, this court will not consider issues not raised before the administrative judge." <span class="Italic">Elmore v. Dept. of Transportation</span>, 421 F.3d 1339, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2005). <span class="Italic">See Meglio v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 758 F.2d 1576, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, Brown's challenge to the settlement agreement fails on its merits. "It is well-established that an oral settlement agreement is binding on the parties, particularly when the terms are memorialized into the record." <span class="Italic">Tiburzi v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 269 F.3d 1346, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (quoting <span class="Italic">Sargent v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 229 F.3d 1088, 1090 (Fed. Cir. 2000)). "[W]here the parties intend to enter into an oral agreement, it is binding on the parties even if its terms are not embodied in a subsequent written instrument." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 269 F.3d at 1352.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the proceedings before the administrative judge leave no doubt that the parties intended, and the administrative judge understood, the oral settlement to be binding. Although the administrative judge left the record open for nine days to permit the parties to sign an agreement (if they elected to do so), he also stated that "the case is settled based on the settlement agreement the parties just entered into the record," and that he was merely "allowing the parties that opportunity...to supplement it with a written agreement that is consistent with those terms." Although one sentence in the settlement agreement refers to "the date of his signature on this agreement" as the cut-off date for Brown's claims against the Army that the agreement settled, that statement does not trump the strong evidence in the record that the parties understood and intended that the unsigned settlement agreement disposed of this litigation. Brown never contended otherwise before the administrative judge, and he publicly stated (as did his attorney) that he agreed with the settlement terms read into the record. Brown has not directly challenged or refuted the Board's determination that the settlement agreement was "lawful on its face...freely reached by the parties, and the parties understand its terms." The record does not support Brown's contention that the settlement was involuntary and thus invalid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the written confirmation of the oral agreement is submitted after the initial decision has been issued, it is not likely that the Board will enforce the written agreement without the parties' assurances that the written agreement supersedes the oral agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Putnam v. DHUD</span>, 44 MSPR 533, 535 n.1 (1990). The point was made in <span class="Italic">Clark v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 78, 81-82 (1989), that a party cannot unilaterally expand upon an oral agreement by supplying a written agreement, signed by only one party, that includes additional terms:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is the oral settlement agreement that is enforceable before the Board under <span class="Italic">Mahoney</span> and <span class="Italic">Robertson</span>, not the written confirmation of the agreement.... The written confirmation of the agreement is of no effect; its purpose is only to memorialize in writing the terms of the settlement that had been orally reached at the parties' conference.... Since the written confirmation of the settlement agreement prepared by the agency contains matters that were not included in the oral agreement, those matters are not part of the agreement (unless the appellant consents to the modification of the agreement and the administrative judge approves the modification) and do not constitute a basis for setting aside the agreement....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, <span class="Italic">Schwartz v. Dept. of Educ</span>., 113 MSPR 601, 604-05 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7, 2010 MSPB 93 (2010), concluded that an oral agreement controls over a subsequent written agreement unless the parties state in the verbal settlement that only a written agreement will control:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges on review that the agency representative sent him a written version of the settlement agreement that is inconsistent with the oral agreement. The appellant describes the alleged inconsistencies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument provides no basis to disturb the initial decision because it does not concern the validity of the oral settlement agreement. Generally, an oral settlement agreement is valid and binding on the parties even though the appellant has subsequently declined to sign a written document memorializing the terms of the agreement. Even if there is language suggesting that the oral agreement will be subsequently reduced to writing, the agreement is still binding absent a showing that the parties did not intend to be bound until a written agreement was signed. <span class="Italic">Tiburzi v. Department of Justice,</span> 269 F.3d 1346, 1351-54 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 36, &#x00B6; 7 (2002). In this case, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal based on the oral settlement agreement, and the tape recording of that agreement makes clear that the parties intended it to be binding, <span class="Italic">see Scott v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 650, &#x00B6; 7 (2001), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 33 Fed. Appx. 502 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The recording contains no statement that only a written and signed agreement would be binding on the parties. HT; <span class="Italic">see Martin,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 36, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">cf. Mahboob v. Department of the Navy,</span> 928 F.2d 1126, 1128-30 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (the oral agreement was not binding because, among other things, the transcript of the tape made clear that the agreement would not be binding until it was reduced to writing and signed by the parties). Because the oral settlement agreement was the operative agreement in this case, the appellant's dispute about the accuracy of the agency's written memorialization of the agreement, even if true, is immaterial. Should the agency's alleged misconstruction of the oral settlement agreement result in a breach of the agreement, the appellant's remedy lies with a petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2); 5 C.F.R. part 1201, subpart F.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McLane v. Dept. of Interior,</span> DC-0752-11-0723-I-1 (NP 4/25/2012), declined to set aside an oral settlement based on the appellant's expectation that there would be a subsequent written agreement, and the Board determined that the appellant's attempts to challenge the agreement were too ambiguous to suggest that she communicated her intent to withdraw from the agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before dismissing an appeal as settled, the administrative judge should document for the record whether the parties have actually reached a settlement agreement, whether they understand the agreement's terms, and whether they have agreed that the settlement will be enforceable by the Board. <span class="Italic">E.g., Gerdts v. Department of Labor,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 412, &#x00B6; 14 (2009). The record reflects that the administrative judge did so in the August 16, 2011 close of the record conference. Oral settlements are as valid and enforceable as written ones. <span class="Italic">E.g., McCarter v. Department of the Navy,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 6 (2010). When the parties intend to enter into an oral settlement, the oral agreement is binding even if the parties anticipate the later preparation of a written version and the written version is never executed, but an oral settlement is not binding if the parties did not intend to be bound until a written settlement was prepared and signed. <span class="Italic">Tiburzi v. Department of Justice,</span> 269 F.3d 1346, 1352-53 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Although the parties discussed reducing the settlement agreement to writing, they did not indicate that their agreement was in any way contingent on doing so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the sworn affidavit she provides with her petition for review, the appellant avers that, based on the parties' close of record conference discussion, she "understood the negotiations to be based on the July 2011 settlement offer." In her petition for review, the appellant argues that before the recorded portion of the close of record conference, she indicated her belief that the terms from the unexecuted July 2011 EEO agreement would also be included in the settlement of her Board appeal, i.e., the forgiveness of her indebtedness to the agency, training for certain agency officials with respect to violence in the workplace, and the removal of absence without leave charges from her record. She contends that the administrative judge assured her that those terms would be addressed, and that agency counsel would work with her on the specific terms in a follow up call, but when the agency representative went on the record to recite the parties' agreement, she omitted the terms in question. Although the administrative judge again assured the appellant that he was going to pursue what the appellant described as "a couple other things" that were included in the agreement, the record does not explicitly identify those items, and the appellant ultimately agrees to the settlement agreement on the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a follow-up call shortly after the conference, the appellant asserts that agency counsel told her that the agency "was agreeable with" most of the terms identified above, but she then called the appellant back within minutes to tell her that the parties' agreement was limited to the terms they had officially agreed to before the administrative judge. The appellant subsequently attempted to speak with the administrative judge but was unsuccessful in doing so before the administrative judge issued the initial decision that dismissed the appeal as settled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Immediate action challenging a settlement can provide evidence that the settlement was invalid. <span class="Italic">See generally Futrell-Rawls v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 322, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). However, <span class="Italic">Futrell-Rawls</span> involved provisions that were added to the subsequent written iteration of the oral settlement agreement that the parties in that case purportedly agreed to at their close of record conference. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As such, it is distinguishable from the instant matter in which the appellant argues the opposite, i.e., that negotiated items were missing from the parties' agreement. The appellant's action was also more equivocal than that of the appellant in <span class="Italic">Futrell-Rawls. Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 10 n.3. Notably, the appellant here concedes that the administrative judge's staff told her that she needed to call with agency counsel (in order to avoid <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> issues), and agency counsel has represented that she was available for such a conference call, but the appellant never followed up. The appellant also failed to immediately file any motions or other statements challenging the settlement. Moreover, there was no obvious basis for the administrative judge to doubt that a valid settlement had been made. <span class="Italic">Compare Futrell-Rawls,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 322, and <span class="Italic">McCarter,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 599, with <span class="Italic">Parks v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 60 (2010). The appellant's later calls came after the initial decision issued, but, at that point, her recourse was to the Board. Thus, we find that the appellant fails to establish a basis for invalidating the parties' settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lisbon v. VA</span>, AT-0752-12-0215-I-1 (NP 8/6/2013), sent an appeal back for adjudication when the parties discussed settlement on the date of the <span id="Page_4763"></span>hearing, but there was not adequate documentation of the settlement by the AJ, the parties then disagreed on the terms of the written settlement drafts that followed, and because the OWBPA would have applied--requiring both a written agreement and a revocation opportunity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Moreover, the administrative judge reported that the agency representative would only discuss a global settlement, i.e., one that included resolution of the appellant's equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint. But, the appellant's EEO complaint included an age discrimination claim, and the Board has found that the terms of the OWBPA (codified in relevant part at 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 626) require that, among other requirements, such settlements must be in writing, e.g., <span class="Italic">Schwartz v. Department of Education</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 12 (2010). Thus, an oral settlement could not have met the agency representative's requirement of a global settlement.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Although the Board could remand the appeal solely for adjudication of the appellant's age discrimination claim, <span class="Italic">e.g., Hinton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6; (2013), because the record does not demonstrate that the parties' reached an agreement, we instead remand the appeal in its entirety for adjudication on the merits.</p>
