<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-244"><span class="space">a.</span> Appeal Right With EEO Allegation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">What 5 USC 7121 taketh away from the Board, it restoreth if a claim of discrimination is asserted. 5 USC 7121(d) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1) of this title which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both. An employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise the matter under either a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure at such time as the employee timely initiates an action under the applicable statutory procedure or timely files a grievance in writing, in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated procedure, whichever event occurs first. Selection of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee to request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review the final decision pursuant to section 7702 of this title in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board, or, where applicable, to request the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review a final decision in any other matter involving a complaint of discrimination of the type prohibited by any law administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_398"></span>5 USC 2302(b)(1) covers the usual bases of prohibited discrimination, plus marital status or political affiliation prohibited by law, rule, or regulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;discriminate for or against any employee or applicant for employment--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, as prohibited under section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-16);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;on the basis of age, as prohibited under sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 631, 633a);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(C)&#x2003;on the basis of sex, as prohibited under section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206 (d));</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(D)&#x2003;on the basis of handicapping condition, as prohibited under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791); or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(E)&#x2003;on the basis of marital status or political affiliation, as prohibited under any law, rule, or regulation[.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Section 7121 has several salient features. Under 5 USC 7121(e)(1), an action under 5 USC 4303 (performance) or 5 USC 7512 (adverse action) can be grieved or taken to the Board by direct appeal, not both. Under 5 USC 7121(d), as to matters not involving actions under 5 USC 4303 or 5 USC 7512 that might otherwise be appealed to the Board (e.g., WIGI denial, RIF), the grievance procedure is exclusive (unless it excludes those matters), but the employee may appeal to the Board (if a grievance is not first used) to challenge the action otherwise within Board jurisdiction if discrimination (or EEO reprisal) is alleged. If any action otherwise within Board appellate jurisdiction is grieved and makes its way of an arbitration decision and if discrimination (or EEO reprisal) was alleged in the grievance, Board review at the headquarters level is available to the appellant (grievant). 5 USC 7121(d). [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-248.html#sec5-247">Review of Arbitration Awards</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A few decisions explain the statute. An allegation of discrimination places an action covered by contract and otherwise within the Board's jurisdiction back into the MSPB appellate jurisdiction, should the appellant elect that route. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 680, 683-84 (1990).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Avila v. DLA</span>, 21 MSPR 91, 93-94 (1984), involving an appeal from the denial of a within-grade increase, explained application of 5 USC 7121:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that an appellant is entitled to appeal to the Board from an agency reconsideration decision denying a within-grade increase. 5 U.S.C, &#x00A7; 5335 (c); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531. 410 (d). Section 531. 410 (d; further provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">... However, for an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement a reconsideration decision that sustains a negative determination is only reviewable in accordance with the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, there is no dispute that the collective bargaining agreement in the instant case provides that it "...is the exclusive procedure available to bargaining unit employee(s) for the resolution of grievances." The agreement, however, also provides, that "[A]n employee alleging <span class="Italic">discrimination</span>...may at his/her option raise the matter under the appropriate statutory appellate procedure or under the provisions of this Article, but not both."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such provision is in conformity with the applicable statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121, which provides for two exceptions to the provision that a collective bargaining agreement may limit appeal rights to the Board. These exceptions are set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) and (e). Section 7121 (d) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302 (b)(l) [discrimination] of this title which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second exception found at section 7121(e)(1) pertains to matters arising under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303 and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 and is not relevant to this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the Board is not divested of jurisdiction by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement providing for exclusivity of remedy where an appellant alleges discrimination in connection with an otherwise appealable matter In the instant case, the appellant alleged discrimination on the basis of both age and sex, and thus is entitled to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Greer</span> and <span class="Italic">Jennings v. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> 19 M.S.P.R. 90 at 91-92 (1984). We therefore find that the presiding official erred in dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, the initial decision is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for adjudication on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Parnell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 128, 129-31 (1993), concluded that an allegation of reprisal for filing an EEO complaint served as a predicate for Board jurisdiction in a RIF case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for appeal, the appellant alleged that the agency's RIF action was based on reprisal for her having filed formal complaints of discrimination with the agency. The administrative judge found that the appellant's claim of reprisal did not rest upon any of the bases stated in 5 USC 2302(b)(1), and that, since her appeal did not fall within the exception provided by 5 CFR 1201.3(c)(1), her avenue of appeal was solely within the negotiated grievance procedure. She therefore dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted, the plain language of 5 USC 2302(b)(1) refers to prohibited discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicapping condition, marital status, and political affiliation; reprisal for filing a discrimination complaint is not included in that list. The administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Department of Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 413, 415-16, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 878 F.2d 1446 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table), and <span class="Italic">Poirier v. Department of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 214 (1986), in support of her finding that, since a claim of reprisal is not included in the above list, the appellant's right of appeal was limited to the negotiated grievance procedure. We note, however, that the appellants in those cases did not allege reprisal for having filed a discrimination complaint. We therefore find that those decisions are not controlling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Some of the court's language in <span class="Italic">Spruill v. MSPB</span>, 978 F.2d 679, 691-92 (Fed. Cir. 1992), suggests that reprisal taken against an individual because of the filing of a discrimination complaint is limited to a violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(9), so that one could argue that it could not also be violative of section 2302(b)(1). The court's comments must be taken in context, however. The issue before the court in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> was whether reprisal for filing a discrimination complaint constituted whistleblowing under section 2302(b)(8). 978 F.2d at 689. Thus, we view the court's comments as leading to the conclusion that there is no overlap between sections 2302(b)(8) and 2302(b)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This reading of <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> is reinforced by the court's reference to <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPB 159, 1 MSPR 163 (1979), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Frazier v. MSPB</span>, 672 F.2d 150 (D.C. Cir. 1982). 978 F.2d at 691. The court approved the distinction the Board drew in <span class="Italic">Frazier</span> between sections 2302(b)(8) and 2302(b)(9), without mentioning or otherwise disapproving the lengthy footnote in <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>, stating that a claim of reprisal for EEO activities sets forth a cognizable claim under section 2302(b)(1)(A), as well as under section 2302(b)(9). <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR at 191 n.36. Further, the court noted in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> at 682 that the administrative judge in that case relied on <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of Defense</span>, 46 MSPR 549 (1991), without mentioning or otherwise disapproving the footnote in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> reiterating the Board's position that reprisal for filing an EEO complaint violates both sections 2302(b)(1) and 2302(b)(9). <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 46 MSPR at 553 n.4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Frazier</span> to be instructive. <span class="Italic">Frazier</span> noted that 42 USC 2000e-16, referenced in section 2302(b)(1), has been interpreted by the courts to include claims of reprisal for opposition to employment practices made unlawful by Title VII. 1 MSPR at 191 n.36. <span class="Italic">See also Jordan v. Clark</span>, 847 F.2d 1368, 1376 n.8 (9th Cir. 1988),<span class="Italic"> cert. denied</span>, 488 U.S. 1006, 109 S. Ct. 786, 102 L. Ed.2d 778 (1989). We note, in addition, that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency responsible for the administration and enforcement of equal opportunity in Federal employment, includes claims of reprisal for filing discrimination complaints as within the ambit of 42 USC 2000e-16 in its regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.101 and 1614.103(a); <span class="Italic">see also Spruill</span>, 978 F.2d at 692 n.17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude that a claim of reprisal for filing a discrimination complaint is cognizable under 5 USC 2302(b)(1). Because the appellant raised such a claim in connection with her RIF appeal, her appeal falls within the Board's jurisdiction under 5 USC 7121(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Martinesi v. EEOC</span>, 24 MSPR 276, 281 (1984) (WIGI appeal: the Board had jurisdiction, despite the existence of a negotiated grievance procedure, when the appellant alleged that the agency's action was in reprisal for filing a discrimination complaint).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to an appeal (and hearing) of a case by an MSPB AJ, for an EEO allegation to vest jurisdiction in the Board over an appealable matter (a RIF) that would otherwise be exclusively covered by a contractual grievance procedure, the EEO allegation is ordinarily raised in the appeal. There are, however, circumstances permitting the EEO allegation to be raised as late as the petition for review, although <span class="Italic">Weslowski v. Dept. of Army</span>, 80 MSPR 585, 590-92 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-14 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Weslowski v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3168), decided that the facts did not permit consideration of appellant's belated EEO allegations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Initially, in his appeal of the merits of his separation by RIF procedures, the appellant stated that he was not a member of the union, and reiterated <span id="Page_400"></span>his request that the Board adjudicate the merits of his RIF separation. If an employee is covered by a CBA, matters that customarily would be within the appellate jurisdiction of the Board are deemed to be covered by the negotiated grievance procedure, and thus beyond the Board's jurisdiction, unless a matter is excluded from the application of the grievance procedure<span class="Italic">. See DiSera v. Department of the Army</span>, 71 MSPR 120, 122 (1996). However, an aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), i.e., discrimination on the bases of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability, age, equal pay, marital status, and political affiliation, which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure, i.e., a Board appeal, the EEO complaint process, or the negotiated grievance procedure. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d). The employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option to raise an allegation of discrimination with the Board, in the EEO complaint process, or under the negotiated procedure at such time as the employee timely initiates an action under the applicable statutory procedure or timely files a grievance in writing, whichever occurs first<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the applicable CBA does not exclude demotions and separations taken pursuant to a RIF from the negotiated grievance procedure. Therefore, notwithstanding that the appellant is not a member of the union, the negotiated grievance procedure is the exclusive appellate avenue for employees separated by operation of RIF procedures and covered by the CBA, except for those who allege discrimination prohibited under section 2302(b)(1). 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d). There is no evidence of record that the appellant alleged such discrimination when he filed his complaint with OSC, when he filed his appeal with the Board from the conclusion of OSC's investigation of his whistleblower reprisal complaint, or when he filed this appeal of the merits of the RIF action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the first time in this petition for review, the appellant states that he will file an equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint against the agency and OSC for violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by not accommodating his disabling conditions of depression and attention deficit disorder. We construe this statement on petition for review as an assertion by the appellant that the Board has jurisdiction over the merits of his RIF separation under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d), i.e., that the Board's jurisdiction is predicated on the appellant's assertion that his RIF separation was discriminatory on the basis of disability. <span class="Italic">See Walters v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 MSPR 115, 119 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant may raise an allegation of discrimination at any time during the Board's consideration of the appeal of the agency's action, including on petition for review, if the appellant did not know of the existence of a basis for the allegation at the time that the petition for appeal was filed. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 3 MSPB 188, 3 MSPR 71, 74 (1980). <span class="Italic">See also Schermerhorn v. United States Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05940729 (Feb. 10, 1995) (the time limit to begin the EEO complaint process is not triggered until a complainant should have reasonably suspected discrimination). The appellant explains that he is raising his allegation of disability discrimination eighteen months after the agency effected his separation because he "recently discovered" that "[b]oth Depression and Attention Deficit Disorder are recognized by [the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] as being in the scope of the [ADA]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant must raise a discrimination claim when he has sufficient knowledge of facts and circumstances to form a reasonable suspicion that prohibited discrimination has occurred. <span class="Italic">See Ball v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Request No. 05880247 (July 6, 1988). An appellant's responsibility to raise the issue of discrimination is triggered when he possessed sufficient facts that he should have reasonably suspected discrimination, but before all of the facts that would have supported a charge of discrimination have become apparent<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Here, the appellant admits that he had been treated for depression and attention deficit disorder for many years, and alleges that the Health Clinic and his place of employment had this information in his personnel file. He also was aware that the agency had not accommodated his conditions. Further, he was fully aware of the facts around his separation by September 29, 1996, the effective date of the agency's separation action. Thus, he had sufficient information to reasonably suspect that his RIF separation might be discriminatory on the basis of disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He alleges on petition for review, however, that he did not know he could file an EEO complaint based on his conditions because he was unaware that they were within the scope of the ADA. However, the additional information that the appellant discovered after he had filed his petition for appeal was not information that could reveal a discriminatory motive on the part of the agency. Therefore, we find that this additional information is not a basis for waiving the time limit for raising a claim of discrimination on the basis of disability, and consequently the appellant's allegations of disability discrimination on petition for review do not provide a basis for the Board's jurisdiction over his appeal from the conclusion of the merits of his RIF separation.[1] Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Because the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal of the merits of his RIF separation under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(d), we need not address whether the appellant's filing with OSC before filing with the Board constituted an election under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(g) that precluded Board jurisdiction over the merits of the appellant's separation by RIF procedures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One decision determined that if through an EEO allegation the appellant seeks the Board to assume jurisdiction over a RIF that is otherwise relegated to contract grievance procedures, the appellant should make the EEO allegation when he files the appeal. If an appellant's appeal is dismissed as beyond the Board's jurisdiction in the absence of an EEO allegation, the appellant may seek to cure the jurisdictional defect by filing a new appeal claiming discrimination, although he would have to explain why he did not earlier amend his pleadings in the first appeal when he was put on notice of the jurisdictional problem. <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 76 MSPR 481, 485-86 (1997); <span class="Italic">see Honga v. DHHS,</span> DE-0351-16-0072-I-1 (NP 5/6/2016) (RIF: "Finally, the appellant has not alleged that he previously lacked sufficient knowledge to suspect that discrimination occurred. Consequently, the appellant's allegations of discrimination on review do not provide a basis for the Board's jurisdiction over this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Weslowski v. Department of the Army</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 585, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-14 (finding that the appellant's allegations of discrimination raised for the first time on review did not provide a basis for Board jurisdiction over his appeal from his RIF separation where he had sufficient information to reasonably suspect that his separation might be discriminatory), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 217 F.3d 854 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cooper v. Dept. of Defense</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/COOPER_EUGENE_SE_0351_03_0036_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248616.pdf">98 MSPR 313</a>, 317-19 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2005), resolved that an allegation of discrimination need not be supported by factual allegations to provide the predicate for Board review of a RIF that could otherwise only be challenged through a contract grievance procedure:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant has maintained that his separation was the result of discrimination based on race, disability, and reprisal for having filed a number of equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaints. In <span class="Italic">Currier v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 177, 180 (1998), the Board held that an appellant has a right to a hearing on his claims of discrimination prohibited by the laws enumerated at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B), and that it is error for an AJ to strike such a claim prior to a hearing regardless of whether the appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation of facts to support it. In arriving at this finding, the Board expressly relied on its decision in <span class="Italic">Bennett v. National Gallery of Art</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 285 (1998), in which the appellant had requested review of an arbitration decision and raised a claim of such prohibited discrimination for the first time on review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bennett</span>, the Board observed that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), "[a]n aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;] 2302(b)(1)" may "request [the Board] to review the final [arbitration] decision pursuant to [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;] 7702...in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board[.] " <span class="Italic">Bennett</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. at 289. The Board further observed that section 7702(a)(1) provides that, "in the case of any employee or applicant for employment who" appeals an action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 and who "<span class="Italic">alleges</span> that a basis for the action was discrimination...the Board <span class="Italic">shall</span>...<span class="Italic">decide</span> both the issue of discrimination and the applicable action[.] " <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis in original). Upon reviewing the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, and the plain language of the statute, the Board in <span class="Italic">Bennett</span> concluded that section 7702 does not distinguish between frivolous and non-frivolous allegations or between facts sufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination and facts insufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 290. The Board similarly concluded that the statute does not distinguish between Board decisions which would find that a discrimination claim is frivolous and decisions in which the Board would find that the appellant has made allegations sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Consistent with this reasoning, the Board held that it had jurisdiction to review an arbitrator's decision under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) in any case in which an appellant alleges discrimination prohibited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), irrespective of whether the allegations are non-frivolous. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 294 (noting that the appellant also must meet any other jurisdictional requirements for consideration of an arbitration decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's <span class="Italic">Currier</span> decision adopted the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">Bennett</span> and applied it to cases in which the appellant has raised a discrimination claim with respect to an appeal brought to the Board under law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Currier</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. at 180. Here, the appellant has raised his discrimination claims in an appeal brought to the Board under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.901 following the appellant's election to proceed before the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(d) and (g). We therefore find that the initial decision, which dismissed these claims without affording the appellant a hearing, was contrary to Board precedent as discussed above.[2] S<span class="Italic">ee also Farquhar v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 454 &#x00B6; 12 (1999) (under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), an appellant who raises a discrimination claim with respect to any appeal brought to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation is entitled to a hearing and to have the Board decide <span id="Page_401"></span>the merits of such a claim in accordance with the procedures set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;To the extent that the Board's decisions in cases such as <span class="Italic">Foland v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 92 (1997), <span class="Italic">Begay v. Department of the Interior</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 532 (1997), and <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 408 (1997) hold that an appellant must allege facts which, if proven, would establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination prohibited by the authorities listed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1)(B) in order to establish Board jurisdiction over an appeal that an appellant has elected to bring to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), they are hereby overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Although not necessary to the result here, we note that the prohibited personnel practices set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) are not coextensive with the practices prohibited by the authorities listed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B). In its seminal decision, <span class="Italic">Ogden Air Logistics Center v. American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 630, 632 (1981), the Board specifically held that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) provides for Board review of arbitration decisions only when there is an allegation of prohibited discrimination raised in connection with a matter otherwise appealable to the Board pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702. Thereafter, in <span class="Italic">Livingstone v. Department of the Navy</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 36 (1994), which involved a claim of marital status discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), the Board determined that, because the appellant had not alleged a form of discrimination covered by section 7702, his petition for appeal, filed with the Board after it was returned to him by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, could not be considered timely. More recently, in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Energy</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 430 (2001), the Board found that the appellant had failed to make a non-frivolous allegation of discrimination with respect to his claim of marital status discrimination under section 2302(b)(1). Because marital status discrimination is a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), but is not prohibited by any of the authorities listed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B), <span class="Italic">Smith</span> is not inconsistent with our decision in the instant case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the 2005 <span class="Italic">Cooper</span> decision, although the existence of an EEO allegation in an appeal that might otherwise be within the exclusive coverage of a contract preserved Board jurisdiction, there were occasional issues concerning the jurisdictional sufficiency of the allegation. The allegation was to be nonfrivolous, that is, sufficiently detailed to provide an understanding of the factual basis for the discrimination allegation. <span class="Italic">See Foland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 75 MSPR 92, 96 (1997) (requiring a nonfrivolous allegation to support an affirmative defense to a RIF otherwise subject to a contract grievance procedure); <span class="Italic">Begay v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 73 MSPR 532, 537 (1997) (nonfrivolous allegation of discrimination or reprisal for EEO activities was sufficient to warrant a jurisdictional hearing when the appellant alleged that a similarly situated male employee was permitted to exercise retreat rights while the appellant was separated as a result of RIF); <span class="Italic">Smith v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCann v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 288, 293-95 (1993), predating <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, discussed the specificity of the allegations necessary to vest jurisdiction in the Board through a discrimination claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In its response to the appeal, the agency contended that, because the collective bargaining agreement covering the appellant did not exclude reduction-in-force actions from the list of employment actions subject to the negotiated grievance procedure, and because he had not raised a claim of discrimination, the Board lacked jurisdiction over his appeal. The appellant, however, argues that he did allege discrimination below, on the bases of "age, reclassification, and seniority."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 7121(a), the grievance procedures provided in the applicable collective bargaining agreement generally are the exclusive means of resolving disputes related to matters not excluded from the agreement's coverage. An aggrieved employee who has been "affected by" a personnel practice prohibited under 5 USC 2302(b)(1), however, may file an appeal with the Board concerning an action otherwise covered by the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7121(d). The Board has construed the words "affected by" to mean that the Board is not divested of jurisdiction by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement providing for exclusivity of remedy where an appellant <span class="Italic">alleges</span> discrimination.[4] ...Personnel practices prohibited under section 2302(b)(1) include discrimination based on age. 5 USC 2302(b)(1)(B).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The appellant's rights in this appeal, then, are analogous to those of a probationary employee seeking to establish Board jurisdiction over his or her appeal. Such an employee may appeal his or her termination to the Board if he or she alleges that the termination was based on partisan political reasons or marital status discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 315.806(b); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of Justice</span>, 48 MSPR 141, 143-44 (1991). In such cases, the Board exercises an initial jurisdiction, based on the mere allegation, to determine whether it does in fact have jurisdiction to proceed further and decide the case. <span class="Italic">See Stokes v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 685 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The Board has interpreted the regulation's requirement of an allegation of discrimination to mean a nonfrivolous allegation. <span class="Italic">See Robinson</span>, 48 MSPR at 143-44; <span class="Italic">see also Von Deneen v. Department of Transportation</span>, 33 MSPR 420, 422, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 837 F.2d 1098 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table). To meet the jurisdictional burden of proof requires more than "the mere filing of allegations," but a proffer of evidence sufficient to enable an administrative judge reasonably to conclude that they are not frivolous. <span class="Italic">See In re Stephens</span>, 52 MSPR 522, 528 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;A <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination is established by showing the following: (1) The employee is within the protected age group (age 40 or over); (2) he has been subjected to an unfavorable employment action; and (3) the employee's age was the determining factor in the agency's challenged employment action. <span class="Italic">See O'Hearn v. General Services Administration</span>, 41 MSPR 280, 285-86 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 902 F.2d 44 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant, as a pipefitter, fell within the bargaining unit represented by the Federal Employees Metal Trades Council (MTC). The collective bargaining agreement between the MTC and the Mare Island Naval Shipyard does not exclude reduction-in-force actions from the list of employment actions which are subject to the negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant failed to check the appropriate box on the petition for appeal form which specifically requested him to state whether he believed that the action was the result of any type of discrimination. Nevertheless, the failure to check the appropriate box on the appeal form is not fatal to an allegation of discrimination that is otherwise timely raised. In the narrative attached to the petition for appeal, the appellant argued that he had been a nuclear/nonnuclear pipefitter; that in 1989, in anticipation of a reduction in force, the agency separated the pipefitters into nuclear and nonnuclear categories and then placed the younger employees in the nuclear category to protect them. He alleged further that 53 pipefitters with less service than himself were retained because they were placed in the nuclear category. He argued, too, that he was not permitted to train for the nuclear positions before the reduction in force, even though it would have only required 228 hours of instruction. In his petition for review, the appellant reiterates these contentions and states that he is over 40 years old. The appellant's facts are undisputed. Based on this, we find that his proffer of evidence is sufficient to determine that the allegations are nonfrivolous.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To preserve Board jurisdiction, the EEO allegation should directly involve the action appealed, not a preliminary step in that action. <span class="Italic">See Cade v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 25 MSPR 107, 109 n.3 (1984) (precluding, by contract, Board jurisdiction over a RIF; discrimination relative to a promotion action preceding the RIF did not preserve jurisdiction as to the RIF).</p>
