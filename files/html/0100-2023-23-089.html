USPS</span>, 110 MSPR 399, 403 &#x00B6; 7, 2009 MSPB 6 (2009). The Back Pay Act provides for recovery of leave lost as a result of an unwarranted or unjustified personnel action. <span class="Italic">Hart v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 109 MSPR 280, 282 n.1, 2008 MSPB 149 (2008) (constructive adverse action involving alleged forced use of leave). "Annual leave is an allowance that the agency must recredit to a prevailing appellant's account under the Back Pay Act." <span class="Italic">Carter v. USPS</span>, 89 MSPR 45, 51 &#x00B6; 21 (2001). If the employee takes leave because of the effects of personnel actions caused by reprisals for whistleblowing, the employee is entitled to restoration of the leave he used. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. VA</span>, 81 MSPR 601, 606 &#x00B6; 10 (1999) (sick and annual leave).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A discharged federal employee is not entitled to a lump sum payment based on accrued sick leave. When the employee is reinstated, the agency should recredit sick leave lost at termination. <span class="Italic">Andreko v.

The Postal Service Employee Labor Relations Manual (ELM) requires that a nonpreference eligible employee receive annual leave she would have earned during the period of a reversed removal. <span class="Italic">Driscoll v. USPS</span>, 112 MSPR 498, 505 &#x00B6; 20, 2009 MSPB 205 (2009). "[U]nlike the Back Pay Act regulations, the ELM in some instances makes leave determinations dependent on whether any net back pay is received in a particular pay period. <span class="Italic">See</span> ELM Section 512.311-E-1." <span class="Italic">Hunt v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency claims that it could not credit the appellant with annual leave because of his indebtedness to the agency. In support of this contention the agency cites its own regulation which states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The order of precedence for deducting erroneous payments from backpay awards when the net amount of backpay is insufficient to cover all the deductions is as follows: retirement annuity payments or refunds of retirement contributions, severance pay, and lump sum payment for accrued annual leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This language does not address the question here.

The agency cites no other regulation or case law to support its position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The crediting of annual leave is distinguishable from a lump sum payment paid to an appellant for annual leave upon his separation. A lump sum payment for annual leave that was accrued <span class="Italic">prior</span> to the appellant's separation would have to be reimbursed to the agency before the appellant could be recredited for that leave. <span class="Italic">Andreko v.

A different result, allowing an employee to keep a lump sum payment for leave and have the leave recredited would be a windfall to the appellant. However, crediting a wrongfully terminated employee with the annual leave he would have earned during the period of his unlawful separation is placing the appellant in the position he would have been in absent the wrongful action and is required by <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> [<span class="Italic">v.

<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">Eaton v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 12, 14 (1992), when the employee is separated, the employee is paid a lump sum amount for accrued leave and taxes are deducted from the amount. When the separation is reversed, the agency repays to the employee the interim salary and deducts from that amount the gross accrued leave lump sum amount. The employee is left to sort out with the IRS how to recover the taxes paid earlier on the lump sum that was paid to him at the time of the separation. <span class="Italic">Eaton</span>, like <span class="Italic">Clemons</span> before it, added that "[w]e direct the agency to assist the appellant to the extent possible by providing any necessary forms or other assistance within the agency's purview that the appellant may need in seeking recourse from the Internal Revenue Service." As to annual leave, under <span class="Italic">Andreko v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 30 MSPR 65, 67 (1986), the employee is entitled to have his leave account recredited upon his repayment of a lump sum annual leave payment.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the appellant's contention, he is not entitled to have this entire amount of annual leave credited to a separate leave account.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not provided any information regarding the appellant's annual leave balance at the time of his termination.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, when the appellant was reinstated, his annual leave balance was 360 hours (144 + 216).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The earnings and leave statement submitted by the appellant shows that the agency credited the appellant with 128 hours in a separate restored leave account.

<p class="Body-Text">The tax complications of the process of leave restoration were explored in <span class="Italic">Clemons v. Smithsonian Inst</span>., 54 MSPR 1, 2-4 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the appellant was terminated in August, 1989, he was issued a lump-sum payment for 312 hours of annual leave. The gross amount of the payment was $2,936.40 with a net receipt after taxes of $1,622.16. This amount was, or should have been, reported to the Internal Revenue Service on the appellant's 1989 tax return.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the Back Pay Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596 (1980), when an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action is corrected, the employee's pay and leave are recomputed as if the personnel action had not occurred. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805(a)(2). The lump-sum payment for annual leave is statutorily authorized only when the employee is separated from service. 5 USC &#x00A7; 5551(a). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Supplement, &#x00A7; 990-2, <span id="Page_4892"></span>S8-7(d)(4). When the separation is cancelled and the employee is restored to duty, the lump-sum payment for annual leave is considered to be an erroneous payment and must be set off against the employee's back pay award and the annual leave recredited to the employee. FPM Supp. &#x00A7; 990-2, S8-7(d)(4). Consequently, because the appellant was reinstated to his former position, the lump-sum payment for annual leave must be deducted from his back pay award. <span class="Italic">Vincent T. Oliver</span>, 59 Comp. Gen. 395 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties concur that the lump-sum payment must be offset, but they differ as to whether the amount should be deducted from the gross or net amount of the back pay award. In essence, the issue is whether the Federal and state taxes and retirement contributions due on the back pay should be calculated before or after the lump-sum payment is deducted. The appellant argues that the lump-sum annual leave payment ($2936.40) must be offset from the gross back pay award ($3055.72), which leaves a difference of $119.32 on which appropriate taxes and deductions should be calculated and from which they should then be deducted. The agency argues that it must deduct the lump-sum annual leave payment from the remaining net amount of the back pay award after required deductions for taxes and retirement contributions have been calculated on the gross amount and deducted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its position, the agency provided portions of the Federal Personnel Manual Supplement concerning deductions from back pay awards of lump-sum annual leave payments issued to employees erroneously separated from service. FPM Supp. &#x00A7; 990-2, S8-7(d)(4).[1] The applicable section of the FPM Supplement contains an example which makes it clear that the amount of taxes and retirement contributions due on the back pay awards is calculated based on the gross back pay amount, without offset of the previously issued lump sum payment. FPM Supp. &#x00A7; 990-2, S8-7(f), example 2. Therefore, we must reject the appellant's argument that he should be taxed only on the difference between the gross amount of back pay due him and the previous gross amount received.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The FPM Supplement provides guidance to agencies and is persuasive authority for the appropriate method of calculating back pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McClain v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues that offsetting the lump-sum annual leave payment from the after-tax net amount results in his paying income tax on money he never received, since taxes are being assessed on the gross amount of the back pay award ($2936.40) when he only received the net amount of the lump-sum annual leave payment ($1622.16). The agency has responded that the appellant may deduct the previously paid Federal taxes if he itemizes his deductions when he files his Federal income tax return. However, the appellant will have to determine from his own tax advisors whether he has a means of recovering the previously paid taxes from the Internal Revenue Service. We direct the agency to assist the appellant to the extent possible by providing any necessary forms or other assistance within the agency's purview that the appellant may need in seeking recourse from the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the agency's calculations of the back pay award offset by the required deductions and the erroneously made lump-sum payment, the appellant owes the agency $712.97.

An employee is "eligible" for FMLA leave if he was employed for at least 12 months by the employer from whom leave is requested and performed at least 1,250 hours of service during the 12-month period prior to the leave request. 29 USC &#x00A7; 2611(2). If eligible, the employee has the right in specified circumstances, including where the employee's own serious health condition makes the employee unable to do his job, to take job-protected, unpaid leave, or paid leave if it has been earned, for up to 12 work weeks in any 12-month period. 29 USC &#x00A7; 2612(a); 5 USC &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.100 (1997) ("What is the Family and Medical Leave Act?").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;With respect to its bargaining unit employees, such as the appellant, the agency is subject to the FMLA. <span class="Italic">See Ramey v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 MSPR 463, 466 (1996), <span class="Italic">modified on</span> <span class="Italic">other grounds, Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior,</span> 76 MSPR 54 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Back Pay Act applies to the appellant because he is a preference eligible veteran. <span class="Italic">See Andress v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 56 MSPR 501, 508 (1993). The Back Pay Act provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee of an agency who...is found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement, to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee...<span class="Italic">(B) for all purposes, is deemed to have performed</span> <span class="Italic">service for the agency during that period</span> [for which the employee received back pay]....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(B) (1996) (emphasis supplied)<span class="Italic">. See also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805(a)(1) (1998) ("When an appropriate authority corrects or directs the correction of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action...[t]he employee shall be deemed to have performed service for the agency during the period covered by the corrective action.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In recommending that the Board grant the petition for enforcement, the administrative judge found that the agency had not restored the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> because "but for the agency's unwarranted personnel action, the appellant would have worked 1,250 hours prior to the date he made the leave request." The agency maintains that this conclusion is error because finding that the appellant "would have worked at all is pure speculation, as his record upon reinstatement demonstrates." Because the Back Pay Act deems the employee, "for all purposes," to have worked for the entire period for which he or she received back pay, the agency's argument conflicts with the plain language of the statute. 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(B). Under the statute, the corrective action period is deemed an actual period of service. No speculation was involved; the administrative judge merely applied the clear command of the Back Pay Act. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency failed to restore the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> because the agency did not deem the appellant, for purposes of FMLA eligibility, to have performed service during the period for which the appellant received back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency next maintains that the Back Pay Act restores "traditional benefits of employment, i.e., leave, health insurance, life insurance" to employees receiving back pay, but does not affect "statutory rights" such as the entitlements provided under the FMLA....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the agency is arguing that the Back Pay Act does not apply to benefits that are conferred by statute, we find no such distinction in the language of the Back Pay Act. More particularly, for purposes of applying the Back Pay Act, we perceive no meaningful conceptual difference between an employee's eligibility for leave rights created by the FMLA and his eligibility or qualifications for other types of leave rights created by other statutes and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency argues that the Board does not have authority to order an employing agency to "waive" the eligibility requirements of the FMLA. In support of this proposition, the agency cites two cases in which Courts struck down a Department of Labor regulation prohibiting employers from challenging an employee's FMLA eligibility when the employer had previously confirmed the employee's eligibility at the time the leave request was made. In each case, the court found that the <span id="Page_4893"></span>challenged regulation directly contradicted Congress's expressed intent regarding employee eligibility under the FMLA<span class="Italic">. Seaman v. Downtown Partnership of Baltimore, Inc.,</span> 991 F. Supp. 751, 753 (D. Md. 1998); <span class="Italic">Wolke v. Dreadnought Marine, Inc.,</span> 954 F. Supp. 1133, 1137 (E.D. Va. 1997). In both cases, and a third "analogous" case cited by the agency, <span class="Italic">Cox v. Autozone, Inc.</span>, 990 F. Supp. 1369 (M.D. Ala. 1998), the courts attempted to reconcile inconsistencies between the FMLA and its implementing regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find these cases inapposite. Here, the issue concerns the relationship between two separate and distinct statutes--the FMLA and the Back Pay Act--and we see no inconsistency between them. As the Supreme Court has observed, the "classic judicial task of reconciling many laws enacted over time, and getting them to 'make sense in combination, necessarily assumes that the implications of a statute may be altered by the implications of a later statute." <span class="Italic">United States v.</span> <span class="Italic">Fausto,</span> 484 U.S. 439, 453 (1988) (holding that the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 precluded judicial review of a nonpreference eligible employee's action based on the Back Pay Act of 1966).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Back Pay Act and the FMLA were enacted for different purposes, their terms affecting the same subject matter must be construed harmoniously and consistently with one another, if reasonably possible. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Woodyard-Hamilton v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 64 MSPR 150, 154 (1991); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Singer, <span class="Italic">Sutherland Statutory Construction</span> &#x00A7; 57.01 (5th Ed. 1992). The Back Pay Act states that "for all purposes" an employee is deemed to have performed service during the period for which the employee received back pay, and the FMLA states that an employee must have performed 1,250 hours of service during the 12 months prior to the date of the leave request. The question before us is whether the phrase "for all purposes" under the Back Pay Act encompasses the eligibility requirements of the FMLA. We find that the remedial purposes of the Back Pay Act and the FMLA require an affirmative answer. Therefore, the appellant is an eligible employee under the FMLA and the agency, by refusing to consider the appellant's requests for FMLA leave, failed to restore him to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> pursuant to the Board's final decision at 78 MSPR 31<span class="Italic">. See Kerr</span>, 726 F.2d at 733.</p>
