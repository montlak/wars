<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-24"><span class="space">7.</span> Adjudication Without Hearing; Responses to Evidentiary Submissions</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">A hearing is not required to develop evidence in a Board appeal. An agency (or appellant) may more fully document the record during the appeal and respond to allegations raised in the appeal. <span class="Italic">Webb v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 35, 38 (1988), noted in passing that "the Board is mandated by 5 USC 7701(a) and (b) to consider <span class="Italic">de novo</span> all of the relevant evidence presented by the parties, whether offered at a hearing or transmitted as part of the administrative record." The opposing party should be permitted to respond to submissions (with the right of reply). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 56 MSPR 224, 233 (1993) (AJ properly permitted the appellant to introduce deposition transcripts of agency officials' testimony into the Board's record; the agency had two days to provide rebuttal argument and "[T]he agency does not assert that the time permitted was inadequate to submit clarifying evidence and argument regarding the depositions"); <span class="Italic">Teague v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 38 MSPR 123, 127 (1988) ("the appellant was provided with the agency's exhibits and given the chance to respond or submit evidence of his own prior to the close of the record, as was the agency"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Cannon v. DHHS</span>, DA-0752-12-0289-I-1 (NP 11/5/2013) (on the weight of hearsay evidence: "We note, however, that the appellant's waiver of his hearing right does not relieve the agency of its burden to prove the charged misconduct by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Genus v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 345, 350 (1987)."); <span class="Italic">Masson v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 244, 247 (1987) ("In response to OPM's brief, the appellant did not assert that he was surprised by the evidence submitted, did not request to reconvene the hearing to rebut the OPM's claim that he was ineligible for the position, and did not respond to the merits of OPM's evidence or argument."). This assumes that both parties are provided with the proffered evidence. A party must ensure service of, and not just access to, evidence that the Board is asked to consider. <span class="Italic">Strauss v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 132, 136 (1988). Nonetheless, as long as the procedure ensures due process, the parties may conduct the appeal by mail (or, these days, through e-filing). If they do so, evidence may be introduced that did not first appear with the evidence file. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Aviles-Wynkoop v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1908.OPINION.9-2-2020_1646608.pdf">825 Fed. Appx. 834</a> n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP) ("Ms. Aviles-Wynkoop suggests that it was improper for the Board to rely on those affidavits because they presented evidence that was not included in the notice of proposed termination. The affidavits, however, were submitted before the evidentiary deadline establish by the administrative judge. And Ms. Aviles-Wynkoop has not identified any requirement that an agency attach to a notice of proposed termination all evidence of the misconduct described in the notice.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a hearing is waived, the AJ should issue a close of record summary that addresses affirmative defenses and burdens of proof. <span class="Italic">Hall v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 119 MSPR 180, 183 &#x00B6; 5, 2013 MSPB 11 (2013) (Member Robbins concurring in part and dissenting in part) (remanding case decided without a hearing because the AJ's close of hearing record summary did not identify the affirmative defenses raised by the appellant and did not explain the burdens of proof: "Because the administrative judge did not inform the appellant of his burdens of proof and the means by which the appellant could prove his affirmative defenses, the appellant did not receive 'a fair and just adjudication' of his affirmative defenses."), <span class="Italic">overruled in part</span>, <span class="Italic">Thurman v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 21 (2022) (establishing multifactor analysis to governing waiver of affirmative defenses).

<p class="Body-Text">An appellant has the right of reply to evidence, <span class="Italic">Anastos v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 18, 20-22 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge informed the parties that the record would <span id="Page_1323"></span>close on September 21, 1987, and that no evidence received after that date would be accepted unless accompanied by a showing that it was new and material evidence that was not previously available.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the agency's submissions were received on the date the record closed, the appellant did not have an opportunity to respond.

<p class="Body-Text">The significance of the opportunity to submit rebuttal evidence, and not to have evidentiary submissions cut off by an AJ, was emphasized in a RIF appeal, <span class="Italic">Schucker v. FDIC</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-federal-circuit/1467107.html">401 F.3d 1347</a>, 1355-58 (Fed. Cir. 2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The longstanding policy of the Board to allow parties an opportunity to submit rebuttal evidence appears in a number of Board decisions, beginning with <span class="Italic">Schultz v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 104 (1982). After the appellant in <span class="Italic">Schultz</span>, who had the burden of proof, did not request a hearing, the presiding official set a final date for the receipt of submissions by the parties. 10 M.S.P.R. at 105. On that closing date, the agency made evidentiary submissions, which the appellant did not receive until after the record closed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 105-06. There is no indication whether or when appellant objected to the closing of the record, or whether appellant made a proffer of rebuttal evidence before the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Nonetheless, the Board held that the presiding official erred in not affording appellant an opportunity to respond, and <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, submit rebuttal evidence, explaining:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The lack of a time limit or other guidelines for closing the record...places the matter within the sound discretion of the presiding official where the appellant waives a hearing.

<p class="Block-Quote2">In the instant case, <span class="Italic">the presiding official closed the record without affording appellant the opportunity to submit evidence and argument to attempt to rebut and impeach the affidavits submitted by the agency which constituted key evidence on which the presiding official based her findings of fact</span>. The Board finds that the action of the presiding official was error.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The policy outlined in <span class="Italic">Schultz</span> was followed more recently in <span class="Italic">Nordhoff v. Department of Navy</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 45 (1995). In that case, the Board held that an administrative judge erred in not affording a party an opportunity to respond. In <span class="Italic">Nordhoff</span>, appellant waived his right to a hearing and the Administrative Judge set two closing dates for the record, an earlier closing date for appellant and a later closing date for the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 48. Before the record closed, appellant objected that he would have no opportunity to respond to the agency's submission. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> After the record closed, appellant filed a motion to extend the close of the record to allow him to respond. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Administrative Judge gave him no opportunity to respond and the Board found error, explaining:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although setting the deadline for closing the record is within the sound discretion of the administrative judge, the judge's rulings in this regard must comport with basic requirements of fairness and notice, including an opportunity for a party to respond to material evidence submitted by the opposing party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The administrative judge's refusal to extend or reopen the record was error because it denied the appellant the opportunity to respond to the agency's evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> In the period between <span class="Italic">Shultz</span> and <span class="Italic">Nordhoff</span>, many Board decisions reached the same result following the same policy. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Palmer v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 552, 555 (1991) ("[A]lthough closing the record in an appeal without a hearing is within the discretion of the administrative judge, parties must be provided an opportunity to respond to submissions."); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dep't of Air Force</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 442, 445 (1991) (holding that where "appellants waived their rights to hearings, the agencies submitted rebuttal evidence on the last day the record was open, [but] the administrative judge rejected the appellants' rebuttal[&#8197;] [evidence,] ...basic principles of fairness and notice, including an opportunity to respond to submissions of the parties, require consideration of the rebuttal evidence"); <span class="Italic">Borowski v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 564, 566-68 (1991) (holding that administrative judge erred by closing the record in the remand appeal before allowing appellant the opportunity to reply to the agency's response even though appellant voiced no timely objection); <span class="Italic">Lamb v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 79, 84 n.1 (1989) ("The appellant cannot, in all fairness, raise material issues just prior to the closing of the record and then attempt to preclude the agency from responding. Therefore, we will consider these affidavits."); <span class="Italic">Anastos v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 18, 19-22 (1988) (holding that administrative judge erred by closing the record "without affording the appellant the opportunity to submit evidence and argument to attempt to rebut the evidence submitted by the agency which constituted key evidence on which the administrative judge based his findings" where appellant objected on the date the record closed); <span class="Italic">Groux v. Dep't of Army</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 288, 289-91 (1983) (reciting <span class="Italic">Schultz</span> rule and finding no error where administrative judge did not grant second extension to respond to agency submission after first extension was granted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have found no decisions of the Board reflecting a change in the policy set forth in the above-noted cases of allowing an appellant an opportunity to rebut the government's evidentiary submissions. These Board decisions, which are hard to distinguish from Schucker's case, thus illustrate the longstanding practice of the Board that it is error to close the record without affording parties an opportunity to submit rebuttal evidence. By taking a position inconsistent with this longstanding practice, without any explanation for the shift, the Board's action is not reasoned decision-making and is arbitrary. <span class="Italic">MATES</span>, 729 F.2d at 754-55.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency contends that the Board's decision is consistent with Board precedent supporting the proposition that a party can waive rebuttal if the party does not take steps to preserve its rights. Specifically, the Agency asserts that Schucker waived rebuttal because she did not object to the November 13 deadline, did not ask for leave, and did not assert that the evidence was not readily available or new and material. <span class="Italic">See Gavette v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 166, 173-74 (1990) (reciting policy of allowing opportunity to respond but holding that administrative judge need not consider evidence where party did not object to staggered deadlines with the deadline for opponent's final submission set later and party showed no prejudice); <span class="Italic">Grassell v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 554, 563-64 (1989) (reciting policy of allowing opportunity to respond but holding that administrative judge did not err in ignoring submissions where judge said that any evidence received after certain date would not be accepted unless it was new and material evidence unavailable before the record closed, and where appellant made his only submission after the deadline, made no request for more time, and did not indicate that it was new and material); <span class="Italic">Dougherty v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 117, 119-21 (1988) (same as <span class="Italic">Grassell</span>). Other Board opinions, however, may support a party's right to submit rebuttal evidence if the party submits rebuttal evidence within a reasonable time. <span class="Italic">See Montreuil v. Dep't of Air Force</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 685, 692 &#x0026; n.2 (1992) (suggesting that appellant only waives objection to the judge's failure to provide him an opportunity to respond "where, during the...period between the close of the record and...the initial decision, he failed to file an objection...[,] request reopening of the record[,] or offer rebuttal evidence"); <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 276, 280-82 (1991) (suggesting that it is error for administrative judge not to consider rebuttal evidence submitted after closing date if a party moves to reopen record, objects to evidence in need of rebuttal, or actually submits the rebuttal evidence); <span class="Italic">Losure</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 201-02 (suggesting that as to rebuttal evidence, "[on]ce the agency makes out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence [then] shifts to the employee").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board did not explain that Schucker waived her rebuttal rights because she failed to object to a deadline, ask for leave, or make a showing. The Administrative Judge simply refused to consider the purported rebuttal evidence, citing only the November 13 deadline. <span id="Page_1324"></span>Accordingly, we decline, in the first instance, to address whether Schucker may have waived her rebuttal right under Board precedent. <span class="Italic">Sec. and Exch. Comm'n v. Chenery Corp.</span>, 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947) (holding that a reviewing court may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency's action that the agency itself has not given); <span class="Italic">Greater Boston Television</span>, 444 F.2d at 851 ("[T]he court...must not be left to guess as to the agency's findings or reasons.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency also argues that Schucker had notice of the type of evidence that the Agency would submit or, at least, should have anticipated it. The government thus contends that Schucker should have submitted rebuttal evidence simultaneously with the Agency's November 13, 2002 submission. Both the Agency's Response and its Prehearing Statement, however, presented only superficial arguments why the positions were "essentially identical." Neither document contained the evidence which Schucker addressed in the Taft affidavit's line-by-line rebuttal of the Agency's submitted evidence. Moreover, the notion of "anticipating evidence" runs counter to the policy enunciated in <span class="Italic">Schultz</span> and <span class="Italic">Losure</span> and the importance of the opportunity to present rebuttal evidence reflected in that policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Agency argues that this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Dorrall v. Department of Army</span> shows that the Board did not abuse its discretion in refusing to consider Schucker's rebuttal evidence. 301 F.3d at 1380. In <span class="Italic">Dorrall</span>, we held that the Board did not abuse its discretion when it chose not to consider a "Statement in Support of Appeal" submitted after the deadline set by the Board, noting that "Dorrall failed to show due diligence or the existence of circumstances beyond his control that prevented him from meeting the filing deadline." <span class="Italic">Id. Dorrall</span> deals, however, with appellant's burden to submit jurisdictional facts into the record at the outset of an appeal. That is in contrast to <span class="Italic">Schultz</span>, in which the Board already had jurisdiction, the record had been compiled, and the question was whether fairness required that appellant be given an opportunity to respond to a material agency submission in an appeal from a reduction-in-force decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Frampton v. Department of Interior</span>, we held that an administrative judge abused his discretion during a hearing by summarily prohibiting the petitioner "from completing the presentation of his evidence" on one of petitioner's principal defenses to an adverse personnel action. 811 F.2d 1486, 1489 (Fed. Cir. 1987). With respect to the parameters of a fair hearing and the right to present evidence, we said:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A fair hearing for employees who appeal to the MSPB from agency decisions is the basic cornerstone of employee rights. Under the statutory scheme, the hearing before the presiding official of the MSPB is the only opportunity which a discharged employee or one subjected to an adverse personnel action has to a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> trial before an impartial judge. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701, 7703. This is so because the scope of judicial review is severely limited by the language of the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c)(3). Many of these cases turn on findings of fact made by the presiding official on the basis of conflicting evidence. Consequently, his findings of fact result in the affirmance of MSPB decisions in all cases where the court finds that only factual issues are involved and that such findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...[P]residing officials have the authority to exclude truly irrelevant or overly repetitious testimony. <span class="Italic">Perkins v. Veterans Administration</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 58, 60 (1984). However, they should scrupulously avoid rulings which deny employees the fair and impartial trial guaranteed to them by the statute and regulation. When, as in this case, a presiding official cuts off an employee's attempt to present his testimony, supporting evidence, or defenses, the presiding official risks reversal of his decision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...Congress included the provision on hearings in that portion of the Act "in order to protect the right [sic] of employees" and to guarantee "a full and fair consideration of their case"....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...Since petitioner was summarily prohibited from completing the presentation of his evidence on this issue, he was effectively denied the right to the full and fair hearing envisioned....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (internal citations omitted). We also observed that "petitioner and his attorney were not without fault in the presentation of petitioner's case before the presiding official" and counseled that petitioner should be better prepared. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1490.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Frampton</span> is not controlling in the present case because Schucker waived her right to a hearing and chose to present her case on submissions. However, <span class="Italic">Frampton</span> reflects that fairness in adjudicating employee's rights is a cornerstone of proceedings before the Board. Even if the petitioner can be faulted for less than efficient presentation of evidence, that does not permit the Board, without explanation, to act in an inconsistent way.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Board excluded Schucker's rebuttal evidence and failed to offer a reasonable explanation for either changing or not following its longstanding practice of affording parties an opportunity to submit rebuttal evidence, we conclude that the Board acted arbitrarily. We vacate the Board's decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. In light of our decision, we need not and do not consider Schucker's claims based on due process or the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The parties must be careful about their evidentiary submissions to ensure they protect the right to submit responsive evidence. In cases not requiring hearings, particularly those involving jurisdictional questions, the AJ's order (including acknowledgment orders requiring evidentiary submissions on matters of jurisdiction and timeliness) may provide that the appellant submits his evidence, the agency submits its evidence, and the record then closes. But each party should have the opportunity to submit evidence in response to submissions by the other. Acknowledgment and other orders should provide for the right of reply, and if not, a party should file a motion seeking leave to reply (along with the information the party wishes to submit). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lamb v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 79, 84 n.1 (1989) ("The appellant cannot, in all fairness, raise material issues just prior to the closing of the record and then attempt to preclude the agency from responding. Therefore, we will consider these affidavits. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schultz v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 104, 106 (1982) (where an appeal is decided without a hearing, the procedures must comport with basic requirements of fairness and notice, including an opportunity for one party to respond to the submissions of another)."). Carefully read Board orders that require evidentiary submissions and then set record closing dates. Object to provisions that deny due process. Take affirmative action to establish a reply right. If additional information is necessary, request extensions for the pursuit of discovery and the submission of evidence for cases decided without a hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To an extent, the problem of last-minute evidentiary submissions was addressed in 2012 revisions of Board regulations, 5 CFR 1201.59 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Closing the record</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;If the appellant waives the right to a hearing, the record will close on the date the judge sets as the final date for the receipt or filing of submissions of the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Once the record closes, additional evidence or argument will ordinarily not be accepted unless:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The party submitting it shows that the evidence or argument was not readily available before the record closed; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;It is in rebuttal to new evidence or argument submitted by the other party just before the record closed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When AJs' are unclear about the timing of evidentiary submissions, the Board may intervene on PFR to ensure that the parties have a full chance to provide evidence if there was no hearing. <span class="Italic">O'Reilly v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 693, 695 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-8 (1999), described the confusing nature of a typical acknowledgment order concerning timeliness of an appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...On December 1, 1997, the administrative judge issued an acknowledgment order advising the appellant that his appeal appeared to be untimely filed and ordering him to submit evidence and argument, within 15 days of the date of the order, or December 16, 1997, showing that his appeal was timely filed or that good cause existed for the delay. The administrative judge advised the agency that it could file a response on the timeliness issue within 25 days of the date of the order, or December 26, 1997. The administrative judge further advised the parties that the record on the timeliness issue would close on December 26, 1997, and that no evidence or argument on the timeliness issue filed after the close of the record would be accepted unless the parties showed that it was new and material evidence that was unavailable before the record closed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 9, 1997, the appellant filed a completed designation of representative form. On December 10, 1997, the administrative judge received the agency's motion to dismiss, dated December 8, 1997, requesting that the appeal be dismissed as untimely filed. On December 23, 1997, the appellant, through his representative, filed a response to the agency's motion to dismiss, asserting in an affidavit that because of his mental and emotional problems he did not have the capacity to understand and file the appeal in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also on December 23, 1997, the administrative judge issued an initial decision, dismissing the petition for appeal as untimely filed. She found that...the appellant, who was represented by counsel, did not present evidence and argument regarding the timeliness issue by the December 16 deadline, [and] failed to demonstrate due diligence in filing his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant alleges that he was denied the opportunity to respond to the agency's motion to dismiss and that the administrative judge failed to consider his response on the timeliness issue which was filed on December 23, 1997.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record clearly establishes that the December 1, 1997 acknowledgment order stated that the record in this appeal would remain open until <span id="Page_1325"></span>December 26, 1997, to receive evidence and argument concerning the timeliness issue. Hence, it was reasonable for the appellant to have relied upon that order, and the record should have remained open, as stated, for the submission of evidence and argument on the timeliness issue until that date. We therefore find that the administrative judge erred in issuing the initial decision on December 23, 1997, during the time allotted to receive submissions, and that by doing so, she could not have considered the appellant's submission filed December 23, 1997. <span class="Italic">Gala v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 38 MSPR 474, 477, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 878 F.2d 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Department of Defense,</span> 28 MSPR 463, 465 (1985). Accordingly, we will admit and consider the appellant's December 23, 1997 submission.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If one party is precluded from responding to material evidence that is included in the opposing party's submission, and if the AJ relies on that evidence, the failure to allow the other party to respond to the evidence may warrant remand. The Board implied that a party should object if the AJ establishes submission dates that preclude responsive evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gavette v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 44 MSPR 166, 174 (1990) ("We note that the agency does not assert, and the record does not indicate, that the agency objected to the different deadlines set by the administrative judge for the receipt of the parties' final submissions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v. Department of the Army</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 600 (1987) (a party cannot wait until after adjudication to object to the administrative judge's rulings). Further, even assuming that the administrative judge erred in this regard, the agency has not shown how the administrative judge's consideration of this evidence prejudiced its substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Karapinka v. Department of Energy</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 124, 127 (1981) (the administrative judge's procedural error is of no legal consequence unless it is shown that it has adversely affected a party's substantive rights).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The bottom line is that if a hearing is waived, the AJ should provide the appellant with additional time, after the deadline for receipt of final argument and evidentiary submissions, to respond to any evidence submitted by the agency not previously reviewed by the appellant. <span class="Italic">Suliman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 14 MSPR 415, 417 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. USPS</span>, 39 MSPR 188, 193 (1988) (determination as to when to close the record must comport with the basic requirements of fairness, notice, and an opportunity to respond to the submissions of the parties). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hillis v. OPM</span>, 40 MSPR 592, 596 (1989) (distinguishing a failure to allow an appellant to respond to an agency pleading that argued the significance of evidence in the record but added no new evidence and raised no new issues).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant and his representative are expected promptly to notify the AJ if materials expected from the opposing side are not received on or before the date set for the record closing. If materials are not received, the appellant or his representative should submit a "verified statement of nonreceipt," according to <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 35 MSPR 322, 325 (1987) ("[A]lthough the appellant was on notice of the requirement for the submission of the agency's file, he did not allege non-receipt of this evidence until the petition for review. Further, the appellant did not submit a verified statement of non-receipt.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a hearing is waived, the interest of justice requires that the AJ monitor the submissions closely and request appropriate additional evidence. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Marine Corps</span>, 3 MSPR 328, 330 3 MSPB 411 (1980). Should a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant ask for clearly relevant material to be produced for consideration of the AJ, the request should be granted even though the appellant failed to follow discovery procedures. <span class="Italic">Hall v. USPS</span>, 13 MSPR 476 (1982). Under some circumstances, the AJ may be required to convene a hearing to order the appearance of witnesses and fully develop the record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hansen v. OPM</span>, 35 MSPR 1, 4 (1987) ("The administrative judge must order OPM to provide the necessary explanation of its evidence within whatever time period he finds appropriate, keeping in mind that a prudent agency already would have furnished it. If the administrative judge determines that it is necessary, he may order a hearing, within the limits prescribed by <span class="Italic">Callahan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 748 F.2d 1556 (Fed. Cir. 1984), '[t]o insure that the record is fully developed on significant issues,' 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(5)(ii), and he may order the appearance of any employee of OPM 'whose testimony would be relevant,'<span class="Italic"> id.,</span> &#x00A7; 1201.41(10).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Complications involving the state of the record can occur when the appellant first requests and then withdraws his hearing request and when the appellant does not show up for the hearing. The parties, or at least the agency, assume that evidence will come into the record through the hearing. When the anticipated hearing does not materialize, both sides must determine how to make the record complete for adjudication by the AJ. Under <span class="Italic">Teague v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 38 MSPR 123, 127 (1988), the AJ may admit additional evidence into the record should the appellant fail to appear at the hearing. This issue was left open in <span class="Italic">Callahan, supra</span>. <span class="Italic">Teague</span> explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Callahan</span>, the court stated that when an employee is absent from a hearing without justification the proper procedure is for the Board to consider the case on the agency's investigatory record alone....&#8197;Further, in <span class="Italic">Daniels v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 552 (1986), a case remanded from the Federal Circuit because the administrative judge improperly held a hearing and allowed the agency to introduce additional evidence at the hearing after the appellant failed to appear, the Board noted that the court remanded the case to determine whether the agency had proved its charges based on the "investigatory record" alone. The Board interpreted the investigatory record to mean the agency adverse action file submitted to the regional office in response to the regional office's initial order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, however, we find that the administrative judge did not err in considering additional written evidence from the agency. In <span class="Italic">Callahan</span>, the court specifically left open the possibility that the Board could allow the written record to be supplemented provided the employee had access to the new material and could also supplement the record.[6] In <span class="Italic">Daniels</span>, there is no indication that the appellant was given this opportunity. Here, however, the appellant was provided with the agency's exhibits and given the chance to respond or submit evidence of his own prior to the close of the record, as was the agency. Therefore, we find that the administrative judge did not err in considering these submissions in reaching her decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The court allowed this possibility "if the Board regulations permit." We find authority for such action well within the discretion of the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 5 CFR 1201.41, 1201.58 [now 1201.59] .</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether the record can be supplemented if a hearing is waived can be of strategic significance to the appellant and to the agency. Consider <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 42 MSPR 181, 184-86 (1989). The appellant was convicted of an off-duty shooting. Her work at the agency throughout the criminal proceedings (then unknown to the agency) was excellent and her ratings were exemplary. When the agency learned of the conviction, it removed her, relying on a presumption to establish nexus between her criminal conduct and her ability to hold her administrative job. On appeal to the Board, the appellant waived a hearing and sought to block evidence from being introduced by the agency to bolster its presumption, i.e., litigation-oriented statements by agency managers that they feared the appellant's presence at the work site. The Board admitted the evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations at 5 CFR 1201.58(b) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.59(b)] provide that "[i]f the appellant waives a hearing, the record shall be closed on the date set by the [administrative judge] as the final date for the receipt of submissions by the parties." As is evident from a reading of 5 CFR 1201.58(a) and (c) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.59(a) and (c)], the "submissions of the parties" referred to in 5 CFR 1201.58(b) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.59(b)] may include "argument, briefs or documents" or any "additional evidence" relevant to the proceedings. Nowhere is it stated that the "submissions of the parties" are restricted to final written submissions consisting only of argument, as alleged by the appellant. Further, the application of 5 CFR 1201.58(b) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.59(b)] remains within the discretion of the administrative judge so long as the procedures utilized comport with basic requirements of fairness and notice, including an opportunity to respond to submissions of the parties. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schultz v. CPSC</span>, 9 MSPB 370, 10 MSPR 104, 106 (1982). We find that the administrative judge here did not err by accepting into the record the agency's timely-submitted evidence, since the appellant, represented at all times by counsel, first requested a hearing, later withdrew that request, and was afforded an adequate opportunity to submit a written objection and rebuttal to the agency's evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Musone v. Dept. of Agriculture</span>, 31 MSPR 85, 89 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 818 F.2d 876 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held in <span class="Italic">Callahan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 748 F.2d 1556, 1559 (Fed. Cir. 1984), that, if an appellant requests, but does not appear at, a hearing, the Board may not take additional evidence from the agency but must adjudicate the case "on the basis of the appeals response alone." The appellant mischaracterizes and misinterprets the court's holding. In <span class="Italic">Callahan</span>, the court noted that an appellant before the Board has the option of a hearing or a decision on the record....&#8197;It found that, if an appellant forfeits the opportunity for a hearing by failing to appear at a requested hearing, "a decision on the record alone" is required....&#8197;The court placed no restrictions on what the "record" may consist of, stating only that, if the Board's regulations permitted the record to be supplemented, the employee must have access to the new material and be afforded a similar opportunity to supplement the record with written material.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;That the Federal Circuit views "the record" as including additional timely evidentiary submissions is demonstrated by its decision in <span class="Italic">Sanders v. USPS</span>, 801 F.2d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1986), where the court, citing to <span class="Italic">Callahan</span>, 748 F.2d at 1559, held that an administrative judge did not abuse his discretion by ordering the production of evidence, where the employee waived his right to a hearing and ignored his opportunity to supplement the record in response to the agency's submissions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, <span class="Italic">Callahan</span> is inapposite to the instant appeal. The appellant here did not fail to appear at a hearing that she requested and did not have a hearing in her absence. Rather, she withdrew her request for a hearing on the condition that the agency be restricted from submitting additional evidence beyond that already submitted with its response to her petition for appeal. However, the administrative judge did not place any "conditions" on the submission of evidence, and set August <span id="Page_1326"></span>14, 1987, as the closing date for receipt of evidence from both parties. A second date, August 21, 1987, was set for submission of final arguments and any additional evidentiary submissions that either party wanted to make in response to a submission of the other party. The agency made a timely submission of additional evidence, and both parties timely filed closing arguments. Although served with copies of the agency's additional evidence, the appellant made no new request for a hearing. The administrative judge then properly denied the appellant's motion to strike the agency's additional evidence and decided the appeal solely on the basis of the written record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, because we are unable to find anything in statute, regulation or case law to support the appellant's contention that evidence received by an administrative judge in the absence of a hearing must be restricted to that already contained in the petition for appeal and the response thereto, we find no reason to disturb the administrative judge's determinations in that regard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the hearing is waived, the agency must ensure that its evidence, if not already in the record, gets there. It is not the AJ's responsibility to ensure that the agency submits an evidentiary case when a hearing is waived by the appellant, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. IRS</span>, 14 MSPR 236, 240-41 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency further argues on review that the presiding official abused her discretion in not requesting verification of the government's ownership of the vehicle pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(9) or of taking judicial notice of it under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.67, especially since appellant did not raise this issue as a defense to the agency action. In addition, it argues that the page of the investigative report which it inadvertently omitted together with the other evidence submitted supports the charges by a preponderance of the evidence. These contentions are also without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the presiding official certainly has the authority to request the production of evidence as part of her authority to "conduct fair and impartial hearings," under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41, that authority does not detract from the agency's responsibility for the presentation of its case before the Board; nor does it require the presiding official to request additional evidence pertaining to the claim of the parties. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 1 MSPR at 519, "&#x00A7; 7701(c)(1) lays upon the agency the main burden of proof on whatever record is established before the Board, whether limited to written representations or expanded to include evidence adduced at a hearing, &#x00A7; 7701(b)." Moreover, the agency must establish every element of its charge by a preponderance of the evidence in order to sustain the charge....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since it failed to do so here, although inadvertently, it must bear the consequences of its failure, especially since we do not find that the presiding official abused her discretion in failing to take official notice in these circumstances. The issue of government ownership of this particular vehicle was not, in our view, necessarily a matter appropriate for official notice, especially in light of the agency's inadvertent omission of the page of the investigative report indicating that it was a government vehicle and its failure to request that official notice be given. Furthermore, since this evidence indicating government ownership of the vehicle driven by appellant cannot be considered on review, in that it does not constitute new and material evidence which was not previously available...we find that the presiding official correctly found that the agency had failed to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, appellant's unauthorized use of a government vehicle in violation of agency regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Regard for the state of the record is important whether or not a hearing is held. The Board will not consider as evidence in one appeal exhibits or testimony from another appeal unless the record in the other case is made part of the appealed case through a motion for consolidation or through some other procedure. In the ordinary course, each case stands on its own record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hipona v. Dept. of Army</span>, 39 MSPR 522, 525 n.2 (1989) ("Throughout the appellant's petition for review, he refers to exhibits which are not a part of the record in this appeal. Apparently, they were exhibits in his other case before the Board, <span class="Italic">Hipona v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, MSPB Docket No. CH300A8710279 (November 21, 1988. Because the appellant initially requested the cases be consolidated but later withdrew that request, the record in <span class="Italic">Hipona v. Office of Personnel Management</span> is not a part of the record in this case. Accordingly, the exhibits in that case are not a part of the record in this appeal."); <span class="Italic">Brooks v. DHHS</span>, 31 MSPR 576, 578 (1986) (initial decision must be reviewed on the basis of evidence presented to an AJ even if the AJ might have reached a different conclusion had the evidence been more complete); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Berry v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 21 MSPR 95, 96 (1984) ("an initial decision issued in another case does not constitute new and material evidence" supporting a PFR; distinguishing outcome of two seemingly similar cases with different results).
