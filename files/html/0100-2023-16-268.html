<h3 class="h3" id="sec8-268"><span class="space">A.</span> ULP CASE PROCESSING REGULATIONS</h3>
<p class="noindent">FLRA ULP case processing regulations are at 5 CFR Part 2423 (2022) [always check FLRA's website or other source for the most current edition of the regulations]:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2423.1 Can a Regional Office help the parties resolve unfair labor practice disputes before a Regional Director decides whether to issue a complaint?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Resolving unfair labor practice disputes before filing a charge.</span> The purposes and policies of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute) can best be achieved by the collaborative efforts of all persons covered by that law. The General Counsel encourages all persons to meet and, in good faith, attempt to resolve unfair labor practice disputes before filing unfair labor practice charges. If requested, and the parties agree, a representative of the Regional Office, in appropriate circumstances, may participate in these meetings to assist the parties to identify the issues and their interests and to resolve the dispute. Parties' attempts to resolve unfair labor practice disputes before filing an unfair labor practice charge do not toll the time limitations for filing a charge set forth at 5 U.S.C. 7118(a)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Resolving unfair labor practice disputes after filing a charge.</span> The General Counsel encourages the informal resolution of unfair labor practice allegations after a charge is filed and before the Regional Director makes a merit determination. A representative of the appropriate Regional Office, as part of the investigation, may assist the parties in informally resolving their dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2423.2 What Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) services does the OGC provide?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Purpose of ADR services.</span> The Office of the General Counsel furthers its mission and implements the agency-wide Federal Labor Relations Authority Collaboration and Alternative Dispute Resolution Program by promoting stable and productive labor-management relationships governed by the Statute and by providing services that assist labor organizations and agencies, on a voluntary basis, to:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Develop collaborative labor-management relationships;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Avoid unfair labor practice disputes; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;Informally resolve unfair labor practice disputes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Types of ADR Services.</span> Agencies and labor organizations may jointly request, or agree to, the provision of the following services by the Office of the General Counsel:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Facilitation.</span> Assisting the parties in improving their labor-management relationship as governed by the Statute;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Intervention.</span> Intervening when parties are experiencing or expect significant unfair labor practice disputes;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Training.</span> Training labor organization officials and agency representatives on their rights and responsibilities under the Statute and how to avoid litigation over those rights and responsibilities, and on using problem-solving and ADR skills, techniques, and strategies to resolve informally unfair labor practice disputes; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Education.</span> Working with the parties to recognize the benefits of, and establish processes for, avoiding unfair labor practice disputes, and resolving any unfair labor practice disputes that arise by consensual, rather than adversarial, methods.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ADR services after initiation of an investigation.</span> As part of processing an unfair labor practice charge, the Office of the General Counsel may suggest to the parties, as appropriate, that they may benefit from these ADR services.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2423.3 Who may file charges?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Filing charges.</span> Any person may charge an activity, agency, or labor organization with having engaged in, or engaging in, any unfair labor practice prohibited under 5 U.S.C. 7116.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Charging Party.</span> Charging Party means the individual, labor organization, activity, or agency filing an unfair labor practice charge with a Regional Director.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Charged Party.</span> Charged Party means the activity, agency, or labor organization charged with allegedly having engaged in, or engaging in, an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2423.4 What must you state in the charge and what supporting evidence and documents should you submit?</p>

<p class="noindent-1">2423.5 [Reserved]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2423.6 What is the process for filing and serving copies of charges?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Where to file.</span> You must file the charge with the Regional Director for the region in which the alleged unfair labor practice has occurred or is occurring. A charge alleging that an unfair labor practice has occurred or is occurring in two or more regions may be filed with the Regional Director in any of those regions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Date of filing.</span> When a Regional Director receives a charge, it is deemed filed. A charge filed during business hours by facsimile or electronic means is deemed received on the business day on which it is received (either by the Regional Office fax machine or by the eFiling system), until midnight local time in the Region where it is filed. But when a Region receives a charge after the close of the business day by any other method, it will be deemed received and docketed on the next business day. The business hours for each of the Regional Offices are set forth at <a href="https://www.flra.gov/">http://www.FLRA.gov</a><span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Method of filing.</span> You may file a charge with the Regional Director in person or by commercial delivery, first class mail, certified mail, facsimile, or electronically through use of the eFiling system on the FLRA's Web site at <a href="https://www.flra.gov/">www.flra.gov</a><span class="Italic">.</span> If filing by facsimile transmission or by electronic means, you are not required to file an original copy of the charge with the Region. You assume responsibility for the Regional Director's receipt of a charge. Supporting evidence and documents must be submitted to the Regional Director in person, by commercial delivery, first class mail, certified mail, facsimile transmission, or through the FLRA's eFiling system.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Service of the charge.</span> You must serve a copy of the charge (without supporting evidence and documents) on the Charged Party. Where facsimile equipment is available, you may serve the charge by facsimile transmission, as paragraph (c) of this section discusses. Alternatively, you may serve the charge by electronic mail ("email"), but only if the Charged Party has agreed to be served by email. The Region routinely serves a copy of the charge on the Charged Party, but you remain responsible for serving the charge, consistent with the requirements in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2423.7 [Reserved]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2423.8 How are charges investigated?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Investigation.</span> The Regional Director, on behalf of the General Counsel, conducts an investigation of the charge as deemed necessary. During the course of the investigation, all parties involved are given an opportunity to present their evidence and views to the Regional Director.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cooperation.</span> The purposes and policies of the Statute can best be achieved by the parties' full cooperation and their timely submission of all relevant information from all potential sources during the investigation. All persons must cooperate fully with the Regional Director in the investigation of charges. A failure to cooperate during the investigation of a charge may provide grounds to dismiss a charge for failure to produce evidence supporting the charge. Cooperation includes any of the following actions, when deemed appropriate by the Regional Director:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Making union officials, employees, and agency supervisors and managers available to give sworn/affirmed testimony regarding matters under investigation;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Producing documentary evidence pertinent to the matters under investigation;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;Providing statements of position on the matters under investigation; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;Responding to an agent's communications during an investigation in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Investigatory subpoenas.</span> If a person fails to cooperate with the Regional Director in the investigation of a charge, the General Counsel, upon recommendation of a Regional Director, may decide in appropriate circumstances to issue a subpoena under 5 U.S.C. 7132 for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary or other evidence. However, no subpoena, which requires the disclosure of intramanagement guidance, advice, counsel, or training within an agency or between an agency and the Office of Personnel Management, will issue under this section.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;A subpoena can only be served by any individual who is at least 18 years old and who is not a party to the proceeding. The individual who served the subpoena must certify that he or she did so:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;By delivering it to the witness in person;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;By registered or certified mail; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(iii)&#x2003;By delivering the subpoena to a responsible individual (named in the document certifying the delivery) at the residence or place of business (as appropriate) of the person for whom the subpoena was intended. The subpoena must show on its face the name and address of the Regional Director and the General Counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Any person served with a subpoena who does not intend to comply must, within 5 days after the date of service of the subpoena upon such person, petition in writing to revoke the subpoena. A copy of any petition to revoke must be served on the General Counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;The General Counsel must revoke the subpoena if the witness or evidence, the production of which is required, is not material and relevant to the matters under investigation or in question in the proceedings, or the subpoena does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence the production of which is required, or if for any other reason sufficient in law the subpoena is invalid. The General Counsel must state the procedural or other grounds for the ruling on the petition to revoke. The petition to revoke becomes part of the official record if there is a hearing under subpart C of this part.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;Upon the failure of any person to comply with a subpoena issued by the General Counsel, the General Counsel must determine whether to institute proceedings in the appropriate district court for the enforcement of the subpoena. Enforcement must not be sought if to do so would be inconsistent with law, including the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Confidentiality.</span> It is the General Counsel's policy to protect the identity of individuals who submit statements and information during the investigation, and to protect against the disclosure of documents obtained during the investigation, to ensure the General Counsel's ability to obtain all relevant information. However, after a Regional <span id="page_1541"></span>Director issues a complaint and when necessary to prepare for a hearing, the Region may disclose the identification of witnesses, a synopsis of their expected testimony, and documents proposed to be offered into evidence at the hearing, as required by the prehearing disclosure requirements in &#x00A7; 2423.23.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2423.9 How are charges amended?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the issuance of a complaint, the Charging Party may amend the charge under the requirements set forth in &#x00A7; 2423.6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2423.10 What actions may the Regional Director take with regard to your charge?</p>

<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Approve a request to withdraw a charge;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Dismiss a charge;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;Approve a written settlement agreement under &#x00A7; 2423.12;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;Issue a complaint; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;Withdraw a complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Request for appropriate temporary relief.</span> Parties may request the General Counsel to seek appropriate temporary relief (including a restraining order) under 5 U.S.C. 7123(d). The General Counsel may initiate and prosecute injunctive proceedings under 5 U.S.C. 7123(d) only upon approval of the Authority. A determination by the General Counsel not to seek approval of the Authority to seek temporary relief is final and cannot be appealed to the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">General Counsel requests to the Authority.</span> When a complaint issues and the Authority approves the General Counsel's request to seek appropriate temporary relief (including a restraining order) under 5 U.S.C. 7123(d), the General Counsel may make application for appropriate temporary relief (including a restraining order) in the district court of the United States within which the unfair labor practice is alleged to have occurred or in which the party sought to be enjoined resides or transacts business. The General Counsel may seek temporary relief if it is just and proper and the record establishes probable cause that an unfair labor practice is being committed. Temporary relief will not be sought if it would interfere with the ability of the agency to carry out its essential functions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Actions subsequent to obtaining appropriate temporary relief.</span> The General Counsel must inform the district court that granted temporary relief under 5 U.S.C. 7123(d) whenever an Administrative Law Judge recommends dismissal of the complaint, in whole or in part.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2423.11 What happens if a Regional Director decides not to issue a complaint?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Opportunity to withdraw a charge.</span> If the Regional Director determines that the charge has not been timely filed, that the charge fails to state an unfair labor practice, or for other appropriate reasons, the Regional Director may request the Charging Party to withdraw the charge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Dismissal letter.</span> If the Charging Party does not withdraw the charge within a reasonable period of time, the Regional Director will dismiss the charge and provide the parties with a written statement of the reasons for not issuing a complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appeal of a dismissal letter.</span> The Charging Party may obtain review of the Regional Director's decision to dismiss a charge by filing an appeal with the General Counsel, either in writing or by email to <span class="Italic">ogc.appeals@flra.gov,</span> within 25 days after the Regional Director served the decision. A Charging Party must serve a copy of the appeal on the Regional Director. The General Counsel must serve notice on the Charged Party that the Charging Party has filed an appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Extension of time.</span> The Charging Party may file a request, either in writing or by email to <span class="Italic">ogc.appeals@flra.gov,</span> for an extension of time to file an appeal, which must be received by the General Counsel not later than five (5) days before the date the appeal is due. A Charging Party must serve a copy of the request for an extension of time on the Regional Director.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Grounds for granting an appeal.</span> The General Counsel may grant an appeal when the appeal establishes at least one of the following grounds:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;The Regional Director's decision did not consider material facts that would have resulted in issuance of a complaint;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The Regional Director's decision is based on a finding of a material fact that is clearly erroneous;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;The Regional Director's decision is based on an incorrect statement or application of the applicable rule of law;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;There is no Authority precedent on the legal issue in the case; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;The manner in which the Region conducted the investigation has resulted in prejudicial error.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">General Counsel action.</span> The General Counsel may deny the appeal of the Regional Director's dismissal of the charge, or may grant the appeal and remand the case to the Regional Director to take further action. The General Counsel's decision on the appeal states the grounds listed in paragraph (e) of this section for denying or granting the appeal, and is served on all the parties. Absent a timely motion for reconsideration, the General Counsel's decision is final.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(g)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reconsideration.</span> After the General Counsel issues a final decision, the Charging Party may move for reconsideration of the final decision if it can establish extraordinary circumstances in its moving papers. The motion must be filed within 10 days after the date on which the General Counsel's final decision is postmarked. A motion for reconsideration must state with particularity the extraordinary circumstances claimed and must be supported by appropriate citations. The decision of the General Counsel on a motion for reconsideration is final.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2423.12 What types of settlements of unfair labor practice charges are possible after a Regional Director decides to issue a complaint but before issuance of a complaint?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Bilateral informal settlement agreement.</span> Before issuing a complaint, the Regional Director may give the Charging Party and the Charged Party a reasonable period of time to enter into an informal settlement agreement to be approved by the Regional Director. When a Charged Party complies with the terms of an informal settlement agreement approved by the Regional Director, no further action is taken in the case. If the Charged Party fails to perform its obligations under the approved informal settlement agreement, the Regional Director may institute further proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Unilateral informal settlement agreement.</span> If the Charging Party elects not to become a party to a bilateral settlement agreement, which the Regional Director concludes fulfills the policies of the Statute, the Regional Director may choose to approve a unilateral settlement between the Regional Director and the Charged Party. The Regional Director, on behalf of the General Counsel, must issue a letter stating the grounds for approving the settlement agreement and declining to issue a complaint. The Charging Party may obtain review of the Regional Director's action by filing an appeal with the General Counsel under &#x00A7; 2423.11(c) and (d). The General Counsel may grant an appeal when the Charging Party has shown that the Regional Director's approval of a unilateral settlement agreement does not fulfill the purposes and policies of the Statute. The General Counsel must take action on the appeal as set forth in &#x00A7; 2423.11(b) through (g).</p>

If the Charging Party fails or refuses to become a party to a formal settlement agreement offered by the Respondent, and the Regional Director concludes that the offered settlement will effectuate the policies of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, the agreement shall be between the Respondent and the Regional Director. The formal settlement agreement together with the Charging Party's objections, if any, shall be submitted to the Authority for approval. The Authority may approve a formal settlement agreement upon a sufficient showing that it will effectuate the policies of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Stipulations to the Administrative Law Judge.</span> Where the stipulation adequately addresses the appropriate material facts, the Administrative Law Judge may grant the motion and decide the case through stipulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Stipulations to the Authority.</span> Where the stipulation provides an adequate basis for application of established precedent and a decision by the Administrative Law Judge would not assist in the resolution of the case, or in unusual circumstances, the Authority may grant the motion and decide the case through stipulation.</p>
