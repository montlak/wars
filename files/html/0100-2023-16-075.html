<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-75"><span class="space">d.</span> "Substantial Impact"; 2020 Interpretation and Guidance; Judicial Reversion to <span class="Italic">De Minimis</span> Standard</h5>
<p class="noindent">Until the Policy was vacated in <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20220201137">25 F.4th 1</a> (D.C. Cir. 2022), <span class="Italic">post</span>, with the effect of continuing the preexisting de <span class="Italic">minimis</span> standard of impact of a change in working conditions necessary to trigger bargaining, through through a 2020 Request for General Statement of Policy or Guidance, without soliciting public comment in advance of the issuance, FLRA revised the standard for impact bargaining to a substantial change in conditions of employment from <span id="Page_1307"></span>the more recent standard requiring a change beyond the level of <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. The majority and dissenting opinions are provided from <span class="Italic">Dept. of Education and USDA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-190.html">71 FLRA 968</a>, 968-976 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting), concluding that "an agency will not be required to bargain over a change to a condition of employment unless the change is determined to have a substantial impact on a condition of employment":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to &#x00A7; 2427.2 of the Authority's Regulations,[1] the Petitioners request that the Authority issue a general statement of policy or guidance regarding the standard that the Authority should use for deciding whether a management-initiated change triggers an agency's duty to bargain under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute). Specifically, the Petitioners ask the Authority to return to the "clear and meaningful" substantial change standard, because arbitrators, judges, and the Authority have been "inconsist[ent] and ambigu[ous]" in their application of the current "<span class="Italic">de minimis</span>" standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2427.2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies are not excused from all bargaining obligations when they exercise management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute.[5] For example, when an agency makes a change to a condition of employment, it may be required to bargain over either procedures or appropriate arrangements (sometimes referred to as "impact and implementation bargaining") under &#x00A7; 7106(b). The term, "conditions of employment," is defined by the Statute as "personnel policies, practices, and matters...affecting working conditions."[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, not all changes that impact a condition of employment require an agency to bargain. Changes must be of a certain significance to trigger a bargaining obligation.[7] Over the course of its history, the Authority has applied two different standards to determine whether the impact of a change triggers bargaining. At its inception, the Authority applied the standard that had been followed under Executive Order (EO) 11,491.[8] Under that standard, &#x00A7; 7106(b) bargaining was required only when a change had a "substantial impact" on conditions of employment.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;Although the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard arises most frequently in the context of impact-and-implementation bargaining, we note the Authority formally extended the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception to changes in matters considered to be substantively negotiable in SSA, Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals, Charleston, S.C., 59 FLRA 646, 653-54 (2004) (Member Armendariz concurring; Member Pope dissenting) (adopting the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception to bargaining obligations where the agency's change does not involve the exercise of a management right), <span class="Italic">pet. den. sub nom. Ass'n of Admin. Law Judges v. FLRA</span>, 397 F.3d 957 (D.C. Cir 2005) (AALJ).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In 1985, the Authority adopted a new approach, under which bargaining was required whenever a change to a condition of employment was "more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>."[10] While both Members in <span class="Italic">Department of HHS, SSA, Region V Chicago, Illinois</span> (<span class="Italic">SSA Reg.

Member McGinnis embraced the new standard only to the extent that "<span class="Italic">de minimis</span> change" was defined as a "change which does not have a <span class="Italic">substantive</span> adverse effect upon unit employees" and only when it would not impact management's ability "to carry out [its] <span class="Italic">day-to-day operations</span>."[11] He also stated that the bargaining obligations imposed by &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) and (3) were "<span class="Italic">limited</span> in [their] scope and purpose," should not be used to "<span class="Italic">unduly impede</span> the exercise of a management right under the Statute," and cautioned that "[d]ecisions are made daily by every level of management, and <span class="Italic">if bargaining were required</span> on each and every decision, Government <span class="Italic">would grind to a halt</span>."[12]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Because the Authority has effectively extended the bargaining obligation under the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> test to conclude that a matter triggers an agency's duty to bargain whenever management has made any decision, no matter how small or trivial,[16] we agree with Petitioners that the application of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> test has "negatively impacted labor-management relations."[17] In our view, because the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> test has been drained of any determinative meaning, it is now incumbent on us to reexamine and clarify when management&#8209;initiated changes have a sufficiently significant impact on conditions of employment to require bargaining.[18]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In our view, two questions must be addressed <span class="Italic">before</span> determining whether a change is significant enough to require bargaining. Based on the definition of "conditions of employment" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) of the Statute, the first question is whether there has been an <span class="Italic">actual, agency-initiated change</span> to a "personnel polic[y], practice[&#8197;], and matter[&#8197;], whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise."[19] Second, the change must "affect[&#8197;] working conditions."[20]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[20]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Any standard that is used by the Authority (and concomitantly by arbitrators and judges) to determine whether a change is significant enough to warrant bargaining must draw a line that is meaningful and determinative. As noted above, cases adjudicated under the Statute's predecessor (EO 11,491) applied a substantial impact standard and that standard was originally followed by the Authority.[21] Neither <span class="Italic">SSA Reg. V</span> nor <span class="Italic">Department of HHS, SSA</span> gave any explanation or rationale to support the change.[22] Rather, despite precedent to the contrary,[23] the Authority puzzlingly rejected the substantial impact standard in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> (<span class="Italic">Dist., Region, Nat'l Office Unit</span>) by merely stating that it "ha[d] not adopted" the substantial impact standard.[24] Thus, it is difficult to determine whether the change was necessary, let alone based on reasoned decision-making.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We agree with our dissenting colleague that the Statute "encourage[s] collective bargaining between federal employees and [federal agencies]." However, it is equally true that the Statute recognized that collective bargaining in the public sector must be narrower--"to meet the special requirements and needs of the Government" and to be "consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government"[26]--than that permitted in the private sector.[27] It is incongruous, therefore, that the Authority should adopt a standard more lenient than the test applied by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), both now and when the Statute was promulgated,[28] to determine whether a change requires bargaining. The NLRB requires bargaining only when a purported change has a "material or substantial impact"[29] on bargaining-unit employees.[30]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[30]&#x2003;Moreover, we note that both the Authority and the dissent have recently looked to the NLRB's precedent for guidance on a variety of issues. E.g., <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of VA, VA Med. Ctr., Martinsburg, W. Va</span>., 67 FLRA 400, 402 (2014) ("Further, both the Authority and the NLRB have held that determining whether employees actually suffered a loss as a result of a ULP is a matter that may be resolved in compliance proceedings."); <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed.

The D.C.

<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing discussion, we conclude that a "more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>" test is not the appropriate standard to apply to determine whether a purported agency&#8209;initiated change is significant enough to impose upon an agency a statutory duty to bargain. By definition, "<span class="Italic">de minimis</span>" signals triviality. Therefore, it is incongruous to impose a statutory duty to bargain on matters that are barely more than trivial, <span class="Italic">but even more so</span>, when the matters have no substantial impact on conditions of employment. Accordingly, the Authority will not use "more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>" as a test to determine whether an agency has a duty to bargain over changes to conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Authority never provided a rationale for departing from the substantial impact standard (which was applied under EO 11,491) and because the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard is inconsistent with the purposes of the Statute, the Authority finds that a substantial&#8209;impact test is the appropriate means for determining whether a change to a condition of employment is significant enough to trigger a duty to bargain. Specifically, an agency will not be required to bargain over a change to a condition of employment unless the change is determined to have a substantial impact on a condition of employment.[31]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[31]&#x2003;Consistent with our approach under the now-rejected <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard, we will apply the substantial&#8209;impact test where the change at issue concerns matters that are substantively negotiable, as well as in the impact&#8209;and&#8209;implementation bargaining context. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> note 7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent contends that judicial precedent constrains the Authority to evaluate the significance of management-initiated changes using a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard, rather than substantial impact. But we think the dissent reads too much into judicial acceptance of the Authority's previous choice to employ a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard.[33] As with other areas of the Statute, the Authority is free to change its views, within the bounds of reasonableness. And the Authority's decision to change its view here finds support in countless judicial decisions affirming the use of standards other than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception to determine when matters were of too little importance to merit the law's notice.[34] Further, the dissent contends that the Authority's adoption of a substantial&#8209;impact test contravenes the judicial teaching that any changes with an "<span class="Italic">appreciable effect</span> on working conditions" must trigger an agency's duty to bargain.[35] That contention, however, is surprising because a common synonym for "appreciable" is "substantial."[36] Thus, our adoption of the substantial&#8209;impact test is consistent with relevant judicial teachings and plain language.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;As the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit noted in upholding the Authority's application of a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception to substantively negotiable matters, the Authority's rationale relied, in part, on the use of a "substantial impact" exception to bargaining over changes to substantively negotiable matters under EO 11,491. <span class="Italic">AALJ</span>, 397 F.3d at 960. And the court did not fault the Authority's reliance on the EO&#8209;era precedent by insisting, as the dissent does, that the only acceptable way to express that a change lacked the significance necessary to trigger an agency's duty to bargain was to call it "<span class="Italic">de minimis</span>." <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The majority's analysis is flawed at every step. It concludes that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine has "negatively impacted labor-management relations" based solely upon conclusory assertions made by the two agencies that requested the policy statement. It misconstrues precedent setting forth the Authority's rationale for adopting the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard.

And rather than providing our parties with a "meaningful and determinative" standard to replace the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard, the majority's decision will generate confusion and litigation over what this new standard actually means.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, the majority is simply incorrect in suggesting that the Authority has not previously provided a "rationale" for adopting the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard. In <span class="Italic">Department of HHS, SSA</span>,[41] the Authority explained that application of a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard was appropriate to ensure that its "adjudicative processes not be unnecessarily burdened with cases that do not serve to bring meaning and purpose to the Federal labor&#8209;management relations program."[42]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Relying upon the legal basis of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine--namely, that "the law does not concern itself about trifles"[43]--the Authority justified its application on grounds that "[i]nterpreting the Statute to require bargaining over every single management action, <span class="Italic">no matter how slight the impact of that action</span>," does not serve the aim of "promot[ing] meaningful bilateral negotiations."[44] But even in applying the exception, the Authority cautioned that "[t]he limited scope of Federal sector bargaining caused by external laws, rules, and regulations also demands that the Authority <span class="Italic">not impose further limitations</span> unless they are based on <span class="Italic">clear statutory authority</span> and are buttressed by <span class="Italic">sound policy considerations</span>."[45]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's adoption of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine was later affirmed by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit) in <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Administrative Law Judges v. FLRA</span> (<span class="Italic">AALJ</span>).[46] In <span class="Italic">AALJ</span>, the court concluded that the Authority, like other administrative agencies, was authorized to apply a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception "not [as] an ability to depart from the statute [they are charged with enforcing], but rather [as] a tool to be used in implementing the legislative design."[47] As the court previously explained in a decision favorably cited in <span class="Italic">AALJ</span>, the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine arises from the principle that "[c]ourts should be reluctant to apply the literal terms of a statute to mandate pointless expenditures of effort."[48]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">But because the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception is derived from implied statutory authority, courts also place significant limits on how agencies may apply it.

<p class="noindent-2">While agencies may safely be assumed to have discretion to create exceptions at the margins of a regulatory field, they are not thereby empowered to weigh the costs and benefits of regulation at every turn; agencies surely do not have inherent authority to second-guess Congress' calculations.[51]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with these principles, the court concluded in AALJ that the Authority could find that a "<span class="Italic">de minimis</span> change is not a proper subject of bargaining" if the change "<span class="Italic">has no appreciable effect</span> upon working conditions."[52] Applying this standard, the court concluded that the agency was not required to bargain over the matter in question because it involved "a truly insignificant change" to the employees' conditions of employment.[53] And, on this basis, it affirmed "the Authority's interpretation of the Statute not to require bargaining over trivia."[54]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With little apparent concern for this clear judicial guidance, the majority's decision jettisons the Authority's long-standing <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard in favor of a standard that will relieve agencies from bargaining over a unilateral change to conditions of employment unless the change is determined to have a "substantial impact" on those conditions of employment.[60] The majority does not further define the contours of this new standard. And because its decision was issued outside the context of an actual case or controversy, it is difficult to determine the degree to which the new standard will absolve agencies of their statutory duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[60]&#x2003;Majority at 6.

<p class="noindent-1">It <span class="Italic">is</span> clear, however, that if applied according to its terms, this new standard will far exceed the permissible boundaries of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception. The word "substantial" is commonly defined to mean "considerable in quantity; significantly great."[61] On the other hand, the word "appreciable"--the term used by the court in construing the limits of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception--is commonly defined as "capable of being perceived or measured."[62] Under any plausible interpretation of these terms, the majority's expansion of our existing <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception falls well outside the "narrow limits" within which the Authority may legitimately apply the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine.[63]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Despite this obvious conflict, the majority has failed to set forth a single credible basis for reversing our long-standing precedent on this matter. As noted, its conclusion that the existing <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard has "negatively impacted" labor-management relations is based solely upon conclusory assertions made by the agencies that <span class="Italic">requested</span> the policy guidance. And as a direct consequence of its decision to "forgo solicitation for public comments," these assumptions were untested by the labor-relations community.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Undeterred, the majority opines that revision of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard is necessary because it has resulted in "unpredictable" applications. In support of this assertion, the majority cites a number of decisions in which the Authority--unlike in today's decision--applied the standard to an actual dispute. But the cases cited by the majority simply reflect the inherently fact-dependent nature of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception. The majority fails to explain how adoption of its new standard will produce decisions that are any less fact-dependent than those applying the current standard. In reality, adopting the majority's standard will not reduce the complexity of litigation concerning what constitutes a sufficiently significant change to trigger bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">And on this point, it is worth noting that the AALJ decision found "little indication" that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception as applied to "impact bargaining" had resulted in "significant confusion."[66] In fact, the court expressed confidence that if the Authority ever found that its administration of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception became "more burdensome than would be the alternative of bargaining over trivia," the Authority would "conclude the interests of 'effective and efficient Government'" would be "better served by <span class="Italic">dispensing</span> with the exception."[67] Of course, that is the opposite of what the majority has done today.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[66]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AALJ</span>, 397 F.3d at 963.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[67]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">And rather than attempting to harmonize its expansion of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard with the court decisions that have directly addressed its inherent limits, the majority simply concludes that the dissent is "read[ing] too much" into these decisions. It then blithely asserts that its adoption of a substantial impact test "is consistent with relevant judicial teaching and [the] plain language" of those decisions. Neither assertion is true.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the first assertion, the majority claims that its decision "finds support in countless judicial decisions affirming the use of standards other than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception to determine when matters were of too little importance to merit the law's notice." In support of this claim, it cites two decisions in which courts have found that "materiality" is an element of proving violations of statutes prohibiting false statements, and a third decision which found that "materiality" was a required element for conviction under a statute governing criminal obstruction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These decisions, which are based upon the particular language and legislative purpose of the statutes they are construing, are certainly relevant to the resolution of claims arising under those statutes. But they have <span class="Italic">nothing whatsoever</span> to do with the judicial recognition and application of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine, which--as explained--is specifically premised upon the principle that administrative agencies are not required to enforce the literal terms of a statute if doing so would only yield a gain of "trivial or no value."[72]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the second assertion, the majority concludes that its "substantial impact" standard falls within the limits of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine as defined by the D.C. Circuit because "a common synonym for 'appreciable' is 'substantial.'" There are several problems with this conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, as one court has explained, "a thesaurus is not a dictionary" because "[i]t does not purport to define words but instead suggests synonyms and antonyms."[74] And "[a] synonym is not a definition because words that are similar can, and often do, have distinct meanings."[75] But whatever interpretative value a thesaurus synonym might provide in this matter is diminished, if not eliminated, because the synonym for "appreciable" upon which the majority relies is squarely inconsistent with its <span class="Italic">actual</span> definition--namely, "capable of being perceived or measured."[76] And any lingering doubt on this question is surely resolved by the D.C. Circuit's repeated explanations that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception should only be applied to excuse bargaining over trivial matters.[77]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the majority's suggestion that a return to the "substantial impact" standard is necessary because it was "the standard that had been followed under Executive Order 11,491" (EO 11,491) is also unfounded.[78] The legislative history of the Statute "makes clear" that Congress intended the Statute to "expand the scope of bargaining that had existed" under EO 11,491 and Federal Labor Relations Council precedent interpreting that order.[79] Indeed, EO 11,491 "did not require 'collective bargaining' at all," and, instead, "merely required agencies and unions to 'meet...and confer in good faith with respect to personnel policies and practices and matters affecting working conditions, so far as may be appropriate.'"[80]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The majority's reliance upon the National Labor Relations Board's (Board or NLRB) adoption of a "substantial impact" standard is similarly defective. While decisions interpreting the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) may be relevant to our interpretation of the Statute, "the degree of relevance of private case law to public sector labor relations [varies] greatly depending upon the particular statutory provisions and legal concepts at issue."[81]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Board's adoption of a "substantial impact" standard bears no relevance to the Authority's <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard because the standards are governed "by different statutory provisions and by different policy considerations."[82] This follows from the fact that the NLRA does not set forth the precise scope of collective bargaining. And in the "absence of a precise statutory definition of the subjects [of bargaining,] the Board very early assumed the role of defining compulsory bargaining subjects."[83] This, in turn, afforded the Board "significant discretion to define the scope of bargaining."[84]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The same simply cannot be said for the Authority, which is required to adhere to specific statutory definitions in determining the scope of federal&#8209;sector collective bargaining.

<p class="noindent-1">As explained by the D.C. Circuit, the Statute "extends the scope of [the] duty to bargain to include all 'conditions of employment,'" while it expressly excludes "several conditions of employment from this bargaining obligation," including matters related to reserved management rights.[85] Thus, the court explained, "[t]he statutory framework...may be envisioned as imposing a broadly defined duty to bargain over conditions of employment that is subject <span class="Italic">only</span> to the express statutory exceptions."[86] In other words, "apart from the <span class="Italic">express</span> exceptions, Congress intended the bargaining obligation to be construed broadly."[87]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">It is therefore not "incongruous," as the majority asserts, for the Authority to "adopt a standard more lenient than the test applied by the [NLRB]...to determine whether a change requires bargaining." To the contrary, the distinct differences between our Statute and the NLRA require precisely this outcome.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Perhaps the most troubling aspect of today's decision, however, is the majority's assertion that its broad expansion of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception <span id="Page_1311"></span>is necessitated by Congress's direction that the Statute be interpreted in a manner "consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government."[89] The Authority has been cautioned that, in providing an underlying rationale for its decisions, "[i]t is not enough to refer in Delphic tones to inherent authority, or to rely vaguely on [its] general duty to interpret the [S]tatute with government efficiency in mind."[90]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">But more importantly, in the same statutory provision upon which the majority relies for this assertion, Congress <span class="Italic">also</span> found that the statutory protection of the right of employees to collectively bargain "safeguards the public interest, contributes to the effective conduct of public business, and facilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes between employees and their employers involving conditions of employment."[91] And based upon these findings, Congress explicitly concluded that "collective bargaining in the civil service [is] in the public interest."[92]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Courts have routinely applied these Congressional findings to conclude that the statutory right to collectively bargain should be broadly interpreted.&#x2003;Indeed, in one of the earliest judicial decisions construing our Statute, the D.C.

<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, the court relied upon the same Congressional findings to conclude that "Congress passed the [Statute] to <span class="Italic">encourage</span> collective bargaining between federal employees and their employers."[95] And it further concluded that "erect[ing] barriers to collective bargaining that are inconsistent with the text and purposes of the [S]tatute" are not "in the public interest" because they "hamper realization of the benefits that such bargaining produces."[96]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Stated succinctly, Congress premised our Statute upon a finding that collective bargaining promotes the public interest because it <span class="Italic">contributes</span> to the efficient accomplishment of government operations. The majority's decision not only ignores these findings, but essentially casts collective bargaining as a potential <span class="Italic">threat</span> to an "effective and efficient Government."[97] And based upon this fundamentally flawed premise, it jettisons decades of carefully-reasoned precedent in favor of a standard that, by any reading, far exceeds the permissible boundaries of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception.[98]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Given the absence of any plausible rationale for today's policy statement--and the disingenuous manner in which it was decided--I can only conclude that the majority's decision is driven solely by its disdain for the role of collective bargaining under our Statute and its relentless effort to marginalize the role of unions in the federal sector.</p>

<p class="noindent">AFGE v. FLRA, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20220201137">25 F.4th 1</a>, 1-12 (D.C. Cir. 2022), vacated FLRA's policy issuance and returned the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> bargaining test:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By statute, certain federal employers are required to engage in collective bargaining with their employees' representatives whenever there is a management-initiated change to the "conditions of employment affecting such employees." Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7102(2), 7103(a)(14). Congress has defined "conditions of employment" to include "personnel policies, practices, and matters. . .affecting working conditions," with certain enumerated exceptions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14). And from the mid-1980s until the policy statement challenged here, the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA") interpreted these statutory provisions to require collective bargaining over any workplace changes that have more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on such working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In September of 2020, the FLRA adopted a new threshold for when collective bargaining is required. Under the agency's new standard, the duty to bargain is triggered only if a workplace change has "a substantial impact on a condition of employment." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Educ</span>., 71 F.L.R.A. 968, 971 (2020). The petitioners are public-sector labor unions that challenge the FLRA's decision to alter the bargaining threshold; they maintain that the FLRA's new standard is both inconsistent with the governing statute and insufficiently explained, and is therefore arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the opinion that follows, we hold that the FLRA's decision to abandon its <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception in favor of a substantial-impact threshold was not sufficiently reasoned, and thus is arbitrary and capricious in violation of section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act ("APA"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A). We therefore grant the unions' petitions for review and vacate the FLRA's policy statement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the fall of 2020, it was the longstanding view of the FLRA that, despite certain federal employers' clear statutory duty to engage in collective bargaining over "conditions of employment," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12), some public-sector management decisions were not subject to bargaining if they had only a "<span class="Italic">de minimis</span> impact" on such conditions. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health&#x0026;Human Servs. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., 24 F.L.R.A. 403, 407 (1986); <span class="Italic">see also Dep't of Health&#x0026;Human Servs. Soc. Sec. Admin. Reg. V</span>, 19 F.L.R.A. 827, 834 (1985) (McGinnis, concurring); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health&#x0026;Human Servs. Soc. Sec. Admin. Chi. Region</span>, 15 F.L.R.A. 922, 924 (1984). The <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> impact exception, the FLRA explained, "derive[s] from the Latin phrase ‘<span class="Italic">De minimis non curat lex</span>,' which. . .mean[s] that the law does not care for, or take notice of, very small or trifling matters[.]" <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health&#x0026;Human Servs. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>, 24 F.L.R.A. at 407&#x0026;n.2 (quoting <span class="Italic">De Minimis Non Curat Lex</span>, BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (5th ed. 1979)). In other words, the FLRA read 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12) and (14) to imply a narrow exception to the statute's collective bargaining requirement; one that pertained to management decisions that had only a trivial effect on conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In October of 2019, the United States Departments of Education and Agriculture jointly requested that the FLRA issue a general statement of policy changing the impact threshold at which collective bargaining becomes mandatory. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2427.2 (providing for general statements of policy or guidance). The Departments alleged several problems with the longstanding <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard. For instance, they asserted that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> policy was insufficiently concrete to permit consistent application, causing unnecessary litigation. They also asserted that "effective and efficient government would be promoted by the establishment" of a clearer standard, and they maintained that the ideal standard would be one under which only a "substantial change"--or, rather, a change having a "substantial impact" on conditions of employment--triggers the duty to bargain. Request for General Statement of Policy or Guidance at 3-4, J.A. 3-4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On September 30, 2020, the FLRA adopted the Departments' proposed standard over a dissent and without soliciting public comment. In a four-page policy statement, the FLRA announced that "an agency will not be required to bargain over a change to a condition of employment unless the change is determined to have a substantial impact on a condition of employment." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Educ</span>., 71 F.L.R.A. at 971. The FLRA stated that the "more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>" test for determining when the duty to bargain is triggered is "not the appropriate standard," <span class="Italic">id</span>., in part because that test had resulted in bargaining "whenever management has made any decision, no matter how small or trivial" and is also "unpredictable," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 969. The FLRA further faulted the initial agency decision to adopt the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard on the grounds that it was insufficiently explained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 970. With respect to the substantial-impact test, the FLRA suggested that this new standard would create "a line that [was] meaningful and determinative[,]" and noted that substantial impact is the governing bargaining threshold in the private sector. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's dissenting member argued that the agency's adoption of a new bargaining threshold was an unjustifiable departure from past precedent and that there was a clear legal basis for the agency's prior adoption of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 972 (DuBester, dissenting). The dissent also maintained that the substantial-impact test was contrary to the governing statute, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 973, and that the FLRA's policy change was not sufficiently reasoned or explained, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 973-76.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1312"></span>The petitioners in these consolidated cases--the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, the National Treasury Employees Union, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO--are labor unions that represent employees of government agencies that the FLRA's policy change covers. Each filed a timely petition for review of the FLRA's policy statement, and we consolidated the petitions. The unions have standing as employee representatives whose "bargaining position" would be "fundamentally diminished" under the FLRA's new interpretation, <span class="Italic">see Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. Chertoff</span>, 452 F.3d 839, 853 (D.C. Cir. 2006), and we have jurisdiction over their petitions for review, see 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The unions challenge the FLRA's policy statement on two grounds, both of which implicate APA standards. First, they argue that the new substantial-impact threshold rests on an impermissible reading of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7103(a)(12) and (a)(14); they contend, in particular, that removing management initiated changes whose effects are more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> but less than substantial from the scope of collective bargaining is contrary to the plain and unambiguous language of these statutory provisions. Second, the unions assail the FLRA's policy statement adopting the substantial-impact standard as arbitrary and capricious. See 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A). In this regard, according to the unions, the FLRA's explanation for dispensing with its old policy and adopting the new one was insufficient to support the policy change.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our analysis begins with the petitioners' arbitrary and capricious challenge. The petitioners also challenge the substantial-impact exception as contrary to the statute and unsupported by any canon that would justify its treatment as "inherent in most statutory schemes by implication." <span class="Italic">See Ass'n of Admin. Law Judges v. FLRA (AALJ)</span>, 397 F.3d 957, 962 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quoting <span class="Italic">Env't Def. Fund, Inc. v. EPA</span>, 82 F.3d 451, 466 (D.C. Cir. 1996)). Because we hold that the policy is unreasoned, we need not and do not reach the statutory claim. <span class="Italic">Cf. Shays v. FEC</span>, 414 F.3d 76, 97 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (declining to assess a claim about the meaning of a statutory provision where the failure of the challenged action under the arbitrary and capricious standard offered a sufficient basis for decision).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the arbitrary and capricious standard, "we must ensure that the [FLRA] ‘examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.'" <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA (AFGE 2020)</span>, 961 F.3d 452, 456 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (alterations in original) (quoting <span class="Italic">Fred Meyer Stores, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 865 F.3d 630, 638 (D.C. Cir. 2017)). The key question is, at its core, whether the FLRA "engage[d] in reasoned decisionmaking." <span class="Italic">Fred Meyer</span>, 865 F.3d at 638 (internal citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project</span>, 141 S. Ct. 1150, 1158 (2021). And while the FLRA certainly "may depart from its precedent," in so doing, it "must supply a reasoned analysis indicating that prior policies and standards are being deliberately changed." <span class="Italic">AFGE 2020</span>, 961 F.3d at 457 (quoting <span class="Italic">Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Emps. v. FLRA</span>, 369 F.3d 548, 553 (D.C. Cir. 2004)). The agency must also show that "the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, and that the agency believes it to be better" than the previous policy. <span class="Italic">FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc</span>., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (emphasis omitted). With these standards in mind and for the reasons explained below, we conclude that the FLRA's decision to abandon its longstanding precedents and adopt the substantial-impact standard was not sufficiently reasoned in several critical respects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first problem with the FLRA's reasoning is that its policy statement falls short on explaining the purported flaws of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To start, the policy statement's description of the problem it seeks to solve is inconsistent. At the beginning of its substantive discussion, the FLRA laments that "[it] has effectively extended the bargaining obligation under the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> test to. . .trigger[ ] an agency's duty to bargain whenever management has made any decision, no matter how small or trivial." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Educ</span>., 71 F.L.R.A. at 969. The policy statement explains that this purportedly ubiquitous misapplication of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard to require bargaining in any and all circumstances has "drained" that standard "of any determinative meaning[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the preceding paragraphs, however, the policy statement's background section highlights its concern that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard is "unpredictable" and "has created uncertainty," citing several examples of cases in which the FLRA concluded that a workplace change was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> and thus beyond the scope of bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 969 &#x0026; n.14; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 970 n.18 (explaining that the FLRA forewent solicitation of public comments "because we are well aware of the confusion sown by nearly thirty-five years of our caselaw").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is not at all clear how the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard could both lead inexorably to the conclusion that all management decisions "no matter how small or trivial" must be subject to bargaining and at the same time yield unpredictable results, including, by the FLRA's own telling, many instances in which the duty to bargain was not triggered. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 969 &#x0026; n.14. Yet that is how the FLRA's policy statement reads: the existing standard both purportedly subjects every minor decision to review and is unworkable because it is impossible to predict.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even looking past this apparent contradiction, the FLRA's claim that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard's unpredictability has "created uncertainty that has negatively impacted labor management relations" is unconvincing on its own terms. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 969 (internal quotation marks omitted). As evidence of the "vast differences of opinion among arbitrators, judges, and the [FLRA itself] as to what matters affect conditions of employment sufficiently to require bargaining," the FLRA cites four pairs of decisions that involve purportedly similar facts in which the FLRA found certain management-initiated changes to be more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> (and thus subject to bargaining) and others to be <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> (and thus not). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 969 &#x0026; n.14. But closer inspection reveals that these divergent results are readily explained by distinguishable contexts. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 973 (DuBester, dissenting) ("[T]he cases cited by the majority simply reflect the inherently fact-dependent nature of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Take, for instance, the policy statement's citation to two decisions about office and seating arrangements that the agency now claims were contradictory. In Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland, the FLRA concluded that "changes in seating assignments. . .including the movement of four employees (one-fourth of all [bargaining] unit employees) and one employee[']s[ ] loss of access to a window" when considered together were "sufficient to support the. . .conclusion that the changes in seating arrangements were more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>." U.S. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Soc. Sec. Admin., Balt., Md</span>., 36 F.L.R.A. 655, 668, 688 (1990)). In <span class="Italic">GSA, Region 9</span>, on the other hand, the FLRA determined that an employer's decision to temporarily move a single employee to another building--after her union suggested that such a temporary move would benefit the employee--had, in light of "equitable considerations," only a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> impact on her working conditions. 52 F.L.R.A. 1107, 1108-09, 1111-12 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To describe these decisions is to distinguish them. And the latter decision, <span class="Italic">GSA, Region 9</span>, indeed expressly distinguished the former as being about a "permanent relocation[ ] of employees that w[as] instituted by agency management for operational reasons," rather than a temporary move at the employee's union's suggestion. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1112 (citing U.S. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Soc. Sec. Admin., Balt., Md</span>., 36 F.L.R.A. at 655). The FLRA's summary assertion that these decisions were irreconcilable and thus evidence of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception's unpredictability thus lacks merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's other examples are more of the same. For instance, the agency speciously summarizes one of its decisions as holding that "[r]equiring [an] employee to give up a ‘second' office while keeping [his] primary office" was "more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>" and another as determining that "moving an employee permanently to a vacant office [was] held not to be more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Educ</span>., 71 F.L.R.A. 969 n.14 (first citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Space &#x0026; Missile Sys. Ctr., Detachment 12, Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M</span>., 64 F.L.R.A. 166, 173-74 (2009); and then citing <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps.' Union, Chapter 26</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. 650, 653 (2012)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But these decisions too are readily distinguishable on their facts. U.S. Department of the Air Force concerned an employer's decision to downsize the workspace of a trainer who was a member of the relevant collective bargaining unit. 64 F.L.R.A. at 173-74. In that case, the FLRA held that the employer's decision to downsize the trainer's primary office at the same time it took away a second workspace that he had used to conduct certain face-to-face training and store equipment--changes made on short notice and without relocation assistance--when viewed alongside problems with the new workspace, constituted a more-than-<span class="Italic">de minimis</span> change. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. In stark contrast, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees' Union, Chapter 26</span>, was not about the reassignment of a union employee at all; instead, it concerned a union's challenge to an employer's decision to assign an employee outside the bargaining unit to a vacant workstation in the same office as employees in the bargaining unit. 66 F.L.R.A. at 652-53. Unsurprisingly, the FLRA held that the mere presence of an employee outside the bargaining unit in the same office as unit members had only a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on the union employees' conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 653. Once again, the FLRA's evidence of an irretrievably broken standard falls flat.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As this court observed once before, "there is little indication that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception" has created the sort of "confusion" the FLRA now claims. <span class="Italic">AALJ</span>, 397 F.3d at 963. Rather than demonstrate such confusion, the examples that the FLRA cites to frame the problem it seeks to address seem to us to demonstrate rigorous application by the FLRA of a fact-intensive standard to varying factual contexts. Put another way, far from demonstrating the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard is unworkable, the FLRA's policy statement simply appears to demonstrate how it works.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's condemnation of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> test also fails to grapple with the agency's own past policy choices and this court's decisions upholding them</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the policy statement under review, the FLRA insists that the <span id="Page_1313"></span>agency's initial adoption of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> threshold back in 1985 was insufficiently explained and reasons that this initial failure supports the 2020 policy change. In this regard, the FLRA explains that the agency had used a substantial-impact standard for a few years before it adopted the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> threshold in 1985. And it calls the decision to discard the substantial-impact standard in favor of the de minimis threshold "specious" for failing to "provide any rationale as to why the substantial impact standard was incorrect." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Educ</span>., 71 F.L.R.A. at 970 n.24. The FLRA further suggests that if a rigorous statutory analysis had been done in 1985, the agency would have discovered that "the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard is inconsistent with the purposes of the Statute." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 971. Thus, the FLRA seeks to cast its policy change as merely correcting thirty-five-year-old procedural and interpretive errors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That rationale cannot withstand scrutiny. It is true that before it adopted the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception in 1985 the FLRA had applied a substantial-impact standard like the one at issue here, apparently as a carryover from the executive-order regime that governed public-sector labor relations before the enactment of the Labor-Management Relations Statute in 1978. But the mere fact that the FLRA briefly used a substantial impact standard soon after the agency's creation does not provide inherent support for the present decision to discard thirty-five years of intervening precedent and return to that past policy. Indeed, Executive Order 11491, which governed before the Labor-Management Relations Statute, did not require bargaining at all. Instead, it directed agencies to "meet. . .and confer in good faith with respect to personnel policies and practices and matters affecting working conditions, so far as may be appropriate," Exec. Order No. 11,491 &#x00A7; 11(a), 3 C.F.R. (1966-1970), which is in marked contrast to the Labor-Management Relations Statute's requirement that agencies bargain over "any condition of employment," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b)(2); <span class="Italic">see also Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Emps. v. FLRA</span>, 369 F.3d 548, 554 (D.C. Cir. 2004) ("Congress passed the Federal Labor Relations Act to encourage collective bargaining between federal employees and their employers."). And the FLRA has itself recognized that the Labor-Management Relations Statute is more protective of collective bargaining than was the Executive Order and practice thereunder. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Educ</span>., 71 F.L.R.A. at 974 &#x0026; nn. 42-44 (DuBester, dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the FLRA's characterization of its earlier decisions as lacking explanation for its adoption of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception is misleading. In fact, as the dissenting Commissioner points out, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 974-75 (DuBester, dissenting), those earlier decisions expressly considered the question, and in light of Congress's clear purpose of expanding public-sector bargaining rights, the mid-1980s FLRA specifically "rejected the ‘substantial impact' test" in favor of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception, <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs. Soc. Sec. Admin. Chi. Region</span>, 15 F.L.R.A. at 924. What is more, the agency explained back then that it was rejecting the substantial-impact threshold both because the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> test struck the correct balance between government efficiency interests and labor rights, <span class="Italic">see Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs. Soc. Sec. Admin. Reg. V</span>, 19 F.L.R.A. at 834 (McGinnis, concurring), and because "[t]he limited scope of Federal sector bargaining caused by external laws, rules, and regulations also demands that the [FLRA] not impose further limitations unless they are based on clear statutory authority and are buttressed by sound policy considerations," <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., 24 F.L.R.A. at 406-07. And the FLRA has since reiterated the view that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard is "the appropriate threshold" under the relevant statutory provisions. <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin. Off. of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals</span>, 59 F.L.R.A. 646, 653 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd, AALJ</span>, 397 F.3d at 964.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, the FLRA's reasons for replacing the substantial-impact standard with the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception back in the mid-1980s were not tidily arranged in a single decision. But the FLRA's present assertion that the agency had offered no "explanation or rationale to support the change" from the substantial-impact test to the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard, <span class="Italic">Dep't of Educ</span>., 71 F.L.R.A. at 970, is simply incorrect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notably, even if the FLRA had failed to provide an adequate explanation for its adoption of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard more than thirty-five years ago, any such failure would not absolve the agency of its present-day responsibility to explain its decision to jettison the precedents that apply the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> threshold. The FLRA cannot point to a latent and unchallenged purported defect in the original adoption of its prior policy and offer that as an independent basis for adopting a new one. Rather, the decision to adopt a new policy must be sufficiently explained on its own terms, because "[i]n administrative law, as elsewhere, two wrongs do not make a right." <span class="Italic">Am. Wild Horse Pres. Campaign v. Perdue</span>, 873 F.3d 914, 928 (D.C. Cir. 2017). We have long held that "we cannot condone the ‘correction' of one error by the commitment of another," <span class="Italic">id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Gray v. Mississippi</span>, 481 U.S. 648, 663 (1987)), and we decline to do so here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, to the extent that the FLRA now asserts that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard must go because it is categorically "inconsistent with the purposes of the [Labor-Management Relations] Statute," <span class="Italic">Dep't of Educ</span>., 71 F.L.R.A. at 971, that contention is plainly contrary to this court's past interpretation of the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In AALJ, for instance, a union challenged the FLRA's application of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception to a new category of management decisions. The agency argued the exception was inherent in the statute, and thus urged us to hold that collective bargaining was not required for a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> change to conditions of employment. We agreed, concluding that an exception for <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effects on conditions of employment is "inherent in" the statute and thus "neither contrary to the text nor unreasonable in light of" the Labor-Management Relations Statute's purpose. <span class="Italic">AALJ</span>, 397 F.3d at 959, 962.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our holding in <span class="Italic">AALJ</span> is a clear recognition of the appropriateness of a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception to the duty to bargain, as a matter of law. Thus, when the FLRA nevertheless reached the conclusion that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> test is not "appropriate" for determining whether the duty to bargain is triggered, <span class="Italic">Dep't of Educ</span>., 71 F.L.R.A. at 971, it not only ignored its own decisions outlining the reasons for its adoption of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception in the first place, but also "departed from precedent" that had expressly decided that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception is consistent with the Labor-Management Relations Statute, <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> 2020, 961 F.3d at 459. For this reason, too, we conclude the need for the policy change "is not sensibly explained." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Up to this point, we have focused on the deficiencies in the FLRA's reasons for its conclusion that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard was so problematic that it needed to be changed. Beyond the various ill-defined reasons that the FLRA offers for departing from the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> threshold, the policy statement under review also undertakes to explain why the FLRA now prefers the substantial-impact standard. The FLRA points to two principal reasons for this decision. And, once again, neither is sufficiently explained.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA first heralds the substantial-impact standard's <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> by suggesting that it draws "a line that is meaningful and determinative" for agencies and their employees seeking to navigate labor negotiations. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Educ</span>., 71 F.L.R.A. at 970. And in its brief the FLRA further contends that its finding that the new standard will be more predictable and administrable is "precisely the sort of predictive judgment" to which this court must defer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But neither the FLRA's challenged decision nor its brief on review analyzes the relative administrability of the substantial-impact and <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standards. This is a critical "gap in [the FLRA's] reasoning[.]" <span class="Italic">AFGE 2020</span>, 961 F.3d at 459. And the FLRA simply ignores the guidance and elaboration provided in its own opinions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs. Soc. Sec. Admin. Region V</span>, 19 F.L.R.A. at 834-35 (McGinnis, concurring) (identifying five factors informing application of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard). It is especially striking that the FLRA does not provide a comparative analysis of the two standards or in its policy statement even argue that the substantial-impact standard used by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in the private sector context has in fact led to more predictable results, since, as noted above, the FLRA frames inconsistent application as the principal problem the new standard is designed to fix.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no obvious reason to expect that labor unions and employers will disagree less frequently about whether any given management decision has a "substantial impact" on conditions of employment than they previously did over whether such a decision had a more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect. <span class="Italic">But see Dep't of Educ</span>., 71 F.L.R.A. at 971. Indeed, these two standards share many characteristics that might lead one to expect just as much disagreement--and, for that matter, just as many "differences of opinion among arbitrators, judges, and the [FLRA] as to what matters affect conditions of employment sufficiently to require bargaining[,]" <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 969 (internal quotation marks omitted)--when the substantial-impact threshold is applied. <span class="Italic">See also id</span>. at 973-74 (DuBester, dissenting) ("The majority fails to explain how adoption of its new standard will produce decisions that are any less fact-dependent than those applying the current standard."). Thus, the new standard that the FLRA has adopted is not the sort of "common sense" measure for "advanc[ing the decision's stated] goals"--here, predictability and streamlined administration--that we have found adequate to withstand arbitrary and capricious review. <span class="Italic">Free Access &#x0026; Broad. Telemedia, LLC v. FCC</span>, 865 F.3d 615, 618 (D.C. Cir. 2017).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To address this obvious shortcoming, the FLRA argues for the first time in its brief that the new substantial-impact standard will have more predictable results because the FLRA will be able to draw on fifty years of NLRB decisions applying the substantial-impact test. The FLRA does not explain in its brief or otherwise why the NLRB's substantial-impact decisions would be easier to apply than the FLRA's own thirty-five years of precedents using the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> test. But, regardless, this argument is forfeit because it was not raised "where it counts"--i.e., in the challenged decision itself. <span class="Italic">AFGE 2020</span>, 961 F.3d at 457; <span class="Italic">see Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co</span>., 463 U.S. 29, 50 (1983) ("[C]ourts may not accept appellate counsel's <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> rationalizations for agency action.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What remains is the FLRA's bald assertion that its own "determination that <span id="Page_1314"></span>the substantial impact test would draw a line that is [more] meaningful and determinative is precisely the sort of predictive judgment to which this [c]ourt accords heightened deference." We fully recognize that we must defer to expert agencies' "reasoned predictions about technical issues[.]" <span class="Italic">BNSF Ry. Co. v. Surface Transp. Bd</span>., 526 F.3d 770, 781 (D.C. Cir. 2008). But there is nothing technical about the predictability assessment that the FLRA makes here, and we are not bound by the FLRA's conclusory and counterintuitive assertions about the consistency with which its new standard is likely to be applied in subsequent adjudications, especially when the record contains no factual basis for making such a forecast.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to its consistency concern, the FLRA must at least explain why and how it has concluded that the substantial impact threshold is "better" than the standard it was relinquishing. <span class="Italic">Fox Television</span>, 556 U.S. at 515. It has failed to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's final tack is to invoke the NLRB's longstanding use of a substantial-impact standard in the private-sector context, as an independent reason for the FLRA's adoption of the same collective bargaining threshold. The FLRA's policy statement asserts that, because "collective bargaining in the public sector" under the Labor-Management Relations Statute "must be narrower" than in the private sector, "[i]t is incongruous. . .[to apply] a standard more lenient than the test applied by the [NLRB]. . .to determine whether a change requires bargaining." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Educ</span>., 71 F.L.R.A. at 970. In its brief, the FLRA adds that it is not just permitted but indeed required to consider NLRB precedents when it administers parallel provisions of its statute; in this regard, it points to our instruction that "when the [FLRA] departs from a familiar principle rooted in private sector precedent, it should either identify ‘practical distinctions between private and governmental needs' that justify the departure, or offer some evidence in the language, history, or structure of the statute suggesting that Congress intended a different result." <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA (AFGE 1988)</span>, 853 F.2d 986, 992 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But NLRB precedent cannot save the FLRA's unreasoned and unreasonable determination to import the substantial impact standard. To start, the FLRA flips the controlling question on its head. Unlike in <span class="Italic">AFGE 1988</span>, we are not being called upon to review a decision to part ways with NLRB precedent in the first instance. Instead, we are evaluating the FLRA's recent departure from its own longstanding precedents that since the 1980s have struck a balance that is different from the NLRB's decisions. In other words, the baseline for our review is the FLRA's longstanding and repeatedly reaffirmed decision to diverge from NLRB policy, which makes <span class="Italic">AFGE 1988's</span> explanation of what the FLRA must do to rationalize a new departure from NLRB precedent inapposite.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's decision to adopt the NLRB's substantial impact test also fails to account for the agency's own past assessments of how the differences between the public-sector and private-sector bargaining contexts inform the appropriate bargaining threshold. We have previously cautioned that the FLRA must "be careful to appreciate fully those distinctions between the private and public sectors that might necessitate a different legal analysis and conclusion" with respect to collective bargaining, since "the bargaining status of any given subject is determined by different statutory provisions and by different policy considerations." <span class="Italic">Library of Cong. v. FLRA</span>, 699 F.2d 1280, 1287 (D.C. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA apparently took those distinctions into account in its 1986 decision in <span class="Italic">Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services Social Security Administration</span>, when it acknowledged the NLRB's substantial-impact standard was "similar[ ]" to the FLRA's <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception, 24 F.L.R.A. at 406 n.1, but nevertheless opted to apply the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard. Critically, that decision highlighted "[t]he limited scope of Federal sector bargaining caused by external laws, rules, and regulations[,]" and observed that this context "demands that the [FLRA] not impose further limitations unless they are based on clear statutory authority and are buttressed by sound policy considerations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 406-07 (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">cf. Library of Cong</span>., 699 F.2d at 1287 &#x0026; n.33 (explaining that "[t]he scope of collective bargaining is far broader in the private sector," in terms of the categories of conditions subject to bargaining, since the Labor-Management Relations Statute "exclu[des] from the scope of federal sector bargaining [ ] matters provided for by federal statute, such as the pay rate or hours of employment").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the FLRA has held in the past that the relative substantive narrowness of the public-sector bargaining mandated under the Labor-Management Relations Statute in fact supports the de minimis standard notwithstanding the NLRB's more stringent bargaining threshold. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>, 24 F.L.R.A. at 407. That conclusion is precisely the opposite of the one that the FLRA reached here. The agency now ignores its earlier balancing of the factors unique to public-sector bargaining and fails to address the reasons that it previously found persuasive when it decided to select a test that differs from the one that pertains to private-sector bargaining. We conclude that, whatever the virtues of the FLRA's present analysis concerning the statutory scheme for public-sector bargaining relative to its private-sector counterpart (which we do not here decide), the FLRA must acknowledge that in the past it reached the opposite conclusion about the need for congruity between the public- and private-sector bargaining thresholds. Thus, "[i]t is not enough" for the agency to now rest on abstract invocations of the "narrowness" of public-sector bargaining or "rely vaguely on [it]s general duty to interpret the statute with government efficiency in mind." <span class="Italic">AFGE 1988</span>, 853 F.2d at 993. Rather, the FLRA's adoption of the substantial-impact threshold after it previously and specifically rejected that standard must be built on a more "solid foundation," <span class="Italic">id</span>., including an explanation of the agency's view of why the new approach better comports with all of the provisions that Congress enacted to govern collective bargaining in the public sector. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1)(B) (finding that collective bargaining "contributes to the effective conduct of public business").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's failure to address its previous balancing of the Labor-Management Relations Statute's priorities--a balancing that led it to adopt a different policy than that of the NLRB--is yet another indication that the FLRA has not, in fact, "engage[d] in reasoned decisionmaking." <span class="Italic">Fred Meyer</span>, 865 F.3d at 638; see 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The cursory policy statement that the FLRA issued to justify its choice to abandon thirty-five years of precedent promoting and applying the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard and to adopt the previously rejected substantial-impact test is arbitrary and capricious for the reasons explained above. Consequently, the unions' petitions for review are granted and the FLRA's September 30, 2020 general statement of policy is vacated.</p>
