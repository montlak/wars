<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-96"><span class="space">d.</span> National Guard Technician</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Coverage of National Guard Technicians was considered as to actions ordinarily within the Board's appellate jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">Ockerhausen v. N.J. Dept. of Military &#x0026; Veterans Affairs</span>, 52 MSPR 484, 486-91 (1992). The Board lacked jurisdiction over Reform Act appeals and IRA stay applications by those employees concerning personnel actions identified at 32 USC 709(e):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant for failure to meet the requirements of his position based on his transfer from his compatible military position of Air Commander (Pilot) to a military position that was incompatible with his technician position of Air Commander. The appellant then filed a petition for appeal of the removal action, alleging that the agency had retaliated against him based on his whistleblowing activities, including his October 26, 1990 letters protesting the Adjutant General's decision to deny his request for an extension of military service beyond the 30-year mandatory separation date. The appellant further requested a stay of the removal action under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA), Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her order denying the stay request, the administrative judge found that the appellant's complaint was centered on disapproval of his request to extend his military service beyond the mandatory 30-year retirement date, and that this determination was beyond the Board's review authority. She noted that the courts have held that the transfer of a National Guardsman from one position to another is not reviewable in a civilian forum and that the scope of the Board's review authority is limited to whether the loss of membership is due to circumstances within the control of the employee. Further finding that the Board will generally uphold the termination of a National Guard technician for not maintaining a requisite military grade, she concluded that the request did not meet the criterion for granting a stay set forth at 5 CFR 1209.15(a)(5)(iii) because the appellant had not produced evidence or argument demonstrating that he was likely to prevail on the merits....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find, as we discuss below, that the Board may not assert jurisdiction over matters precluded from our review by the National Guard Technicians Act of 1968, we find that the Board does not have jurisdiction over a removal for failure to maintain a compatible military position involving a National Guard technician. Accordingly, dismissal of the appellant's stay request, as well as of the appeal, is appropriate....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Everett</span>, 28 MSPR 348, 350-52 (1985), the Board looked to the definition of a "personnel action" under 5 USC 2302(b) in order to determine whether, when Congress enacted the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978), it extended the prohibited personnel practice provisions set forth at 5 USC 2302 to the activities of technician supervisors in the National Guard. It found that Section 2302(a)(2)(A) provides that an appointment, a promotion, and eight other major actions are personnel actions if they are taken against "an employee...in an agency." Finding further that Section 2302(a)(2)(C) defines an agency but does not identify the state National Guards as a covered agency, it determined that, while technicians are Federal employees by virtue of 32 USC 709, they are federal employees who work in the National Guards of the various states and do not work in a Federal agency. The Board therefore concluded that the prohibited personnel practice provisions of 5 USC 2302 do not apply to technician supervisors. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Everett</span>, 28 MSPR at 353.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board recently recognized in <span class="Italic">Kostan v. Arizona National Guard</span>, 50 MSPR 182, 186 (1991), in determining that National Guard technicians do not hold positions "in an agency," the Board did not consider the following uncodified provision of the National Guard Technicians Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Except as provided in this Act and in the amendments made by this Act</span>, and notwithstanding any law, rule, regulation, or decision to the contrary, the positions of persons employed under section 709 of title 32, United States Code, existing on the day before the effective date of this Act, and the persons holding those positions on that day, shall, on and after that effective date, be considered to be positions in and employees of the Department of the Army or Department of the Air Force, as the case may be, and employees of the United States <span class="Italic">to the same extent as other positions in and employees of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pub. L. 90-486, 3(b), 82 Stat. 755, 757 (1968) (emphasis added in <span class="Italic">Kostan</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find that, even though National Guard technicians work for state organizations under the authority of a state official, they must be considered civilian employees of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kostan</span>, 50 MSPR at 186. We find that a technician thus must be deemed an employee in a covered position "in an agency" who has the same rights as other civilian employees of those agencies, save those rights specifically denied them in the National Guard Technicians Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the prohibited personnel practices provisions of 5 USC 2302 apply to technician supervisors, and that National Guard employees, as well as applicants for such positions, may challenge such practices before the Board to the extent that the Board's review authority is not otherwise limited. Moreover, an "employee, former employee, or applicant for employment," in a covered National Guard position may seek corrective action under 5 USC 1221, including a stay, with respect to any personnel action based on a disclosure of government wrongdoing as set forth at 5 USC 2302(b)(8), save where such right is specifically denied him or her. We therefore overrule our decision in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Everett</span>, 28 MSPR at 353, insofar as it holds that the prohibited personnel practices provisions do not apply to the activities of technician supervisors in the National Guard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that our review authority is limited in National Guard appeals. First, the National Guard Technicians Act provides that a right of appeal "shall not extend beyond the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned" in the following situations: (1) Separation from civilian employment in instances involving loss of a required military Guard membership or a military grade specified for the position; (2) separation from civilian employment as a result of failure to meet military security standards; (3) separation for cause by the Adjutant General; and (4) reduction in force or adverse action involving discharge, suspension, <span id="Page_3828"></span>furlough without pay, or reduction in rank or compensation. 32 USC 709(e)(5). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kostan</span>, 50 MSPR at 186.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the National Guard Technicians Act further provides that "[s]ections 2108, 3502, 7511, and 7512 of title 5, do not apply to any person employed under this section [709]." 32 USC 709(f). Therefore, any appeal rights which arise under these provisions do not apply to National Guard technicians. Accordingly, National Guard technicians may not appeal adverse actions under 5 USC 7513(d) since they are expressly excluded from the definition of "employee" under 5 USC 7511, and from the applicability of the "actions" covered by Chapter 75 under 5 USC 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that these provisions of the National Guard Technicians Act restricting Board jurisdiction in cases involving National Guard technicians remain unaffected by the enactment of the CSRA or the WPA. In <span class="Italic">State of Nebraska Military Department v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 705 F.2d 945, 948-49 (8th Cir. 1983), the court found that the Guard's duty under the CSRA to bargain over union proposals which would allow binding arbitration of certain personnel actions reserved for ultimate determination by state adjutants general under 32 USC 709(e)(5) caused an actual conflict between the CSRA and the National Guard Technicians Act. In this connection, it noted that requiring binding arbitration of such matters would violate congressional intent to place such matters under exclusive state control. 705 F.2d at 949.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finding further that the legislative history and the broad purpose of the CSRA do not provide an affirmative expression of congressional intent to override the specific provision set forth at 32 USC 709(e)(5) for exclusive review of certain personnel actions by state adjutants general, the court reasoned that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under such circumstances, we are constrained from declaring the Civil Service Reform Act repealed by implication section 709(e)(5) of the National Guard Technicians Act....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 952. Accordingly, the court set aside the decision of the Federal Labor Relations Authority finding that the National Guard was required to bargain over the union proposals under 5 USC 7121(a). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 953.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the same reasoning applies here. Our review of the legislative history of the CSRA and the WPA similarly discloses no indication that Congress intended to extend the Board's jurisdiction over National Guard technician appeals where civilian review is expressly excluded by the provisions of the National Guard Technicians Act set forth at 32 USC 709(e)(5) and 709(f). In addition, we note that, consistent with 32 USC 709(f), the recent Civil Service Due Process Amendments, Pub. L. No. 101-376, 104 Stat. 461 (1990), expressly exclude National Guard technicians who, as a condition of their employment, are required to hold a compatible military position from the provisions of Chapter 75 affording Federal employees the right to appeal such actions to the Board. 5 USC 7511(b)(5) (1990). <span class="Italic">See also</span> H.R. Rep. No. 328, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 5, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1990 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 695.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that Congress intended to maintain the restrictions on Board jurisdiction set forth in the National Guard Technicians Act precluding the Board from asserting review authority over whistleblowing claims, as well as appeals, involving the personnel actions set forth at 32 USC 709(e)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Everett</span>, 28 MSPR 348, 353 (1985), <span class="Italic">overruled in part</span>, <span class="Italic">Ockerhausen v. N.J. Dept. of Military &#x0026; Veterans Affairs</span>, 52 MSPR 484 (1992), <span class="Italic">supra,</span> dismissed a disciplinary action case against a technician supervisor with the National Guard. Technicians, despite their official status as federal employees, were hybrid employees not subject to Board jurisdiction because they did not work for a federal agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A federal employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action as defined in the statute is prohibited from committing any of the enumerated practices in section 2302(b). In determining whether the respondent Everett has that authority, it is necessary to look to the definition of a personnel action. Section 2302(a)(2)(A) provides that an appointment, a promotion, and eight other major actions are personnel actions if they are taken against "an employee...in an agency." Section 2302(a)(2)(C) defines an agency and it does not identify the state National Guards as a covered agency. While it is true that technicians are federal employees by virtue of 32 USC 709, they are federal employees who do not work in a federal agency. The prohibited practice provisions of 5 USC 2302 apply only against persons who can take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve a personnel action against any employee in a covered federal agency. Guard technicians work in the National Guards of the various states. While the respondent Everett is a federal employee, he works in the National Guard of North Carolina, a state organization.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Singleton v. Ohio Nat'l Guard</span>, 77 MSPR 583, 586-87 (1998), determined that the National Guard Act excludes removals from Board review, but it does not preclude IRA appeals from denial of a promotion or other significant "changes in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." But the Board concluded that cases involving National Guard technicians that may be within the jurisdiction of the MSPB will be dismissed because the Board lacks an effective remedy against that agency. The result reached by the Board was confirmed in <span class="Italic">Singleton v. MSPB</span>, 244 F.3d 1331, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By way of background, we borrow the following description of the national guard from a previous Board decision. The national guard is an essential reserve component of the armed forces of the United States, available with regular forces in time of war, and on stand-by to be federalized to assist in controlling civil disorders. The national guard is the successor to state militias of the nation's early years, and thus is a deeply imbedded feature of our national defense system. The national guard, however, is available to serve state needs as well. Hence, the role of the national guard does not fit neatly within the scope of either state or national concerns; instead, the national guard is somewhat of a hybrid. Within each state, the national guard is a state agency, under state authority and control. At the same time, the activity, make-up, and function of the national guard are provided for, to a large extent, by federal law<span class="Italic">. See Special Counsel v. Everett</span>, 28 MSPR 348, 350 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The NGTA provides in 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 314 for the existence of adjutants general in each state and territory, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. Except for the adjutant general of the District of Columbia, who is appointed by the President of the United States, adjutants general are appointed locally and perform such duties as are prescribed by the laws of the pertinent local jurisdiction. The NGTA also provides for the employment of technicians by the various adjutants general, and it expressly provides that such technicians are deemed to be federal employees. Subsection (e) of 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709 states that a "technician employed under subsection (a) is an employee...of the United States." The legislative history of the NGTA notes that technicians previously were state employees whose salaries were paid in full by the federal government. Because of a lack of nationwide uniform fringe and retirement benefits, the Act declared national guard technicians to be federal employees for the purpose of providing them with the same fringe and retirement benefits enjoyed by other federal employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 1823 (1968), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1968 USCCAN 3318, 3319; <span class="Italic">see also Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth.</span>, 730 F.2d 1534, 1536-37 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (stating that the NGTA vests technicians with federal employee status for the limited purpose of affording uniform fringe and retirement benefits). For purposes of enforcement of the limited employee rights afforded them by the NGTA, technicians are defined as "employees" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) ("'employee' means an...individual who is appointed in the civil service by...an adjutant general designated...under section 709(c) of title 32").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the adjutant general of the ONG is appointed "by the governor [of Ohio] and shall hold office during the governor's pleasure." Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &#x00A7; 5913.02 (West 2000). Ohio statutes set forth the qualifications and duties of the Ohio adjutant general, and expressly provide that the salary of the Ohio adjutant general is to be paid from state funds. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5913.01, 5913.021, 141.02, 124.15 (West 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to a national guard technician's rights under the WPA, the NGTA imposes severe and significant restrictions. In particular, the NGTA provides that "notwithstanding any other provision of law," which of course includes the WPA, "a reduction in force, removal, or an adverse action involving discharge from technician employment, suspension, furlough without pay, or reduction in rank or compensation shall be accomplished by the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned" and "a right to appeal which may exist with respect to [the above enumerated actions] shall not extend beyond the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned." 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 709(f)(3), (f)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though a national guard technician is a federal employee for purposes of fringe and retirement benefits, when it comes to protection under the WPA, the NGTA by its clear terms bars a technician from federal appeal rights under Title 5 when the adverse action taken is one of those enumerated in the statute. Thus, Mr. Singleton has no right to pursue an individual right of action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 in the event he is removed or subjected to any of the other severe adverse actions for which appeal rights lie only to the adjutant general. Mr. Singleton concedes this point, which is well established in Board jurisprudence. <span class="Italic">See Kostan v. Ariz. Nat'l Guard</span>, 50 MSPR 182, 186 (1991). The question remains, however, whether a national guard technician who has made an alleged protected disclosure has the right to invoke the protections of the WPA when the reprisal action taken against the technician is not listed in the NGTA as a penalty for which appeal lies only to the adjutant general.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board first considered the question of whether a state national guard should be deemed a federal agency for purposes of exercising its authority to enforce the WPA, the Board concluded that the essentially state character of the national guard precluded treating the national guard as a federal agency. The question of the state national guard's status, for WPA enforcement purposes, arose in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Everett</span>, 28 MSPR 348 (1985). In that case, Everett, a technician in the North Carolina Army National Guard, took an adverse personnel action <span id="Page_3829"></span>against Barbee, a subordinate technician. Barbee complained to the Office of Special Counsel that his removal was a reprisal for having made a protected WPA disclosure. The Special Counsel agreed with Barbee, and initiated disciplinary proceedings before the Board to punish Everett for violation of the WPA. An administrative judge of the Board held that the national guard was subject to the WPA, but dismissed the Special Counsel's petition on the ground that Barbee had not in fact made a protected disclosure. The full Board undertook review of the decision of the administrative judge, and concluded that the state national guard is not an agency to which the WPA applies. The Board took notice of the hybrid character of the national guards--state agencies that receive substantial federal assistance and whose technicians are by statute considered federal employees. However, the Board noted that the WPA by the terms of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(a) is applicable only to executive agencies, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts,[1] and the Government Printing Office. Because national guards are not specifically included in the WPA as a covered agency, the full Board concluded that the administrative judge had erred in reaching the merits of the case. The full Board thus held that because a national guard is not an agency within the reach of the WPA, its terms could not be enforced against Everett.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In 1990, Congress amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(a) to no longer apply to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. Administrative Office of the United States Courts Personnel Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-474, &#x00A7; 5(c), 104 Stat. 1097, 1099 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Six years after its decision in <span class="Italic">Everett</span>, the Board considered again in <span class="Italic">Kostan</span> the question of whether a national guard should be considered a federal agency. There, however, the question did not involve enforcement of the WPA but instead concerned enforcement of Kostan's restoration rights. The Board had previously held that, with respect to such restoration rights, national guards are not to be deemed federal agencies. <span class="Italic">See Gordon v. Mass. Nat'l Guard</span>, 42 MSPR 251 (1989). In <span class="Italic">Gordon</span>, the Board followed the course it had taken in <span class="Italic">Everett</span>, concluding that a national guard is not a federal agency. But in <span class="Italic">Kostan</span>, the Board grappled with an uncodified section of the NGTA that had not been considered in either <span class="Italic">Everett</span> or <span class="Italic">Gordon</span>. The uncodified statutory NGTA language reads:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Except as provided in this Act and in the amendments made by this Act, and notwithstanding any law, rule, regulation, or decision to the contrary, the positions of persons employed under section 709 of title 32, United States Code, existing on the day before the effective date of this Act, and the persons holding those positions on that day, shall, on and after that effective date, be considered to be positions in and employees of the Department of the Army or Department of the Air Force, as the case may be, and employees of the United States to the same extent as other positions in and employees of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pub. L. No. 90-486, &#x00A7; 3(b), 82 Stat. 755, 757 (1968). In the light of this specific statutory language, the Board in <span class="Italic">Kostan</span> determined that a national guard technician must be considered to be an employee of a federal agency. Accordingly, the Board overruled its previous decision in <span class="Italic">Everett</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly thereafter, the Board had another occasion to consider whether a national guard should be considered a federal agency for purposes of enforcement of the WPA. In <span class="Italic">Ockerhausen v. New Jersey</span>, 52 MSPR 484 (1992), the Board referred again to the uncodified provision of the NGTA recited in <span class="Italic">Kostan</span>, and concluded that national guard technicians, being treated as employees of their corresponding federal military department, must be treated as employees of a federal agency. Ockerhausen, however, had been removed from his technician job in reprisal for an alleged protected WPA disclosure. Since any remedy for a removal is expressly and solely reserved in the NGTA to the state adjutant general, the Board dismissed Ockerhausen's petition for want of jurisdiction. Coming full circle, however, the Board held that it does have jurisdiction to consider WPA cases so long as NGTA has not expressly reserved the avenue of appeal to the state adjutant general.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Board precedent seems not to have considered the anomaly presented by the fact that severe adverse personnel actions, such as removals and reductions in rank and compensation, can be taken by adjutants general with no consequences under the WPA whatsoever, while relatively lesser adverse personnel actions, for example a half day suspension, may be pursued fully by an individual right of action. The purpose of the WPA is to encourage federal employees to bring to light situations that an employee reasonably believes to evidence a violation of law, or gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, and other unwanted circumstances in federal government. It hardly makes sense for Congress to have excluded national guard technicians from protection under the WPA in situations where the employees are treated in reprisal very harshly, say, with removal for making protected disclosures, while affording WPA protection to similarly-situated employees who assert WPA rights after receiving adverse actions of much lesser impact. In other words, if Congress intended for the governmental benefits of the WPA to apply when governmental wrongdoing occurs in a national guard, it seems odd indeed that those benefits can only be assured if the national guard takes only modest adverse actions in reprisal for a technician's protected disclosure. This anomaly, coupled with the very limited purposes for which technicians are deemed by the NGTA to be federal employees, and with the Board's previous awareness that the WPA by its terms does not expressly seek to reach national guard entities, mounts a strong counter argument to the proposition that the uncodified text of the NGTA requires the Board to assume jurisdiction over WPA cases when the adverse actions against national guard technicians are less severe than the actions over which the Board clearly has no WPA enforcement powers. We need not decide in this case, however, whether the NGTA should be interpreted to preclude all aspects of WPA enforcement by the Board. This is so because even if Mr. Singleton were to prevail in his individual right of action based on his alleged failure of promotion, we agree that the Board lacks the power to enforce any order it would issue in Mr. Singleton's favor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We thus turn to the Board's enforcement powers. The Board is a creature of limited authority, enjoying and exercising only the powers vested in it by Congress. <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The Board is authorized to adjudicate all matters within its jurisdiction and to take final action on any such matter. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(1) (1994). In the event the Board exercises its adjudicative powers under section 1204(a)(1), it is expressly authorized to "order any Federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision issued by the Board under the authority granted under paragraph (1) of this subsection and enforce compliance with any such order." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Board were to rule in Mr. Singleton's favor on his individual right of action, relief for Mr. Singleton would have to come in the form of an order by the Board to direct some corrective action by the ONG. The adjutant general of the ONG is not a federal employee, as that term is defined in Title 5. Therefore, no order of the Board may be directed to the adjutant general. The Governor of Ohio similarly is not a federal employee, and consequently no order of the Board could command the Governor to order a corrective act to be taken by the adjutant general. If the ONG is a federal agency, as the Board has held, then an order could hypothetically issue by the Board commanding the ONG to take some action in Mr. Singleton's favor. But the ONG itself, even if considered a federal agency, can act only through its adjutant general. So if the Board were to order the ONG to direct the adjutant general to take an act, the Board would lack any authority over the adjutant general to compel him to perform the ordered act. In this case, the corrective order would involve some personnel action in favor of Mr. Singleton. That action would not fall into the category of a mandatory act, one compelled by an express law, and consequently even the remedy of mandamus would not be available to enforce a Board order. <span class="Italic">See Heckler v. Ringer</span>, 466 U.S. 602, 616 (1984) (stating that the remedy of mandamus is only available if the defendant owes the plaintiff a clear nondiscretionary duty).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, the Board has determined that its orders are not enforceable against state national guards, and for that reason, the Board is without power to supply an effective remedy even in the instance of a federal employee who can prevail on the merits of a WPA claim over which the Board considers itself vested with jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See Melendez v. Puerto Rico Nat'l Guard</span>, 70 MSPR 252 (1996), <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed</span>, 152 F.3d 943 (Fed. Cir. 1998). For instance, were Mr. Singleton to prevail, the Board could not implement any order concerning back pay, front pay, damages, correction of records, or other similar matters. <span class="Italic">See McVay v. Ark. Nat'l Guard</span>, 80 MSPR 120 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board indicated in this case, the most that Mr. Singleton might obtain would be a declaration that he had been treated improperly with respect to the promotion denied to him. Such a declaration is hardly effective relief, and instead would be a mere advisory opinion, an act that the Board is barred by statute from taking. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h) (1994). Because Mr. Singleton cannot obtain effective relief on his WPA cause of action, the Board was correct in dismissing his claim as one for which relief cannot be granted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McVay v. Arkansas Nat'l Guard</span>, 80 MSPR 120, 124-25 (1998), explained the enforcement problems presented by an IRA claim arising from failure to secure a promotion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A Board order is not enforceable against the ANG. <span class="Italic">Melendez v. Puerto Rico National Guard</span>, 70 MSPR 252 (1996), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 152 F.3d 943 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Further, the ANG makes clear in its response to the appellant's petition for review that it does not consider itself to be subject to the Board's adjudicatory authority; it is thus clear that the ANG would not voluntarily comply with a Board order on the merits. Thus, even if the appellant could show that the ANG decided not to select him for promotion because of his whistleblowing, he would be without an effective remedy. He could not obtain back pay, front pay, damages, correction of his records, or any corrective personnel action. Indeed, <span id="Page_3830"></span>the appellant would not even be considered a "prevailing party" for purposes of awarding attorney fees (he had an attorney below), because a decision in his favor on the merits would not be an enforceable order that changed the legal relationship between the parties. <span class="Italic">See Melendez v. Puerto Rico National Guard</span>, 70 MSPR 255 (1996), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 152 F.3d 943 (Fed. Cir. 1998). If the merits of the appellant's claim were decided, at most he could receive a declaration that he was treated improperly with respect to the promotion. Such a declaration would not be effective relief, <span class="Italic">see White v. International Boundary &#x0026; Water Commission</span>, 59 MSPR 62, 65 (1993), and issuance of a decision on the merits would therefore violate the statute that prohibits us from issuing advisory opinions. <span class="Italic">Id.; see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(h).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant cannot obtain effective relief before the Board, even if his IRA appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction and he shows that he was subjected to a retaliatory personnel action, the appeal should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <span class="Italic">McGowen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 72 MSPR 601, 607 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 135 F.3d 777 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table); <span class="Italic">see also Lackhouse v.

Department of Labor</span>, 57 MSPR 163 (1993) (an appeal that was within the Board's jurisdiction was dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, because as a matter of law the appellant could not prevail); <span class="Italic">cf. White,</span> 59 MSPR at 65 (an IRA appeal was dismissed as moot because the appellant could not obtain effective relief even if he showed he was subjected to a retaliatory personnel action). The appellant herein cannot obtain effective relief in this proceeding, so his appeal must be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, insofar as he challenges the ANG's decision not to promote him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Singleton,</span> the Federal Circuit decided that a member of the Ohio National Guard could not invoke Board IRA jurisdiction as to nonselection claims, <span class="Italic">Asatov v. MSPB</span>, 513 Fed. Appx. 984, 984-86 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rakhmatulla Asatov applied for several national guard technician positions with the Connecticut National Guard. He was found ineligible for six positions and was not selected for two other positions. He then filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel seeking corrective action. When that office terminated its investigation, Mr. Asatov filed an Individual Right of Action appeal to the Board, alleging that he was not selected because he had engaged in protected whistleblowing activity. The administrative judge who was assigned to the case ruled that, although the Board had jurisdiction to review Mr. Asatov's whistleblower claims, it lacked the authority to provide him relief. The administrative judge explained that because the adjutant general, the responsible official of the Connecticut National Guard, is a state appointee, the Board lacks the power to order any remedial action. Mr. Asatov appealed to this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our decision in <span class="Italic">Singleton v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 244 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2001), forecloses Mr. Asatov's argument on appeal. In that case we held that the Board lacked the authority to order the adjutant general of the Ohio National Guard to grant relief to a national guard technician who claimed he was denied a promotion as a result of his whistleblower activity. The <span class="Italic">Singleton</span> court recognized that the national guard has a "hybrid" state-federal character. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1333. The national guard serves as a reserve component of the United States military, and federal law provides for the positions of both adjutant general and national guard technician. 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 314, 709(a), (d). In addition, 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(e) classifies a national guard technician as a federal employee for purposes of fringe and retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Singleton</span>, 244 F.3d at 1334. However, the national guard of each state is an agency of that state; in <span class="Italic">Singleton</span>, we noted, the adjutant general of the Ohio National Guard was appointed by the Governor.[2] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1333-34. As such, the adjutant general did not fall within the Board's power to "order any Federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision issued by the Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2). Because the adjutant general was the responsible official in the Ohio National Guard, any order by the Board to grant Singleton a promotion would have improperly compelled the adjutant general's compliance. 244 F.3d at 1336-37. The court therefore held that the Board could not offer Singleton any effective relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Other circuits have held that the adjutant general may be a federal agent for certain purposes. <span class="Italic">See Gilliam v. Miller</span>, 973 F.2d 760, 762 (9th Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Costner v. Okla. Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 833 F.2d 905, 907 (10th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">NeSmith v. Fulton</span>, 615 F.2d 196, 199 (5th Cir. 1980). However, those cases do not speak to the Board's authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), and they are not in conflict with this court's ruling in <span class="Italic">Singleton</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Singleton</span> governs this case. The adjutant general of the Connecticut National Guard is appointed by the Governor. Conn. Gen. Stat. &#x00A7; 27-19 (2011). He is therefore a state official; the Board accordingly lacks statutory authority to order the adjutant general to alter his employment practices or decisions in response to a Board decision. As this court held in <span class="Italic">Singleton</span>, the Board's "orders are not enforceable against state national guards." 244 F.3d at 1337. Mr. Asatov's argument to the contrary has already been considered and rejected by this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Asatov's attempts to distinguish his case are unpersuasive. He states that the adjutant general has Protection Act to the director of the human resources department, who is a federal employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(c); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 302(b) (discussing delegation of agency authority). But the administrative judge properly determined that the delegation does not change the fact that any remedial order must be directed to the adjutant general. As this court reasoned in <span class="Italic">Singleton</span>, a state's national guard "can act only through its adjutant general." 244 F.3d at 1337. An order addressed to a subordinate still compels the adjutant general to accept the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Asatov responds by analogy, noting that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(e)(2)(A) permits the Board to suspend the pay of any federal employee "charged with complying with [the Board's remedial] order" unless that employee is a principal officer--i.e., a presidential appointee confirmed by the Senate. When an agency headed by a principal officer fails to respond satisfactorily to an order, the Board has in some cases suspended the pay of a subordinate with delegated responsibilities, such as a director of human resources. Mr. Asatov concludes that, just as the Board may suspend the pay of a subordinate federal employee to ensure compliance with its orders, it should be able to order the director of human resources for the Connecticut National Guard to comply with a decision in Mr. Asatov's favor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That argument conflates the Board's remedial authority over a federal agency or responsible federal employee under section 1204(a)(2) with the method prescribed in section 1204(e)(2)(A) for enforcing compliance with such a remedial order. The latter provision merely enforces the former; an agency may invoke section 1204(e)(2)(A) only "[I]n enforcing compliance with any order under subsection (a)(2)." That section does not grant the Board independent remedial authority over federal employees working in state agencies under the direction of state appointed officials. The Board may order a federal employee's pay suspended only if there is a federal agency or delegated his responsibilities under the Whistleblower decisionmaker that it may direct to provide the mandated relief. In this case, both the Connecticut National Guard and its adjutant general fall outside the Board's remedial power.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Asatov's analogies to other federal statutes are likewise inapt. He points out that the Board has issued remedial orders to state agencies under the Hatch Act. But the Board has specific statutory authority to enforce the Hatch Act against state and local entities. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1506(a). That kind of statutory grant of authority is precisely what is missing in this case. Similarly, Mr. Asatov argues that the Board's decision ignores 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C), which lists the agencies covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act. However, Mr. Asatov fails to distinguish between the coverage of the Act and the Board's authority to enforce it. He also points to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303(4)(B) and 4323(a), which pertain to the enforcement of service members' employment rights against state employers. But those provisions do not authorize the Board to order any relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Mr. Asatov argues that the Board's recent decisions are inconsistent with its previous position that it may exercise remedial authority over the national guard. Regardless of the merits of Mr. Asatov's characterization of the Board's precedent, he has not shown how his claim can survive <span class="Italic">Singleton</span>.[3] We therefore we affirm the dismissal of his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Mr. Asatov seeks to distinguish <span class="Italic">Singleton</span> on the ground that, unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Singleton</span>, he was merely an applicant to become a national guard technician. However, the decision in <span class="Italic">Singleton</span> was based on the legal status of the adjutant general as a state official, not the status of the claimant, so that distinction is of no aid to Mr. Asatov....</p>
