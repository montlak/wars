<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-95"><span class="space">4.</span> Employee Blocked From Working Because of Employer's Concern About Fitness; Fitness Examination Requirement</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Jurisdiction may depend on who initiates the employee's leave status and how the leave status is initiated. The jurisdictional analysis is complex, imprecise.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">We begin with and trace back from a Federal Circuit decision, <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas v. MSPB</span>, 833 F.3d 1342, 1346-49 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (Judge Dyk dissenting), determining there was no Board jurisdiction, that is, no adverse action appeal, over an employee's claim that, after a period of leave he was improperly continued in leave during the time the employer requested and evaluated medical evidence concerning the employee's fitness for duty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Rosario alleges that his decision to take leave was involuntary due to coercion by the Corps. Therefore, the Board required Mr. Rosario to demonstrate that his absence from work was involuntary by proving that: (1) he lacked a meaningful choice in the matter; and (2) it was the Corps' wrongful actions that deprived him of that choice. <span class="Italic">See Romero v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, 610 (2014). Ultimately, the Board concluded that "[c]onsidering the appellant's failure to engage in the interactive process with respect to his request for parttime work and his failure to provide documentation from his psychiatrist releasing him for full-time work...the agency did not act improperly in refusing to place the appellant back in a duty status."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee voluntarily takes leave, an agency may properly refuse to allow the employee to resume working if the employee does not satisfy the agency's conditions for returning to work. [<span class="Italic">Romero</span>] at 610 n.2 ("[W]hile the agency's refusal to allow the appellant to return to work is the immediate cause of his absence, the proximate cause is arguably his failure to meet the conditions of the agency's 'clearance to return to work' policy."). In those circumstances, the agency's refusal to allow the employee to return to work does not amount to a constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Rosario took voluntary leave to recover from depression. When Mr. Rosario was able to resume working, the Corps conditioned his return on the provision of a medical release in which his physician addressed the history of his medical condition, his prognosis, including estimated date of recovery, and an explanation of the impact of the medical condition, including any resultant medical restrictions and the reasons for them.[1] Mr. Rosario did not provide the Corps with the requested medical release and thus failed to comply with the Corps' conditions for returning to work. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that the Corps did not act improperly by refusing to allow Mr. Rosario to return to work. Because the Corps did not act improperly in refusing to allow Mr. Rosario to return to work, his absence was not involuntary and thus he was not constructively suspended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We offer no conclusion as to whether the Corps' conditions for returning to work violate the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act, as jurisdiction for those claims lie with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b)(1), or the appropriate United States District Court, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Judge Dyk dissented in <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority in this case affirms the Board's dismissal of Mr. Rosario's case for lack of jurisdiction. Unfortunately, the panel majority, the Board, the agency, and the petitioner himself view the case as involving an alleged constructive suspension--that is, a purportedly voluntary act that is, in fact, involuntary. In my view this is not a true constructive suspension case in which an employee's facially voluntary leave is, in fact, coerced and involuntary. Instead, under our court's precedent, Mr. Rosario's absence is properly viewed as a facially involuntary suspension over which the Board has jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that in June of 2012, Mr. Rosario contacted his supervisor at the Corps, Mr. Castillo, asking to return from sick leave on July 2, 2012. Mr. Castillo refused to permit him to return to work absent medical documentation establishing that Mr. Rosario was able to perform his job safely and capably. As the majority opinion describes, "[w]hen Mr. Rosario was able to resume working, the Corps conditioned his return on the provision of a medical release in which his physician addressed the history of his medical condition, his prognosis, including estimated date of recovery, and an explanation of the impact of the medical condition, including any resultant medical restrictions and the reasons for them." Between July 2 and November 18, 2012, the employee asked to work, and the agency prevented him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is governed by <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 832 F.2d 598 (Fed. Cir. 1987). There, we reviewed the Army's decision to place an employee "on enforced leave after determining that it could no longer retain him on a light-duty position and that it had no other position which he was physically capable of performing within his medical restrictions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 599. We held that this enforced leave constituted an appealable suspension of more than 14 days. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 600. "[I]ndefinite enforced leave is tantamount to depriving the worker of his job--without any review other than by the agency--until the agency itself changes its mind and decides that he can perform his job." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in <span class="Italic">Pittman</span>, Mr. Rosario's leave was "a suspension for more than 14 days." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(2). Under &#x00A7; 7513(d), "[a]n employee against whom an action is taken under this section is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under section 7701 of this title." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). We held in <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> that "jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7512 is established if and when a claimant shows that he or she is, in fact, a covered employee as required by the statute and that the agency took one of the enumerated actions in &#x00A7; 7512 against the claimant." <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1327-28 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Mr. Rosario has met this burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A constructive suspension, by contrast, exists when an employee's facially voluntary leave is, in fact, coerced and involuntary. "A constructive adverse action arises when an agency's conduct leaves an employee no alternative but for the employee, involuntarily, to impose the adverse action on himself or herself." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1324. The MSPB has previously distinguished an enforced leave from a true constructive suspension. In <span class="Italic">Abbott v. United States Postal Service</span>, the Board reviewed <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> and noted that "an agency's placement of an employee on enforced leave for more than 14 days constitutes an appealable suspension within the Board's jurisdiction." 121 M.S.P.R. 294, 298 (M.S.P.B. 2014) (citing <span class="Italic">Pittman</span>, 832 F.2d at 599-600). Abbott held that "suspensions under these circumstances are not 'constructive,' and the case law concerning constructive suspensions is inapplicable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This is a meaningful distinction, as the petitioner in a non-constructive suspension case does not need to clear the additional jurisdictional hurdle of proving the involuntariness of his absence from work. Mr. Rosario's claim is not a constructive suspension claim because he was barred from returning to work by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, the agency may have been justified in refusing to permit Mr. Rosario to return to work. An agency with reasonable concerns should have the authority to require a long-absent employee to submit documentation of fitness to work as a condition of return. But the propriety of an agency's decision to bar an employee from work for failure to submit medical documentation is a merits question, not <span id="Page_2078"></span>a jurisdictional one. I would reverse the MSPB's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction and remand with instructions to consider the merits of Mr. Rosario's claim. I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Romero v. USPS</span>, 121 MSPR 606, 608-11 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-12, 2014 MSPB 76 (2014), cited by <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas</span>, involved a postal supervisor with health problems that caused his absence from work and the agency's refusal to permit his return to work without adequate medical clearance. The Board affirmed a jurisdictional dismissal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board recently discussed in <span class="Italic">Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397 (2013), and <span class="Italic">Abbott v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 294 (2014), certain leaves of absence may be appealable under chapter 75 as constructive suspensions. <span class="Italic">Abbott</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 294, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 7. In <span class="Italic">Bean</span>, the appellant began taking a large amount of sick leave, annual leave, and leave without pay in order to avoid having to work on his regular tour because it would have required him to work into the night, contrary to his doctor's recommendations. <span class="Italic">Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 4. Although the appellant requested reasonable accommodations and submitted supporting medical documentation, it appears that the agency was never able to find an accommodation upon which the parties could agree. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The administrative judge construed the appellant's subsequent Board appeal as a constructive suspension claim and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction without conducting a jurisdictional hearing, finding that the appellant's choice between working after dark and requesting leave was perhaps unpleasant but nevertheless voluntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bean</span>, the Board granted the appellant's petition for review and remanded the appeal for further adjudication. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 1. It found that the essence of the appellant's claim was that he was compelled to take leave because his only alternative was to work after dark, in violation of his doctor's orders, and that the agency forced him into this untenable position by improperly taking him off of the tour 2-day shift and otherwise failing to accommodate his condition. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 14. The Board determined that the appellant's allegations, if proven, could establish that he lacked a meaningful choice in the matter and that it was the agency's improper actions that deprived him of that choice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It disagreed with the reasoning in prior Board cases suggesting that an appellant's "unpleasant" choice between taking leave and returning to work outside of his medical restrictions was voluntary, rejecting the premise that working outside of medical restrictions is somehow a viable option. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 13. The Board thus concluded that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was subjected to an appealable constructive suspension and remanded the appeal for further development of the record and a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Abbott</span>, the appellant never voluntarily absented herself from duty and her appeal did not concern a claim that leave that appeared to be voluntary actually was not. Rather, she submitted a request to work a light-duty assignment. <span class="Italic">Abbott</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 294, &#x00B6; 2. The agency denied her request on the ground that there was no work available within her medical restrictions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It thereafter proposed to place the appellant on enforced leave because there was no available work within her medical restrictions and, after granting her an opportunity to reply to the notice, issued a final decision effecting the enforced leave action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 3. The administrative judge adjudicated the appeal as an alleged constructive suspension and dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 4. The Board reversed, noting that in <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987), our reviewing court held that placement of an employee on enforced leave due to his medical condition, which prevented him from performing in any available position, constituted an appealable suspension of more than 14 days. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9. The Board held that suspensions under these circumstances are not "constructive" and the case law concerning constructive suspensions is inapplicable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10. Rather, to sustain such suspensions, the agency must prove by preponderant evidence that the charged conduct occurred, that a nexus exists between the conduct and service efficiency, and that the penalty is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because there was no dispute that the agency placed the appellant in an enforced leave status for more than 14 days against her will, the Board held that the agency's action constituted an appealable suspension within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 11. Because the agency provided the appellant a proposal notice and a final decision on the proposed action, the Board remanded the appeal for adjudication of the merits and the appellant's affirmative defenses. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like <span class="Italic">Bean</span>, the instant case is an appeal of a constructive suspension insofar as it concerns a claim that leave that appeared to be voluntary actually was not. Specifically, although the appellant was initially voluntarily absent from his position due to chronic headaches, his absence arguably became involuntary once he expressed his intent to return to work on December 24, 2012, and the agency was unable to find him work within his restrictions. <span class="Italic">See Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14. Thus, to establish jurisdiction under these circumstances, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that: (1) he lacked a meaningful choice in the matter; and (2) it was the agency's wrongful actions that deprived him of that choice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, once the appellant was medically released to return to work with medical restrictions, the agency's decision not to return him to work deprived him of a meaningful choice in the matter. Thus, the appellant satisfied the first prong under <span class="Italic">Bean</span>.[2] However, we have reviewed the documentary and testimonial evidence, and, for the reasons discussed below and in the initial decision, we conclude that the agency did not act improperly in refusing to allow the appellant to return to work. Thus, the second prong under <span class="Italic">Bean</span> has not been satisfied, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over this constructive suspension appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;It could be argued that once the appellant sought to return to work and was prevented from doing so for more than 14 days, the action became an appealable suspension under <span class="Italic">Abbott</span> rather than a constructive suspension under <span class="Italic">Bean</span>. However, while the agency's refusal to allow the appellant to return to work is the immediate cause of his absence, the proximate cause is arguably his failure to meet the conditions of the agency's "clearance to return to work" policy. The analytical framework in <span class="Italic">Bean</span> contemplates the development of the record on both of these issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In pertinent part, the record reflects that the agency received a work capacity report which indicated that the appellant could return to work on December 24, 2012, that his condition "can be augmented with stress," and that his work should be limited to 8 hours per day. The agency's Occupational Health Nurse Administrator testified that the information contained in the work capacity report caused her to send clarification requests to the appellant's primary care physician and neurologist in late December 2012, and both doctors checked "no" to a question about whether the appellant "was safe and medically cleared to return to the work environment." <span class="Italic">See</span> (the appellant's primary care physician stated on December 27, 2012, that his "symptoms are exacerbated by stress and by loud noises" and he recommended "a more stable work hour schedule, less stress and less noise in [a] working environment"); (the appellant's neurologist stated on December 26, 2012, that when the appellant's headaches are severe, "they will impair his attention and concentration," and the neurologist recommended "either a change in his job duties to more stable hours or an environment where he is not exposed to noises").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the significant restrictions of less stress, less noise, and less hours, we find that there was not any improper or wrongful agency action. To the contrary, the record reflects that the agency worked diligently to find the appellant a position that met these restrictions, it held two DRAC meetings, it reasonably determined that a supervisory position did not meet these restrictions, and it offered the appellant three nonsupervisory positions. Moreover, when the agency finally learned at the end of March 2013, that the appellant could return to work with only hearing protection and hours not to exceed 12 hours a day, the agency promptly returned him to work in his Supervisor position on April 1, 2013.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Romero</span> analysis essentially evaluates the agency's justification for continuing an employee in leave status as a component of jurisdictional analysis. Judge Dyk had the better view in <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas</span> dissent that the Board has jurisdiction to evaluate the propriety of an agency preventing an employee from returning to work until there is medical clearance or an available accommodation. It does not lose jurisdiction because the agency makes out its defense.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Referenced by Judge Dyk in his dissent and in <span class="Italic">Romero</span> was <span class="Italic">Pittman v. MSPB</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The employing agency placed Pittman on enforced leave after determining that it could no longer retain him on a light-duty position and that it had no other position which he was physically capable of performing within his medical restrictions. He had been assigned to a light-duty position after hospitalization for low back pain and sciatica. He was reported as unable to do overhead work, bend, stoop, lift objects over 30 to 40 pounds, do repeated lifting or carrying of objects weighing over 20 pounds, stand, or walk for more than half-an-hour without resting. The agency had considered him for certain supply clerk positions but found that his medical restrictions prevented him from performing in those positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner appealed to the Board, claiming that his placement in enforced leave was a suspension of more than 14 days. His claims were that he had greatly improved and could now perform. The presiding official decided, however, that the action taken against him was not disciplinary in nature and that the MSPB had no jurisdiction. On appeal to the full Board, that tribunal agreed with the conclusion that the "suspension"--if it was such--was not disciplinary. The full Board distinguished between psychological and physical problems--refusing to denominate the latter as disciplinary. Member Devaney dissented.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two of our earlier decisions give us helpful guidance in the current case. The first was <span class="Italic">Thomas v. General Services Administration</span>, 756 F.2d 86 (Fed. Cir. 1985), and the second was <span class="Italic">Mercer v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 772 F.2d 856 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Though appealable suspensions of more than 14 days must be "disciplinary," <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> expressly held (756 F.2d at 89):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_2079"></span>Such suspensions--which are ordered because the agency believes that the employee's retention on active duty could result in damage to federal property, or be detrimental to governmental interests, or be injurious to the employee, his fellow workers, or the public--are "disciplinary" in the broader sense of maintaining the orderly working of the Government against possible disruption by the suspended employee (pending the determination of that employee's disability retirement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Mercer</span>, 772 F.2d at 858, repeated this rule and held that part of that employee's suspension "constituted an improper suspension."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The full Board's opinion in the current case distinguished cases with psychological overtones (in which <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> and <span class="Italic">Mercer</span> would apply) from those showing purely physical symptoms (like Pittman's) which would still be beyond MSPB jurisdiction. We see no reason in the statute, legislative history, or regulation for this difference. The effect on the Government's operations as well as on the employee's own interests is the same. <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> and <span class="Italic">Mercer</span> are framed in general principles making no such psychological-physical distinction. As <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> has already indicated (756 F.2d at 89-90), it is hard to believe that the law limits a prolonged suspension (i.e., of more than 14 days) wholly to the agency's own judgment in physical cases while psychological instances would clearly be appealable to the Board. "The actual impact on the employee would be the same, and there would be no adequate reason for distinguishing between the two (on the question of appealability)." In both instances, indefinite enforced leave is tantamount to depriving the worker of his job--without any review other than by the agency--until the agency itself changes its mind and decides that he can perform his job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The requirement in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> that the placement on enforced leave be "pending inquiry" (756 F.2d at 89) is fulfilled here by the demand that the agency continue to monitor Pittman to see whether he has become able to work. "[O]nce an agency learns that its beliefs are unfounded, i.e., that the employee is fit for duty, the employee must be restored immediately to 'active duty status.'" <span class="Italic">Mercer</span>, 772 F.2d at 858. The result is that the present case falls directly under <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> and <span class="Italic">Mercer</span> in all respects.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we hold that the MSPB did have jurisdiction of Pittman's case and the case is remanded to the Board for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Does the Board have jurisdiction, or not, when an agency prevents an employee from returning to work after a period of absence until the employee provides medical clearance? The answer should be that it does have jurisdiction since the agency is perpetuating placement in a nonwork status without the consent of the employee. Whether the agency action is justified goes to the merits, that is, whether the imposed nonwork status is justified. The decisions that follow, predating <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas</span>, often but not always determined that there was jurisdiction when an employee was blocked from returning to duty pending a medical evaluation. Whether the appeal was characterized as a constructive suspension or enforced leave, the analysis employed varied over time as to the result: in some cases, if the constructive suspension was within the jurisdiction of the Board and if it was imposed without due process, it could be reversed. Under <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas</span>, if what looks like a constructive suspension imposed without due process is justified by the employer's explanation, it is not a suspension at all--just leave status not remediable by the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether nonpay status is enforced leave or a constructive suspension is a matter of no consequence to employees, since what counts is that they are not being paid, although for enforced leave exceeding 14 days the agency should provide a proposal notice and other due process protections. The distinction was noted in <span class="italic">Hamilton v. USPS</span>, DA-0754-15-0375-I-1 (NP 5/13/2022), n.4:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge initially characterized the appellant's absence as a constructive suspension. IAF, Tab 6 at 5, Tab 9 at 1, Tab 12 at 1 (setting forth the jurisdictional standard for a constructive suspension that an appellant must prove that he lacked a meaningful choice in the matter, and it was the agency's wrongful actions that deprived him of that choice); <span class="italic">Romero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6; 8 (2014). As discussed below, the agency's action was correctly characterized as the placement of the appellant on enforced leave because he never voluntarily absented himself from duty and his appeal did not concern a claim that leave that appeared to be voluntary actually was not. <span class="italic">See Romero</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6; 7 (distinguishing a constructive suspension from an appealable suspension). However, the administrative judge's characterization did not prejudice the appellant because she applied the jurisdictional standard applicable to enforced leave actions in her initial decision and put the appellant on notice in her order on jurisdiction and summary of the prehearing conference that the voluntariness of his absence was at issue. <span class="italic">Scott v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2007).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cited in Hamilton was <span class="italic">Romero v. USPS</span>, 121 MSPR 606, 2014 MSPB 76, &#x00B6; 7 (2014), alluding to but not specifically defining the distinction between a constructive suspension and enforced leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant never voluntarily absented herself from duty and her appeal did not concern a claim that leave that appeared to be voluntary actually was not. Rather, she submitted a request to work a light-duty assignment. <span class="italic">Abbott</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 294, &#x00B6; 2.

<p class="Body-Text">However one characterizes Board jurisdiction, the employee must at least communicate to the agency the desire to return to work after a period of leave. <span class="Italic">Justice v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 89 MSPR 379, 383-86 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-13 (2001), determined that one period of nonpay status was not a constructive suspension when the employee did not tell the agency of his desire to report to duty, but that another period of nonpay was a noticeless suspension, based on decisions before <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's voluntary absence from work is not appealable. <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 680, 691-92 (1996). If, however, an agency bars an employee from work, the resulting absence is appealable as a constructive suspension if it lasts more than fourteen days. <span class="Italic">See Dize v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 635, 638 (1997). In general, the dispositive question in determining the voluntariness of an absence is whether the employee or the agency initiated the absence in question. <span class="Italic">See Haentges v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 507 &#x00B6; 5 (1999). However, an initially voluntary absence can subsequently become involuntary, and vice versa. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 254 &#x00B6; 6 (1999); <span class="Italic">Baker</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 692-93. An agency's placement of an employee on enforced leave for more than fourteen days, based on an alleged physical or mental disability, constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Lewis,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 254 &#x00B6; 6.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant does not identify any record evidence supporting his allegation that, as of September 30, 1999, the agency instructed him not to report to work until October 25, 1999.... We therefore find that the appellant's argument that the agency instructed him not to report for duty before October 25, 1999, is without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant has not identified below or on review any record evidence showing that he communicated to the agency his desire to report for duty before October 25, 1999, and we can find no such evidence in the record. We therefore find that the appellant has failed to establish error in the AJ's finding that his use of leave prior to October 25, 1999, was voluntary and did not constitute a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See Haentges</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 507, &#x00B6; 6 ("a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of constructive suspension requires the appellant to show that he made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was able to work, that he communicated his desire to work, and that the agency failed to allow him to return to work"); <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that he was constructively suspended after November 25, 1999. The AJ found in this regard that: On October 25, 1999, when the appellant reported for duty at the CSU, the agency "informed [him] that he had not been medically cleared for duty" and "presented [him] with a form setting forth various choices regarding the leave status in which he wished to be placed"; upon consulting with Lee Beachem, a Fiscal Accounting Specialist with the CSU, the appellant "elected to continue in a sick leave status until such leave was exhausted, and then to be placed on shore leave, annual leave and leave without pay, in that order"; and although the appellant signed the form indicating that he voluntarily chose to be placed in various leave categories, the information on the form regarding the appellant's "right to be placed in <span id="Page_2080"></span>a temporary duty status for thirty days during the notice period of an involuntary enforced leave action by the agency" was confusing and was not clarified by Ms. Beachem. The AJ concluded that the agency's failure to inform the appellant of his right to be placed in a duty status for thirty days commencing October 25, 1999, rendered "his subsequent leave elections involuntary" and that, because the constructive suspension "was effected without affording him requisite procedural protections," it must be reversed....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Because the agency refused to allow him to return to work thereafter, based on its determination of his medical disqualification, his absence after October 25, 1999, was involuntary and constituted a constructive suspension for more than fourteen days. Because the appellant was not afforded minimum due process (much less the statutory procedure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)) before this constructive suspension was effected, it must be reversed in its entirety. <span class="Italic">See Lohf v.

<p class="Body-Text">Several Board decisions predating <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas</span> involve the Postal Service, an agency that has medical standards for its employees and procedures established to evaluate medical fitness. The analysis in the decisions involving the Postal Service varies over the years. An example of leave improperly forced on an employee whose doctor cleared him to return to work and declared that he presented no threat to himself or others is taken from <span class="Italic">Zygas v. USPS</span>, 116 MSPR 397, 398-400, 402-04 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-10, 16-22, 2011 MSPB 55 (2011), concluding that the Postal Service was not justified in demanding unnecessary documentation from the appellant as a condition to his return to duty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Due to a 2001 work-related injury, the appellant was employed in a limited duty capacity as a Mail Expeditor/Clerk at the agency's Las Vegas Processing and Distribution Center (P&#x0026;DC). On December 8, 2008, after a confrontation with his supervisor over a work matter, the appellant left work early and requested sick leave for the remainder of the day on the basis of "[s]tress hostile working conditions." His supervisor denied the request "pending documentation." The appellant acknowledged that he would need medical documentation before returning to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated December 9, 2008, Beverly Jones, an Occupational Health Nurse Administrator (OHNA) with the agency, notified the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In order [for you] to be cleared to return to work, the United States Postal Service requires that your doctor address and clarify the following questions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The nature of the problem?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The extent of recovery?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Dates of hospitalization or surgery?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Diagnosis and prognosis of any medical/psychological condition that may prevent the employee from doing his job as clerk?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">What medications is the employee taking? Name of medication, dosage and frequency?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If psychotropic medications are indicated, will they affect his ability to safely perform the essential functions of his job as clerk?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Does employee pose a risk, or potential risk of threat to the safety of himself or others?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Define any limitations...and the duration of those limitations?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 23, 2008, Ms. Jones received a December 16, 2008 letter and a December 22, 2008 note written by Agapito Racoma, M.D., a staff psychiatrist at Harmony Healthcare. In his December 16, 2008 letter, Dr. Racoma stated that he had interviewed the appellant on December 15, 2008, and that the appellant was suffering "significant anxiety and major depression" as a result of "serious job difficulties, reportedly with service managers and supervisors." Dr. Racoma recommended that the appellant either take a medical leave of absence or transfer to another location within the agency. In his December 22, 2008 note, Dr. Racoma stated that the appellant was under his care and treatment, was stable, and was not a danger to himself or others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated December 23, 2008, Ms. Jones informed the appellant that his medical documentation was incomplete and that he was not authorized to return to work until his doctor clarified all of the questions in her December 9, 2008 letter. She further informed the appellant, "Once the medical documentation is received and reviewed, a determination will be made about your readiness to return to work, and you will be notified."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 24, 2008, the appellant reported for duty and began to work. Shortly thereafter, Janice Cullen, Supervisor, Distribution Operations, told him that he was not cleared to return to work, that he would have to go home, and that management would contact him as soon as the OHNA cleared him to work. Ms. Cullen then escorted the appellant to the door of the employee parking lot and he left the premises.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thereafter, in response to virtually every communication by the appellant's doctors and other health professionals that the appellant was stable, not a danger to himself or others, and could return to work, Ms. Jones deemed the documentation deficient.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated August 31, 2009, Dr. Racoma stated that the appellant was never seen as a danger to himself or others nor had he displayed any indication of psychosis. He further stated that the appellant was on a medical leave of absence from December 8, 2008, through December 16, 2008, when he provided the appellant a letter indicating that he could return to work without restrictions as of December 16, 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After receiving Dr. Racoma's August 31, 2009 letter, the agency offered the appellant a limited duty assignment in the manual letter section of the Las Vegas P&#x0026;DC on September 20, 2009. The appellant accepted the offer on September 23, 2009, and returned to work the following day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 30, 2009, the appellant filed an appeal with the Board, alleging that the agency constructively suspended him from December 16, 2008, until September 24, 2009, by ordering him not to return to work until he provided "extensive medical information to the [a]gency well in excess of that legitimately needed by the [a]gency." He did not request a hearing or claim affirmative defenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge correctly found that the agency constructively suspended the appellant by refusing to allow him to return to work on December 24, 2008</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's absence for more than fourteen days that results in a loss of pay may be a constructive suspension appealable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2) and 7513(d). <span class="Italic">Hamiel v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 497, &#x00B6; 4 (2007). Constructive suspension claims generally arise in two situations: (1) when an agency places an employee on enforced leave pending an inquiry into his ability to perform; or (2) when an employee who is absent from work for medical reasons asks to return to work with altered duties, and the agency denies the request. <span class="Italic">Sage v. Department of the Army</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 398, &#x00B6; 5 (2008). The key question for jurisdictional purposes is whether the employee or the agency initiated the absence; if the absence is involuntary, i.e., at the direction of the agency, then the employee has been constructively suspended, but a voluntary absence is not a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Mills v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6; 6 (2007). An initially voluntary absence can subsequently become involuntary, and vice versa. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 254, &#x00B6; 8 (1999). An employee who alleges that he was constructively suspended must prove by preponderant evidence that his absence was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Nolan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 241, &#x00B6; 5 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the agency argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that the agency placed the appellant on enforced leave by refusing to allow him to return to work on December 24, 2008, pending an inquiry into his ability to perform his job. The agency contends that, pursuant to Section 865 of the agency's Employee and Labor Manual (ELM), the appellant was required to provide medical documentation in support of his request to return to work. The agency asserts that the appellant failed to provide the appropriate medical documentation and, therefore, the agency's refusal to allow him to return to work did not constitute a constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under Section 865.1 of the ELM, return-to-work clearance may be required for absences due to an illness when management reasonably believes that: (a) the employee may not be able to perform the essential functions of his position; or (b) the employee may pose a direct threat to the health or safety of himself or others due to his medical condition. By its own terms, this provision is triggered when the agency has "reliable and objective information" indicating that the appellant was unable to do his job or that he posed a threat to himself or others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the standard set forth in Section 865.1 of the ELM for requiring an employee to submit medical documentation to support his request to return to work was not met here. The appellant's request for sick leave due to stress allegedly caused by a hostile work environment is not by itself "reliable and objective information" indicating that the appellant was unable to do his job or that he posed a threat to himself or others. Looking at the record as a whole, we note that it contains a memorandum dated November 26, 2008, from the appellant's supervisor, wherein she asserted that the appellant "appears constantly paranoid; more so some days than others" and that she felt that there is "a potential or possibility of danger[.]" She then recounted several incidents and confrontations over an unspecified period of time involving the appellant.<span class="Italic"></span> While a couple of the incidents might indicate a serious mental disorder, such as paranoia (e.g., the appellant becoming upset on a few occasions because he believed co-workers were talking about him or looking at him), most of the described incidents merely involve the appellant's accusation of harassment by his supervisor and other managers.<span class="Italic"></span> Thus, the record does not support a finding that the appellant's actions created a reasonable concern that he was a threat to his own safety or that of others when he requested sick leave on December 8, 2008. Therefore, we find that the ELM did not authorize the agency's demand for additional medical <span id="Page_2081"></span>information as a condition for allowing the appellant to return to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also challenges the administrative judge's finding that the appellant did not return to work seeking any job modification. The agency asserts that this conclusion is "flatly contradicted" by the documentary evidence because Dr. Racoma's December 16, 2008 letter recommended that the appellant either take a medical leave of absence or transfer to another facility. The agency asserts that these recommendations created medical restrictions that prevented him from returning to his previously assigned duties and that, because the appellant's request to return to those duties contradicted these restrictions, there can be no finding of constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. The record is clear that the appellant was not seeking any restrictions or accommodations as a condition for returning to work after sick leave on December 8, 2008. As the administrative judge properly found, because the appellant did not condition his request to return to work upon being granted a new light duty assignment, a reassignment to another position, or any modification in his duties, he was not obligated to submit medical documentation supporting a light duty request or reassignment. ID at 18-19 (citing <span class="Italic">Barnes v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 103, &#x00B6; 10 (2006) (the agency initiated the appellant's absence when it advised him he could not return to his prior position without medical documentation)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that, as of December 24, 2008, the agency had medical documentation indicating that, while suffering from anxiety and depression, the appellant was stable, could perform his job, and was not a threat to himself or others. We find that this documentation was sufficient to support the appellant's request to return to work. Therefore, we believe that the agency improperly kept the appellant from work from December 24, 2008, to September 24, 2009. Accordingly, we affirm the initial decision's finding that the appellant's absence during that time period was involuntary and thus, a constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another Postal Service appeal involved the appellant's voluntary initiation of leave and the agency's efforts to block the appellant's return to work, <span class="Italic">Favors v. USPS,</span> AT-0752-09-0606-I-1 (NP 5/26/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's voluntary absence from work is unappealable. <span class="Italic">Sherrod v. Department of the Navy</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 19 (2001). If an agency bars an employee from duty for more than 14 days, however, the employee's absence may be a constructive suspension appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2) and 7513(d). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To establish the Board's jurisdiction over a constructive suspension appeal, an appellant must ultimately prove by preponderant evidence that her absence was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Mojarro v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 11 (2010) (citing <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>)). The dispositive question in a constructive suspension appeal is whether the employee or the agency initiated the employee's absence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A constructive suspension may occur when an agency has placed an employee on enforced leave without pay pending an inquiry into the employee's ability to perform in her position. <span class="Italic">Mojarro</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 10. Thus, the Board has found that an agency's placement of an employee on enforced leave for more than 14 days, based on an alleged physical or mental disability, constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Justice v. Department of the Navy,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 379, &#x00B6; 5 (2001); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 254, &#x00B6; 6 (2001). These holdings are consistent with the precedential decisions of the Board's reviewing court. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (an agency's placement of an employee on indefinite leave for more than fourteen days, after concluding that he was unable to perform his duties within his medical restrictions, is a disciplinary-type action within the Board's jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Mercer v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 772 F.2d 856, 857-58 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (an agency's placement of an employee on enforced leave pending the outcome of a psychiatric fitness-for-duty examination, which resulted in an absence lasting more than 14 days, constituted a suspension appealable to the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The uncontested record evidence shows that, following an April 19, 2009 verbal altercation with a co-worker, the appellant submitted, on April 23, 2009, requests for leave to cover her work shifts from April 23-27, 2009. Thus, we find that the appellant initiated her absence from work for the period of April 23-27, 2009. However, the agency submitted a sworn declaration of Plant Manager George W. Sconyers in which he states that, following the appellant's April 23-27, 2009 leave requests, "Manager Flora White instructed Ms. Favors on/about April 27th that in order to return to work Ms. Favors must provide a note from her doctor indicating she was able to work." The record also contains a May 20, 2009 letter from Nanci Langer-Warren, LCSW, BCD, with Kaiser Permanente, indicating that the appellant would start a 3 week intensive treatment program beginning on May 21, 2009, and a May 20, 2009 leave request from the appellant under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), in which she requests leave for the period of May 20, 2009, through June 20, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on this uncontested evidence, we find that the appellant initiated her absence for the period of April 23-27, 2009; that the agency then placed the appellant on enforced leave for the period of April 28, 2009, through May 19, 2009; and that the appellant thereafter again initiated her absence for a period of at least 3 weeks from May 20, 2009, through at least June 9, 2009. Thus, we find that the agency constructively suspended the appellant for the period of April 28, 2009, through May 19, 2009. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mercer</span>,<span class="Italic"></span> 772 F.2d at 857-58; <span class="Italic">Justice</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 379, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>,<span class="Italic"></span> 82 M.S.P.R. 254, &#x00B6; 6.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that the appellant may or may not have been ready, willing and able to perform the duties of her position for the period of April 28, 2009, through May 19, 2009, is irrelevant to the question of whether a constructive suspension occurred. <span class="Italic">See Rutherford</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 570, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Sherrod</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 23. Further, the fact that the agency may have placed the appellant in an enforced leave status, without pay, in accordance with its normal practice under its Employee and Labor Relations Manuel is also irrelevant to the issue of whether the agency constructively suspended the appellant. An agency's action in placing an employee in an enforced leave status for more than 14 days, without pay, for the purpose of determining the employee's ability to perform the duties of her position constitutes a constructive suspension within the Board's jurisdiction regardless of the agency's reason for taking the action. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. General Services Administration</span>, 756 F.2d 86, 90 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (although it left undisturbed the Board's finding that the agency had "ample, corroborated evidence warranting" the placement of the employee on enforced leave, the court found that the placement constituted a suspension appealable to the Board). Accordingly, we AFFIRM the initial decision in the 2009 appeal in part and REVERSE it in part. We find that the uncontested record evidence establishes that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal and that the agency constructively suspended the appellant for the period of April 28, 2009, through May 19, 2009.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The second situation occurs when an agency places an employee on forced leave pending an inquiry into his or her ability to perform. <span class="Italic">Hardy</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 539, &#x00B6; 12.

On remand, the AJ found that the record supported the appellant's assertion that when he reported to work on July 28, 2003, Wade told him that he would need a completed Form CA-17 for his left knee, in addition to the Form CA-17 he had presented to her regarding his right knee, before he could return to work. Thus, the AJ essentially found that the agency initiated the appellant's absence as of July 28, 2003. We agree with this determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having found that Wade told the appellant that he could not return to work until he provided medical documentation regarding his left knee, i.e., the knee that did not cause his most recent absences, we further find that the appellant has proven by preponderant evidence that the agency initiated his absence pending an inquiry into his ability to perform. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 254, 257 (1999) (the medical unit's action in preventing the appellant from returning to duty without clearance warranted a finding that the agency initiated the appellant's absence); <span class="Italic">Lohf v.

Davis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 184, 188 (1997) (the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency constructively suspended him when it placed him on enforced leave without his consent, and did not allow him to return to work until it first received completed paperwork from the appellant's psychologist indicating that the appellant was fit to return to work). Thus, the appellant has shown that the agency constructively suspended him from July 28, 2003, to September 17, 2003, and that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal. Because there is no indication that the agency provided the appellant with the procedural protections of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) or any other advance notice of the suspension or opportunity to respond, the action violates the appellant's right to minimum due process and cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Rivas</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 128.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2082"></span>A nonprecedential decision of the Federal Circuit provided some leeway for an agency to request more medical documentation, required by internal procedures, from an employee seeking to return to work. The court declined to construe as a constructive suspension the time unjustifiably taken by the employee to produce the requested information, <span class="Italic">Atkinson v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3404):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Atkinson was employed by the United States Postal Service (agency) in Anchorage, Alaska. He requested and was granted a period of absence based on job-induced stress. On August 23, 1999, he submitted a letter from his clinical psychologist dated August 20, 1999, stating that he could return to work "by Wednesday, August 25, 1999." The agency's contract physician reviewed this letter and deemed it insufficient to show that Mr. Atkinson could perform the duties of his position. On August 26, 1999 the agency wrote Mr. Atkinson that he should supplement his letter with a completed Work Restriction Evaluation Form. Mr. Atkinson's clinical psychologist completed the form on August 30, 1999. Mr. Atkinson filed the form with the agency on September 14, 1999. An agency contract physician concurred with his return to full duty by letter dated September 14, 1999, received by the agency September 15, 1999. On September 15, 1999 the agency sent Mr. Atkinson a "Return-to-Work" letter and also attempted to advise him by telephone that he could report to work that day. Meanwhile, on September 13, 1999 Mr. Atkinson filed an appeal to the Board, stating that he had been placed in involuntary leave status as of August 25, 1999, the date on which his psychologist had stated he could return to work, and had been constructively and erroneously suspended until at least September 15, 1999.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held that Mr. Atkinson had not been absent from work involuntarily for fourteen or more days, as required by statute to establish appeal rights based on improper suspension. The Board held that Mr. Atkinson's absence after August 30, 1999, the date his psychologist had completed the newly requested form (not filed with the agency until September 14, 1999), was "entirely voluntary" and therefore could not be counted to meet the fourteen day jurisdictional minimum. This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A suspension is defined as "the placing of an employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a temporary status without duties and pay." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7501(2), 7511(a)(2). A "suspension for more than 14 days" is appealable to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2), 7513(d). Included in this category of appealable actions are personnel actions that, although not technically suspensions, "remove an employee's duties and pay, and thus have the same effect as suspensions." <span class="Italic">Perez v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Such a "constructive suspension" is appealable to the Board if its duration was for more than fourteen days. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To constitute an appealable suspension the employee's absence must be involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Holloway v. United States</span>, 993 F.2d 219, 221 (Fed. Cir. 1993). If an employee has voluntarily absented himself from work, generally an appealable action does not arise. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perez</span>, 931 F.2d at 855.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Atkinson argues that the Board erred as a matter of law when it found his absence from work after August 30, 1999 to be voluntary. That was the day the requested form was completed by his psychologist, although Mr. Atkinson did not submit it to the agency until two weeks later. An agency must restore an employee to active duty status immediately upon learning that the employee is medically able to perform the duties of his position. However, the agency acted reasonably in following its internal procedures to assure that the employee is medically fit to perform all of the duties of his position. This is in contrast to <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 598 F.2d 598, 600 (Fed. Cir. 1987), wherein this court ruled that a constructive suspension occurred when the agency insisted that the employee either return to work or provide documentation for continued absence. In Mr. Atkinson's case the agency insisted that his treating psychologist or physician verify that he could perform all the duties of his position. Until the psychologist's form of August 30, 1999 was provided to the agency on September 14, 1999, the agency can not be charged with knowledge that Mr. Atkinson was fully fit for return to employment. The gap between August 30 and September 14 is not explained by Mr. Atkinson.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Atkinson argues that the information in the letter he submitted on August 23 and the Work Restriction Evaluation Form he submitted on September 14 are essentially identical insofar as they relate to his capability of performing his job. The August 23 letter did not relate to physical performance of the specific tasks of his position, as was set out in the Work Restriction Evaluation Form. Mr. Atkinson's argument appears to be that because the agency wrongfully requested this additional information, it is not material that he delayed in providing it to the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We confirm the Board's holding that none of that two-week period of delay in providing the form constituted a suspension by the agency, actual or constructive. The agency acted promptly when Mr. Atkinson filed this form, apparently on September 14, obtained a physician's review, and notified him on September 15 that he could return to work immediately. The Board's finding that his absence from work between August 30 and September 14 was a voluntary action is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. We also confirm the Board's holding that even if the agency should have returned him to work on August 23, there is no appealable action because the period from August 23 to August 30 is well below the fourteen day jurisdictional requirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Lohf v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 81, 85-86 (1996), if the agency imposed a medical fitness requirement or a requirement of providing a medical certification of fitness as a condition to an employee's continued employment, and if the employee was precluded from working until the conditions imposed by the agency are met, the ensuing absence was a constructive suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, relying on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Tyler v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 62 MSPR 509 (1994), found that the appellant was not constructively suspended because he never sought to report to work after presenting his physician's letter to the agency. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> We find, however, that the administrative judge misread the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Tyler.</span> Tyler's treating psychiatrist had placed Tyler on medical leave for an indefinite period of time. <span class="Italic">Tyler</span>, 62 MSPR at 510. Nearly one year later, Tyler requested to return to work. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The agency responded by requiring a FFD examination before Tyler could return to work. Tyler's request to return to duty merely constituted the event that triggered the agency's requirement that he take a FFD examination before returning to work. The Board found that Tyler's absence was initiated by the agency when it did not allow Tyler to return to work. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency placed the appellant on enforced leave and prevented him from returning to duty until he completed a ninety-day inpatient treatment program for PTSD. This decision need not have been prompted by a request to return to duty by the appellant in order to constitute an enforced leave suspension. Rather, it arose out of the results of a FFD examination ordered by the agency and the appellant's alleged behavior. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. General Services Administration</span>, 756 F.2d 86, 87-90 (Fed. Cir.) (finding Board jurisdiction over a constructive suspension where the agency placed the employee in a nonduty, nonpay status based on the results of a FFD examination and the employee's behavior), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 474 U.S. 843, 106 S. Ct. 129, 88 L. Ed.2d 106 (1985). It would be illogical to require the appellant to request to return to duty after the agency told him not to return until he completed a ninety-day inpatient treatment program for PTSD. <span class="Italic">Cf. Pledger v. Department of the Navy,</span> 50 MSPR 325, 330 (1991) (requiring an employee to offer to return to work after being informed that no work was available would be illogical). Moreover, jurisdiction over an appeal from enforced leave does not depend on whether the employee was ready, willing, and able to work<span class="Italic">. Gallegos,</span> at 485; <span class="Italic">see Vargo v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 49 MSPR 284, 286-87 (1991). By requiring the appellant to request to return to work after the agency had placed him on enforced leave, the administrative judge, in effect, was requiring the appellant to show that he was ready, willing, and able to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also found that the agency did not determine the appellant's medical inability to work; rather, it was determined by the appellant's own physician, an outside examination by a psychiatrist, and the concurrence of the agency's contract physician. We disagree. The appellant's psychologist advised the appellant to take off from work if the appellant felt that violence was imminent. The appellant's psychologist did not advise him not to go to work under any circumstances; rather, the decision to return to work was left to the appellant's discretion. The psychiatrist who performed the agency-ordered FFD examination was the first to recommend that the appellant not return to work, and the agency's contract physician agreed with that recommendation. Thus, it was the agency, and not the appellant's physician, that determined the appellant's medical inability to work and initiated his absence from duty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the agency directed that the employee not return to work without undergoing a fitness exam or providing independent evidence of medical fitness, it was the agency that placed the appellant into a nonwork status. The employee was constructively suspended and due process requirements applied (and Board appeal rights attach if the suspension exceeds 14 days), <span class="Italic">Gannon v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 41, 46-47 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the appellant's tour of duty that began at 10:45 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on December 16, 1992, Carol E. Clarke, his supervisor, ordered him to leave the premises on the ground that he was unfit for duty. The agency informed the appellant that he could not return to work until he presented medical documentation from a Board-certified psychiatrist and was cleared for duty by Dr. E. Evangelista, the agency's Senior Medical Officer. The appellant did not provide the requested medical documentation and has not since returned to work. The record indicates that the agency placed the appellant on sick leave, annual leave, and/or administrative leave from the time it ordered him off its premises until it removed him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for appeal, the appellant states that the "actions" taken against him by the agency were "disciplinary and retaliatory." Specifically, <span id="Page_2083"></span>he states that the agency placed him in "emergency off duty status" as a "disciplinary action." The appellant further declares in his appeal that when he reported for duty he "was threatened by management with arrest unless [he] immediately left the facility." He also contends that he returned to his duty station on February 8, 1993, and was informed that he had no business being there and would be arrested if he did not leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's placement on enforced leave for more than fourteen days, pending the agency's inquiry into whether his retention in duty status might be detrimental to the Government's interests, or be injurious to himself, his fellow workers, or the public, is a disciplinary-type action within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. General Services Administration</span>, 756 F.2d 86, 88-90 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 474 U.S. 843, 106 S. Ct. 129, 88 L. Ed.2d 106 (1985). We find that the appellant is appealing not only his removal, but is also alleging a pre-removal constructive suspension, and that the administrative judge erred in addressing solely the removal action in the initial decision<span class="Italic">. See Marr v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 49 MSPR 196, 201 (1991). Consequently, we must remand this case to the regional office for further proceedings on the appellant's claim of constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Martin v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 22, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-19 (2022), determined an employee was constructively suspended when an agency unjustifiably required medical evidence that the employee did not present a threat to himself or others based on medical condition that caused the employee to initiate the leave. The agency did not establish that it had a proper basis to consider the employee a potential threat, and, as a result, discriminated against him based on his disability--an asthmatic condition triggered by an anxiety attack:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a preference-eligible Window Clerk, left work after suffering an anxiety attack that triggered an asthma attack on December 15, 2016. According to the appellant, he saw his primary care physician at her first availability on January 11, 2017, and then saw his clinical psychologist, for further evaluation and clearance to return to work. The appellant believed, and the agency agreed, that he was required to submit medical documentation to the agency and receive the agency's permission prior to returning to work. On January 12, 2017, his psychologist faxed a note to the agency's Occupational Health Nurse Administrator (OHNA) stating that the appellant's health episode on December 15, 2016, was psychological in nature and that he had sufficiently recovered to return to work with no restrictions. After not hearing anything from the agency regarding his clearance to return to work, the appellant reported to his duty station on January 26, 2017, but a supervisor told him that he had to leave because he had not been cleared to return to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 27, 2017, the appellant filed the instant Board appeal, alleging that the agency had constructively suspended him following an absence for medical reasons and discriminated against him on the basis of disability. On February 9, 2017, he received a February 6, 2017 letter from his station manager informing him that his psychologist's return-to-work letter was deficient because it did not state whether the appellant was a threat to himself or others. In a letter to the agency dated February 13, 2017, the appellant's psychologist stated that the appellant was not a threat to himself or others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After holding the appellant's requested hearing, the administrative judge issued an initial decision finding that, notwithstanding the agency's conceding jurisdiction, the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal because the appellant failed to show that his absence from work was involuntary. In so finding, the administrative judge explained that the agency had a reasonable basis for requesting documentation regarding whether the appellant was a danger to himself or others because the station manager knew that his absence was related to a psychological condition, he engaged in an altercation with his supervisor before leaving work on December 15, 2016, and he previously was reassigned to his current duty station because he could not work with a particular supervisor. She further found that the agency timely notified the appellant of the requirement to provide the additional medical documentation and that, although the agency's delay in returning the appellant to work was regrettable, it was not wrongful. Because she found that the appellant failed to establish jurisdiction over his appeal, she did not reach the appellant's disability discrimination affirmative defense but noted that she would have found that he failed to establish it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although various fact patterns may give rise to an appealable constructive suspension, all constructive suspension claims are premised on the proposition that an absence that appears to be voluntary actually is not. <span class="italic">Rosario-Fabregas v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 8 (2015), <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 833 F.3d 1342. To demonstrate that the absence was not voluntary and is an actionable constructive suspension, an appellant must show the following: (1) he lacked a meaningful choice in the matter; and (2) it was the agency's wrongful actions that deprived him of that choice. <span class="italic">Id</span>. This analysis extends to situations in which the agency prevented the appellant's return to work after an initially voluntary leave of absence. <span class="italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant must prove jurisdiction in a constructive adverse action appeal by preponderant evidence. <span class="italic">Abbott v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 294, &#x00B6; 8 (2014). The jurisdictional issue in such appeals is often dispositive. Id. That is, if the appellant fails to meet his burden of establishing by preponderant evidence that he was constructively suspended, the appeal will be dismissed because the Board lacks jurisdiction over appeals of employees' voluntary actions. <span class="italic">Id.</span> Because such constructive suspensions are often effected without notice, however, if the appellant establishes jurisdiction, the Board will reverse the agency's action on due process grounds without proceeding to the merits. <span class="italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, once the appellant submitted a medical note on January 12, 2017, releasing him to return to work without restrictions, the agency's decision not to permit him to return deprived him of a meaningful choice in the matter. <span class="italic">See Romero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6; 9 (2014). Thus, the appellant satisfied the first prong of the constructive suspension test. The administrative judge found, however, that he failed to prove that his absence resulted from the agency's wrongful actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained by our reviewing court, "[w]hen an employee voluntarily takes leave, an agency may properly refuse to allow the employee to resume working if the employee does not satisfy the agency's conditions for returning to work." <span class="italic">Rosario-Fabregas</span>, 833 F.3d at 1347. The employee's resulting absence is not a constructive suspension. <span class="italic">Id.</span> If, however, the agency's conditions for returning to work are wrongful, then the employee's absence following the agency's refusal to allow him to return to work may be deemed a constructive suspension. <span class="italic">See Rosario-Fabregas</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board adjudicates claims of disability discrimination raised in connection with an otherwise appealable action under the substantive standards of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. The standards under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008, have been incorporated by reference into the Rehabilitation Act and the Board applies them to determine whether there has been a Rehabilitation Act violation. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(f); <span class="italic">Miller v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 13 n.3 (2014). The ADA significantly restricts the medical inquiries that an agency may make of an employee. <span class="italic">Archerda v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 29 &#x0026; n.6 (2014). Under the ADA, an agency may require a medical examination or make a medical inquiry regarding whether an employee "is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of the disability" only when such inquiry or examination "is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4)(A). The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has promulgated regulations implementing this statutory provision and issued enforcement guidance addressing the ADA's limitations on disability-related inquiries and medical examinations during employment. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.13(b), 1630.14(c); EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees under the [ADA], Notice 915.002, 2000 WL 33407181 (July 27, 2000) (Enforcement Guidance). The Board generally defers to the EEOC on issues of substantive discrimination law, and we find that it is appropriate to do so here. <span class="italic">See Evans v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6; 9 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, a disability-related inquiry or medical examination may be "job-related and consistent with business necessity" if an employer "has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that: (1) an employee's ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition; or (2) an employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition." <span class="italic">Archerda</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 30 (<span class="italic">quoting Watkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01981800, 2001 WL 1097442, at *2 (Aug. 29, 2001)); Enforcement Guidance, 2000 WL 33407181, at *6. The agency's Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM) incorporates this standard. Specifically, ELM, section 865.1 provides that the agency can require employees returning from medically related absences to submit documentation to clear their return to work when it "has a reasonable belief, based upon reliable and objective information" that the employee may be unable to perform the essential functions of his position or may present a "direct threat to the health or safety of [himself] or others due to that medical condition." It is the agency's burden to show that its disability-related inquiries and requests for examination are job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="italic">Archerda</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 31.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency did not allege that the appellant could not perform his essential job functions but argued that the station manager acted within her discretion under ELM, section 865.1, to require language regarding whether the appellant was a risk to himself or others because his absence was related to a mental health condition. In addition, the station manager testified that she requested the additional information because she heard that the appellant engaged in a "back-and-forth" with his supervisor just before he left work on December 15, 2016, and because she was aware that he could not work with a particular supervisor at another facility. The administrative judge found that these reasons were sufficient to provide the agency with a reasonable basis to require the appellant to submit <span id="Page_2084"></span>medical documentation containing the direct threat language. The appellant challenges these findings on review, arguing that he did not engage in an altercation before departing work on December 15, 2016, and that there was no evidence that he posed a direct threat to himself or others. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the appellant that the agency did not have a reasonable basis to request additional medical information and that the administrative judge erred in finding otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Direct Threat means a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r); <span class="italic">see Archerda</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 30. The Board has found that an agency had a reasonable belief that the employee presented a "direct threat" when he submitted a psychiatrist's note less than 5 months earlier stating that he had experienced "aggressive episodes." <span class="italic">Rosario-Fabregas</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 17. The EEOC has concluded that an agency had a reasonable belief that an employee presented a direct threat to herself when she exhibited specific behavioral changes following an accident, including violent outbursts and unsafe actions. <span class="italic">O'Malley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01994945, 2002 WL 31232360, at *4-*5 (Sept. 26, 2002). Further, an example in the EEOC's Enforcement Guidance states that an agency could require medical documentation based on a reasonable belief that the employee posed a direct threat due to a medical condition when, prior to a period of absence for psychiatric treatment, the employee threatened several of his coworkers and was disciplined. Enforcement Guidance, 2000 WL 33407181, at *14. On the other hand, the Board and EEOC have found that an agency did not have a reasonable belief that an employee presented a direct threat due to a medical condition when there was no evidence in the record that he was physically violent or posed a significant risk of doing substantial harm. <span class="italic">Archerda</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 32; <span class="italic">see Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01992682, 2001 WL 1526433, at *3-*4 (Nov. 20, 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as noted above, the first reason cited by the agency in support of its decision to require the appellant to provide medical documentation containing the direct threat language was because his absence was related to a mental health condition. The station manager testified that she required the appellant to provide such documentation because the OHNA advised her that the January 12, 2017 letter indicated that his condition was psychological in nature. HCD (testimony of the station manager). The OHNA and a postmaster testified that the agency requires any employee whose absence from work is related to a mental health condition to provide a medical note specifically addressing whether he is a risk to himself or others before he may be returned to work. HCD (testimonies of the OHNA and postmaster). The mere fact that an employee's absence is related to a mental health condition, however, does not constitute objective and reliable evidence establishing, or even suggesting, that he is likely to be violent or do harm. See EEOC Enforcement Guidance on the [ADA] and Psychiatric Disabilities, Notice 915.002, 1997 WL 34622315, *13-*14 (Mar. 25, 1997) (explaining that a determination of whether an individual with a psychiatric condition poses a direct threat must be based on "specific behavior" rather than solely on the individual's treatment for a psychiatric disability). Therefore, we find that the agency's reliance on the fact that the appellant's absence was related to a mental health condition was not an acceptable basis to require additional medical documentation under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="italic">See Archerda</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 30.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The station manager also testified that she required the appellant to submit additional medical documentation containing the direct threat language because she was aware from the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) Forms CA-17 submitted by the appellant each month that he could not work at another facility with a particular supervisor. HCD (testimony of the station manager). The record contains a copy of one OWCP Duty Status Report, Form CA-17, signed by the appellant's psychologist in January 2017, indicating that the appellant was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, which OWCP accepted as a workplace injury with a date of injury of January 19, 2005. The form also indicates that the appellant was advised to resume work on April 23, 2012, and states the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As described in previous CA-17 Forms submitted, [the appellant] may return to his [position] full time, providing that [he] does not work for, is not supervised by, and his work is neither directly nor indirectly influenced by [the supervisor] (The person I believe is primarily responsible for [his] work injury).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unclear from the record when the appellant experienced difficulties working with this particular supervisor or the circumstances surrounding those difficulties, although it appears to have been around the beginning of 2005. Nevertheless, we find that the station manager's knowledge that the appellant had unspecified difficulties with a particular supervisor and that working with her contributed to his anxiety disorder does not constitute objective evidence establishing, or even suggesting, that he is likely to be violent or do harm. Therefore, we find that the agency has not shown that its reliance on the appellant's difficulties with a particular supervisor a number of years earlier was an acceptable basis to require additional medical documentation under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="italic">See Archerda</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 30.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, the station manager testified that she required the appellant to provide the direct threat information in his return-to-work letter because she heard that he was involved in an altercation with his supervisor before he left work on December 15, 2016. Specifically, she testified that, although she had "no idea exactly what happened" because she was not there, the supervisor told her that he instructed the appellant to work at a different window, the appellant refused, and there was a "back-and-forth." The EEOC has held that a workplace argument in which an employee pushed her chest into a coworker's chest did not provide the agency a reasonable basis to believe that the employee posed a direct threat to herself or others, even though her conduct may have been improper. <span class="italic">Snowden v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120083032, 2011 WL 4343908, at *5 (Sept. 9, 2011). Here, the "back-and-forth" alleged by the station manager describes a mere verbal disagreement between the appellant and his supervisor, without any suggestion that the appellant behaved in a threatening or violent manner. Therefore, we find that this was an improper basis to require the appellant to submit additional medical information under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="italic">See Archerda</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 30.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the foregoing, we find that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it refused to permit the appellant to return to work and ordered him to provide additional medical documentation that was not job-related or consistent with business necessity. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Snowden</span>, 2011 WL 4343908, at *5 (finding that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it ordered the complainant to undergo a fitness-for-duty examination without proving it reasonably believed she was a direct threat or could not perform her essential job functions). Because the agency's actions were wrongful, the agency constructively suspended the appellant when it refused to permit him to return to work, and the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal. <span class="italic">See Rosario-Fabregas</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 8. Because the appellant did not receive due process for this constructive suspension, the action must be reversed. <span class="italic">See Abbott</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 294, &#x00B6; 8. Furthermore, because the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act, we find that the appellant has established his disability discrimination claim.[3] <span class="italic">See Evans</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6; 16 (finding that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act when it asked a potential employee to disclose the medications he was taking prior to extending a job offer to him and that this violation constituted discrimination based on disability); <span class="italic">Clark</span>, 2001 WL 1526433, at *3-*5 (finding that the agency discriminated against the employee by requiring him to undergo a fitness-for-duty examination without showing that such examination was job-related or consistent with business necessity in violation of the Rehabilitation Act).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The ADA's restrictions on disability-related inquiries and medical examinations apply to individuals both with and without disabilities. <span class="italic">Archerda</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 31. Therefore, the appellant is protected by these restrictions regardless of whether he qualifies as disabled within the meaning of the ADA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reasserts his claims that the agency subjected him to status-based disability discrimination and failed to accommodate his medical conditions of anxiety disorder and asthma. The administrative judge found that the Board lacks jurisdiction over these claims and, alternatively, that the appellant failed to prove them. In light of our finding that the appellant proved Board jurisdiction over his constructive suspension, the Board has jurisdiction over these claims. However, we find it unnecessary to separately address them. We already have found the agency's actions discriminatory, and therefore wrongful, based on its improper medical inquiry. Under the particular facts of this case, we discern no basis on which the appellant could seek additional damages for these claims, and thus decline to address these other theories of liability. <span class="italic">See Cerge v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Request No. 0520080093, 2008 WL 559447, *2 (Feb. 20, 2008) (explaining that compensatory damages were available to a complainant who was sent to a fitness-for-duty examination that was not job-related or consistent with business necessity). Because we have found in the appellant's favor on the issues of the constructive suspension and disability discrimination, we need not address the appellant's remaining allegations of error by the administrative judge. <span class="italic">See Coltrane v. Department of the Army</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 397, 403 n.9 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency has a medical fitness standard that an employee must meet as a condition of continuing employment, the agency may require the employee to undergo a fitness for duty examination, and reasonable delay in ordering the exam is not improper, but the employee should be returned to duty after the agency's legitimate need for medical information is satisfied, and the agency may not delay the employee's return by imposing medical evidentiary requirements not contemplated by OPM's regulations governing fitness exams, the situation involving a criminal investigator in <span class="italic">Ferrante v. EPA</span>, PH-0752-15-0372-I-2 (NP 4/25/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2085"></span>Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(b)(3) (2015), an agency has the authority to require an employee who occupies a position with physical and medical standards to report for a medical exam whenever there is a direct question about his continued capacity to meet the physical or medical requirements of his position. [2] Here, the administrative judge correctly found that, while the agency must consider the appellant's provided medical documentation, it need not rely on that information exclusive of an opinion from its own physician.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Office of Personnel Management amended 5 C.F.R. part 339, effective March 21, 2017, after the issuance of the March 10, 2017 initial decision. 82 Fed. Reg. 10959-01, 10959 (Feb. 17, 2017). For the purposes of this nonprecedential final order, we apply the 2015 version of the regulations in effect at the time of the appellant's alleged constructive suspension. <span class="italic">See Zajac v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 160, &#x00B6; 5 n.2 (2009). Nonetheless, we would reach the same outcome under either version because the amended regulations do not absolve the agency its obligation to designate an appropriate practitioner and to pay for exams that it orders. <span class="italic">Compare</span> 5 C.F.R. part 339 (2015), <span class="italic">with</span> 5 C.F.R. part 339 (2017).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the agency's exam order was appropriate because the appellant's medical documentation did not sufficiently resolve the question of his fitness for duty. The appellant's clearances from his treating practitioners did not explain how his medical condition affected his duties, or the reasons and bases for finding that his medical condition had improved since their recommendations that the appellant be excused from his duties. <span class="italic">See Archerda v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19, 34-35 (2014) (finding that the agency was authorized to order the appellant to report for a fitness-for-duty exam because the provided medical documentation did not adequately explain his Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) medications, provide a history of his medical condition, include a prognosis or diagnosis, or indicate how his PTSD affected his ability to perform his Firefighter position duties); <span class="italic">Calicott v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A01169, 2003 WL 21634364, at *2 (July 2, 2003) (finding that the agency had a sufficient basis for ordering a fitness-for-duty exam when the employee's medical documentation lacked relevant facts and information regarding his current medical status). We therefore discern no error in the agency's decision to order the appellant to submit to a FOH exam, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(b)(3) (2015), to determine his fitness for duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="italic">The agency failed to fully discharge its obligations under 5 C.F.R. part 339 in effecting the ordered FOH examination.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that, contrary to the administrative judge's findings, it acted appropriately and reasonably in requiring the appellant to submit acceptable medical documentation before permitting him to return to work, given the severity of his injury and the demanding nature of his position. While we agree with the administrative judge that the agency acted improperly when it ordered the appellant to obtain and provide a neurological evaluation after the agency had conducted the medical examination, we additionally find that the wrongful action included the agency's requirement that the appellant pay for that evaluation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency-ordered FOH exam did not include the neurological evaluation at issue. However, early documentation from the appellant's treating practitioners raised a question as to his cognition, which, among other things, affected his ability to operate a firearm. Thus, given the extent of the appellant's head injuries and the nature of his position, the FOH exam likely should have included that evaluation or referred him for further testing. Archerda, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 21 (stating that an exam ordered pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301 must be done in conformance with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Americans with Disabilities Act regulations, consistent with business necessity, and tailored to its specific concerns regarding the appellant's ability to perform).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recognizing the deficiency, the FOH MRO directed the appellant to submit a "CURRENT" neurological and mental status evaluation by a board-certified neurologist. The neurological evaluation was a required component of the clearance determination. Rather than merely provide already-obtained medical information describing his diagnosis or prognosis, the appellant was forced to undergo a new exam to fulfill the FOH directive. Also, unlike <span class="italic">Rosario-Fabregas</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-5, 13, wherein, in furtherance of the interactive process, the agency requested additional medical information from the appellant because the supporting information he offered was insufficient to make a determination on his reasonable accommodation request, the FOH MRO's directive was in conjunction with an agency-ordered medical exam and evaluation to determine whether it would permit the appellant to resume his duties in a position with medical standards and physical requirements. We therefore find that, under these facts, the agency effectively ordered the appellant to undergo a medical exam from a private board-certified neurologist.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The agency argues that under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.302, it has the option of offering an exam under certain conditions. However, even if this is a circumstance in which the agency had the authority to offer (or refrain from offering) an exam under that provision, it nonetheless elected to utilize its authority under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(b)(3) (2015) to order a medical exam.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency did not comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.303(b), which required it to "designate[ ] the examining physician," and that this wrongful action deprived the appellant of a meaningful choice. Although the agency contends that it complied with the designation requirement by directing the appellant to "have a board-certified neurologist" complete a "CURRENT neurological and mental status evaluation," we disagree. Section 339.303(b) does not indicate that an agency may "designate" an employee's yet unidentified personal physician as the examining physician; rather, it provides that the agency must merely "offer" the employee an opportunity to submit medical documentation from the personal physician.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, when an agency orders or offers a medical exam, the agency shall pay for the exam. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.304 (2015). The evidence in the record does not reflect that the agency made any effort to pay for the new neurological exam. Consequently, we find that the agency also did not comply with the requirements set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.304 (2015), and that wrongful action, along with its failure to comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.303 (2015), deprived the appellant of a meaningful choice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a result, the delay in medically clearing the appellant was attributable to the agency's failure to conduct a sufficient exam and to comply with its obligations under 5 C.F.R. part 339 in ordering and paying for a neurological exam, and not due to the appellant's delay in providing the neurological report. Cf. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.102(c) (2015) (explaining that "[a]n employee's refusal to be examined in accordance with a proper agency order authorized under [5 C.F.R. part 339] is grounds for appropriate disciplinary or adverse action") (emphasis added). We therefore find that the appellant proved that the agency constructively suspended him from June 15, 2015, when the FOH MRO completed her report, to October 16, 2015, the appellant's last day of absence before returning to duty, and that the Board has jurisdiction, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(2), over that constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="italic">The administrative judge erred in including the appellant's involuntary absence before June 15, 2015, in the constructive suspension period.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that the delay between the appellant's last FOH appointment on May 13, 2015, and the appellant's receipt of the June 15, 2015 MRO report on July 9, 2015, was unreasonable. We agree with the agency in part and modify the administrative judge's finding as to when the constructive suspension period began.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge relied on <span class="italic">Sherrod v. Department of the Navy</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 24 (2001), in finding that the delay was unreasonably long. We find Sherrod distinguishable from the instant case. There, the agency failed to provide any explanation for its nearly 3-month delay between receiving the appellant's request to return to duty and medical information from his private physician and issuing its request for more information. <span class="italic">Sherrod</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 24. Here, in contrast, the agency submitted evidence explaining the medical review process and the FOH MRO's actions taken to complete her review, which included reviewing medical documentation from the appellant's private practitioners and the FOH exam information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find the remaining cases relied on by the administrative judge on this issue inapposite. In <span class="italic">Caballero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 263, 266-67 (1987), the Board did not base its finding on the appellant's constructive suspension claim on the length of the agency's delay in rendering a fitness-for-duty determination. In <span class="italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 119, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 13 (1999), the Board found that the agency constructively suspended the appellant because it failed to comply with its obligations to search for a light-duty assignment within the appellant's restrictions and within the 72-hour time frame mandated by the collective bargaining agreement. There is no similar provision requiring the agency to return the appellant to work within a specific timeframe in this case; thus, the Board's unreasonably long delay finding in <span class="italic">Baker</span> is not applicable. Finally, the administrative judge relied upon <span class="italic">Justice v. Department of the Navy</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 379, &#x00B6; 13 (2001), in finding that, although a "brief delay" between a medical examination and a medical clearance determination would not be improper, the Board declines to speculate in these types of cases as to how long a reasonable delay might last. <span class="italic">Justice</span>, however, was issued before the Board decided in <span class="italic">Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397 (2013), that a finding of wrongful agency action is required for an involuntary absence to constitute a constructive suspension, and therefore, merely held that the appellant's constructive suspension began on the day the agency refused to allow him to return to work when he reported for duty that day. <span class="italic">See Justice</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 379, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FOH MRO completed her review of the appellant's medical <span id="Page_2086"></span>information 1 month after his last FOH exam. We find that this is not an unreasonably long time to conduct such a review and that such a delay does not constitute a wrongful action sufficient to trigger a constructive suspension. <span class="italic">See Campbell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21 (2003) (finding no wrongdoing in the agency's nearly 1-month delay between receiving the appellant's clearance from his private physician and issuing its request for medical documentation). Therefore, the appellant has not shown any wrongdoing in the agency's actions from April 15 to June 14, 2015. Accordingly, we find that the appellant was constructively suspended only from June 15, 2015, when the FOH MRO deferred a medical determination pending further documentation, including a neurological and mental status evaluation, until October 16, 2015, the last day of the appellant's absence until his return to duty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board had jurisdiction over an enforced leave appeal when the agency blocked the appellant's return to work for medical reasons once the appellant sought to return after a period of absence initiated by the appellant, <span class="Italic">Tyler v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 509, 512-14 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's placement on enforced leave for more than fourteen days, pending the agency's inquiry into his physical ability to perform, is a disciplinary suspension within the Board's jurisdiction because the appellant's absence from the workplace is involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Rivas v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 61 MSPR 121, 126 (1994), issued after the initial decision in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's absence from the workplace from May 5, 1992, to the present, was involuntary because, as we have indicated above, since May 5, 1992, the appellant repeatedly requested permission to return to work but the agency refused to allow him to return until a fitness-for-duty medical examination was completed, the medical evidence reviewed, and a decision made regarding his status. Further, once the fitness-for-duty examination was completed in July 1992, the agency continued to refuse the appellant's request to return to work. Thus, it is evident that the agency initiated the appellant's continuing absence when it refused to allow him to return to work. <span class="Italic">See Rivas</span>, 61 MSPR at 127. Therefore, the appellant's absence from May 5, 1992, was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge based his finding, that the appellant was not suspended, on evidence that the appellant was not "ready, willing, and able" to return to work. However, the Board found in <span class="Italic">Rivas</span> that, whether the appellant was "ready, willing, and able to work" is a back pay, compliance issue and not a jurisdictional issue<span class="Italic">. See Rivas,</span> at 128; <span class="Italic">see also Vargo v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 49 MSPR 284, 286-87 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the availability of work within an employee's medical restrictions may be relevant to the merits of an agency's decision to suspend an employee. <span class="Italic">See e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Mercer v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 772 F.2d 856, 858 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (court found suspension proper in light of evidence supporting the reasons for the action). However, it is not relevant to the jurisdictional issued [sic] raised here, because it does not tend to show either that the agency placed the appellant on leave contrary to his wishes or that the appellant voluntarily placed himself on leave. <span class="Italic">See Rivas,</span> at 127-128.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent the administrative judge relied on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of the Navy,</span> 45 MSPR 136, 142 (1990), which suggests that the availability of work in appeals such as this generally is relevant to the issue of jurisdiction, the administrative judge did not have the benefit of the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Rivas</span> which explicitly overruled <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> and other similar decisions. <span class="Italic">Rivas,</span> at 128. Thus, here, as in <span class="Italic">Rivas,</span> the dispositive issue is whether the appellant or the agency initiated the absence<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, we find that a suspension was initiated by the agency and that this suspension began on May 5, 1992. Accordingly, because this suspension has exceeded fourteen days, we find that it constitutes an adverse action over which the Board has jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2), 7513(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next find that the agency, in suspending the appellant, provided him with none of the procedural protections of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b). Nor did it provide him with any other advance notice or opportunity to respond to such notice. Thus, the agency's action violates the appellant's constitutional right to minimum due process, and it cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Rivas,</span> at 128-29; <span class="Italic">Pledger v. Department of the Navy,</span> 50 MSPR 325, 330 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the absence of a final decision on the appellant's discrimination and retaliation allegations, under the circumstances of this case, we find it appropriate that the agency now cancel its suspension action and restore the appellant to his position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(1) and (2). The continued processing of, and ultimate decision on, the discrimination and retaliation issues can have no effect on the appellant's entitlement to return to duty under our holding in this Opinion and Order. <span class="Italic">See Polite,</span> 49 MSPR at 657.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">See Sherrod v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 90 MSPR 347, &#x00B6; 24 (2001) ("The agency wrote a letter to Dr. Fougy on October 4, 2000, requesting answers to specific questions raised by Dr. Fougy's June 26 letter. The record does not explain the reason for the delay. As indicated above, placement of the appellant in a leave status after the agency received the June 26, 2000 letter may have constituted a constructive suspension. In addition, the appellant's failed attempt to return to work on September 11, 2000, may have constituted a constructive suspension.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Leave status should not have been imposed on an employee who sought to return to the work site after a period of absence for medical reasons only because the agency was unsure of the employee's fitness to work upon her return, <span class="Italic">Walker v. DHHS</span>, 58 MSPR 614, 616-18 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant maintained that, although she submitted a medical release form to her supervisor and indicated that she was ready, willing, and able to work, the agency stated that she would be carried in AWOL status until she provided adequate medical documentation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency responded to the appellant's petition for appeal. It alleged that the appellant's supervisor approved her sick leave on February 19, 1991, but after the appellant telephoned to request leave on 7 consecutive days, the supervisor instructed her to submit adequate medical documentation to determine whether her alleged illness could be accommodated. The agency asserted that: The appellant submitted a March 4, 1991 medical report which stated that she suffered from anxiety and depression, and would require 6 to 8 weeks for a partial or full recovery; on March 28, 1991, when the appellant reported for duty, the agency prohibited her from returning to work because her medical documentation was inadequate to determine whether she was capable of performing the full range of her duties without restrictions; on March 29, 1991, she submitted a note from her physician indicating that she was fit to return to work on a trial basis; and the agency then informed her that it required a detailed medical evaluation to make an informed managerial determination of whether she was in fact ready, willing, and able to perform the full range of her duties without restrictions, because the March 4, 1991 medical report stated that she would be incapacitated for 6 to 8 weeks. The agency further alleged that: The appellant then submitted an April 5, 1991 medical report stating that she was partially recovered but that she might suffer a relapse if her work conditions did not improve; the agency informed the appellant that the April 5, 1991 medical report was not adequate to show that she was ready, willing, and able to work, and until she submitted such evidence she would be carried on AWOL; and the appellant failed to submit any additional medical evidence to the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant here attempted to return to work on March 28, 1991, but was placed in an AWOL status for her alleged failure to provide adequate medical documentation allowing the agency to determine whether she was able to perform the full range of her duties.... Thus, her absence from work from March 28, 1991, onward, was not of her own volition but was at the behest, or under the control, of the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Connor v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 583, 587 (1992); <span class="Italic">Barnes</span>, 49 MSPR at 25-26; <span class="Italic">Finn v. VA</span>, 39 MSPR 658, 662 (1989). We find under these circumstances that the agency's placement of the appellant on enforced leave since March 28, 1991, pending an inquiry into her physical ability to perform, constitutes an appealable constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pittman</span>, 832 F.2d at 599; <span class="Italic">Magno</span>, 52 MSPR at 468; <span class="Italic">Barnes</span>, 49 MSPR at 25-26. We therefore conclude, contrary to the administrative judge's findings, that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the agency effected the constructive suspension without affording the appellant the required statutory procedural protections of prior notice, an explanation of the agency's evidence, and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7513(b).
