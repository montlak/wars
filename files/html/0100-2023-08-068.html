<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-69"><span class="space">3.</span> Same or Similar Position</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The concept of "current continuous service" is common to the definition of both competitive service and excepted service employees, but in the excepted service, for time to count toward an appeal right, the current continuous service must be in the same or similar positions: the excepted service preference eligible must have completed one year of current continuous service in an executive agency in the same or similar positions; the person without preference eligible status in the excepted service must have completed two years of current continuous service in the same or similar position in an executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to two years or less. 5 USC 7511 provides the source of the MSPB appeal rights for excepted service personnel through the definition of "employee":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;For the purpose of this subchapter--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;"employee" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;in an Executive agency; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;in the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(C)&#x2003;an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less[.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statute does not define what constitutes the "same or similar positions," but OPM regulations define "similar positions," 5 CFR 752.402 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Similar positions</span> means positions in which the duties performed are similar in nature and character and require substantially the same or similar qualifications, so that the incumbent could be interchanged between the positions without significant training or undue interruption to the work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weinberger v. USPS</span>, 4 MSPR 330, 331-32, 4 MSPB 395 (1980), provides history and interpretation of the phrase "current continuous service in the same or similar positions":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board notes that a review of the legislative history of the Reform Act demonstrates that the phrase "one year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions" was intended to constitute the same definition of the extent of coverage afforded to employees in appellant's position as pre-act law and regulations. S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 48 (1978). The meaning of this phrase as used in Civil Service regulations at the time the Reform Act enacted was set forth in FPM Supp. 752-1, subchapter S2-3a(3), as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Current continuous employment in a position outside the competitive service may be either (i) employment in one position without a break of a workday or (ii) employment in more than one position <span class="Italic">in the same line of work</span> without a break of a workday. (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reference to the phrase "same line of work" in the Board's <span class="Italic">Weinberger</span> decision, used in some decisions that follow, referenced in FPM Supp. 752-1, was defined in the Appendix to (the late) Federal Personnel Manual, Chapter 315, "Determining Completion of a Probationary Period," of September 19, 1989, at section A-3c(3):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Same line of work means the positions in which the duties performed are similar in nature and character and require substantially the same or similar qualifications, so that the incumbent could be interchanged between the positions without significant training or undue interruption to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Claims held that to determine whether an individual who has been moved among jobs is a probationer or tenured employee, depending upon whether he has one year of continuous service in the same or a similar position, the Board may properly rely on comparison of job duties rather than organizational structures. <span class="Italic">Weinberger v. USPS</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 612 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Carr v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 681, 683 (1990), explained the jurisdictional significance of continuity of service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency asserted that the appellant did not have the 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar position required by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the written record nor the initial decision in this case contains any discussion concerning the issue of jurisdiction.

The administrative judge found that the appellant's service from March 1986 to November 1988 as a Mail Handler satisfied the requirement for 1 year of current continuous service. The administrative judge erred in this regard because such service, despite being for a period of over a year, did not occur immediately prior to the appellant's removal and thus cannot be considered current continuous service<span class="Italic">.

Cir. 2006), involving the discharge of an air marshal who was previously an INS agent, determined that for purposes of determining whether the prior federal appointment was the same or similar to the excepted service job held at the time of termination emphasis should be placed on the skills and fundamental character of the positions rather than on dissimilarities in position descriptions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Coradeschi argues that the AJ improperly denied him an evidentiary hearing on the issue of MSPB jurisdiction through &#x00A7; 7511 and &#x00A7; 7513. Specifically, he contends that he made a non-frivolous allegation that his position as an INS agent was similar to his position as a FAM under &#x00A7; 7511.</p>

There, we stated that the AJ improperly narrowed the meaning of "similar positions" by focusing on "certain differences in the work the two jobs involved, as specified in the position descriptions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The AJ in <span class="Italic">Mathis</span> found that the two positions were dissimilar because "the 'main function' of a special delivery messenger 'is to deliver' the mail 'after it has been sorted,' and not to 'distribute it within the facility [the Post Office],' which is the function of a distribution clerk." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We rejected that finding and held that "the critical fact is that the petitioner handled the mail" and that the skills required to perform mail handling in both positions were closely related. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 235.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the TSA's own Human Resources Office defines "same or similar positions" for its own probationary period. TSA Management Directive No. 1100.31-1 on Trial Periods effective February 4, 2004 ("TSA Directive")--a week before Coradeschi was terminated--defines the term "same or similar positions" to be "[p]ositions that would be classified in the same occupational series and requires substantially the same or similar qualifications." TSA Directive &#x00A7; 4(E).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Coradeschi maintains that he has sufficiently made a non-frivolous allegation that his work as an INS agent was the same or similar to his work as a FAM. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From the limited evidence presented without even a hearing, it appears that both positions required Coradeschi to apprehend and subdue criminals, carry and be proficient with a firearm, and investigate criminal activity. Moreover, both positions carried an 1801 occupation code, a fact that seems important in both the TSA Bulletin in effect when Coradeschi was hired and the TSA Directive in effect when he was terminated.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Though the TSA Bulletin and TSA Directive are helpful in defining the TSA's view of what is similar to a FAM, we recognize that these are not dispositive determinations because they are neither factual determinations nor legal interpretations of &#x00A7; 7511.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ and the government place too much emphasis on job description dissimilarities, such as the fact that FAMs enforce criminal laws primarily in the confines of planes while INS agents enforce immigration laws primarily within business establishments and the fact that FAMs undergo specialized training for work onboard aircraft. Furthermore, the AJ noted that FAM incumbents must obtain a top secret security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While these differences are real, they fail to overcome Coradeschi's allegations that the <span class="Italic">skills and fundamental character</span> of both positions were closely related. Both positions required firearm proficiency and the ability to enforce laws and apprehend criminals. Even though Coradeschi was required to undergo specialized FAM training, there is no evidence to suggest the retraining was "extensive" as <span class="Italic">Mathis</span> requires. 865 F.2d at 235. In fact, Coradeschi alleges that less than 15 hours of the training was substantively new training. Furthermore, he alleges that much of the training was waived because of his prior experience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like <span class="Italic">Mathis,</span> the fact that Coradeschi performed the same skills in two different physical locations, i.e., a plane as opposed to a business, does not make his allegations frivolous. Therefore, Coradeschi has made non-frivolous allegations that he is an employee for purposes of &#x00A7; 7511 and is entitled to appeal his action to the MSPB. An evidentiary hearing is now appropriate to determine by preponderance of the evidence whether his position as an INS agent is the same as or similar to his position as a FAM. If by a preponderance of the evidence they are proven similar, the MSPB has jurisdiction to hear the merits of Coradeschi's appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Trainee positions in the Student Career Experience Program (SCEP) were discontinuous in the appeal of an excepted service employee, <span class="Italic">Yeressian v. Dept. of Army</span>, 112 MSPR 21, 26 &#x00B6; 10, 2009 MSPB 123 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the AJ did not need to consider whether the two SCEP positions he held were the "same or similar" in order to determine whether he had 2 years of current continuous service that satisfied the definition of employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). The appellant asserts that the AJ correctly found that he had 2 years of continuous service in the SCEP position he held from October 2005 to April 2008 and he asserts that his more than 2 years of continuous service in that position was sufficient to satisfy the 2 years of current continuous service required to qualify him as an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). The appellant's assertion is without legal merit. Consistent with the Office of Personnel Management's definition of "current continuous employment" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b), the Board has held that the term "current continuous service" means service immediately prior to the action at issue without a break in service of a work day and, further, that the definition applies to both competitive and excepted service positions. <span class="Italic">See McCrary v. Department of the Army</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 266, &#x00B6; 8 (2006). The appellant's 2 years of continuous service in his first SCEP position was not rendered immediately prior to his removal and, thus, his service in that position does not satisfy the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), because it was not "current continuous service." We note that the appellant has not challenged on review the AJ's finding that the two SCEP positions he held were not the "same or similar" so as to allow his service in both SCEP positions to be combined for the purpose of satisfying the required 2 years of current continuous service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Van Skiver v. USPS</span>, 7 MSPR 18, 19-20, 6 MSPB 630 (1981)), focused on analysis of duties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears that the Presiding Official's rather conclusory finding that the positions of mail handler and distribution clerk are not the "same or similar" was based on nothing other than that official's own perceptions of the differences between these positions as reflected in their titles. We would agree that the positions differ to some degree, and under normal circumstances the two jobs are not the "same or similar." However, the salient feature of this case is that there is no evidence in the record that appellant ever performed duties requiring knowledge of a scheme. Knowledge of a scheme is an integral part of the duties of a distribution clerk. Thus, it is apparent that regardless of the title of the job appellant was performing during his various assignments, there was no significant change in the duties allocated to appellant, since the primary distinction between the job of mail handler and that of distribution clerk is knowledge of a scheme. To the contrary, it is evident from an examination of these position descriptions that many duties of a distribution clerk, not requiring knowledge of a scheme, are similar to the duties of a mail handler. These include, for example, facing and canceling mail, typing mail and inserting facing slips, opening and dumping pouches and sacks, and operating cancelling machines. On the other hand, a mail handler may make distribution of parcel post requiring no scheme knowledge. Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that appellant continuously performed in the same or similar positions, since the nature and character of his duties did not change.[1] ....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In general, the Board does not probe behind the position description of record, as that document is taken to be definitely reflecting of the duties performed. However, in the instant case, the Board is concerned with the nature and character of the duties performed making mere reference to the PD's themselves inadequate. Thus, under the unique circumstances of this case, the Board will take cognizance of all factors having bearing upon the totality of circumstances with respect to the duties performed. The Board deems this approach to best serve the interests of justice and equity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Van Skiver v. USPS</span>, 9 MSPR 380, 381 (1982) (again remanding for analysis of duties performed by appellant in positions of mail handler and distribution clerk).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mathis v. USPS,</span> 865 F.2d 232, 232-35 (Fed. Cir. 1988), elaborated on the concept of "same or similar" and, as applied to an employee who was first a special delivery messenger and was then terminated from the position of distribution clerk, directed consideration of whether the "positions...involve related or comparable work that requires the same or similar skills":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7701(a) (1982), an "employee" may appeal an adverse personnel action to the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board). Section 7511(a)(1)(B) of Title 5 of the United States Code includes in the definition <span id="Page_87"></span>of "employee" a Postal Service preference eligible who has "completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions." During the year preceding his termination by the Postal Service, the petitioner had served first as a special delivery messenger and then as a distribution clerk. The Board dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that those jobs were not "similar positions" under section 7511(a)(1)(B). We reverse and remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner, a preference eligible who had been employed by the United States Postal Service for 21 years, was working as a special delivery messenger when, in late 1986, the Postal Service cancelled his Postal Service driver's permit. The effect of this cancellation was to preclude him from working in that capacity. On November 22, 1986, the Postal Service reassigned him to the position of distribution clerk.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service removed the petitioner effective September 4, 1987, based on an altercation with another postal employee. The petitioner filed a timely appeal to the Board. The Board's administrative law judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, and the Board denied review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative law judge held that the petitioner was not an "employee" over whose appeal the Board had jurisdiction because the two jobs that the petitioner held during the one year preceding his removal were not "similar positions" under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7511(a)(1)(B). Looking to the position descriptions for the two jobs, the administrative law judge noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]&#x2003;Special Delivery Messenger...is charged with delivering mail after it has been sorted. A Distribution Clerk works solely within the facility and, as a primary function, separates both incoming and outgoing mail. Incoming is separated by delivery point, e.g., rural route, city route, general delivery.... A Special Delivery Messenger receives mail to be delivered which has already been sorted and designated as special delivery.... [H]is main function is to deliver, not distribute it within the facility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Mathis v. U.S.P.S.,</span> MSPB Initial Decision Docket No. AT07528710822 at 3 (Nov. 30, 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative law judge stated that the positions as thus described entailed "significantly different responsibilities and duties and thus are not interchangeable," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 6, and therefore were not "similar positions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction over the petitioner's appeal turns on whether the two jobs the petitioner held during his last year of employment in the Postal Service--special delivery messenger and distribution clerk--were "similar positions" under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7511(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying upon certain differences in the work the two jobs involved, as specified in the position descriptions, the Board held that the two jobs were not "similar positions." The Board stressed that the "main function" of a special delivery messenger "is to deliver" the mail "after it has been sorted," and not to "distribute it within the facility [the Post Office]," which is the function of a distribution clerk.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that in so ruling the Board interpreted section 7511(a)(1)(B) too narrowly, and that the two positions were "similar."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;The statute does not define "similar positions," but the context in which the phrase appears gives it meaning. Section 7511(a)(1) specifies two categories of individuals who come within the statutory definition of "employee":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;an individual in the competitive service who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment or who has completed 1 year of current continuous employment under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;a preference eligible in an Executive agency in the excepted service, and a preference eligible in the United States Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission, who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reason why Congress required employees in the competitive service to have completed only "one year of current continuous employment" (subparagraph A) but added the qualification in subparagraph B that for preference eligibles that service must have been in the "same or similar positions," is unclear. Taken together, however, these two definitions reflect a congressional intent to limit "employees" who may appeal an adverse action to the Board to those employees who have completed one year of permanent service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of section 7511(a)(1)(B), which neither party discussed, supports this conclusion. The only reference to the phrase "same or similar positions" we have found in the legislative history is the following statement in the Senate Committee Report:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The phrase "one year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions," which defines the extent of coverage of employees in the excepted service, is intended to be the same as that currently used in civil service regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S.&#x2003;Rep. No. 95-969, 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 2723, 2770.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The civil service regulations in effect at the time the statute was enacted did not explain or define "similar positions." The Federal Personnel Manual for 1978, although not a Civil Service regulation, sheds some light on the problem. FPM Supplement 752-1, issued October 11, 1976, subchapter S2, deals with "Employee Coverage" for purposes of adverse actions. Subchapter S2-3(a) states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A preference eligible employee with one year of current continuous service in a position outside the competitive service is covered by subpart B of part 752 [which deals with adverse actions of greater than 30 days duration.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Meaning of "current continuous employment." Current continuous employment in a position outside the competitive service may be either (i) employment in one position without a break of a workday or (ii) employment in more than one position in the same line of work without a break of a workday.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1978 FPM Supplement 752-1 Sec. S2-3(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The requirement that for a preference eligible employee to have completed "one year of current continuous service" the service must have been "in the same line of work" is similar to the requirement in section 7511(a)(1)(B) that the employee's continuous year of service must have been "in the same or similar positions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Claims has interpreted the phrase "same line of work" in determining whether prior service in a different assignment is counted in the one-year probationary period. In <span class="Italic">Horne v. United States,</span> 419 F.2d 416, 190 Ct. Cl. 145 (1969), the court ruled that since the plaintiff's prior jobs in agencies other than the Internal Revenue Service "involved duties of a different nature and character than that of a tax technician position for which he was employed by the Internal Revenue Service...she was properly subject to a one-year probationary period in her new position." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> 419 F.2d at 419. In <span class="Italic">Dargo v. United States,</span> 176 Ct. Cl. 1193 (1966), the court stated that the question is "what the nature of the work plaintiff actually performed [as confidential assistant to the chairman of the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission] was as compared with the work plaintiff was required to perform as a Personnel Assistant." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1203. The Board has held that "for purposes of determining completion of a probationary period, positions are in the same line of work if experience in a position demonstrates the knowledges, skills, and abilities required to perform the work of the other job." <span class="Italic">Shobe v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 5 MSPB 468, 5 M.S.P.R. 466, 471 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the statute, Federal Personnel Manual and these decisions show, the requirement for preference eligibles that the year of service must be in positions that, if not the same, are "similar," indicates that to be an "employee" a preference eligible must occupy positions that involve related or comparable work that requires the same or similar skills.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This conclusion is consistent with Board decisions that for positions to be "similar," "the nature and character of [the employee's] duties" must be the same, and that positions are not "similar" if they involve "two distinctly different lines of work." <span class="Italic">Van Skiver v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 6 MSPB 630, 7 M.S.P.R. 18, 20 (1981) ("the Board finds that appellant continuously performed in the same or similar positions, since the nature and character of his duties did not change") (footnote omitted); <span class="Italic">Wafford v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 34 M.S.P.R. 691, 696 (1987) ("appellant's prior employment as a Distribution Clerk does not satisfy the requirement of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7511(a)(1)(B) to serve one year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions. What is critical to our determination here is the fact that appellant served his last year with the Postal Service in two distinctly different lines of work") (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;We hold that under this standard, the jobs of special delivery messenger and distribution clerk that the petitioner held during the year preceding his removal were "similar positions" under section 7511(a)(1)(B). The duties of each position involved the handling of the mail, and the skills required to perform the work were closely related. Indeed, in 1982 the petitioner had served for three months as a distribution clerk. There is no indication that he was unable to perform the duties of a distribution clerk upon his reassignment to that position in 1986, or that performance of those duties required him to undergo extensive retraining.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board apparently deemed it critical that a special delivery messenger delivered the mail outside the Post Office after it had been sorted, but a distribution clerk worked solely inside the Post Office and separated both incoming and outgoing mail and then distributed it inside the facility. Those differences in the nature of the work performed in the two jobs, however, are not inconsistent with their being "similar positions." In each position the critical fact is that the petitioner handled the mail. The fact that he did that handling in different physical locations and in different steps of the mail distribution process did not alter the fundamental character of the work he did, which was sufficiently closely related in the two jobs to make those positions "similar."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The same or similar analysis was again developed in <span class="Italic">Holloman v. MSPB</span>, 102 Fed. Appx. 688, 690 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_88"></span>Mr. Holloman had the burden of establishing the Board's jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) (2002). As explained above, the AJ dismissed Mr. Holloman's appeal after he found that Mr. Holloman had failed to establish that his previous position as an Amtrak police officer position was "similar" to his position as a federal air marshal for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). On appeal, Mr. Holloman argues that the decision of the Board on this point is not supported by substantial evidence. He therefore urges reversal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have no difficulty concluding that the Board did not err in holding that it lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Holloman's appeal. Two positions are "similar" for purposes of section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) if they "involve related or comparable work that requires the same or similar skills." <span class="Italic">Mathis v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States Postal Serv.,</span> 865 F.2d 232, 234-35 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The Board has explained that the factors to be considered include whether the two positions require the same qualifications, whether they are in the same competitive level for reduction-in-force purposes, or whether interchange between the two is possible without significant training and without unduly interrupting the work program. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Spillers v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 22, 26 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Van Skiver v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 6 MSPB 630, 7 M.S.P.R. 18, 20 (1981), <span class="Italic">aff'd on reconsideration,</span> 9 MSPB 28, 9 M.S.P.R. 380 (1982)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(g) (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board found the testimony of Adam C. Kistler, Acting Deputy Chief of Training for the agency, more persuasive than testimony by Mr. Holloman and his witness. Mr. Kistler testified that although both positions at issue are in the arena of law enforcement, a federal air marshal works in a unique environment, under unique conditions, with substantially different skills. For example, as opposed to the stations, concourses, platforms, and trains upon which an Amtrak police officer works, a federal air marshal works alone, in the sky, and undercover. In contrast with an Amtrak police officer's situation, a federal air marshal uses law enforcement techniques not used elsewhere because of the confined structure and configuration of an airplane, and he faces distinct dangers while on duty in an aircraft. A federal air marshal also receives training that other law enforcement officers do not need, including position-specific training conducted in aircraft and simulators, and special fire training. Moreover, the firearms skill that a federal air marshal must meet is the highest in federal law enforcement, surpassing that of an Amtrak police officer. Furthermore, unlike an Amtrak police officer, a federal air marshal must attain a top secret security clearance. These findings regarding the two positions are supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, because Mr. Holloman's Amtrak police officer position was not "similar" to his federal air marshal position, he was not entitled to appeal his removal to the Board pursuant to section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lopez v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 103 MSPR 55, 60 &#x00B6; 9, 2006 MSPB 234 (2006), compared craft positions under a "same or similar" analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the position description for the WG-05 Pipefitter Helper shows that the incumbent is responsible for the installation, operation, maintenance, and removal of pipe lines, pumping, gas freeing, and washing of marine liquid fuel tanks, water tanks, and the installation and operation of pumping and washing systems. In addition, a Pipefitter Helper must have knowledge and skills in fitting and hose layouts, pressure and temperature limits, control valves, and liquid levels in portable and fixed tanks. The position description for the Sheet Metal Trainee, in contrast, shows that the incumbent "removes, ships, stores, discards, manufactures, lays-out, modifies, repairs, assembles and installs sheetmetal items" and is required to know how to operate the tools of the trade in order to work with Welders to assemble and install sheetmetal items. Clearly, these positions, which are in two wholly different crafts, are not similar.

Given the differences in the appellant's positions, the requisite trial period began on July 13, 2003, when she began working as a Sheet Metal Trainee. Because she was removed less than 2 years later, on April 25, 2005, the appellant does not meet the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii).</p>

OPM's implementing regulations define "similar positions" as "positions in which the duties performed are similar in nature and character and require substantially the same or similar qualifications, so that the incumbent could be interchanged between the positions without significant training or undue interruption to the work." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(g). In addition, positions may be deemed "similar" within the meaning of section 7511(a)(1)(B) when they are in "the same line of work," which has been interpreted as involving related or comparable work that requires the same or similar knowledge, skills, and abilities. <span class="Italic">See Mathis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 232, 234 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The Board has reasoned that positions are in the "same line of work" when the positions require the same qualifications, and the nature of the work would place them in the same competitive level for reduction in force purposes; however, whether the positions are in the same competitive level is not necessarily determinative of whether they are "similar." <span class="Italic">Beets</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6; 11. Positions belong in the same competitive level if they are in the same grade and classification series, and the duties, qualification requirements, pay schedules, and working conditions of the positions are sufficiently similar to allow the appellant to successfully perform the critical elements of the other position upon entry without undue interruption. <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Department of Justice</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 623, &#x00B6; 8 (2003), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds</span>, No. 04-3186 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (NP).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Immigration Inspector (GS-11, Occupational Code 1816) and ATF Inspector (GS-9, Occupational Code 1801) positions are in different grades and classification series, and hence different competitive levels, which tends to show that they are not similar under section 7511(a)(1)(B). <span class="Italic">See Beets</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6; 12. In addition, the ATF Inspector position requires a top secret clearance, but there is nothing to indicate that the Immigration Inspector position had a similar requirement. Further, the Vacancy Announcements for the ATF Inspector positions indicate that selectees will undergo a two-year training program, during which time they are expected to "participate in a formal training program and job assignments to develop competencies appropriate to ATF's mission and needs." The appellant signed a "New Professional Training Successful Completion Requirement Certification," indicating that he understood he had to complete and pass the New Professional Training and Basic Criminal Investigator Training as a condition of continued employment and that his failure to do so would result in his reassignment to a position not requiring such training or his termination from Federal service. The agency presented evidence to show that the appellant attended the Inspector Basic Training Program from October 27 to December 16, 2004.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, a review of the position descriptions shows that the Immigration Inspector and ATF Inspector positions do not involve related or comparable work and do not require similar knowledge and skills. The ATF Inspector position description indicates that the incumbent conducts investigations/inspections to carry out the Federal government's regulatory responsibilities pertaining to the firearms and explosives industries. The duties include, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, reviewing records of firearms and explosives licensees to discover violations of laws and regulations and drafting reports recommending further action, determining whether persons desiring to enter the industries meet legal requirements for obtaining a Federal permit, conducting onsite inspections to ensure proper storage and detect illegal manufacturing, and applying state and Federal alcohol and tobacco statutes in alcohol diversion and cigarette smuggling cases. The ATF Inspector position requires knowledge of Federal laws and regulations administered by ATF, state laws pertaining to firearms and explosives, and basic knowledge of the judicial process and rules of evidence. The work environment involves on-site investigations of manufacturing and storage facilities and firearms dealers and may be conducted outdoors in undesirable conditions, around potentially dangerous objects, and in areas with high crime rates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, the position description for the Immigration Inspector position indicates that the incumbent performs "a full range of inspection, examination, processing, and law enforcement duties regarding persons seeking to enter the United States from foreign locations." Immigration Inspector responsibilities include conducting primary inspections of all applicants for admission to the United States to determine whether they should be detained for secondary screening. The Immigration Inspector interviews, collects fingerprints, and searches people and property for admission to the United States in cases of secondary screening or in connection with administrative and criminal violations of immigration and other laws. The incumbent detains, interviews, and investigates persons in cases of expedited removals and pursues investigation that may result in entry, refusal, removal, criminal prosecution, or detention. The position requires knowledge of Federal immigration, customs, public health, and agriculture laws; the ability to identify high-risk individuals and fraudulent documents; competence in search, seizure, arrest, interrogation, and investigative techniques; knowledge of drug and alien smuggling; report-writing ability; intelligence gathering ability; proficiency with firearms and non-deadly force devices. The work is performed in seaports, airports, and border entry points and involves exposure to hostile individuals or volatile situations. Thus, while the position descriptions do indicate that both positions require investigatory skills, the work is performed in substantively different fields: immigration versus firearms and explosives.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_89"></span>In response to the administrative judge's jurisdictional order, the appellant merely stated that the two positions he held were similar. In response to the agency's submissions, the appellant stated that he qualified for the ATF Inspector position at the GS-9 level because, as outlined in the vacancy announcement, he had one year of specialized experience that was in or related to the work of the ATF Inspector position. He further asserted that, although ATF Inspectors must complete 12 months of on-the-job training, his supervisors allowed him to complete solo inspections after only six months because of his "specialized, similar background" and the fact that he was a "distinguished graduate" of the ATF Academy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not dispute the transcript showing that the Inspector Basic Training Program was approximately seven weeks in length. He did not allege that his actual duties were different from those set forth in the position descriptions. Thus, this evidence is undisputed. While the appellant maintained that he had specialized experience in or related to the work of the ATF Inspector position, that he was a distinguished graduate of the training course, and that he was able to perform solo inspections sooner than other newly-hired ATF Inspectors, his allegations, if proven, would not show that the duties of the positions are similar in nature and character and require substantially the same or similar qualifications or that the appellant undertook the duties of the ATF Inspector position "without significant training or undue interruption to the work." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(g). We therefore conclude that the appellant failed to satisfy the jurisdictional criteria under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). <span class="Italic">See Beets</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-14.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit decided that the positions of immigration inspector and inspector with BATF were dissimilar, <span class="Italic">Amend v. MSPB</span>, 221 Fed. Appx. 983, 985-86 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Amend argues that when he was hired for the ATF position, which was three grade levels lower than the Immigration Inspector position, "ATF effectively eliminated any doubt as to whether or not the petitioner's prior experience as an Immigration Inspector was 'similar.'" We disagree. This court has explained that in "the same or similar positions" is akin to "in the same line of work." <span class="Italic">Mathis v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 865 F.2d 232, 234 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In other words, the positions must "involve related or comparable work that requires the same or similar skills." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Moreover, the implementing regulations define "similar positions" to mean "positions in which the duties performed are similar in nature and character and require substantially the same or similar qualifications, so that the incumbent could be interchanged between the positions without significant training or undue interruption to the work." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(g). We see no error in the Board's determination that the two positions are not the "same or similar."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the two positions require different qualifications. ATF Inspectors are expected to have knowledge of federal, state, and local alcohol, tobacco, firearm, and explosive laws and regulations. Immigration Inspectors are required to understand "U.S. immigration, customs, public health, and agriculture laws, regulations, and related precedent decisions and court injunctions." To become an ATF Inspector, applicants must complete a seven week training course. In addition to the seven week training course, once accepted as an ATF Inspector, the first two years of employment are considered an "internship" before the employee "may be non-competitively converted to a career or career-conditional position." During these two years, employees must engage in "various training and developmental programs." Moreover, the ATF position requires top secret clearance, which is not apparently required for Immigration Inspectors. Although not dispositive, the positions were also listed at different pay grades and classifications. The ATF Inspector was GS-9, Classification 1854, and the Immigration Inspector was GS-11, Classification 1816. <span class="Italic">See Coradeschi v. Dep't Homeland Sec.,</span> 439 F.3d 1329, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the actual work performed by an ATF Inspector is not similar to that performed by an Immigration Inspector. According to the official job description, the primary task of an ATF Inspector is to determine whether people "desiring to enter business in the regulated industries [of alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and explosives] meet established legal requirements for obtaining a federal permit or license." To complete the duties, an ATF Inspector must interview people, inspect buildings, and conduct background investigations. The work environment of an ATF Inspector includes onsite investigations of explosive manufacturers, explosive storage magazines, and firearms dealers. In contrast, an Immigration Inspector "[c]onducts primary inspection or examination of all classes of applicants for admission to the United States." This includes inspecting and examining arriving persons, baggage, and merchandise for the United States Customs Service. Immigration Inspectors primarily work at seaports, airports, and land border entry points.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Amend relies on <span class="Italic">McCormick,</span> 307 F.3d 1339, in support of his position. However, <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> only involved &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A), whereas this case involves &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). (emphasis added). As &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) does not contain the "same or similar position" language, <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> does not apply here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we agree with the Board that the ATF Inspector and Immigration Inspector positions are not "the same or similar" under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), and therefore Amend was not an "employee" when his position was terminated.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining question is whether the Postal Service Clerk and Veterans Service Representative positions are the "same or similar" for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). The regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II, define "similar positions" as "positions in which the duties performed are similar in nature and character and require substantially the same or similar qualifications, so that the incumbent could be interchanged between the positions without significant training or undue interruption to the work." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402. In addition, positions may be deemed "similar" if they are in the "same line of work," which has been interpreted as involving "related or comparable work that requires the same or similar skills." <span class="Italic">Mathis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 232, 234 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The Board has interpreted such language to mean that positions are similar "if experience in [one] position demonstrates the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform the work of the other job." <span class="Italic">Coradeschi v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 439 F.3d 1329, 1333 (Fed.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 22, 26 (1994). In conducting this analysis, the Board must consider the nature of the work actually performed. <span class="Italic">Davis v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of his claim that the positions are similar, the appellant submitted the following list of "job tasks" for the Postal Service Clerk position: answering questions regarding mail regulations and procedures, postal rates and post office boxes; checking mail in order to insure correct postages and that packages and letters are in proper condition for mailing; completing forms regarding change of address, or theft or loss of mail, or for special services such as registered or priority mail; feeding mail into postage canceling devices or hand stamping mail to cancel postage; keeping money orders in order, and recording and balancing daily transactions; obtaining signatures from recipients of registered or special delivery mail; providing customers with assistance in filing claims for mail theft, or lost or damaged mail; gathering evidence to support customer claims for damaged insured mail; processing customer claims for refunds for overnight mail not making the committed time; putting undelivered parcels away, retrieving them when customers come to claim them, and completing any related documentation; receiving letters and parcels, and placing mail into bags; registering, certifying, and insuring letters and parcels; renting post office boxes to customers; responding to complaints regarding mail theft, delivery problems, and lost or damaged mail, and filling out forms and making appropriate referrals for investigation; selling and collecting payment for products such as stamps, prepaid mail envelopes, and money orders; setting postage meters, and calibrating them to ensure correct operation, sorting incoming and outgoing mail, according to type and destination, by hand or by operating electronic mail-sorting and scanning devices; transporting mail from one workstation to another; weighing letters and parcels, computing mailing costs based on type, weight, and destination, and affixing correct postage; cashing money orders; posting announcements or government information on public bulletin boards; and providing assistance to the public in complying with federal regulations of the Postal Service and other federal agencies. The appellant also submitted the following job description for the Veterans Service Representative position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Within a team environment, the Veterans Service Representative (VSR) functions as (1) a counselor or advocate for VA claimants providing information about a broad range of benefits and assisting with applications for VA benefits and services, (2) a legal technician gathering requisite evidence from medical, military, community, and other sources to support benefit determinations, (3) a decision maker weighing the evidence and applying the controlling laws and regulations, and (4) a computer systems user who enters <span id="Page_90"></span>appropriate data to generate accurate benefit payments, control pending issues or schedule future actions, and release complete, correct notifications of benefits determinations. The VSR must not only be competent in the interpretation and application of laws and procedures, but must be well-versed in medical principles and terminology and public relations skills.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not alleged that his actual duties differed from the job descriptions he provided.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that the positions are similar in that both involve customer service and claims processing. Nevertheless, it is evident from the job descriptions that processing veterans benefit claims requires specialized knowledge, both legal and medical, not required for processing claims concerning insured mail and late overnight delivery. Furthermore, although the fact is not dispositive, the Postal Service Clerk and Veterans Service Representative positions do not share the same classification. <span class="Italic">See Amend v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 221 Fed. Appx. 983, 985 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">cf. Coradeschi</span>, 439 F.3d at 1334. Finally, the appellant has not shown that the positions require the same or similar qualifications. The job description for the Veterans Service Representative position indicates that qualified applicants must have 1 year of specialized experience gained in such ways as: (a) a claims decision-making position in a federal or State agency, or in an insurance company, employee compensation board, or retirement and death compensation program; or (b) experience in Government or private industry in a disability retirement or disability pension program. Nothing in the appellant's evidence suggests that the Postal Service Clerk position had similar experience requirements. In sum, we find that the appellant has not shown by preponderant evidence that the positions are similar for purposes of establishing appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An attorney's position in the Social Security Administration was not similar to a trademark lawyer, <span class="Italic">Clarke v. Dept. of Commerce,</span> DC-0752-14-0490-I-1 (NP 2/27/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II, define "similar positions" as "positions in which the duties performed are similar in nature and character and require substantially the same or similar qualifications, so that the incumbent could be interchanged between the positions without significant training or undue interruption to the work." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 232, 234 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have interpreted such language to mean that positions are similar "if experience in [one] position demonstrates the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform the work of the other job." <span class="Italic">Coradeschi v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 439 F.3d 1329, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (quoting <span class="Italic">Shobe v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues, as she did below, that she demonstrated that her experience in the Attorney-Advisor (General) position provided her with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform the duties of the Attorney-Advisor (Trademark) position. We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not provide copies of the position descriptions for the Attorney-Advisor (General) and Attorney-Advisor (Trademark) positions, although the administrative judge encouraged her to do so. However, she alleged that the "primary responsibility" of an Attorney-Advisor (Trademark) is to process and examine applications for federal trademark protection under the Lanham Act. The vacancy announcement for the Attorney-Advisor (Trademark) position, which the appellant submitted below, indicated that one of the qualifications for the position was "[k]nowledge of legal principles, especially intellectual property law (specifically trademarks and the federal trademark registration process)." The agency provided the appellant's performance appraisal plan, which indicated that she was responsible for examining trademark applications to determine whether registration was appropriate, ensuring that applications were approved for publication or registration in accordance with the Lanham Act, and conducting searches to identify marks that, when used in connection with goods and services closely related to those of the applicant, were likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception. The appellant did not dispute that her performance appraisal plan accurately represented her duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the appellant alleged that the "primary responsibility" of an Attorney-Advisor (General) with the Social Security Administration is to process appeals of administrative law judge decisions on disability claims arising under Title II and Title XVI of the Social Security Disability Act. The appellant did not allege that her position with the Social Security Administration involved any training or experience in trademark examination or intellectual property law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that the two positions were similar in the broad sense that they both were legal positions requiring her to interpret and apply federal statutes, draft final agency decisions, communicate with applicants/claimants, and meet production goals. However, even positions requiring some similar skills may be dissimilar where, as here, the work is performed in substantively different fields. <span class="Italic">See Amend v. Department of Justice</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 12 (2006) (finding that two inspector positions were dissimilar when one was in the field of firearms and explosives and the other was in the field of immigration), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 221 F. App'x 983 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Based upon the undisputed evidence and allegations in the record, the fundamental nature of the Attorney-Advisor (Trademark) position required specialized knowledge, skills, and experience in trademark and intellectual property law that were not required in the appellant's previous position processing appeals of disability claims.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Moreover, the appellant held a higher grade (GS-12) in the Attorney-Advisor (General) position than in the Attorney-Advisor (Trademark) position (GS-11). Although a difference in grade alone is not dispositive of the issue, it tends to indicate that two positions are not similar. <span class="Italic">Amend</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 8 (considering the appellant's different grades as evidence that two positions were not the same or similar); <span class="Italic">cf. Enocencio v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 130, &#x00B6; 6 (1998) (a difference in grade level, standing alone, does not render two positions dissimilar).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge properly considered the appellant's training upon appointment to the Attorney-Advisor (Trademark) position as evidence that her positions were not the same or similar.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that the administrative judge applied an incorrect legal standard in requiring her to establish that she could have assumed her duties as an Attorney-Advisor (Trademark) without completing a 7-week training on the Lanham Act. (The appellant's argument below that significant training was not required for the Attorney-Advisor (Trademark) position). The administrative judge found that the training indicated that the appellant's position with the Social Security Administration did not provide her with the knowledge necessary to perform her duties with the agency. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency provided evidence that the appellant was required to attend a 7-week training that taught attorneys how to "examine a trademark application, including how to search existing trademarks for the same or similar marks," and "instruct[ed] attorneys in Federal trademark law, rules, and procedures." The appellant did not dispute the agency's description of the training, nor did she allege that the experience that she acquired as an Attorney-Advisor (General) with the Social Security Administration rendered her capable of assuming the duties of her new position without completing the training.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-established that an administrative judge may properly consider training requirements at the beginning of an appointment when evaluating whether two positions are the same or similar. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402 (defining similar positions are those in which an incumbent could be interchanged without "significant training or undue interruption of work"); <span class="Italic">see Amend</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 12 (the fact that one of the positions required an extensive training program supported a finding that two positions were not the same or similar)<span class="Italic">; cf. Coradeschi</span>, 439 F.3d at 1334 (an appellant nonfrivolously alleged that two positions were the same or similar where there was no evidence that the specialized training for his new position was extensive, and he alleged that less than 15 hours of the training was substantively new training and that the agency waived much of the training due to his experience in his prior position). Here, we find that the administrative judge correctly considered the 7-week training, in conjunction with the other factors discussed in the initial decision, in determining that the appellant's positions were not the same or similar.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that the administrative judge failed to consider the fact that the agency required the same training for all entry-level trademark attorneys, regardless of whether they had previous trademark law experience. The appellant is incorrect. In the initial decision, the administrative judge specifically acknowledged that the training was required for all new trademark attorneys with the agency. However, she also correctly concluded that the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that her experience with the Social Security Administration provided her with the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform her duties in the Attorney-Advisor (Trademark) position without completing the training.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Knowledge and experience that the appellant acquired through law school and private sector employment are not relevant to whether the Attorney-Advisor (General) and Attorney-Advisor (Trademark) positions are the same or similar.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues that the administrative judge erroneously stated that she offered no evidence or argument that she had knowledge or experience in patent or trademark law prior to beginning her employment with the agency. Although the appellant is correct that <span id="Page_91"></span>the administrative judge made this erroneous statement, it is of no legal consequence because the appellant has not demonstrated that it was prejudicial to her substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See also Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984). The appellant alleged that she had previous experience in trademark and intellectual property law through prior private sector employment during and after law school and that she took an intellectual property class as a law student, not that she had prior experience in trademark and intellectual property law through her position with the Social Security Administration. The relevant issue is not whether the qualifications that the appellant acquired throughout her career allowed her to easily transition to the Attorney-Advisor (Trademark) position but rather whether her position with the agency was the same as or similar to her prior position with the Social Security Administration. <span class="Italic">See McDonald v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 148, 153 (1989) (finding that an appellant's personal ability to perform either of two positions was not relevant to whether the positions were similar). Experience that the appellant acquired through other employment is not pertinent to this inquiry.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Enocencio v. VA</span>, 79 MSPR 130, 133-34 &#x00B6; 5-6 (1998), noted that grade distinctions did not disprove the similarity of positions in an excepted service VRA appointee's appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge found that the appellant's prior service did not constitute service in the same or similar positions because the two positions were not at the same grade level. We find that the administrative judge erred in her analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Positions are "similar" within the meaning of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) when they involve related or comparable work that requires the same or similar skills<span class="Italic">.

Relevant evidence consists of position descriptions and testimonial evidence as to the duties that the appellant performs. In <span class="Italic">Gettings</span>, the issue was whether a GS-7 Construction Inspector position was similar to a GS-9 Service Contract Monitor position. Based on the appellant's unrebutted testimony that he performed the same duties in both positions, the Board found that they were similar within the meaning of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Spillers</span>, the issue was whether an EAS-15 Postmaster position was similar to an EAS-16 Supervisor, Customer Services, position. The Board found that it could not determine that issue based on the record before it and returned the appeal to the administrative judge for further adjudication, including a hearing at which the parties could present evidence of the actual duties of the two positions in question. Thus, the difference in grade levels alone was not sufficient to make the two positions dissimilar.</p>

Effective May 25, 2004, he was terminated from his FAM position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has argued that the two positions are "similar" within the meaning of subsection (C)(ii) because they are both "law enforcement positions" with the "same or similar purposes and...the same or similar core duties" involving national security. OPM's implementing regulations define "similar positions" as "positions in which the <span class="Italic">duties</span> performed are similar in nature and character <span class="Italic">and</span> require substantially the same or similar <span class="Italic">qualifications</span>, so that the incumbent could be interchanged between the positions without significant training or undue interruption to the work." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(g) (emphases added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, positions may be deemed "similar" within the meaning of section 7511(a)(1) when they are in "the same line of work," which has been interpreted as involving related or comparable work that requires the same or similar knowledge, skills, and abilities. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mathis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 232, 234 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The Board has defined "same line of work" to mean "work that is so similar that the positions require the same qualifications, and the nature of the work would place them in the same <span class="Italic">competitive level</span> for reduction in force purposes." <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Department of Justice</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 623 &#x00B6; 8 (2003) (emphasis added). "Positions belong in the same competitive level, if they are in the same grade and classification series, and are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay schedules, and working conditions so that the incumbent of one could successfully perform the critical elements of the other position upon entry into it, without undue interruption." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We stress, though, that "the competitive level for reduction in force purposes is but one factor in determining whether two positions are in the same line of work." <span class="Italic">Aizin v. Department of Defense</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 146, 150 (1991). In fact, the Board has stated that "the difference in grade levels [which would warrant placing the positions in different competitive levels] alone [i]s not sufficient to make the two positions dissimilar" for purposes of section 7511(a)(1). <span class="Italic">Enocencio v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 130 &#x00B6; 6 (1998); <span class="Italic">see Spillers,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. at 26, 28 (in a case involving positions in different grade levels, the Board remanded the case for a determination of whether the positions are "similar" enough to permit tacking under section 7511(a)(1), thereby finding in effect that a difference in grade levels does not, by itself, preclude a finding that the positions are not "similar"). Thus, whether the positions are in the same competitive level is not necessarily determinative of whether they are "similar" under section 7511(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the BPA (GS-9, Occupational Code 1896) and FAM (FV/SV-G, Occupational Code 1801) positions are in different grades and different classification series, and thus would be placed in different competitive levels. As noted above, that the positions would be placed in different competitive levels may not be sufficient, by itself, to preclude a finding that the positions are "similar" under section 7511(a)(1). However, the fact that the positions are not only in different grades but also in different classification series <span class="Italic">tends</span> to show that they are not "similar" under section 7511(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See Ramos</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 623 &#x00B6; 8<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the undisputed evidence of record shows that the two positions require significantly different qualifications, as follows: FAMs must complete Advanced Federal Air Marshal Training, which BPAs need not complete, and FAMs must have a Top Secret clearance, which BPAs need not have. As the appellant was notified in the agency's written offer of the FAM position, which he accepted and signed, the stringent qualification requirements of the FAM position are mandatory. The FAM position requires "a background investigation, drug test, Federal Law Enforcement Training, Advanced Federal Air Marshal Training and any pending medical evaluations," and mandates that an incumbent's "[f]ailure to successfully complete the[se] ...requirements...or to obtain a Top Secret Clearance, <span class="Italic">will</span> result in termination of employment as a Federal Air Marshal." (emphasis added). Moreover, "[a]ny subsequent placement in another position is not guaranteed and employment with the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] can be terminated."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of these significant differences between the BPA and FAM positions, we find that they are not sufficiently "similar" to permit tacking under section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). We therefore find that the appellant failed to satisfy the jurisdictional criteria for an "employee" under section 7511(a)(1), and we DISMISS this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Training may be a factor that makes positions dissimilar, <span class="Italic">Lopez v. VA,</span> AT-0752-11-0541-I-1 (NP 3/22/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The position description for the Budget and Financial Technician, GS-0503 series provides that the incumbent is responsible for ensuring all billable cases are appropriately identified, forwarded to coding, and billed accurately and promptly in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The appellant testified that on a typical day as a Budget and Financial Technician, GS-0503-05, he was assigned to perform either medical or pharmacy billing, to gather the vouchers, and to go through the coding and billing process. The appellant testified that the Budget and Financial Technician position involves primarily coding and data entry.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, as an Accounting Technician, GS-0525, the appellant was responsible for reviewing invoices, matching the invoices against procurement documents, and resolving discrepancies. The Accounting Technician is responsible for processing payments by entering data into the accounting system and periodically analyzing and reconciling account payables. When the appellant was selected for the Accounting Technician position, he was required to attend Financial Management System (FMS) computer training for at least 1 week in Madison, Wisconsin. It is also undisputed that during the first 6 weeks in the position of Accounting Technician, the appellant was provided with on-the-job training by subject-matter experts and time to learn the CPAC Revenue Accounting Guidebook, which he had not used in his previous position. HCD (testimony of Accounting Manager Jeanette Greene). The appellant testified that he had not used the FMS software system to process vouchers as a Budget and Financial Technician at the VAMC. Further, it is undisputed that the Accounting Technician was not responsible for "billing," but was instead responsible for processing financial transactions such as processing refund payments directly to insurance companies and veterans. HCD (testimony of Greene). Accounting Technicians also classify accounting transactions and reconcile transactions. The position necessarily requires knowledge of accounting procedures and general ledger accounts. Further, it is undisputed that as an Accounting Technician, the appellant performed collateral duties including processing transit benefits and processing travel orders and vouchers. HCD (testimony of Greene).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear that the training required for the Accounting Technician position at CPAC was extensive and varied from the training requirements of the Budget and Financial Technician at the VAMC. <span class="Italic">See Amend v. Department <span id="Page_92"></span>of Justice</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 12 (2006) (considering the fact that one of the positions required an extensive training program and finding that the positions at issue were not "the same or similar"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 221 F. App'x 983 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Indeed, it is undisputed that the appellant did not use the FMS software or the CPAC Revenue Accounting Guidebook to perform in his previous position as a Budget and Financial Technician, and he received considerable formal and on-the-job training in these areas. <span class="Italic">Cf. Coradeschi</span>, 439 F.3d at 1334 (the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that required retraining for new position was not extensive because the appellant alleged that less than 15 hours of the training was substantively new training and that much of the specialized training requirements were waived because of his experience in his prior position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the undisputed documents and testimonies in the record, the Accounting Technician position requires specialized knowledge in accounting techniques and reconciling accounts payable, which was not required in the appellant's previous position. <span class="Italic">See Maibaum</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 234, &#x00B6; 17; <span class="Italic">Amend</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 10. Moreover, the positions are in different grades and classification series and, although the differing classification in itself is not dispositive, it tends to demonstrate that the positions are not similar. <span class="Italic">See Amend</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Beets</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">see also Coradeschi</span>, 439 F.3d at 1334.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the above reasons, the positions are not the same or similar so as to satisfy the definition of an "employee" in the excepted service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(i).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Positions may be the same or similar in different series, although that was not the situation in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Corp. for National &#x0026; Community Service</span>, DA-1221-13-0040-W-1 (NP 5/22/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, rather than reaching a generalized conclusion based solely on statutory differences between SES and excepted service positions, the administrative judge should have specifically compared the Senior Advisor and State Program Director positions. <span class="Italic">See Amend v. Department of Justice</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 7 (2006) (whether positions are in the same competitive level, although relevant, is not necessarily determinative of whether they are similar), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Amend v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 221 F. App'x 983 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">cf. Beets v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2005) (Board indicating that it was "unaware of any clear legal support" for the proposition that a position in the competitive service cannot be similar to a position in the excepted service for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii)). Notwithstanding, because the parties addressed this issue extensively in numerous pleadings, we find it unnecessary to remand this appeal for further analysis or a hearing and will modify the initial decision by performing a more detailed analysis of this issue. <span class="Italic">See Amend</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 6 (Although the administrative judge did not address the issue of whether the two positions were the same or similar, and the appellant requested a hearing, we need not remand this appeal because the parties submitted evidence and argument on this issue below, and the undisputed evidence of record is sufficient to resolve it.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that positions are in different grades and classification series tends to show that they are not similar under section 7511(a)(1). <span class="Italic">Beets</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6; 12. Even where two positions are in the same series, they may not be similar if "one of the positions requires specialized knowledge, skill and ability which characterize a specialized line of work which is typically different from that required to perform the other position." <span class="Italic">Shobe v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 466, 471-72 (1981). Further, positions requiring similar skills may be dissimilar if the work is performed in substantively different fields. <span class="Italic">Amend</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The State Program Director position is of a lower equivalent grade than the Senior Advisor position; SES positions are "classified above GS-15," whereas the NY-04 State Program Director position is equivalent to a GS-14/15. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3132(a)(2). Also, the State Program Director position is in Occupational Series 0301 (Miscellaneous Administration and Program Series), whereas the Senior Advisor position is in Occupational Series 0685 (Public Health Program Specialist Series). Positions in the 0685 Series "require specialized knowledge of the principles, practices, methods, and techniques of administering public health programs." Office of Personnel Management's Handbook of Occupational Groups and Families at 65 (May 2009). The 0301 Series covers positions relating to "administrative or program work for which no other series is appropriate" and does not require specialized public health knowledge. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 35. Indeed, the State Program Director vacancy announcement does not indicate that the position requires specialized knowledge regarding administering public health programs. Moreover, the appellant's statement that her SES position required more training and more supervisory responsibility than the position of State Program Director contradicts her argument that the positions are the same or similar. <span class="Italic">See McDonald</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 153 (finding that the appellant's statement that the position he held at the time of his removal was lower-rated and required less job knowledge than a previous position "counter[ed] his own argument" that the two positions were similar).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the appellant failed to provide a copy of the position description for the Senior Advisor position but instead submitted a declaration under penalty of perjury, wherein she enumerated her accomplishments during her 8 years at SAMHSA, including her positions as CSAP Director and Senior Advisor to the Administrator, as well as her service on several committees. In essence, she argued that, because her extensive experience at SAMHSA made her qualified for the State Program Director position, and she therefore required no training when she began working as State Program Director, she satisfied the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, the relevant question is not whether the skills and qualifications the appellant has acquired throughout her career allowed her to easily transition from one position to another but, rather, whether the position of State Program Director is the same as or similar to her former position as Senior Advisor to the Administrator. <span class="Italic">See McDonald</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 153 (the appellant's "personal ability to perform...is irrelevant to the proper classification of the positions").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the appellant has not nonfrivolously alleged that she meets the definition of an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) because she has failed to show that the State Program Director and Senior Advisor positions are the same or similar.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The requirement of current continuous service in the same or similar position may produce some odd results, likely unintended by the legislative drafters, one being the potential for lack of jurisdiction over the termination of an individual who was promoted or assigned to a supervisory position for less than a year but whose prior service included years of nonsupervisory work. A strict interpretation of a year of current continuous service was implied by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Dequarto v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3076), affirming a Board decision denying jurisdiction over an appeal by a postal service supervisor from a demotion, divesting the Board of jurisdiction over a recently promoted long-term postal employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time of his demotion from his supervisory position in February 1994, Dequarto had held that position for the previous six months. Although before his first demotion he had occupied a supervisory position for more than five years, his tenure in a supervisory position was interrupted by an intervening period of service in a non-supervisory position. Although he had accumulated more than a year of continuous service in a supervisory position, his period of one year of continuous service in that position was not "current." He therefore failed to satisfy the plain terms of the jurisdictional statute applicable to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dequarto argues that because he had completed a probationary period as a supervisory employee before being downgraded to a nonsupervisory position in May 1993, he should be regarded as an "employee" for purposes of Merit Systems Protection Board jurisdiction, even though he had less than a year of current continuous service in the supervisory position to which he was promoted in August 1993. Under section 7511(a)(1)(B), however, the Board may not assert jurisdiction on the basis of prior periods of service; instead, Board jurisdiction is established only if the employee has at least a year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions. Although Dequarto invokes 5 CFR 315.906, an Office of Personnel Management regulation governing the award of credits for prior service against a probationary period, that regulation has nothing to do with the statutory requirement of a year of current continuous service that is a prerequisite for invoking the jurisdiction of the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>

USPS</span>, 83 MSPR 571, 576-79 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-19 (1999) (under the concept of "current continuous service," a promotion into a job not the same or similar to the one last held requires completion of a new trial period); <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 34 MSPR 687, 690 (1987) (Board lacked jurisdiction over an appeal from the demotion of a long-term postal employee whose position at time of appeal was less than one year and whose prior position involved dissimilar duties; White's experience as an acting supervisor, gained during details prior to his promotion, could not be credited toward completion of one year of service as a supervisor of mails).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But <span class="Italic">Bates v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 538, 538-39 &#x0026; n.* (1985), appeared to hold that an appeal right accrued to an excepted service preference eligible appointee who was first hired and served for more than a year as a distribution clerk and was then terminated within a year of his promotion to the supervisory position of superintendent of window services. <span class="Italic">Bates</span> cited <span class="Italic">Born v.

However, neither <span class="Italic">Born</span> nor <span class="Italic">Metz</span> appear to have anything to do with the result reached by the Board in <span class="Italic">Bates</span>.</p>
