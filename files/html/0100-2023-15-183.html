<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-182"><span class="space">c.</span> Threat Through Another; Rumor</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Metz v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 780 F.2d 1001, 1003 (Fed. Cir. 1986), rumors, or fear based on rumors, cannot suffice to prove that an employee threatened anyone. Although the Federal Circuit cautioned against reliance on rumors, threats that concerned one supervisor and were uttered to another individual, who then repeated what he heard to the supervisor, supported dismissal, <span class="Italic">Murphy v. DHHS</span>, 34 MSPR 534, 537-38 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant points out that Mr. Johnson stated that he did not take the comment about burning the house down seriously, the administrative judge cited testimony by Mr. Johnson that he was "kind of concerned" and thought the appellant's statements were a "threat in a way." More importantly and regardless of whether Mrs. Watson heard the appellant's statement, her reactions after Mr. Johnson reported it to her indicated that she considered it to be a threat...she took the remarks seriously, she was upset because she lives in an old building with no fire escape, the appellant had previously mentioned burning someone's house and she had reported the statement to the police, and she had asked to be moved from the appellant's module.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that she did not intend to threaten Mrs. Watson....&#8197;That the appellant did not intend to carry out her threat does not establish that she did not intend to threaten Mrs. Watson. The appellant contends that the threat was conditional. The administrative judge correctly found, however, that the evidence showed that the appellant stated she "would or could burn the house."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant asserts that the statement should not be considered a threat because of the attendant circumstances: her anger at the proposed suspension and her mental illness which heightened the anger. We do not find that the appellant's anger or mental problems are sufficient to show that the statement was not a threat. It goes without saying that most people are angry when they make threats. That the appellant was upset at receiving a notice of proposed disciplinary action does not excuse an explicit reference to burning her supervisor's home. Moreover, the appellant received the proposed suspension notice two days before she made the statement. Therefore, it cannot be excused as a spontaneous thoughtless reaction to the notice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Applying <span class="Italic">Murphy</span>, the Board again considered a threat made to someone other than the object of the threat in <span class="Italic">Battle v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 63 MSPR 403, 406-08 (1994). Appellant, a maintenance mechanic, told a coworker that he "had a hot piece of lead" for his immediate and second-level supervisors and that he would treat them "just the way they did the 'Gooks' in Vietnam." Removal was sustained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Metz v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 780 F.2d 1001, 1004 (Fed. Cir. 1986), the court held that, in deciding whether statements constitute threats, the Board is to apply the reasonable person criterion, considering the listener's reactions and apprehensions, the wording of the statements, the speaker's intent, and the attendant circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the only listener was the appellant's co-worker, Ralph Davis, who, on the day after the appellant made the statements, reported them to the Family Program Coordinator, who in turn saw to it that the appellant's supervisors were informed regarding them through the chain of command. In his testimony, Davis stated that he told the Family Program Coordinator because he "was concerned about [his] welfare and [the appellant's] welfare and others['] welfare," and "[b]ecause I didn't know how to take it." Although Davis testified that he did not feel that the appellant would hurt him, he was not the object of the appellant's threatening language. Davis testified that the appellant was angry when he uttered the threatening language and that he believed that the appellant was frustrated by the way that his supervisors were treating him. Davis's testimony makes it clear that the appellant's statement was directed at his first and second level supervisors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's supervisors did not hear the threats, their reactions are a consideration under <span class="Italic">Metz. See Sims v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense</span>, 58 MSPR 131, 136 (1993); <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 34 MSPR 534, 537 (1987). When Fulton Dayton, the appellant's first-line supervisor was made aware of the appellant's threatening remarks, he stated that "[i]t scared [him] to death." He also stated that "[i]t's affected me mentally, stress-wise...." When Roger Olson, the appellant's second-line supervisor, heard of the appellant's March 10 remarks, he was concerned for himself, his family, and other people in the building. He altered his driving route to work and wore a bullet proof vest for a time. He also had trouble sleeping and concentrating. Barbara Bailey, Olson's supervisor, testified that she observed that Olson was "about ready to break down" because he was so upset "about the situation" when he heard about the appellant's threats.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other agency officials took the appellant's threatening language seriously, too. The Chief of Administrative Services, Captain James Ingham, took steps to assure the accuracy of the facts regarding the threat. He also decided, based on the threat, to secure the building by closing doors that had previously remained open and by changing the locks on the doors. Additionally, he hired a security service to provide at the entrance a guard who knew the appellant's identity and was to stop him if he tried to enter the building. When Captain Ingham reported his actions to higher management, they approved. Higher management also sought a restraining order against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The words used by the appellant are not in dispute. Those words are unsettling, <span class="Italic">per se</span>. They are unconditional and strongly suggest that Dayton and Olson would suffer bodily harm at the appellant's hands. Further, the attendant circumstances show that the appellant had a history of making threats in fits of temper. In August of 1992, he told Dayton that he would do violence to Olson, apparently with a gun. The agency did not initiate an adverse action against the appellant based on the August 1992 incident, but it took the appellant's threat seriously. <span id="Page_2686"></span>Immediately, agency officials placed the appellant on administrative leave out of concern for the safety of the employees, and referred him for psychiatric counseling. The appellant was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, i.e., manic depression, and was prescribed medication, lithium carbonate, to control his disease. The appellant was returned to work in October of 1992, based on the evaluation of his psychiatrist that he was fit to return and that the lithium would stabilize him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's mental condition is also an attendant circumstance<span class="Italic">. See Murphy</span> at 538. We do not find, however, that the appellant's mental problems are sufficient to show that his statement was merely an outgrowth of his disease, and not a threat of physical harm. Dr. Peter True, an expert witness for the agency, testified regarding manic depression. Dr. True characterized the appellant's March 10 behavior as a manic depressive incident. He stated that rash statements are often a symptom of the appellant's disease. He indicated also that violence is another manifestation of the disease, but that manic depressives usually follow the same pattern. Thus, he opined that, if a manic depressive's outrageous statements were not accompanied by violence in the past, they will not be in the future, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency introduced evidence to show that the appellant had been violent in the past. Based on the appellant's supervisor's testimony about an incident during which the appellant had apparently put a gun to his son's head, agency counsel cross examined the appellant in this regard. The appellant admitted that police had come to his home prior to August 1992. Also, after the March 10 incident, agency officials assured themselves that the appellant had in fact held a gun to his son's head. The appellant therefore had expressed himself violently in the past, and the agency's fear that the appellant's more recent threatening words would be accompanied by violence appears warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the reactions of Davis, Dayton, and Olson, the unconditionally threatening nature of the appellant's words, and on the attendant circumstances, including the appellant's past threatening language and violent actions, we find that the agency proved that the appellant's March 10 statement constituted a threat. Accordingly, we sustain the agency's charge that the appellant threatened physical harm to two supervisors.</p>

Dept. of Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 177, 182 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Specifically, although he does not dispute that the incidents underlying this appeal resulted in anxiety and disruption in the workplace, the appellant alleges that the anxiety and disruption was attributable to the actions of agency management, not to any action of his. He asserts that Carl Stokes, his first-line supervisor, held a meeting in which he told the appellant's co-workers that the appellant had knowledge of bombs and had threatened to blow up the building. He further avers that Stokes's alleged embellishment of statements attributed to the appellant by Whelchel, the agency's immediate expulsion of the appellant from the base, the changing of the locks and instigation of hallway patrols to keep a look-out for the appellant, coupled with a more vigilant attitude about violence in the workplace due to a violence in the workplace committee, and reports about a postal worker who shot some co-workers on postal premises that appeared in the news several days after March 8, all caused the anxiety and disruption in the workplace, not the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]f it is true that Stokes embellished Whelchel's report of the appellant's alleged statements, then it is necessary to determine whether the anxiety and disruption in the workplace was caused by the appellant's statements, as the agency charged, or something else. Therefore, this issue is material to the outcome of this appeal, and the administrative judge erred by not addressing it. <span class="Italic">See Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 2 MSPB 2, 1 MSPR 587, 589 (1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, removal was sustained, <span class="Italic">McCarty v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 72 MSPR 201, 202-07 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective May 16, 1994, the agency removed the appellant from his GS-9 Industrial Engineering Technician position based on a charge of "Making Statements to Co-Workers that Resulted in Anxiety and Disruption in the Workplace." The agency alleged that, on March 8, 1994, during a telephone call with co-worker and union president Henry Whelchel, the appellant stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I have guns....&#8197;I have a history of emotional instability....&#8197;What's it going to take--me taking out 4 or 5 people here in the office?...&#8197;I'm in the middle of an army swinging my sword--I'll take down a few with me.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge, after exhaustively summarizing the relevant testimony and documentary evidence, determined that the incident was "surrounded by panic, confusion, and haste," and that there was a rumor in the workplace that the appellant had in essence threatened to blow up the workplace with bombs. The appellant does not dispute these findings. The administrative judge found, moreover, that the appellant's co-workers reacted with anxiety and disruption based on, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, their knowledge that the appellant had weapons and, therefore, the means to act on his remarks, his threatening and intimidating demeanor in the workplace, and his remarks to some co-workers that he was emotionally unstable. She also found that there was no evidence to support the appellant's claim that the anxiety and disruption in the workplace was attributable to management's reaction to his remarks, rather than to the remarks themselves....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge was correct in pointing out that the "office atmosphere" was one of panic and confusion. It is undisputed that, as soon as agency managers learned of the appellant's remarks, they convened a meeting and quickly decided to send him home and bar him from the workplace. Immediately after the appellant left agency premises, agency managers held a meeting with the appellant's co-workers, during which they informed the employees of the appellant's remarks. The agency changed the locks on the doors as a safety precaution. At some point, a rumor began circulating that the appellant had threatened to blow up the agency with bombs. Several employees informed management that they were unwilling to work with the appellant should he return to the workplace. Moreover, several days after the appellant's remarks to Whelchel, employees heard a news broadcast describing an incident in California in which a disgruntled postal worker shot some co-workers on postal premises.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While there is no evidence that agency management started the rumor that the appellant had threatened to blow up the office with bombs, someone started the rumor. It appears that the agency, by calling a meeting to inform the appellant's co-workers of his remarks, was attempting in good faith to warn its employees without alarming them. In hindsight, the agency might have done a better job of dispelling rumors, but we are unwilling to conclude that agency management overreacted. Ultimately, however, the reactions of the appellant's co-workers can be traced to their prior dealings with the appellant and their familiarity with his reputation. As the administrative judge found, "[t]he reactions of the employees were accumulation of their knowledge of the appellant's statements, along with his reputation and background as an avid hunter and gun collector, as well as a product of their daily life experiences." The appellant was known as a bully, he had brandished a loaded gun in public, and he had been heard to make remarks such as "you know I have guns, and you know I am also legally emotionally unstable."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's thorough summary of the testimony shows that the appellant's co-workers were clearly frightened: They appeared visibly shaken and upset; they walked to the parking lot in groups at the end of the workday; productivity went down; they spent a large amount of worktime discussing safety precautions; some purchased weapons, pepper spray and mace; and they were bothered by loud noises and distracted whenever the office door was opened. Under the circumstances of this case, while we recognize that there may have been a degree of overreaction to the appellant's conduct on the part of his co-workers, we find that such "office atmosphere" does not warrant mitigation of the removal penalty. Furthermore, in light of the seriousness of the offense and the appellant's prior disciplinary record, we find that the appellant's years of service and satisfactory or better work record are insufficient to warrant mitigation of the penalty. Accordingly, we find that the penalty of removal is within the bounds of reasonableness....</p>
