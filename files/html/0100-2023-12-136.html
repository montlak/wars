<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Gaddas v. OPM</span>, 61 MSPR 650, 654-55 (1994), involving an issue of interim relief, OPM asserted that it discovered, after the initial decision issued, information that led it to believe that the appellant had not fully answered interrogatories from OPM inquiring of appellant's outside income. The Board accepted OPM's evidence and remanded the case to the AJ for further factfinding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming the truth of OPM's information that the appellant has been employed by Rogue Valley since April 1993, we find that the appellant's response to OPM's interrogatory #13 was not completely accurate, since he simply states therein that he was "unemployed" from April 1992 until April 1993. By omitting information requested by interrogatory #13, such as the names and addresses of any employers and the dates of his employment, by responding to interrogatory #14, which was only to be answered if he was "not presently employed," and by omitting his working at Rogue Valley as part of his "typical weekday," he appears to have essentially responded to OPM's interrogatories in an untruthful or misleading manner. In granting OPM's motion to compel discovery, the administrative judge determined that its interrogatories were relevant and material to the issues of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because OPM exercised due diligence in propounding interrogatories relating to his possible employment, its later-discovered evidence contradicting the appellant's answers is "new." Inasmuch as this information may be of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that of the initial decision, we also find that it is "material." <span class="Italic">See Russo v. Veterans Administration</span>, 3 MSPR 345, 349 (1980).... Upon remand, the administrative judge shall afford the parties the opportunity to obtain and present further evidence and argument concerning this matter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">No statute or regulation requires an agency to bring exculpatory information to the attention of the appellant or the Board. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. VA</span>, 20 MSPR 443, 446 (1984). Posthearing documents containing statements of witnesses are problematic because they deny the opposing party the right to confront and cross-examine the party as to each assertion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garriga v. VA</span>, 13 MSPR 204, 207 (1982). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-12-137.html#sec5-136">Corroborative Evidence</a>."] But evidence, once located, may lead to attempts to reopen Board decisions. In <span class="Italic">Wright v. USPS</span>, 183 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1999), the Federal Circuit strongly implied the necessity for the Board to reopen cases when evidence newly acquired following the close of the record tends to impeach the credibility of a witness whose testimony is central to the disposition of the appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The board cited <span class="Italic">Bucci v. Department of Education</span>, 42 MSPR 47, 55 (1989), for the proposition that new evidence regarding a witness' credibility generally is not considered material and we agree. <span class="Italic">See Mosely v. Department of Navy</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 718, 722 (1981). We also agree with <span class="Italic">Bucci's</span> holding that "new evidence is...material...[if it] is of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that of the initial decision." 42 MSPR at 55; <span class="Italic">cf. Azarkhish</span>, 915 F.2d at 679 (finding medical reports that provided excuse for employee's delay in filing to be material). Thus, evidence that impeaches the credibility of a witness whose testimony is the sole basis for an employee's removal cannot be characterized as immaterial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the board finds that Wright failed to timely introduce the evidence it may still reopen the record or review the initial decision <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B) (1994); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.118 (1999); <span class="Italic">Azarkhish</span>, 915 F.2d at 679; <span class="Italic">Connolly v. United States Dep't of Justice</span>, 766 F.2d 507, 511 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The board has broad discretion in deciding whether reconsideration of a decision is necessary to preserve consistency or achieve the "right result." <span class="Italic">See Azarkhish</span>, 915 F.2d at 679; <span class="Italic">Schaffer v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 751 F.2d 1250, 1254 (Fed. Cir. 1985). There is ample justification for the board to exercise this discretion here. Wright's falsification of his employment application is a legitimate factor in weighing his credibility, as is evidence of Vasquez' false workers' compensation claim, bias, and--possibly--arrest record. The administrative judge discounted virtually all evidence that supports Wright, yet accepted Vasquez' testimony in its entirety. The board, therefore, should carefully consider whether its refusal to reopen the record would produce an inconsistent or wrong result. <span class="Italic">See Azarkhish</span>, 915 F.2d at 679. Moreover, we leave it to the board to decide whether it is appropriate to impeach Vasquez' credibility with evidence of her arrests, if otherwise entered into the record.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another Circuit decision, <span class="Italic">Kursar v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> 157 Fed. Appx. 306, 310-11 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Kursar v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> 102 MSPR 306, 2006 MSPB 156 (2006)<span class="Italic">, post</span>), suggested the Board consider carefully whether new evidence is material when it may bear on a significant credibility determination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...First, while it may be true, as the agency argues, that new evidence regarding witness credibility is rarely material, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Bucci</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 55, it is also true that a decision resting entirely on a credibility determination might be affected by evidence that was not presented to the administrative judge, but that directly undermines the central credibility determination, <span class="Italic">Wright</span>, 183 F.3d at 1332. Second, Mr. Johnson's affidavit does more than merely impeach Mr. Blake's and Major Hom's credibility. Rather, it directly contradicts the critical factual determination on which the Initial Decision hinged. The Initial Decision on Mr. Kursar's USERRA claim hinged on the administrative judge's conclusion that Major Hom and Mr. Blake did not discuss Mr. Kursar's 1996 USERRA claim during their April 22 conversation and that neither of them even knew about Mr. Kursar's past USERRA claim. While that conclusion was reasonable in light of the administrative record at the time of the hearing, Mr. Johnson's affidavit directly contradicts that critical conclusion based on a statement reportedly made by Major Hom. Not only does Mr. Johnson's affidavit suggest that Major Hom and Mr. Blake knew about Mr. Kursar's 1996 USERRA claim, but it further suggests that the critical conversation between Major Hom and Mr. Blake focused, at least in part, on Major Hom's assertion that Mr. Kursar was unfit for a TSA position precisely <span id="Page_1723"></span>because he had filed a USERRA claim in the past. If that assertion was a motivating factor in Mr. Blake's "gut feeling" to terminate Mr. Kursar, then Mr. Kursar would likely have met his initial burden of showing that his military service or his past USERRA claim was a motivating or substantial factor in his termination, and the agency would have to show that Mr. Kursar would have been terminated regardless of his 1996 USERRA claim and his military status. <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014. Contrary to the agency's vague response to Mr. Kursar's petition for review, Mr. Johnson's affidavit was therefore at least facially material.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The full Board's order dismissing Mr. Kursar's petition for review did not refer to the materiality of Mr. Johnson's affidavit. Rather, the Board summarily concluded that Mr. Kursar had presented "no new, previously unavailable, evidence." Similarly, TSA's brief in this court asserts, without much elaboration, that Mr. Johnson's affidavit was not "new" evidence. The record, however, shows that Mr. Johnson's first contact with Mr. Kursar was in late April 2004, more than a month after Mr. Kursar's hearing, and that Mr. Kursar did not obtain Mr. Johnson's letter and his affidavit until after the administrative judge's decision in the case. If, despite due diligence, Mr. Kursar could not have obtained the evidence before the record closed, Mr. Johnson's affidavit would appear to be "new."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we do not conclude here that Mr. Johnson's affidavit was new or material, we believe the record, in its current state, does not support a conclusion that substantial evidence shows that the affidavit did not constitute "new and material" evidence. Further proceedings are necessary to ascertain whether Mr. Johnson's affidavit was new and material evidence and, if so, whether that evidence, if considered by the administrative judge, would result in a different outcome in this case. We therefore vacate the Board's order and remand this case to the Board for further proceedings addressed to Mr. Kursar's new and material evidence claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand, the Board reopened <span class="Italic">Kursar v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 102 MSPR 306, 309-10 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8, 2006 MSPB 156 (2006), although it did not offer much legal guidance on when it would reopen in future cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will grant a petition for review when it finds that new and material evidence is available that, despite due diligence, was not available when the record closed. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(d). We find that the information contained in Mr. Johnson's affidavit may be material evidence. <span class="Italic">See Bucci v. Department of Education</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 47, 55 (1989) (new evidence is "material" if it is "of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that of the initial decision"). In concluding that the appellant failed to establish his entitlement to relief under USERRA, the administrative judge credited the testimony of Mr. Blake and Major Hom that they were unaware of the appellant's prior USERRA claim. Mr. Johnson's affidavit constitutes evidence to rebut that finding and may therefore warrant a different outcome.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that, as a general rule, evidence offered merely to impeach a witness's credibility is not considered material. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, as the court noted, Mr. Johnson's affidavit does not merely call into question Mr. Blake's or Major Hom's testimony on a collateral matter but goes directly to the rationale of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Kursar</span>, 157 Fed. Appx. at 310; <span class="Italic">see also Martin v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 309, 313 (1995); <span class="Italic">Priddy v. Veterans Administration</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 42, 45 (1989). To prevail on his USERRA claim, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that his military status or past USERRA claim was "at least a motivating or substantial factor" in the agency's decision to terminate him. <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2001). If the appellant meets that initial burden, he will prevail unless the agency can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of his military status or protected USERRA activity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The administrative judge denied relief based on the lack of evidence in the record before him that the appellant's military service or prior USERRA activity was a factor in his termination. However, according to Mr. Johnson's affidavit, Major Hom told Mr. Blake that the appellant was unfit for a TSA position precisely because he had filed a USERRA claim in the past. We note that this evidence is hearsay, and we make no finding as to its credibility or probative value. However, if Johnson's statement is credible, and if the information from Major Hom was a motivating factor in Mr. Blake's "gut feeling" that the appellant should be terminated, then the appellant may have satisfied his burden of showing that his protected USERRA activity was a substantial or motivating factor in the agency's decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cook v. Dept. of Army</span>, 105 MSPR 178, 183-85 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-15, 2007 MSPB 76 (2007), declined to consider evidence that went to the appellant's credibility on the central charge against him when the Board concluded that the evidence could have been discovered by the agency before the hearing and the individual whose testimony was belatedly offered knew of the Board proceedings and was in a position to have offered his testimony to the agency before the hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the agency presents the affidavit of Gregory Stallworth, who currently serves as the EEO Officer at Fort Campbell. In his affidavit, Mr. Stallworth describes himself as a friend, coworker, and neighbor of the appellant, and he states that the appellant requested his help in persuading the agency not to remove him. Specifically, Mr. Stallworth asserts that the appellant showed him a memorandum describing the statement at issue in this case; that he asked Mr. Stallworth to vouch for his character; that, when Mr. Stallworth asked the appellant whether he had made the statement, the appellant admitted that he had; and that the appellant explained "that he was frustrated when he made the comment and that it was a reflection of his observation that minorities seemed to be the only people who were being promoted at Fort Campbell." According to the affidavit, Mr. Stallworth considered the appellant's request but eventually decided not to vouch for the character of a person he "now had reason to believe harbored and expressed racist sentiments."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may grant a petition for review when a party establishes the availability of new and material evidence that, despite due diligence, was not available when the record closed below. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(d)(1). We need not determine whether the affidavit presented by the agency provides material evidence. As discussed below, it does not constitute "new" evidence, as that term is used in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(d)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To constitute new evidence, the information contained in the documents submitted on petition for review, and not just the documents themselves, must have been unavailable to the party submitting those documents even with that party's exercise of due diligence. <span class="Italic">Harpole v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 232, &#x00B6; 12 (2005). Here, the agency could have made a simple discovery request of the appellant, asking him to identify anyone with knowledge of the events giving rise to the charge. The agency does not claim to have made such a discovery request, and there is no indication that it did so. Even if the agency's representations on petition for review and the statements in Mr. Stallworth's affidavit are accurate, therefore, there is no basis for a finding that the agency exercised due diligence in defending against the appellant's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that Mr. Stallworth has stated in his affidavit that he assumed that the appellant "had admitted to everyone involved that he made the comment." He has not explained this assumption clearly, however. In any event, any such assumption would have been incorrect. The appellant expressly denied, in his response to the deciding official, that he made the statement attributed to him in the removal proposal, and he continued his denials through the adjudication of his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Stallworth is the EEO Officer for Fort Campbell, as indicated above--a high-ranking official whose responsibilities bear an obvious relationship to matters such as the statement the appellant has been charged with making. Although he did not hold that position at the time of his alleged conversation with the appellant, his affidavit indicates that he has held it since January 22, 2006, a date several weeks before the hearing in this case began. Moreover, Mr. Stallworth indicated in a deposition taken in this case that he was aware that a hearing was being held in March 2006 on the appellant's appeal challenging the action against him. Despite his position, his awareness of the hearing, his awareness that the appellant was challenging the action against him, and his alleged knowledge of crucial information concerning this pending personnel dispute, Mr. Stallworth remained silent concerning his alleged conversation with the appellant until after the administrative judge had decided the appeal in the appellant's favor. Under these circumstances, his decision not to come forward must be imputed to the agency. Permitting the agency to introduce its allegedly new evidence at this stage of the proceedings would ignore basic concepts of procedural fairness and would be inconsistent with an employer's responsibility for the actions of its officials. We therefore decline to reopen the record for consideration of the agency's newly submitted evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Evidence was not considered on PFR that went to credibility of an agency witness when objection to the testimony of that witness could have been but was not made at the hearing, <span class="Italic">Mangano v. VA</span>, SF-1221-04-0234-B-9 (NP 10/30//2014) (Vice Chairman Wagner dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding Dr. G.F., the appellant claims that the Medical Center Director's testimony, that she terminated Dr. G.F. after he lost his faculty appointment, constituted "surprise and unsupported testimony." The appellant contends that the agency never mentioned Dr. G.F.'s termination in any of its discovery responses, he did not know Dr. G.F., and he was "totally unaware" that the agency would consider him as a comparator. To that end, the appellant provides a statement from Dr. G.F., made under penalty of perjury, which appears to contradict the Medical Center Director's testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Importantly, the appellant did not object to the Medical Center Director's testimony regarding Dr. G.F., nor did he seek additional time to submit rebuttal evidence. Moreover, he did not raise the "surprise" issue in his closing argument, which he submitted more than 1 month after the hearing. In fact, the appellant did not raise this issue at any time prior to the initial decision being issued, nearly 8 months after the hearing; rather, he only claimed surprise after the administrative judge issued an initial decision finding Dr. G.F. to be similarly situated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1724"></span>The Board has previously held that a rebuttal to "surprise" witness testimony does not constitute new evidence when the appellant did not request an extension of time in order to rebut the alleged surprise, and his posthearing brief did not allude to any surprise. <span class="Italic">Wakeland v. National Transportation Safety Board</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 37, 38-39 (1981). Similarly, we find that the appellant's statement from Dr. G.F. does not constitute new evidence. Moreover, evidence offered merely to impeach a witness's credibility is not generally considered new and material. <span class="Italic">Bucci v. Department of Education</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 47, 55 (1989). For these reasons, we do not consider Dr. G.F.'s statement on review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to consider what the agency styled as evidence suggesting lack of credibility of the appellant when the evidence could have been presented in earlier proceedings before the Board. The Board declined to allow the evidence, or to consider the proffer of evidence, under the doctrine of a "fraud upon the court" defined in <span class="Italic">Doe v. DOJ,</span> CH-0752-04-0620-M-1 (NP 11/17/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A "fraud upon the court" is distinct from mere fraud upon a party. <span class="Italic">See Superior Seafoods, Inc. v. Tyson Foods, Inc.</span>, 620 F.3d 873 (8th Cir. 2010). A fraud on the court, which justifies vacating a judgment, is narrowly defined as fraud which is directed to the judicial machinery itself, and is not fraud between the parties or fraudulent documents, false statements, or perjury, which the agency claims exists in this case. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Smiley</span>, 553 F.3d 1137, 1144 (8th Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">see also Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co.</span>, 322 U.S. 238, 245 (1944) (suggesting that a fraud on the court is not present in a simple "case of a judgment obtained with the aid of a witness who, on the basis of after-discovered evidence, is believed possibly to have been guilty of perjury").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is material if an agency representative built a case out of coerced, perjured testimony. If public officers connive at or knowingly acquiesce in the use of perjured evidence, their misconduct denies a defendant due process of law. The evidence of perjury should be presented as soon as it is available or the objection is deemed waived. If the information is presented to the AJ after the hearing is closed, but before the initial decision is issued, the AJ must consider the allegations to determine if they are true and to determine the extent they reflect on the credibility of the agency case. <span class="Italic">Bowers v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 562, 4 MSPB 80 (1980) (evidence that an agency representative may have intimidated a witness who would otherwise have testified in the appellant's favor); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Thomson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 16 MSPR 474, 476 (1983) (evidence of perjury of the appellant was not new and would not be considered on the PFR when the agency had that evidence but failed to submit it prior to the close of the hearing record). If after a hearing evidence is obtained showing that a witness was coerced into giving false testimony, tainting the adjudication before the AJ, the evidence, presented through affidavit with the PFR, warrants a remand on the issue encompassing the testimony, <span class="Italic">Lelak v. DHHS</span>, 11 MSPR 163, 164-66 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its petition for review, appellant has submitted a statement of an individual who allegedly was told by the agency witness, Mr. Weatheroy: "Well, you know I have to say what they told me to say/' as well as a statement from his attorney that she had called Mr. Weatheroy after the hearing and that he had admitted to her on May 7, 1981, that he had indeed picked up some drinking glasses for the Principal Regional Official for the agency, Chris Cohen at the Direction of his supervisor, but declined to give her a statement to that effect. Thus, he argues that the hearing should be reopened with discovery beforehand for the purpose of determining whether other high-level officials also diverted government vehicles to their personal use. He also contends, citing the former agency labor relations officer, Mr. Bradwish's testimony, that the removal was arbitrary and unreasonable because there were two instances when the agency failed to bring disciplinary actions, and in the two instances when disciplinary actions were brought, the agency only suspended the employees involved. The agency did not file a response to the petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bowers v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 4 MSPB 80 (1980), we held that evidence, which was submitted in the form of an affidavit after the close of the record, that the agency representative had attempted to coerce a potential agency witness to testify against the appellant, constituted new and material evidence since evidence that "an agency representative had built a case out of coerced, perjured testimony would, of course, be material." There, the Board noted that the appellant had contended that the evidence cast doubt on the credibility of the witnesses who, in fact, did testify and ruled that the presiding official's failure to consider the evidence and its impact on the credibility of the witnesses constituted error. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 81.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, although it was not disputed that appellant did commit the conduct charged, evidence that Mr. Weatheroy may have been acting under coercion when he denied, on cross-examination, that there were other occasions when he had been asked by other supervisors to use the government vehicle for personal reasons and stated that he did not "remember picking up any glasses for Mr. Cohen," was certainly relevant as to the consistency of the penalty under similar circumstances. Therefore, we find that appellant has submitted new and material evidence within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(a) and that the case should be remanded to the regional office for a determination as to whether agency officials coerced Mr. Weatheroy into giving false testimony concerning the personal use of government vehicles by other high level officials thereby tainting the prior adjudication. The parties may conduct additional discovery under 5 C.F.R. Part 1201 limited to evidence relating to this issue. If the presiding official finds misconduct on the part of agency officials then she must determine if such acts constituted harmful error. <span class="Italic">See Bowers v. U.S. Postal Service, supra</span>, at 81-82. If not, the presiding official will consider the impact of these statements on Mr. Weatheroy's credibility on the issue of whether appellant was singled out from other high-level officials who also have diverted government vehicles for their personal use. Appellant is not entitled to conduct additional discovery in support of this contention since he was already given this opportunity to do so under our regulations when he filed his appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mr. Lelak's removal was affirmed when, on remand, the AJ determined that the testimony of a witness was false but not coerced by the agency; the result was unchanged because the agency's case was independently supported. <span class="Italic">Lelak v.

<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant claims that a document was falsified, and the evidence of the falsification is submitted for the first time with the PFR, the Board will not set aside the AJ's determination unless the new evidence would warrant a different result, i.e., the evidence must have a material effect upon the earlier outcome of the case. <span class="Italic">Nulph v.

USDA</span>, 23 MSPR 428, 430 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Kirsch v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 30 MSPR 573, 575 (1986) (because the AJ made her own credibility determinations, an EEO investigation report that was subsequently available did not constitute new and material evidence). The Federal Circuit then attempted to set matters straight, <span class="Italic">McReynolds v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-810):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is anomalous for the Board to adopt the position that impeaching evidence, i.e., evidence which would be a pertinent factor in any credibility determinations the presiding official may be called upon to make, cannot be new and material evidence within the meaning of 5 CFR 1201.115(a) when such evidence is clearly relevant to a credibility determination.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board seemingly abandoned its interest in the integrity of its own proceedings by its observation in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 105, 107 n.* (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has also alleged that an agency official attempted to intimidate a witness regarding testimony to be offered at the hearing <span id="Page_1725"></span>in this case. While the appellant's assertion does not establish that the agency committed a prohibited personnel practice in effecting his removal, the appellant can pursue this matter through the Office of the Special Counsel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cardwell v. VA</span>, 32 MSPR 1, 4 n.3 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Priddy v. VA</span>, 40 MSPR 42, 45-46 (1989), the agency discovered a witness who provided information--the appellant's admission--tending to sustain a charge of patient abuse. The witness could not have earlier been discovered with due diligence. As to the materiality of the evidence, the Board fashioned and distinguished a "minor inconsistency" rule:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will not consider evidence submitted for the first time with the petition for review absent a showing that it was unavailable before the record was closed despite the party's due diligence<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115; <span class="Italic">Avansino v. United States Postal Service,</span> 3 MSPB 308, 3 MSPR 211, 214 (1980). In this case, the agency has established that it could not reasonably have known that Ms. Webb had information relevant to the charges against the appellant prior to the close of the record below. There was nothing in her duties or work location to connect her with the alleged incident, the patient, or the appellant. Under these circumstances, we must conclude that Ms. Webb's information was not previously available despite due diligence by the agency. <span class="Italic">Cf. Pangarova v. Department of the Army,</span> 28 MSPR 652, 656 (1985) (an affidavit from a witness who had not previously come forward, about a subject that the appellant knew was in issue, was not "new" evidence where the appellant failed to show that she could not find the same or similar information elsewhere); <span class="Italic">Williams v. General Services Administration,</span> 22 MSPR 476, 479 (1984) (affidavits from witnesses known to the agency but previously unwilling to testify were not "new" evidence), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 770 F.2d 182 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's "new" evidence--the affidavit from Ms. Webb dated June 23, 1988--also meets the criterion of "material" evidence. <span class="Italic">See Russo v. Veterans Administration,</span> 3 MSPB 427, 3 MSPR 345, 349 (1980) (the Board will not grant a petition for review based on "new" evidence absent a showing that it is of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that of the initial decision). Generally, evidence offered merely to impeach a witness's credibility is not material. <span class="Italic">See Murphy v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 34 MSPR 534, 536 (1987). In this case, however, we find that the general rule does not apply because the agency's "new" evidence does not raise a minor inconsistency in the appellant's testimony but alleges that the appellant admitted the misconduct at issue. Since the agency's "new" evidence presents a significant challenge to the appellant's credibility, he must have the opportunity to present evidence contradicting that offered by the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Priddy</span> was followed and explained, <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 67 MSPR 309, 312-13 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also asserts on review that it has obtained new and material evidence showing that the appellant lied under oath at the hearing. It submits on review an affidavit from Deborah Ward, the appellant's former housemate, written after issuance of the initial decision. In her affidavit, Ward states that the appellant bragged to her that he had "gotten away with all of it," that he had committed all of the charged misconduct, and that once he returned to duty, "he could do almost anything and they couldn't touch him." She further attests that the appellant told her he intended to get even with all of the people who testified against him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Priddy v. VA</span>, 40 MSPR 42, 45 (1989), the agency sought to offer an affidavit from a previously unknown witness who attested that, prior to his removal, the appellant admitted to her that he engaged in the charged misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 44-45. The Board remanded the appeal to the administrative judge to afford the appellant the opportunity to present evidence contradicting the agency's new evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 45-46.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, evidence offered merely to impeach a witness's credibility is not considered new and material. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bucci v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 42 MSPR 47, 55 (1989). Here, however, Ward's affidavit does not raise a mere minor inconsistency in the appellant's testimony but alleges that the appellant admitted the misconduct at issue and plans to seek revenge against those who testified against him. <span class="Italic">See Priddy</span>, 40 MSPR at 45. As in <span class="Italic">Priddy</span>, the agency here does not appear to have had any way of knowing of Ward's existence as a witness with relevant information/testimony to offer until she came forward, after issuance of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Therefore, we find that Ward's affidavit constitutes new and material evidence warranting a remand of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Priddy</span>, we remand this appeal to permit the administrative judge to assess the credibility and probative value of Ward's affidavit, and any response by the appellant, and determine whether it warrants reversal of his finding that the fourth specification of the first charge is not sustained....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's analysis in <span class="Italic">Priddy</span> and <span class="Italic">Martin</span> was apparently modified by <span class="Italic">Cole v. Dept. of Army</span>, 78 MSPR 288 (1998). The appellant's removal for AWOL was mitigated in part because of the AJ's reliance on the appellant's testimony that his AWOL was caused by incarceration on charges that were unfounded. The agency submitted court records showing that, after the issuance of the initial decision, the appellant was found guilty of the charged behavior. Although there appears from the Board's decision nothing suggesting that the agency could not have ascertained the true state of appellant's conduct at the time of the hearing, the posthearing conviction was admitted as new evidence amounting to more than a "mere inconsistency" and instead presenting a "significant challenge" to the witness's credibility. The removal penalty, mitigated by the AJ, was reinstated by the Board. The basis of <span class="Italic">Priddy</span> and <span class="Italic">Martin</span> was the agency's apparent inability to obtain impeaching evidence at the time of hearing. <span class="Italic">Cole</span> explained, 78 MSPR at 293:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, the Board does not consider evidence offered merely to impeach a witness's credibility to be new and material<span class="Italic">. Bucci v. Department of Education</span>, 42 MSPR 47, 55, 58 (1989). The general rule does not apply, however, when the new evidence does not raise a "mere inconsistency" but presents a "significant challenge" to the witness's credibility. <span class="Italic">Priddy v. Veterans Administration</span>, 40 MSPR 42, 45 (1989); <span class="Italic">accord Martin v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 67 MSPR 309, 313 (1995). Here, given the administrative judge's reliance on the appellant's testimony as a critical basis for mitigating the penalty, we find that this new evidence does not raise a "mere minor inconsistency" and is material to determining whether mitigation of the removal was warranted....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A variant on the "minor inconsistency" rule--what might be called the "overwhelming evidence" proviso--was expressed in <span class="Italic">Cooper v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 174, 179 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's contention that the administrative judge relied on perjured testimony also lacks merit. The appellant asserts that [an] agency witness...testified before the Texas Employment Commission that, in the past, it had been an acceptable payment practice to carry items to and from different stores. The appellant further asserts that [the witness's] testimony before the administrative judge contradicted his testimony before the Commission. Even if the appellant's assertion were correct, it would not affect the outcome of the case since the initial decision does not rely on [the witness's] testimony and the overwhelming weight of the evidence presented regarding present BX policy is that carrying items from one store to another for payment is neither a usual nor an accepted practice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Coulter v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 12 MSPR 431, 435 (1982), reopened a case because material testimony by the same witnesses in two related but independent appeals (before different AJs) changed from one hearing to the other. The Board assessed the later testimony and reversed the adverse action it previously sustained.
