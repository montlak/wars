<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-22"><span class="space">a.</span> Failure to Seek Timely Reconsideration; Requests to Extend Time to Request Reconsideration</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1997 OPM amended its regulations, 5 CFR 831.109(f)(2), to give itself the authority to permit employees to appeal an OPM retirement determination directly to MSPB without going through the reconsideration process. <span class="Italic">See</span> 62 Fed. Reg. 22873 (4/28/97). Assuming, however, that OPM has not issued a final and appealable decision and that OPM does not authorize avoidance of the reconsideration process, OPM allows 30 days from its initial determination to seek reconsideration. When a final decision is issued on a reconsideration request, OPM regulations authorize an MSPB appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The process is described at 5 CFR 831.109 (2022), for CSRS:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Initial decision and reconsideration</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Who may file</span>. Except as noted in paragraph (b) of this section any individual or agency whose rights or interests under the Civil Service Retirement System are affected by an initial decision of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may request OPM to review its initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Actions covered elsewhere</span>. (1) A request for reconsideration of termination of annuity payments under 5 U.S.C. 8311-22 shall be made in accordance with the procedures set out in subpart K of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A request for reconsideration of a decision to collect a debt will be made in accordance with &#x00A7; 831.1304(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Initial decision</span>. A decision shall be considered an initial decision when rendered by OPM in writing and stating the right to reconsideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reconsideration</span>. A request for reconsideration must be in writing, must include the individual's name, address, date of birth and claim number, if applicable, and must state the basis for the request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time limits on reconsideration</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A request for reconsideration must be received by OPM within 30 calendar days from the date of the original decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The representative of the Associate Director for Compensation responsible for reconsiderations may extend the time limit for filing when the individual shows that he/she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he/she was prevented by circumstances beyond his/her control from making the request within the time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Final decision</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;After reconsideration, the Associate Director's representative shall issue a final decision which shall be in writing, shall fully set forth the findings and conclusions of the reconsideration, and shall contain notice of the right to request an appeal provided in &#x00A7; 831.110. Copies of the final decision shall be sent to the individual, to any competing claimants and, where applicable, to the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;OPM may issue a final decision providing the opportunity to appeal under &#x00A7; 831.110 rather than an opportunity to request reconsideration under paragraph (c) of this section. Such a decision must be in writing and state the right to appeal under &#x00A7; 831.110.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Then, under 5 CFR 831.110 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Appeals</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Appeals to MSPB</span>. Except as noted in this paragraph, an individual or agency whose rights or interests under the Civil Service Retirement System (Subchapter III of chapter 83, title 5, United States Code) are affected by a final decision of the representative of the Associate Director for Compensation, Office of Personnel Management, may request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review such decision in accord with procedures prescribed by the Board. Decisions of OPM and the Associate Director for Compensation made in accord with the procedures referenced in &#x00A7; 831.109(b)(1) are made under subchapter II of chapter 83, title 5, United States Code. Such decisions are not appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board under 5 U.S.C. 8347(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The review process is about the same for FERS, 5 CFR 841.305 (2022):</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Two related timeliness issues arise in appeals from OPM reconsideration decisions involving annuity claims. First, there is the problem of the extension requested and denied by OPM for an extension of the time for filing a reconsideration request. Second, assuming a timely reconsideration request, there is the issue of the belated Board appeal from the OPM final decision following reconsideration. Our discussion in this subsection begins with OPM's authority to extend the time limit for a reconsideration request that is filed with OPM after its regulatory deadline.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For CSRS, under 5 CFR 831.109(e)(2) (2022), "The representative of the Associate Director for Compensation responsible for reconsiderations may extend the time limit for filing when the individual shows that he/she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he/she was prevented by circumstances beyond his/her control from making the request within the time limit," and for FERS, under 5 CFR 841.306(d)(2) (2022), "The Associate Director's representative responsible for reconsiderations may extend the time limit for filing when the requestor shows that he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit."

<p class="Body-Text">Affirming the denial of a reconsideration request as untimely in an annuity overpayment case, <span class="Italic">Drago v. OPM,</span> AT-0845-15-0772-I-1 (NP 4/29/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By regulation, a request for reconsideration of an OPM decision to collect a debt or waiver of an overpayment must be received by OPM or postmarked within 30 calendar days of the date of the decision. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 841.306(d)(1), 845.204(b)(1). OPM's regulations provide that OPM may extend the time limit when an individual proves that: (1) she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it; or (2) she was prevented by circumstances beyond her control from making the request within the time limit. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 841.306(d)(1), 845.204(b)(1); <span class="Italic">see Kent v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 123 M.S.P.R. 103, &#x00B6; 8 (2015).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reiterates her argument raised below that she was unaware of the time limit for requesting a waiver. We agree with the administrative judge that OPM provided the appellant with sufficient information regarding the time limit and method for requesting a waiver. The appellant does not dispute that she received the overpayment notice, which stated that any request for reconsideration or waiver must be received or postmarked within 30 days, and also informed her that October 24, 2013, was the specific date by which she needed to submit her request. Regarding the appellant's argument below that she believed that she could request a waiver by telephone, we agree with the administrative judge that the overpayment notice did not state that the appellant could call to request a waiver, but instead, informed the appellant that a request for reconsideration or waiver could be made by completing a form and submitting it to OPM by hand delivery or mail, consistent with OPM's regulations.[4] <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.204(b)(1) (specifying that requests for reconsideration or waiver may be made by hand delivery or mail); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.306(c)(providing that a request for reconsideration must be in writing).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The overpayment notice provided a telephone number that the appellant could call if she had questions, but did not state or imply that the appellant could request a waiver, as opposed to ask a question, by phone.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant also reiterates her argument that she failed to submit a timely request for a waiver because she was stressed and depressed. When, as here, the appellant failed to provide any medical evidence in support of her assertions, or present any specific argument as to how her alleged conditions prevented her from making a request within the regulatory time limit, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant's assertions regarding depression and stress did not demonstrate that factors beyond her control prevented her from making a timely request for a waiver.[5] <span class="Italic">See Meister v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 508, 515-16 (1992) (affirming OPM's denial of an appellant's request for reconsideration as untimely where he proved that medical problems interfered with his ability to file on time but did not prevent from filing within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(e)(2)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;For the first time on review, the appellant argues that the Board should have appointed her an attorney so that she would have had "a fair chance to fight." It is well settled that the Board's authority to request <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation for appellants does not extend beyond disability retirement appeals in which appellants claim that they are mentally incompetent and present medical evidence to support such claims. <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 605, &#x00B6; 17 (2013); <span class="Italic">see French v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 496, 499 (1988) (finding that the Board has authority to request <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation for an appellant in a disability retirement appeal who is found to be incompetent); <span class="Italic">see also Barnett v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 95, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10&#8209;15 (2001) (finding that <span class="Italic">French</span> procedures should be applied in an appeal involving the dismissal of a reconsideration request on timeliness grounds). Here, the appellant has not claimed that she was mentally incompetent, and she has not provided any medical evidence to support such a claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues on review that it was unfair that OPM only provided her 30 days to request a waiver, when it took OPM several years to realize that she had been overpaid in the first instance. However, when, as here, an appellant fails to show that she was not notified of the time limit for making a request for reconsideration or a waiver, or prevented by circumstances beyond her control from making such a request, the Board will not reach the issue of whether OPM acted unreasonably or abused its discretion in refusing to extend the time limit. <span class="Italic">See Kent,</span> 123 M.S.P.R. 103, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">see also Davis v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 70, &#x00B6; 7 (2006) (addressing an untimely request for reconsideration under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(e)(2)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant repeats her assertions that OPM's collection of the overpayment is causing her severe financial hardship. However, when OPM denies a request for reconsideration as untimely, the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal only with regard to the untimeliness determination. <span class="Italic">See Mounce v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 120, &#x00B6; 7 (2005). Here, because the administrative judge properly affirmed OPM's decision dismissing the appellant's waiver request as untimely, the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider whether the appellant's financial circumstances entitle her to a waiver. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (finding that jurisdiction attached to the merits of an appellant's appeal of OPM's disallowance of his disability retirement application once an administrative judge determined that OPM abused its discretion in dismissing the appellant's request for reconsideration as untimely).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, for the reasons discussed above, we find that the appellant has not shown error in the administrative judge's finding that OPM properly dismissed her request for a waiver of the overpayment as untimely.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;However, our decision in this matter does not preclude the appellant from exercising any right that she may have to make a mid-collection request to OPM for modification of the repayment schedule, compromise, suspension, or write&#8209;off, as provided for under any applicable law, rule, regulation, or OPM guideline. <span class="Italic">See</span> , <span id="Page_889"></span><span class="Italic">e.g</span>., 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.301 (stating that, when it has been determined that the recipient of an overpayment is ineligible for waiver, the individual nevertheless is entitled to an adjustment in the recovery schedule if she shows that it would cause her financial hardship to make payment at the rate scheduled); <span class="Italic">Hundley v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Beason v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-3352), recapitulated the law on the effect on Board jurisdiction of an untimely reconsideration request to OPM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision dated May 12, 1993, OPM denied Ms. Beason's disability retirement benefits application on the ground that she had failed to demonstrate the existence of a disabling medical condition. OPM's regulations provided that any request for reconsideration of that decision must be received by OPM within 30 calendar days from the date of the initial decision. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.109(e)(1) (1993). The initial decision notified Ms. Beason of that time limit and further warned:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If you intend to submit additional evidence but it is unavailable to be sent with your timely request for reconsideration, do not delay your request. In such case, please state in your request that additional evidence will be submitted at a later date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the initial decision was dated May 12, 1993, a request for reconsideration had to have been received by June 11, 1993, in order to have been timely. On June 28, 1993, OPM received a letter requesting reconsideration of the initial decision. OPM subsequently denied Ms. Beason's request for reconsideration on the ground that it was untimely. In a letter dated July 6, 1993, Ms. Beason requested a waiver of the time limit for her reconsideration request. On August 31, 1993, OPM declined to grant a waiver of the regulatory time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Beason contends that OPM abused its discretion in declining to excuse her untimely request for reconsideration. OPM has discretion to extend the time limit for filing a request for reconsideration, but <span class="Italic">only</span> when the individual making the request shows (1) that he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or (2) that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.109(e)(2) (1993); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Azarkhish v. OPM</span>, 915 F.2d 675, 677 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Thus, Ms. Beason must first prove that she met one of these two criteria and then prove that OPM abused its discretion in not extending the time limit for filing the request<span class="Italic">. Azarkhish</span>, 915 F.2d at 678. Ms. Beason does not contend that she was unaware of the time limit. She asserts that her inability to obtain the necessary medical records constituted circumstances beyond her control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB concluded that Ms. Beason had not established that there were circumstances beyond her control which prevented her from timely filing her request for reconsideration with OPM. The MSPB decision noted that OPM's initial decision explicitly stated that Ms. Beason's request for reconsideration should not be delayed, even if she intended to submit additional evidence, and that the initial decision further counseled that, if additional evidence was unavailable, Ms. Beason should file a request and state in that request that the additional evidence would be submitted at a later date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court must affirm the decision of the MSPB if there is substantial evidence to support the MSPB's finding that Ms. Beason was not prevented from timely filing her request for reconsideration. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c) (1988); <span class="Italic">Azarkhish</span>, 915 F.2d at 678. If such evidence exists, this court will not reach the issue of whether OPM abused its discretion in denying Ms. Beason's untimely request for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Azarkhish</span>, 915 F.2d at 678. Ms. Beason does not explain why she did not file a timely request for reconsideration stating that she would later supplement the request with additional evidence. The failure of her attorney to file such a request is not a sufficient excuse, especially since she admits giving her attorney a copy of the OPM decision prior to the June 11, 1993 deadline. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The complete absence of any reason why Ms. Beason was prevented from filing a timely request supports the MSPB's determination that Ms. Beason failed to establish that there were circumstances beyond her control which prevented her from timely filing her request. We must affirm.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM's decision on an extension of time to file a reconsideration request is overruled only if the Board determines that denial was unreasonable or an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Meister v. OPM</span>, 52 MSPR 508, 513 (1992). Summarizing the law, <span class="Italic">Baldos v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 606, 608-09 (1988), advised:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on <span class="Italic">Slater v. OPM</span>, 21 MSPR 405, 407 (1984), the administrative judge found that if the OPM denies an individual's request for reconsideration on the basis of untimeliness, the Board lacks jurisdiction of the appeal unless it finds that the OPM's denial was unreasonable or an abuse of discretion....&#8197;The Board reopens to clarify its jurisdiction over appeals from OPM denials of requests for reconsideration on the basis of untimeliness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Slater</span>, the Board held that if the OPM denies an individual's request for reconsideration as untimely, the Board's jurisdiction over the merits attaches only if it is determined that the OPM's determination of untimeliness was unreasonable or an abuse of discretion. Because <span class="Italic">Slater</span> presented a situation in which the Board found the OPM's action unreasonable, it did not there specifically address the jurisdictional posture of a case in which the OPM's untimeliness determination was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">Bradley v. OPM</span>, 23 MSPR 475, 477 (1984), where the OPM's denial of reconsideration based on untimeliness was found to be reasonable, the Board exercised jurisdiction to sustain the untimeliness determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further clarifying <span class="Italic">Slater</span> and <span class="Italic">Bradley</span>, we hold that if the OPM denies an individual's request for reconsideration as untimely, the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal with regard to the untimeliness determination; our jurisdiction over the merits of the appellant's appeal, however, attaches only if it is determined that the OPM's denial of reconsideration was unreasonable or an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The abuse of discretion standard is deferential to OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shelley v. OPM</span> (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is governed by the facts found by the AJ, as applied to OPM's regulation regarding allowable excuses for the untimely filing of a request for reconsideration. General equitable factors articulated in <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of Air Force</span>, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980), do not enter into the analysis in this case. <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> addressed whether "good cause," a more lenient standard, was demonstrated for the untimely filing of an appeal to the Board under MSPB's regulation, 5 C.F.R. Sec. 1201.12, not whether petitioner met narrower factual criteria under OPM's regulation, 5 C.F.R. Sec. 831.109(e)(2), for discretionary extension of the time for filing a request for reconsideration with OPM. Since we cannot say the latter regulation violates the statute it implements, we have no choice but to uphold its application to the facts, if properly found.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's limited authority to waive an untimely reconsideration request was emphasized, <span class="Italic">Cerezo v. OPM</span>, 94 MSPR 81, 84-85 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A request for reconsideration of an initial decision by OPM on retirement matters must be received by OPM within 30 days of the date of the initial decision. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(e)(1) (2001). OPM has discretion to extend the time limit for filing a request for reconsideration, but only "when the individual shows that [she] was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that [she] was prevented by circumstances beyond [her] control from making the request within the time limit." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(e)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_890"></span>There is no dispute that the request for reconsideration was filed approximately 13 months late. The appellant has not alleged that she was unaware of the time limit for filing the request for reconsideration. In addition, the appellant has not alleged nor shown that she was prevented by circumstances beyond her control from requesting reconsideration within the time limit. Rather, the appellant bases her request for waiver of the time limit on OPM's alleged unreasonableness and abuse of discretion. She alleges, in essence, that it was unreasonable and an abuse of discretion for OPM to refuse to waive her untimeliness when it had previously waived Mr. Carreon's untimeliness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant misinterprets 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(e)(2). That section provides only two bases for waiving the time limit: (1) Where the appellant was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it; and (2) where the appellant was prevented by circumstances beyond her control from making the request within the time limit. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(e)(2). The Board will reverse an OPM final decision denying reconsideration under this section only if it finds that OPM's denial was unreasonable or an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Meister v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 508, 513 (1992). If the appellant fails to show that she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that she was prevented by circumstances beyond her control from making the request within the time limit, the issue of whether OPM was unreasonable or abused its discretion in denying her untimely request for reconsideration is not reached. <span class="Italic">Azarkhish v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 915 F.2d 675, 677-78 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (the court did not reach the issue of whether OPM abused its discretion where the appellant did not show that she was prevented from timely filing her request for reconsideration and it was undisputed that she was aware of the time limit because 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(e)(2) provides OPM discretion in extending the time limit for requesting reconsideration only upon a showing of either lack of knowledge of the time limit or prevention).</p>

Dept. of Navy</span>, 100 MSPR 190, 193-95 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (2005), departed from an unduly deferential review standard as to an OPM determination concerning the timeliness of a reconsideration request. The reconsideration request, involving an overpayment dispute, seemed to be only a day or two late. The Board noted that its standard of review of an OPM determination not to waive a reconsideration deadline was whether the OPM determination was unreasonable or an abuse of discretion, but the Board took some trouble to identify mitigating circumstances leading to a remand for consideration of the appeal on the merits, while emphasizing that OPM should make its reconsideration request procedures clear and demonstrate how it applied its discretion when it denies a reconsideration request as untimely:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A request for reconsideration of an initial decision issued by OPM finding that an annuitant has been overpaid in annuity benefits must be postmarked within 30 days from the date of the initial decision. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1304(b)(1). OPM may extend the time limit for filing a request for reconsideration when the individual can prove that she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that she was prevented by circumstances beyond her control from making the request within the time limit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(e)(2); <span class="Italic">Cerezo v.

If the appellant fails to show that she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that she was prevented by circumstances beyond her control from making the request within the time limit, the issue of whether OPM was unreasonable or abused its discretion in denying her untimely request for reconsideration is not reached. <span class="Italic">Cerezo</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 81 &#x00B6; 9</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has asserted that she did not receive OPM's December 14, 2003 initial decision and notice that she could request reconsideration of that decision until December 23, 2004, and her assertion is unrebutted. Thus, the appellant established that she only had from December 23, 2003, until January 13, 2004, in which to submit her reconsideration request to OPM. <span class="Italic">See Boyd v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 574 &#x00B6; 6 (2004). The appellant also asserted that her medical conditions prevented her from timely filing her reconsideration request within this time period. We note that the "good cause" analysis the Board would apply in analyzing the timeliness of a submission filed with the Board, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Hawkins v. Office</span> <span class="Italic">of Personnel Management</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 147 &#x00B6; 9 (2004); <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Department of the Navy,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 434, 437 (1998), is not applicable in our review of OPM's discretionary denial of an extension of the reconsideration filing time period under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1304(b) and 831.109(e)(2). <span class="Italic">Azarkhish v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 915 F.2d 675, 677 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (the "good cause" standard the Board applies to cases involving an untimely filing with the Board is a more lenient standard than the narrower factual criteria under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.109(e)(2)); <span class="Italic">Meister v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 508, 514 n.2 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the appellant suffered from her medical conditions for the entire time period in which she had to file her request for reconsideration; that she submitted corroborating medical evidence showing that she suffered from her indicated medical conditions during the filing time period; that she provided an explanation of how her medical conditions prevented her from timely filing her request for reconsideration; and, further, that she made several attempts to call OPM to seek an extension of the filing time period due to her incapacitating medical conditions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that OPM's initial decision does not contain information regarding its discretion to grant an extension of the filing period, nor the criteria for obtaining an extension, nor even information as to when or how an extension request must be made. The regulation does not require a request for an extension to be submitted in writing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1304(b). Indeed, immediately following the information on the cover page of the special notice that informed the appellant that she must make her request for reconsideration within 30 days from the date of the notice, OPM provides "Toll Free" and "Washington Area" telephone numbers. Only on the second page of "PART 2" of the notice does OPM provide a mailing address. The evidence contained in OPM's file supports the appellant's assertion that she made several calls to OPM in an attempt to obtain an extension of the reconsideration time period due to her incapacitating medical conditions. Thus, the appellant's attempts to seek an extension by timely calling the telephone numbers OPM provided also evidence that she exercised due diligence in attempting to seek an extension of the filing time period. We find that, under the facts of this particular case, the appellant proved by preponderant evidence that she was prevented by circumstances beyond her control from making her reconsideration request within the filing time limit and that OPM's denial of the appellant's request for an extension of this limit was unreasonable and an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1304(b) and 831.109(e)(2); <span class="Italic">see also Mounce v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 120 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-6 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also correct the AJ's indication below that, upon a finding that OPM's denial of the appellant's request for an extension was unreasonable or an abuse of discretion, the case would be sent back to OPM for a new reconsideration decision regarding her request for a waiver of the annuity overpayment. Although the Board's jurisdiction over this appeal is initially limited to a review of OPM's untimeliness determination, the Board's jurisdiction over the merits of OPM's annuity overpayment determination attaches upon a finding that OPM's timeliness determination was unreasonable or constitutes an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Mounce</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 120 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8. Thus, the AJ is now free to adjudicate the merits of OPM's annuity overpayment determination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Sawyer v.

The AJ should provide the appellant with another copy of the AJ's March 5, 2004 order setting forth the appellant's burden of proof to establish entitlement to a waiver of the annuity overpayment or an adjustment of the repayment schedule, and require the appellant to submit a completed copy of OPM's "Financial Resources Questionnaire" and any other evidence and argument in support of her request for a waiver or adjustment of the repayment schedule.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the belated reconsideration request appears to be the product of the mental condition of a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant, the Board will apply the procedures of <span class="Italic">French v.

If the appellant establishes that she qualified for an extension or waiver of the filing deadline under section 841.306(d)(2), the Board then will consider whether OPM acted unreasonably or abused its discretion in refusing to extend or waive the time limit and dismissing her request for reconsideration as untimely filed. <span class="Italic">Kent</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 103, &#x00B6; 8. If the Board determines that OPM's timeliness determination was unreasonable or an abuse of discretion, the Board will reverse OPM's dismissal of the request for reconsideration as untimely filed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued below that it was impossible for her to provide OPM with the documentation it requested within 30 days and that she "did everything [she] could in a timely manner." She explained that, during the response period, she had to move out of her house and was in the middle of a divorce, and that her ex-husband was taking her mail. She further asserted that her response was only 1 or 2 days late, while OPM took more than 3 years to notify her that her request for reconsideration was untimely filed. In the remand initial decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant did not qualify for a filing deadline extension under OPM's regulatory criteria because she was notified of, and was aware of, the filing deadline, and she failed to show that circumstances beyond her control prevented her from timely requesting reconsideration of the disallowance decision. Thus, the administrative judge did not reach the issue of whether OPM was unreasonable or abused its discretion in dismissing the appellant's request for reconsideration as untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that she failed to show that she was prevented by circumstances beyond her control from timely filing a request for reconsideration. Specifically, she argues, as she did below, that she requested reconsideration as "quickly as [she] could while moving, going through a very nasty violent divorce, being sent to several doctors, having tests done [and] getting results." She also asserts that the 30-day filing period should begin to run on the day she actually received the disallowance decision or on the next business day after it was mailed, which would make her June 21, 2011 request for reconsideration timely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we noted in our remand order, the Board previously has held that an individual is entitled to a reasonable period of time to request reconsideration after the belated receipt of an initial OPM decision. <span class="Italic">Kent</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 103, &#x00B6; 11 n.7. Accordingly, the Board specifically directed the administrative judge to determine when the appellant received OPM's disallowance decision and to weigh this factor in determining whether she was prevented by circumstances beyond her control from requesting reconsideration within the 30-day time limit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the remand initial decision, the administrative judge appears to adopt the appellant's unchallenged assertion that she received OPM's May 18, 2011 disallowance decision on June 10, 2011. OPM has not challenged this finding on review, and we find no basis to disturb it. Thus, it follows that the appellant's delayed receipt of the disallowance decision deprived her of 23 days of her 30-day filing period. Nonetheless, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to show that she was prevented by circumstances beyond her control from making a timely request for reconsideration, even considering her shortened response time due to the mailing delay. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, OPM dismissed the appellant's request for reconsideration as untimely filed by 1 day, and the appellant appealed the dismissal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 8-10 (2005). The Board found that the appellant in Williams was prevented by circumstances beyond her control from filing a timely request for reconsideration because she: did not receive OPM's December 14, 2003 initial decision until December 23, 2003; she was experiencing medical conditions throughout the filing period; she attempted to call OPM to seek an extension of the filing period due to her incapacitating medical conditions; and OPM's initial decision did not contain information regarding its discretion to grant an extension to the filing period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the appellant here was deprived of a significant portion of the 30-day filing period as a result of a mailing delay. Moreover, as in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the disallowance decision here does not contain information regarding OPM's discretion to extend the filing period, nor the criteria for obtaining an extension, nor even information as to when or how an extension request must be made. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 10. Although the appellant in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, unlike the appellant here, attempted to contact OPM by telephone to request an extension and suffered from medical conditions that inhibited her ability to meet the filing deadline, she had nearly 20 days remaining of her 30-day filing period when she received OPM's initial decision, while the appellant here had only 7 days remaining. Accordingly, under the particular facts of this case, we find that the appellant was prevented by circumstances beyond her control from filing a timely request for reconsideration and, therefore, that she has met the regulatory requirement for a filing period extension under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 841.306(d)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must determine next whether OPM acted unreasonably or abused its discretion in refusing to extend or waive the time limit and dismissing the appellant's request for reconsideration as untimely filed. <span class="Italic">Kent</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 103, &#x00B6; 8. To be timely, the appellant's request for reconsideration of OPM's May 18, 2011 initial decision must have been received by OPM no later than Friday, June 17, 2011. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 841.109, 841.306(d)(1). Although it is unclear from the record when OPM received the appellant's June 21, 2011 request for reconsideration, OPM has stated that the envelope was postmarked June 22, 2011. Assuming 5 days for mailing, OPM received the appellant's request for reconsideration on or by Monday, June 27, 2011--at most, 10 days past the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her request for reconsideration, the appellant indicated that she received the May 18, 2011 disallowance decision on June 10, 2011. However, OPM did not acknowledge, or appear to consider, the appellant's assertion regarding the delayed delivery in finding that she failed to show that she was unable to request reconsideration within the time limit. Rather, OPM explained only that, "[o]n October 2014 we sent you a letter requesting evidence that would qualify for a waiver based on [the regulatory criteria] . As of the date of this letter we have received no evidence from you regarding these criteria." Thus, OPM concluded, "[s]ince you have not presented evidence to show that you were unable to file a request for reconsideration within the time limit provided by regulation, your reconsideration request is being dismissed as untimely filed." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although OPM's determination rests on the appellant's failure to present evidence in response to the October 29, 2014 timeliness letter, OPM was well aware that she never received that letter. As stated above, the timeliness letter was returned to OPM as undeliverable, and OPM concedes that it did not attempt to redeliver the letter or make "a subsequent attempt to inform the appellant of her opportunity to show that she was eligible for an extension of the filing deadline." Further, even if the appellant had received the October 29, 2014 timeliness letter, her ability to prove that circumstances prevented her from timely filing her request for reconsideration during a 7-day period in June 2011, was substantially prejudiced by OPM's unreasonable delay of more than 3 years in contacting her regarding the timeliness of her request for reconsideration. Again, however, OPM did not acknowledge or consider its failure to timely act in dismissing the appellant's request for reconsideration as untimely filed. Lastly, because it appears that OPM failed to properly address the disallowance decision, the delayed delivery and the appellant's shortened response time was due to OPM's error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the above, as well as the appellant's relatively short delay after receiving the disallowance decision, we find that OPM acted unreasonably and abused its discretion in refusing to extend or waive the time limit and dismissing the appellant's request for reconsideration as untimely filed. Accordingly, we reverse OPM's dismissal of the appellant's request for reconsideration as untimely filed. <span class="Italic">Kent</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 103, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Neglect of counsel does not excuse an untimely reconsideration request. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Young v. OPM</span>, 78 Fed. Appx. 111 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Sparks v. OPM</span>, 679 Fed. Appx. 1011 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP) (Board properly considered a number of factors when it affirmed OPM's decision that a reconsideration request was untimely, including medical reports and information about appellant's activities, including administrative matters, during the time leading to the period for filing the reconsideration request).</p>
