<p class="noindent">The particularized need test requires the union to articulate to management with some specificity why it needs the requested information. FLRA offered in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 2343</span>, 52 FLRA 1195, 1206 n.11 (1997), that "[n]ot knowing what a document contains does not prevent a union from explaining, with specificity, why it <span class="Italic">needs</span> to know what that document contains." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2343</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2343 v. FLRA</span>, 144 F.3d 85, 87-90 (D.C. Cir. 1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Interpreting section 7114(b)(4)(B), this court requires that unions demonstrate "particularized need" for information they seek. <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base v. FLRA</span>, 104 F.3d 1396, 1400 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (citing <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 523, 531-32 (D.C. Cir. 1992)). In response to a union request for information, the employer must balance the union's particularized need against its own countervailing anti-disclosure interest. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Allenwood Fed. Prison Camp v. FLRA</span>, 988 F.2d 1267, 1270 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Applying the "particularized need" standard, the Authority requires a union to "articulat[e], with specificity, why it needs the requested information, including the uses to which the union will put the information and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute." <span class="Italic">IRS, Wash., D.C., and IRS, Kansas City Serv. Ctr., Kansas City, Mo.</span>, 50 F.L.R.A. 661, 669 (1995). Because enabling the employer to weigh its privacy interests against the union's disclosure interests is one of the purposes of the articulation requirement, the union ordinarily may not rely upon conclusory assertions of need. <span class="Italic">See Allenwood Fed Prison Camp</span>, 988 F.2d at 1271; <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, 50 F.L.R.A. at 670.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case arises from a February 1993 disturbance in a federal penitentiary in Marion, Illinois. Immediately after correctional officers released an inmate named Baptiste from segregated confinement into the prison recreation area, Baptiste "squared off" to fight another inmate, causing several officers--one of whom was injured in the incident--to subdue Baptiste and return him to the segregation unit. Afterwards, a supervisor accused Officer Aubrey Francis, one of the officers who removed Baptiste, of using excessive force. When the matter was referred to the Bureau of Prison's Office of Internal Affairs, Francis was placed on "home duty" for the duration of the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2343 filed a grievance alleging that by releasing an inmate with known violent tendencies into the general prison population, the penitentiary violated the collective bargaining agreement's health and safety provision. Seeking a complete investigation of all supervisors involved in the incident, the grievance accused the penitentiary of:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a systematic and calculated effort on the part of the above mentioned supervisors to violate the civil rights of these two inmates and force staff into a position of having to fight an inmate when there was no need. Because of this effort on these individuals [sic] part one Officer is at home on "home duty" because of a memo <span id="Page_301"></span>written by a supervisor and one Officer is hurt and may never work again trying to transport Baptiste back to 1 Unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Asserting that it had legitimate reasons for releasing Baptiste, the penitentiary denied the grievance. The Union then invoked the collective bargaining agreement's arbitration clause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Preparing for arbitration, the Union asked the penitentiary for all materials in its possession relating to the Baptiste incident, saying only that it needed the information "to prepare the case for arbitration." When the penitentiary failed to respond, the Union made a second request, this time invoking section 7114(b)(4) and stating that it needed the information to "effectively carry out its representational obligation in processing of a grievance (in this case the arbitrational hearing)" because "[m]anagement has this information to present during the arbitration and the Union needs this same information so it may effectively present its case." The penitentiary denied the request, concluding that the Union had failed to articulate particularized need since "none of the allegations of staff misconduct were substantiated by the investigation report you are requesting." The Union then filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reviewing <span class="Italic">in camera</span> two OIA reports--one concerning the Francis investigation and the other an allegation that a correctional officer made a false statement during the investigation--the administrative law judge found that because both reports included information supporting the Union's claim that correctional officers knew of Baptiste's violent tendencies, the information was "necessary" for purposes of section 7114(b)(4)(B). Because the ALJ also found that the Union failed to establish "particularized need" for the documents, however, he concluded that the penitentiary's refusal to furnish them did not violate the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Over the dissent of one member, the Authority adopted the ALJ's conclusion. Characterizing as "conclusory" the Union's claim that it "needed the information to prepare for arbitration of its previously filed grievance," the Authority found that the Union failed to articulate particularized need for the documents. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Penitentiary, Marion, Ill.</span>, 52 F.L.R.A. 1195, 1202 (1997). The Authority then examined the grievance itself to decide whether, notwithstanding the Union's failure to articulate particularized need, the penitentiary could have made a reasoned judgment about its obligation to disclose the information. Acknowledging that the Union claimed at the hearing before the ALJ that it was grieving both whether Francis was wrongly placed on home duty and whether correctional officials created a safety risk by releasing Baptiste, the Authority concluded, based on its reading of the original grievance--the only document the agency had before it when it rejected the Union's request--that the home duty issue "was not one that the [penitentiary] had reason to know was part of the arbitration for which the Union requested information." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1203. Also finding that "the Union never explained to the [penitentiary] why it needed the information developed by the OIA investigation of [Francis] in order to show that the inmate's release adversely affected health and safety," <span class="Italic">id.</span>, the Authority ruled that the penitentiary had not committed an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Authority's decision turned in no small part upon its interpretation of the scope of the Union's grievance, we must first consider whether the Authority erred in finding that the grievance presented only the health and safety issue and not whether Francis was wrongly placed on home duty. Although the parties disagree about the proper standard of review--the Union argues that our review is <span class="Italic">de novo</span> while the Authority urges us to review for substantial evidence--we need not resolve that issue because we conclude that under any standard of review the Authority got it right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">From the plain language of the grievance, we think it unmistakable that the Union complained only about the safety consequences of releasing Baptiste, not about placing Officer Francis on home duty. Not only does the entire grievance focus on the decision to release Baptiste, but the grievance never alleges that placing Francis on home duty was improper. It mentioned Francis only to illustrate that Baptiste's release had unfortunate consequences. To be sure, the Union later claimed at the hearing before the ALJ that it was grieving the Francis issue. At the time the penitentiary decided against delivering the documents, however, it had before it only the Union's written grievance. It therefore had notice only of the Union's intent to grieve the health and safety issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question, then, is whether the Authority erred by finding that the Union failed sufficiently to articulate the connection between the information it wanted and its interest in grieving the health and safety issue. Conceding that it told the penitentiary no more than that it needed the information to prepare for arbitration, the Union argues that this suffices to satisfy the particularized need test because the connection between the information and the grievance is "self-evident." There may well be cases where the connection between the information a union seeks and the grievance is so clear that the union's need is self-evident. That might have been the case here if the reports at issue were entitled "Health and Safety Effects of the Penitentiary's Decision to Release Baptiste into the General Prison Population." But the reports in this case concerned events at least one step removed from the decision to release Baptiste. The reports related only to Officer Francis's activities on the day of the incident and an alleged false statement made in connection with the Francis investigation. Under these circumstances, the Authority reasonably concluded that the Union's need for the documents was not self-evident. The Authority requires unions to articulate particularized need to ensure that in cases like this, where the documents sought are not obviously relevant to the subject of the grievance, the employer has sufficient information about exactly why the union needs the information in order to weigh the union's interest against any countervailing interest the employer might have in privacy and non-disclosure. Because the reports the Union wants in this case could contain all sorts of material--some of which the Union may need but some of which it may not--merely stating that it needs the reports to prepare for arbitration does not give the employer sufficient information to weigh the competing interests in any meaningful way.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relying on <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span> and <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, the Union argues that where, as here, the requested documents discuss a specific incident about which the Union has filed a grievance, particularized need is automatically established. The Union points to our statements in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> that a union "may" meet the particularized need standard when it has a grievable complaint covering information regarding agency action against an employee and that "disclosure normally should obtain" if a duty imposed by statute or contract with respect to predecisional deliberation "ground[s] a grievable claim of right in the employee or union," <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d at 532-33. Not only does nothing in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> hold that the existence of a grievance always suffices to establish particularized need, but in subsequent decisions, both this court and the Authority required unions to "articulate" particularized need. <span class="Italic">See Allenwood Fed. Prison Camp</span>, 988 F.2d at 1271; <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, 50 F.L.R.A. at 669-70. The articulation requirement gives content to the "particularized" part of the test by requiring not just that there be a need--a standard that unions probably could meet whenever seeking information in connection with a grievance--but also that unions explain with some specificity why they need the information. Nor does <span class="Italic">Scott</span> support the Union's argument. Seeking a disciplinary letter issued by the base to a supervisor who allegedly struck an employee, the union in that case went well beyond simply saying that the letter concerned the events involved in the grievance. It articulated a specific reason for needing the letter--to know whether (and if so how) the base had already disciplined the supervisor so it could determine whether to pursue arbitration. <span class="Italic">See Scott</span>, 104 F.3d at 1400-01; <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Ill.</span>, 51 F.L.R.A. 675, 677 (1995); <span class="Italic">see also Department of Justice, INS, N. Region, Twin Cities, Minn. v. FLRA</span>, No. 97-1388, slip op. at 9, 1998 WL 271092 (D.C. Cir. May 29, 1998) (finding that union met need test by asserting it needed documents to compare discipline that employee had received with discipline received by other employees committing similar offenses).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Authority's application of the particularized need test requires it to predict the contents of documents to which it has not yet had access, as well as to reveal its strategy for the upcoming arbitration. We share this concern. The Authority may not, as it clearly recognizes, <span class="Italic">see IRS, Kansas City</span>, 50 F.L.R.A. at 670 n.13, apply the particularized need test to ask unions the impossible--to describe documents they have not seen--or to require unions to reveal so much about their need for the information that employers will enjoy an unfair advantage at arbitration. In this case, the Authority did neither. As we read the Authority's decision, the Union could have satisfied its obligation to articulate particularized need merely by saying that it needed the information to determine whether correctional officers knew about Baptiste's violent tendencies. Such a statement would neither require knowledge of the documents nor reveal strategic information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that the particularized need test asks unions to walk a fine line between saying too little and saying too much.&#x2003;While we emphasize here that the Authority must not require unions to say too much, we conclude that the Authority committed no error by finding that, in this case, the Union said too little.</p>
<p class="noindent">The contours of the imprecise "particularized need" test were examined in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Forrest City and AFGE Local 0922</span>, 57 FLRA 808 (2002), <span class="Italic">enforcement granted in part remanded for further consideration</span>, <span class="Italic">FLRA v. DOJ</span>, 395 F.3d 845 (8th Cir. 2005), <span class="Italic">post</span>, involving requests for an investigative manual and records of comparable discipline. The principles distilled from the case are that: the union must articulate a connection between the particular information that it requests, the uses for the information, and the representational purposes for supporting the request; the union is not required in its request to describe the exact nature of the respondent's alleged misapplication or violation of policy, procedure, law or regulation; and whether the requested information would accomplish the union's purpose is not determinative of whether it is necessary within the meaning of the Statute. Under <span class="Italic">FCI Forrest City</span>, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 812-15:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_302"></span>1.&#x2003;Applicable Framework</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To demonstrate that information is "necessary" a union "must establish a particularized need for the information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs the requested information, including the uses to which the union will put the information, and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute<span class="Italic">." IRS, Kansas City,</span> 50 FLRA at 669 (footnote omitted). In addition, the union's responsibility for articulating its interests in the requested information requires more than a conclusory assertion and must permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether the disclosure of the information is required under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 670. The agency is responsible for establishing any countervailing anti-disclosure interests and, like the union, must do so in more than a conclusory way. <span class="Italic">Id. See also Health Care</span> <span class="Italic">Financing Admin., </span>56 FLRA 156, 159 (2000) <span class="Italic">(HCFA). </span>Such interests must be raised at or near the time of the union's request. <span class="Italic">See IRS, Austin Dist. Off., Austin,</span> <span class="Italic">Texas, </span>51 FLRA 1166, 1180 n.14 (1996) <span class="Italic">(Austin Dist. Off</span>.) (finding of violation based on response at time of request, not some later time).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Application of the framework to the information requested in this case</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003; SIS Manual, Investigatory Policy Documents, and Disciplinary Policy Documents</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has not established that the Judge incorrectly determined that the Union had established a particularized need for the requested SIS Manual, investigatory policy documents, and disciplinary policy documents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's request clearly informed the Respondent that it needed the requested information for several reasons, specifically, to determine: (1) whether the investigation of Hendrickson was conducted in accordance with applicable Agency policy; (2) who had the authority to resolve issues of employee conduct without imposing discipline; (3) whether Hendrickson was treated differently than other employees; and (4) whether to file a grievance concerning the discipline of Hendrickson. The request clearly notified the Respondent that the Union intended to examine whether the investigation of Hendrickson was consistent with Agency policies concerning investigations of employee conduct and that it needed information as to those policies in order to make that examination. The Union had a similar intent with respect to the Agency's policies regarding the imposition of discipline. The results of its examination would enable it to decide whether to file a grievance concerning the Hendrickson discipline. In short, the Union's explanation established a connection between the particular information that it was requesting, the uses to which that information would be put, and the representational purposes for which it was requested.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the Respondent's contention that the Union had identified no irregularities in the Hendrickson investigation, a union is not required in its request to describe the exact nature of the respondent's alleged misapplication or violation of policy, procedure, law or regulation. <span class="Italic">See HCFA, </span>56 FLRA at 162. With respect to the contention that the Union has not shown how the requested information would enable it to demonstrate disparate treatment, the Authority has stated previously that whether requested information would accomplish a union's purpose is not determinative of whether it is necessary within the meaning of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See IRS, Kansas City, 50 </span>FLRA at 673....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Respondent has not demonstrated that the Judge erred in finding that the Union established a particularized need for the requested SIS Manual, investigatory policy documents, and disciplinary policy documents. Consequently, we deny the Respondent's exception in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003; Hendrickson Investigatory File</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the Agency failed to establish that the Judge erred in finding that the Union established a particularized need for the Hendrickson investigatory file.&#x2003;First, the Respondent contends that the decision to discipline Hendrickson was based on the disciplinary file and not the investigatory file. Second, the Respondent contends that the Union did not establish that it had any reason to believe that there was exculpatory evidence in the investigatory file. The Respondent's contentions miss the point.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the first contention, the Union made clear that it intended, at least in part, to examine whether the investigation leading up to the disciplinary action was consistent with the Respondent's policy and whether that file contained exculpatory evidence. The second contention assumes that the Union should have had some knowledge of the contents of the file. However, since it had no previous access to that information, the Union would not have had any knowledge of those documents. Neither of these contentions demonstrates that the Judge erred in finding that the Union's request established a particularized need for the requested file.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Respondent has not demonstrated that the Judge erred in finding that the Union established a particularized need for the requested Hendrickson investigatory file.&#x2003;Consequently, we deny the Respondent's exception in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003; List of Disciplinary and Adverse Actions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find that the Judge erred in concluding that the Union established a particularized need for the requested list of disciplinary and adverse actions. In this regard, we note that the Authority has consistently recognized that a union establishes a particularized need under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) for requested information where the request provides "sufficient specification of both the uses to which the information would be put and [the] connection between the uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute." <span class="Italic">United States</span> <span class="Italic">Dept of Justice, INS, Northern Region, Twin Cities,</span> <span class="Italic">Minn., </span>52 FLRA 1323, 1331 (1997) <span class="Italic">(INS, Twin Cities),</span> <span class="Italic">aff'd, United States Dept of Justice, INS, No. Region,</span> <span class="Italic">Twin Cities, Minn. v. FLRA, </span>144 F.3d 90 (D.C. Cir. 1998). <span class="Italic">See also Austin Dist. Off., </span>51 FLRA at 1178; <span class="Italic">United States Dept of Transportation, FAA, New</span> <span class="Italic">England Region, Bradley Air Traffic Control Tower,</span> <span class="Italic">Windsor Locks, Conn., </span>51 FLRA 1054, 1067-68 (1996); <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City, 50 </span>FLRA at 672. However, where the information sought is broader than the circumstances covered by the request, and the union has not been able to establish a connection between the broader scope of the information requested and the particular matter referenced in the request, the Authority has found that the union has not established a particularized need for that information. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Customs Service,</span> <span class="Italic">South Central Region, New Orleans Dist, New Orleans,</span> <span class="Italic">La., </span>53 FLRA 789, 799 (1997); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 1391, 1395-96 (1996); <span class="Italic">United States Dept of Labor, Washington, D.C., </span>51 FLRA 462, 476 (1995) <span class="Italic">(Dept. of Labor).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that the Union failed to establish a particularized need for the list of disciplinary and adverse actions, despite the Respondent's repeated requests for clarification of the Union's need for the type and breadth of information sought.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, the record reveals that the Union initially requested "copies of all disciplinary and adverse action files on all employees at FCI-Forrest City," including "the charges, action taken, and the pay grades of each individual." The Union did not explain why it needed information for all employees and for <span class="Italic">all </span>types of disciplinary and adverse actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Union did not identify the uses to which that information would be put. The Respondent timely responded to the Union's request, stating that the Union had failed to provide sufficient information to create a particularized need. In particular, the Respondent noted that the Union failed to indicate why it needed the information, how the information would be used, and how the use of the information would relate to the Union's representational responsibilities under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its second request for the information, the Union stated that the information would be used to determine if the Respondent was "consistent in disciplinary actions taken against bargaining unit employees, compared with the disciplinary actions taken against supervisors." The Union added that the information "will be used to survey the comparisons between exempt, and non-exempt employees...[and] will also be used to compare the action taken on cases similar in nature." The Respondent timely responded to this second request and, in its response, stated that the Union had failed to provide a sufficient basis to establish a particularized need for the requested information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nowhere in the Union's first or second requests is there any reference to the Hendrickson suspension or an indication that the information was needed for the possible representation of a bargaining unit employee. Likewise, nowhere in the two requests is there any indication as to any other representational purpose for which the requested information would be used. A mere assertion that the Union intended to make comparisons between disciplinary actions taken against employees and those taken against supervisors does not, standing alone, meet the statutory requirement to articulate, with specificity, why the Union needed the information, including the uses to which the information would be put and the connection between those uses and the Union's responsibilities in adequately representing its members. <span class="Italic">See IRS,</span> <span class="Italic">Kansas City, 50 </span>FLRA at 669-70. As the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City, </span>a request need not be so specific as to require a union to reveal its strategies or compromise the identity of potential grievants who desire anonymity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 670 n.13. However, a union must still identify, with sufficient specificity, the representational purposes to which the requested information will be put. Here, there was no such specificity provided in the Union's first and second requests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Not until the third information request did the Union reference the Hendrickson suspension and the possible filing of a grievance on Hendrickson's behalf. However, the Union's July 30 request, although now confined to a particular time period, continued to request all disciplinary and adverse action records within that stated time period in order to compare discipline in similar cases against unit employees, rather than solely in connection with the discipline in the Hendrickson case. <span id="Page_303"></span>In addition to the previous requests, it sought to have the information as to disciplinary actions coded as to race, gender, and national origin.[10] Further, referencing the complaint of an unnamed unit employee, it claimed to need the information to compare disciplinary actions based on race, gender, and national origin. In replying to the July 30 request, the Respondent noted that, in that request, the Union indicated it was "making [the] request on behalf of Mr. Hendrickson," but that it also "now refer[s] to a bargaining unit member and further without specificity on race, gender, and ethnic origin." In this manner, the Respondent indicated to the Union that it had failed to specify whether and how all the information sought was needed for a grievance concerning Hendrickson or to indicate whether it was needed for some other employee. This reply was sufficient to apprise the Union that additional specificity to support the request was needed. However, the Union did not provide any further explanation to the Respondent.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;In this regard, the Union noted that coding the information would allow it to make "a more specific request if necessary." The Union's statement suggests that it recognized that it was requesting more information than it might ultimately need.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that the Union's requests concerned general issues related to disparate treatment of unit employees, and were not related solely to the Hendrickson suspension. Nothing in the record indicates that the Union attempted to clarify its request to apply only to information concerning offenses similar to that involving Hendrickson. Thus, while some of the information requested may be the type of information that would be needed to compare the Respondent's discipline of Hendrickson to the discipline of, e.g., similarly situated nonunit employees, or other employees based on race, gender, or national origin, not all of the requested information would be necessary for that purpose. The Union did not further explain the manner in which the remainder of the information would have any connection to demonstrating disparate treatment of Hendrickson with respect to similarly situated employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, in the instant case, as in <span class="Italic">Dept of Labor, </span>the Union has established "a need for <span class="Italic">some </span>disciplinary...records to compare with the [similar discipline] given [the employee it is representing]," but it does not "explain why [it] needs the information it has requested[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 476. The Authority concluded in <span class="Italic">Dept of Labor </span>that the union had not established a particularized need for the scope of the information requested. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Dept of Labor, </span>and for the same reasons, the Union in this case has not established a particularized need for the list of disciplinary and adverse actions which it requested.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;The fact that the Union established a particularized need for most of the information it requested clearly shows that the Union was aware of the steps that it was required to take to satisfy a showing of need under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4), and that these steps did not impose an insurmountable burden on the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Judge erred in finding that the Union established a particularized need for the requested list of disciplinary and adverse actions and reverse the Judge's finding of a violation of the Statute on that ground.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Eighth Circuit returned <span class="Italic">FCI Forest City</span> for reconsideration, <span class="Italic">FLRA v. DOJ</span>, 395 F.3d 845, 850-51 (8th Cir. 2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed the Bureau violated the Statute and committed unfair labor practices.&#x2003;This case is concerned only with the scope of the Authority's order remedying the unfair labor practices. Specifically, we ask whether the Authority's order, which apparently requires the Bureau to turn over the entire SIS Manual to AFGE, was arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion. In essence, we ask whether the Authority had the authority to issue such a broad order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude the Authority abused its discretion in issuing such a broad remedial order.&#x2003;The Bureau committed an unfair labor practice by not furnishing AFGE with information about the Bureau's policies on employee investigations. Clearly the Bureau was required to furnish AFGE with those portions of the SIS Manual that could assist AFGE in representing the disciplined employee. However, the Bureau is not required to furnish AFGE with information bearing no relationship to AFGE's representational duties. Forcing the Bureau to produce the entire, limited use, highly sensitive SIS Manual without explaining why such expansive production is an appropriate remedy is arbitrary, and the Authority abused its discretion in issuing such a broad order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding our conclusion that the Authority arbitrarily issued such a broad order, and, in doing so, abused its broad discretion, we suspect the Authority did not really intend to abuse its discretion and force the Bureau to furnish AFGE with the entire SIS Manual. We glean this intent from language used by both the ALJ and the Authority in rendering their decisions. Although the ALJ and the Authority ordered the Bureau to furnish AFGE with "the SIS Manual," each used language indicating their orders were not so broad. After conducting an <span class="Italic">in camera</span> review of the SIS Manual, the ALJ specifically noted the Bureau "had an obligation...to supply [AFGE] with the Chapter or Chapters dealing with staff misconduct and employee investigations." Thus, the ALJ apparently, and quite correctly, intended to limit the scope of the Bureau's disclosure. The Authority also indicated some limitation on the scope of its order. Addressing the Bureau's argument that the ALJ's order requiring the Bureau to furnish the entire SIS Manual was too broad, the Authority held the ALJ's "recommended order is sufficiently specific to put [the Bureau] on notice as to what is required, and any disputes as to particular information covered by the order in this regard should be resolved in compliance proceedings." If the Bureau were required to furnish AFGE with the entire SIS Manual, we doubt either the ALJ or the Authority would have used such equivocal language.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regardless of whether the Authority intended to limit the scope of its remedial order as it related to the SIS Manual, the order itself clearly requires the Bureau to furnish AFGE with the entire SIS Manual, even if portions of the SIS Manual are irrelevant to AFGE's needs. Because such a broad, unguided order is arbitrary and an abuse of discretion, we set aside the Authority's order as it relates to requiring disclosure of the entire SIS Manual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We would prefer to use our authority to modify or interpret the Authority's order in a way that would end this seemingly senseless litigation. Indeed, the Bureau contends we can interpret the Authority's order to do just that. The Bureau argues the Authority's order that the Bureau furnish AFGE with the SIS Manual "is most reasonably interpreted as requiring [the Bureau] to provide [AFGE] with all sections of the manual that deal with employee investigations. [The Bureau] has done this. Accordingly, it has fully complied with the Authority's order and the Court should deny the [FLRA]'s petition for enforcement." Unfortunately, we do not have sufficient evidence before us to determine what portions of the SIS Manual are relevant to AFGE's representational duties or whether the Bureau has complied with the Authority's order. We also emphasize the Bureau committed the unfair labor practices that started this litigation. The Authority has the near-absolute power to remedy those unfair labor practices by ordering the Bureau to furnish AFGE with the relevant portions of the SIS Manual. We believe the Authority should have an opportunity to issue an amended order clarifying what portions of the SIS Manual must be released.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we set aside the Authority's order, in part, and remand the case to the Authority to issue an amended order that specifically addresses the portions of the SIS Manual the Bureau is required to furnish AFGE. We suggest the amended order specifically list the relevant pages, or portions of pages, of the SIS Manual that remedy the unfair labor practices and order the Bureau to furnish only those limited, and precise, portions of the SIS Manual. By using exacting language as to what portions of the SIS Manual the Bureau must turn over to AFGE, the Authority will, hopefully, finally end this dispute over a one-day suspension without further appellate review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the preceding reasons, we grant, in part, the FLRA's application for enforcement of the Authority's order. Because the Authority's order is too broad as it relates to the SIS Manual, we set aside the Authority's order that the Bureau furnish AFGE with the entire SIS Manual, and remand to the Authority to resolve conclusively--and in no uncertain terms--the scope of the order concerning the SIS Manual, identifying the specifically relevant portions to be produced.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Although a casual observer could complain about the follies of the federal government in spending countless hours and dollars engaged in this protracted litigation emanating from a one-day suspension of a federal employee, perhaps a quote from President Harry S. Truman might lessen the blow of this inefficiency: "Wherever you have an efficient government you have a dictatorship." Robert I. Fitzhenry, <span class="Italic">The Harper Book of Quotations</span> 184 (3d ed. 1993). This case reveals our Nation certainly does not bow to a dictatorship, but, alas, remains a Republic guided by the Rule of Law, no matter how inefficiently it may operate.</p>
<p class="noindent">Turning to its task on remand, FLRA modified its earlier remedial order, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Forrest City and AFGE Local 922</span>, 62 FLRA 308, 308-11 (2007):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case arose when a bargaining unit employee (hereinafter the employee) at the Federal Correctional Institution, Forrest City, Arkansas, requested and took annual leave. Questions subsequently arose regarding the employee's actions leading up to the leave approval, and the Respondent conducted an investigation. The employee ultimately received a one-day suspension for absence without leave and dishonest conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Considering a possible grievance, the Union requested the SIS Manual and other documents under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute) to determine whether the Respondent properly conducted its investigation into the employee's conduct. It is the Respondent's refusal to provide the SIS Manual to the Union that gives rise to the dispute in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_304"></span>A.&#x2003;Authority Decision in 57 FLRA 808</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint alleged that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of the Statute by failing to provide the Union with information requested under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) in connection with a disciplinary action against the employee. Specifically, as relevant herein, the Union requested the SIS Manual and any and all operations memoranda, program statements, and manuals that provide guidance on the conduct of investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Law Judge (Judge) determined that the Union had established a particularized need for the SIS Manual as required under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) and concluded that the Respondent had violated the Statute by failing to disclose that information. Specifically, as to the Manual, the Judge found that the Union established a need for, and the Respondent had an obligation to provide, "the Chapter or Chapters dealing with staff misconduct and employee investigations." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Federal Bu. of Prisons, FCI, Forrest City, Ark.,</span> 57 FLRA 808, 827 n.4 (2002) (<span class="Italic">FCI, Forrest City I</span>). Based on that finding, the Judge recommended an order that, as relevant herein, required the Respondent to provide the Union with "the SIS [M]anual and any and all operations memoranda, program statements, and manuals that indicate how an investigation should be conducted[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 832. The recommended order did not specify the portions of the SIS Manual that were to be provided to the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority rejected the Respondent's exceptions regarding disclosure of the SIS Manual and, in agreement with the Judge, determined that the Respondent violated the Statute by failing to provide that Manual. The Authority determined that the Judge's recommended order was "sufficiently specific to put the Respondent on notice as to what is required, and any disputes as to particular information covered by the order in this regard should be resolved in compliance proceedings." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 817. The Authority's order required the Respondent to provide the Union with the SIS Manual and any and all investigatory policy documents, but did not specify which portions of the SIS Manual were to be provided to the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Court of Appeals Decision in FCI, Forrest City II</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent provided the Union with Chapter 9 of the SIS Manual pertaining to investigations of employee misconduct, as well as other portions of the Manual. <span class="Italic">FCI, Forrest City II</span>, 395 F.3d at 848 (quoting Union's Letter to the Court, dated April 27, 2004). The Authority filed an enforcement action with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit seeking release of the entire SIS Manual. In response, the court found that the Respondent was "required to furnish [the Union] with those portions of the SIS Manual that could assist [the Union] in representing the disciplined employee[,]" but was not required to furnish "information bearing no relationship to [the Union's] representational duties." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 850. The court noted language in the Judge's and the Authority's decisions that suggested that a narrower order was intended, but found that the order itself required disclosure of the entire SIS Manual. As such, the court set aside the Authority's order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court concluded that it did not have "sufficient evidence" before it "to determine what portions of the SIS Manual are relevant to [the Union's] representational duties or whether the [Respondent] has complied with the Authority's order." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 851. Consequently, the court remanded the case to the Authority for the Authority "to issue an amended order that specifically addresses the portions of the SIS Manual the [Respondent] is required to furnish [the Union]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court suggested, in this regard, that the Authority's amended order "specifically list the relevant pages, or portions of pages, of the SIS Manual that remedy the unfair labor practices and order the [Respondent] to furnish only those limited, and precise, portions of the SIS Manual." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Authority's Order</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon remand, the Authority determined that the record was inadequate for the purpose of complying with the court's decision. Specifically, the SIS Manual was not a part of the record in the case and, thus, there was insufficient evidence for the Authority to make the necessary determinations as to whether the portions of the SIS Manual not already furnished to the Union should be provided to the Union under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The Judge in this case conducted an <span class="Italic">in camera</span> review of the SIS Manual and returned it to the Respondent. <span class="Italic">See FCI, Forrest City I, </span>57 FLRA 808, 827 n.4 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Authority ordered the Respondent to file with the Authority one complete copy of the SIS Manual, as it existed at the time of the Union's original request for information in this case. The Authority stated that the SIS Manual would be made a part of the record of the case and maintained under seal for purposes of <span class="Italic">in camera</span> review by the Authority pursuant to and in compliance with the court's order. The Respondent provided the SIS Manual as ordered by the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the court remand in <span class="Italic">FCI, Forrest City II</span>, our task on remand is to determine the parts of the SIS Manual that are "necessary" for the Union's representational purposes, which are described as those portions of the SIS Manual that are relevant to "whether the [Respondent] properly conducted the employee investigation" that took place in this case. 395 F.3d at 847. Specifically, we must identify the sections of the SIS Manual "that deal with employee investigations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 851.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our <span class="Italic">in camera</span> review of the SIS Manual provided by the Respondent discloses that the Manual addresses more than just employee misconduct investigations. In this regard, for example, the Manual contains provisions that address not only employee disciplinary investigations, but also employee criminal investigations and investigations into inmate misconduct, including inmate criminal activity. Because the underlying proceeding in this case and the Union's request for information pertain only to whether the Respondent properly conducted an investigation into alleged employee misconduct, we confine the release of information from the Manual to matters related to how investigations of employee misconduct are to be conducted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, our review of the SIS Manual indicates that certain portions of the manual pertain to both employee and inmate investigations and to both criminal and disciplinary investigations. With particular regard to Sections 801 through 807 of the Manual, we conclude that while these sections fall within the category of documents covered by the Union's request and must be disclosed, the Agency has a significant interest in ensuring that this information is not disseminated beyond the immediate need of the Union for the information. In view of these unique facts and circumstances, we will condition the disclosure and require that Sections 801 through 807: (1) will not be disclosed further by the Union; (2) will be used only in connection with the Union's representational responsibilities in this case; and (3) will be returned to the Respondent at the conclusion of the proceedings underlying this case. Any disputes concerning these restrictions may be resolved as a compliance matter pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.41(e).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note in this connection that the record of the case that was before the Eighth Circuit does not contain copies of the parts of the Manual actually disclosed.&#x2003;Those portions were provided to the court by the Respondent under seal and were not made part of the record. <span class="Italic">See</span> Letter of Michael Gans, Clerk, United States Court of Appeals, Eighth Circuit, dated June 10, 2004. While the parties are in agreement that Chapter 9 of the Manual, and redacted portions of other chapters, have been disclosed, their descriptions as to those other parts are unclear.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, with the exception of the Program Statement, the Table of Contents, and Chapter 9, we have reviewed the entire Manual to determine what must be released. In so doing, we have identified those sections and/or subsections that relate to the Union's responsibility in connection with employee investigations, and have directed their disclosure. Sections and/or subsections that primarily concern inmate matters or other organizational and operations requirements that do not have a bearing on employee misconduct and investigations are not disclosed. As the Table of Contents, which includes the titles of the Chapters and sections has already been provided to the Union, there is no need here to further describe them. Therefore, and based on the foregoing, we find that the following portions of the SIS Manual are "necessary," within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, and must be disclosed to the Union:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...[portions of manual to be disclosed enumerated by FLRA]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we have carefully reviewed the SIS Manual provided by the Respondent. Pursuant to that review, clarifying the order in our decision in this case, we find that, under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, the foregoing identified material is necessary for the Union's representational purposes in the circumstances of this case. Accordingly, the Respondent is ordered to provide that material to the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the union's request calls for records extending beyond the time encompassed by the events of a grievance, the request is too broad and may be denied (and the union could send another, more tailored, request), as in <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 67 FLRA 534, 538 (2014) (Member DuBester dissenting in part), reviewing an arbitration award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Under Authority precedent, a union's burden of establishing particularized need includes the burden of establishing the necessity of "the scope of the request," including the time period covered by the request.[74] Therefore, a union requesting data that covers a specific period of time must explain why it needs data for that entire period.[75] Where a union requests data for a specific period of time, and the Authority finds no particularized need for that period, the Authority does not separately assess whether the union established a need for <span class="Italic">some</span> of the information within that period.[76] Rather, the Authority finds that no remedy is warranted.[77] Neither party challenges this precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[74] <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 64 FLRA 293, 295 (2009) (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, INS, N. Region, Twin Cities, Minn</span>., 51 FLRA 1467, 1472 (1996), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, 52 FLRA 1323 (1997), <span class="Italic">pet. for review denied</span>, 144 F.3d 90 (D.C.

<p class="noindent-2">[76] <span class="Italic">See NLRB</span>, 60 FLRA 576, 580-81 (2005) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring and then-Member Pope dissenting in part as to finding of no particularized need); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Randolph Air Force Base, San Antonio, Tex</span>., 60 FLRA 261, 264 (2004) (stating that where a union fails to establish a connection between the scope of its information request and the particular matter referenced in that request, particularized need for the request is not established); <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, 51 FLRA at 476-77.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[77] <span class="Italic">See NLRB</span>, 60 FLRA at 581 (setting aside arbitrator's order to post a notice); <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv., S. Cent. Region, New Orleans Dist., New Orleans, La</span>., 53 FLRA 789, 799 (1997) (dismissing ULP complaint because Union did not establish particularized need for entire scope of its request even though judge found it had established particularized need for part of the requested time period); <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, 51 FLRA at 477 (dismissing ULP complaint without issuing remedy).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that the Union failed to established a particularized need for the seven years of attendance records that it requested in Refiled Request 3. However, rather than finding no violation and awarding no remedy, the Arbitrator found that the Union was entitled to a remedy: an Arbitrator-formulated information request to which the Agency could not object on the basis of the Union's lack of need. Awarding a remedy after finding no particularized need for the period of time covered by the Union's request is contrary to the unchallenged Authority precedent described above. Accordingly, we find that the Arbitrator's remedy regarding Refiled Request 3 is contrary to law, and we set it aside.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Customs Serv., S. Cent. Reg. and NTEU Chap. 168</span>, 53 FLRA 789, 798-99 (1997), adopted the ALJ's decision that a request for information on demotions for a four-year period was too broad. It was the union's burden to demonstrate the necessity for the information over that period of time as opposed to a shorter period, e.g., a year. FLRA emphasized the need for unions to avoid overbroad information requests, <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRBPA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-115.html">60 FLRA 576</a>, 580-81 (2005), reviewing and setting aside an arbitration award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The union's responsibility for articulating its interests in the requested information requires more than a conclusory assertion and must permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether the disclosure of the information is required under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 670. Further, the union is required to explain the scope of its request, including, as relevant here, the temporal aspects of its request. <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv., S. Cent. Region, New Orleans Dist., New Orleans, La.</span>, 53 FLRA 789, 799 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Customs Serv.</span>). Thus, if a union requests information that covers a multiple-year period and fails to articulate with requisite specificity why it needs information relating to that extended period, then the Authority will not find a violation of the Statute for failure to provide the information. <span class="Italic">See United States DOL, Wash., D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 462, 476-77 (1995) (<span class="Italic">DOL</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Union's stated need for the requested information involved whether the 2003 details solicitation complied with the parties' agreements, the Union requested extensive information retroactive to 1998. The Union's only explanation for why it was seeking such information was that it needed the information in order "to determine the staffing and case-processing levels and needs of each field office, relative to each other <span class="Italic">and to historical staffing and case-processing patterns</span>." Opp'n, Attachments, Jt. Ex. 7 at 1 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union did not articulate why 5 years' worth of information--as opposed to a lesser or greater time period--was necessary in order for the Union "to determine if the selection of the field office details...was in fact appropriately based upon office staffing and workload needs, or instead upon some other, inappropriate, basis." Although the Arbitrator found that an exchange program was in existence since at least 1989, the Union never explained the significance of information for the years 1998 to 2003 and why that information was required. In this regard, the Union did not explain how the workload and staffing information for all offices in the five years prior to the FY 2003 solicitation was necessary to determine whether the Agency had improperly designated the offices that would participate in the FY 2003 exchange program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously found that the mere existence of information spanning several years is insufficient to establish the necessity for information spanning those same years.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Customs Serv., </span>53 FLRA at 799 (1997) (no need established for data covering a four-year period); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of</span> <span class="Italic">Labor, Washington, D.C.,</span> 51 FLRA 462 (1995) (<span class="Italic">DOL</span>) (union failed to establish particularized need for information covering a five-year period). The Authority also has recognized, in such cases, that while <span class="Italic">some</span> of a union's requested information may be necessary in order for representational purposes, a union seeking to establish a particularized need must show that <span class="Italic">all</span> of the requested information is necessary. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., DOL</span>, 41 FLRA at 476. <span class="Italic">See also United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Forrest City, Ark.</span>, 57 FLRA 808, 814 (2002) (Member Pope dissenting in part).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, and consistent with Authority case law, a union must establish a particularized need for requested information <span class="Italic">before</span> an agency is required to come forward with countervailing interests that would militate against the furnishing of such information. In <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army Hdqtrs., Fort Monroe, Va.</span>, 57 FLRA 793, 796 (2002) (Member Pope dissenting in part), for example, the Authority found that an administrative law judge properly considered a respondent's countervailing anti-disclosure interests <span class="Italic">after</span> determining that the union had established a particularized need for the information. Citing <span class="Italic">IRS, Wash., D.C.</span>, the Authority stated that "an unfair labor practice will be found if a union has established a particularized need...for the requested information and either: (1) the agency has not established a countervailing interest; or (2) the agency has established such an interest but it does not outweigh the union's demonstration of particularized need." 50 FLRA at 671. Thus, in assessing whether an agency has unlawfully refused to furnish information, the proper inquiry is, first, whether a union has established a particularized need for the requested information. That showing is not contingent on the presence or absence of countervailing anti-disclosure interests.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See Dept. of Air Force, Randolph AFB and AFGE Local 1840</span>, 60 FLRA 261, 263 (2004) (where information sought is broader than circumstances covered by request, and union has not been able to establish a connection between the broader scope of the information requested and matter referenced in request, union has not established a particularized need for that information).</p>
<p class="noindent">Management must present a cogent and nonconclusory response to an information request supported by a particularized need, as <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, FDC Houston and AFGE Local 1030</span>, 60 FLRA 91, 93-94 (2004), pointed out, determining to be insufficient the agency's claim that disclosure of investigative manuals would compromise its ability to maintain internal security:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To demonstrate that information is "necessary" a union "must establish a particularized need for the information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs the requested information, including the uses to which the union will put the information[,] and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute." <span class="Italic">IRS, Washington, D.C. and IRS, Kansas City Service Center, Kansas City, Mo.</span>, 50 FLRA 661, 669 (1995) (footnote omitted). In addition, the union's responsibility for articulating its interests in the requested information requires more than a conclusory assertion and must permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether the disclosure of the information is required under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 670. The agency is responsible for establishing any countervailing anti-disclosure interests and, like the union, must do so in more than a conclusory way. <span class="Italic">Id. See also Health Care Financing Admin.</span>, 56 FLRA 156, 159 (2000). Such interests must be raised at or near the time of the union's request. <span class="Italic">See IRS, Austin Dist. Off., Austin, Tex.</span>, 51 FLRA 1166, 1180 n.14 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found, and the Respondent does not dispute, that the Union established a particularized need for the SIS Manual. The Respondent contends that the Judge erred in failing to find that its countervailing interest in security outweighed the Union's particularized need for the SIS Manual.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its response to the Union's request, the Respondent noted a security concern related to the disclosure of the SIS Manual, but stated that concern in connection with its assertion of a law enforcement privilege. It did not, at that point, elaborate on its security concern by identifying the portions of the SIS Manual that would compromise prison security if it were released, or explain how disclosure of the information would, in fact, compromise security. The Respondent argued, at the hearing and in its brief to the Judge, that disclosure of the SIS Manual would allow persons subject to investigation to anticipate investigatory techniques and, as result, avoid them. The Judge examined the SIS Manual <span class="Italic">in camera</span> and found nothing to warrant the Respondent's concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's explanation of its countervailing security interest is general and conclusory. As such, even assuming that the claimed countervailing interest was raised in response to the Union's request for the SIS Manual, it is not sufficient to outweigh the Union's demonstration of a particularized need for the information. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Air Force, Scott AFB, Ill.</span>, 51 FLRA 675, 683-84 (1995) (speculation about possible outcomes falls short of establishing agency interests deserving of much weight). <span class="Italic">See also United States Postal Service</span>, 305 NLRB 997, 997-98 (1991) (Board found claim of nondisclosure interest in use of force guidelines because disclosure would allow circumvention of guidelines was unconvincing and speculative).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the union does not provide sufficient information to justify a request for information, the agency should request a statement of reasons. The agency may not flatly refuse the request. <span class="Italic">AAFES, Dallas and AFGE Local 1345</span>, 24 FLRA 292, 306-07 (1986) (ALJ Decision). Although a written request for information may not be specific enough, a subsequent conversation between representatives of the union and management cures the defect if specific information is provided during that conversation. <span class="Italic">DHHS, Region <span id="Page_306"></span>IV, HCFA and NTEU</span>, 21 FLRA 431, 442 (1986) (ALJ Decision). Under the prior "relevance" test, if the request is specific enough that management knew or should have known what information was sought and the relevance to the representational purpose advanced by the request, management was not to request additional information as to relevance and then decline to provide the requested information if the union did not respond. <span class="Italic">IRS, Wash. and NTEU</span>, 32 FLRA 920, 926-27 (1988). FLRA pointed out in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force and AFGE</span>, 49 FLRA 603, 607 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we reject the Judge's conclusion that the complaint in Case No. CH-CA-20193 should be dismissed because, based on the Union's request for the initial IG Report, "Respondent AFLC could not make an informed judgment as to whether or to what extent the information was necessary." Although the Union's request mischaracterized, in part, the origin and content of the IG Report, the request clearly identified the report which was sought, and clearly tied the request to the Union's desire to investigate safety matters involving unit employees. We find the request sufficient to enable the Respondents to determine whether to disclose the report under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute....</p>
