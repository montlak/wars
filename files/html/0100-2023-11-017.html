<p class="Body-Text">The Board's leading hearsay decision is <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. DOJ</span>, 5 MSPR 77, 87, 5 MSPB 150 (1981), an appeal from a suspension. All material facts were disputed. At the hearing, agency witnesses who were not present during the <span id="Page_1457"></span>incidents testified by reading from the investigatory record. Objections to hearsay were overruled. The AJ ruled that the appellant could have examined the witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the events had he desired to do so by calling them as witnesses. The statements in the investigative record relied on by the AJ were purportedly sworn but unsigned. The appellant and three witnesses he called contradicted the version of the events offered in the investigation file. But the AJ accepted as credible and persuasive the unsigned statements offered in the agency file. The AJ found unpersuasive the testimony of appellant and his witnesses without finding their testimony unbelievable or inconsistent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considered irrelevant whether appellant could have called the agency declarants as witnesses. The only question was whether the agency sustained its burden of proof by preponderant evidence. The Board considered well settled the law that relevant hearsay evidence is admissible in administrative proceedings. The value or weight of hearsay, however, depends on the circumstances of each case. The Board noted that "[H]earsay evidence that meets the 'substantial' standard may not have sufficient probative value or weight to meet the preponderance standard. These standards have been distinguished and [set] forth by the Board in <span class="Italic">Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency</span> [1 MSPR 505, 529-30 (1980)]." <span class="Italic">Parker</span> considered the standard of proof--substantial or preponderant evidence--in Board appeals. <span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span> enumerated factors to be considered by an AJ who evaluates hearsay evidence offered to satisfy a burden of proof or defense:</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">1.</span> the availability of persons with firsthand knowledge to testify at the hearing;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">2.</span> whether the statements of the out-of-court declarants were signed or in affidavit form and whether anyone witnessed the signing;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">3.</span> the agency's explanation for failing to obtain signed or sworn statements;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">4.</span> whether declarants were disinterested witnesses to the events, and whether the statements were routinely made;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">5.</span> consistency of the declarants' accounts with other information in the case, internal consistency, and their consistency with each other;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">6.</span> whether corroboration for statements can otherwise be found in the agency record;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">7.</span> the absence of contradictory evidence;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">8.</span> credibility of the declarant when he made the statement attributed to him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board determined that the statements in the agency record--unsigned, lacking explanation for the absence of the declarants or the interest of the declarants in the events of the case--left those statements without even the weight of substantial evidence. The pertinent charges were not sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span> remains the Board's principal decision on the evaluation of the types of evidence. The significance of the decision is more fully appreciated based upon the Board's carefully considered analysis of the role of hearsay evidence in administrative proceedings, 5 MSPR 77, 83-88 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the agency's hearsay evidence was properly admitted at the hearing under well settled law that relevant hearsay evidence is admissible in administrative proceedings.[6] We are also fully aware that hearsay evidence has been held to constitute substantial evidence in some circumstances.[7] We conclude nevertheless that the agency's hearsay evidence is insufficient in the circumstances of this case to sustain the agency's burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Richardson v. Perales</span>[8] is the landmark case recognizing that hearsay may constitute substantial evidence. In that case, the Supreme Court held that hearsay evidence alone was sufficient to defeat a claimant's appeal from a denial of social security disability benefits by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, despite contradictory live testimony of claimant and his personal physician. The hearsay evidence, consisting of five medical reports by physicians who had examined the claimant, was considered substantial evidence. The Court, first, however, expressed its confidence in the underlying reliability and probative value of the medical reports. The Court then concluded that the integrity of the administrative process was not damaged by reliance on the medical reports to refute the contradictory live testimony. Thus, <span class="Italic">Perales</span>, while holding that hearsay alone may constitute substantial evidence, has not, we think, changed the traditional test used both before and after that decision, that the assessment of the probative value of hearsay evidence necessarily rests on the circumstances of each case.[9] Rather, <span class="Italic">Perales</span> has been perceived as a rejection of any rule that hearsay may not <span class="Italic">per se</span> constitute substantial evidence.[10] We adopt that interpretation of <span class="Italic">Perales</span>.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">It still remains for the trier of fact to weigh the probative value of the hearsay evidence in the circumstances of the case. In <span class="Italic">Perales</span>, the Court noted that the medical reports had been prepared routinely by unbiased physicians who had examined the claimant, that such reports were regularly used in the agency's adjudication of hundreds of thousands of disability claims, and that courts had recognized their reliability even in formal trials and had admitted them as an exception to the hearsay rule.[11] In other cases where hearsay alone has been held sufficient to sustain an agency action, other factors entered into the court's determination of the reliability and trustworthiness and hence probative value of the hearsay evidence. For example, in <span class="Italic">Peters v. United States</span>,[12] an agency action was sustained both on the testimony of persons who had spoken to the absent declarants of signed sworn statements and on the signed sworn statements. The court relied heavily on the fact that the witness who testified had spoken to the affiants, and it was possible to test the credibility of the witness testifying as to the hearsay, the accuracy of his recollection of the hearsay statement, and his ability and opportunity to observe the affiant and hear what was said of the hearsay. The court also noted the lack of subpoena power that disabled the agency from calling the affiants.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">School Board of Broward County, Florida v. Dept. of HEW,</span>[13] the court found substantial hearsay relied on to support an administrative finding denying eligibility for federal aid. Following the example of <span class="Italic">Perales</span>, the court looked for assurance of underlying reliability and probative value to determine whether the hearsay evidence constituted substantial evidence. The court stated that two impartial witnesses testified as to statements made to them, that direct evidence was unavailable, that there was no subpoena power for the agency to call witnesses to give direct testimony, and, thus, the case rested on the only available evidence, which was uncontradicted by the School Board.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">More recently in <span class="Italic">Schaefer v. United States</span>,[14] the U.S. Court of Claims affirmed an agency's removal action and held that statements regarding plaintiff's misconduct, signed by three of his co-workers, were of sufficient probative force to constitute substantial evidence. The court found sufficient assurance of the truthfulness of this hearsay evidence, relying on the fact that the individuals signed their respective statements and another person witnesses their doing so and also signed the statement. While noting that in appropriate cases uncorroborated hearsay could constitute substantial evidence, the court pointed out that the statements in this case all contained corroboration in the administrative record.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In other cases decided since <span class="Italic">Perales</span>, courts have not hesitated to dismiss hearsay evidence as insubstantial under the circumstances of the case. In <span class="Italic">Reil v.

The court observed, however, that had the hearsay evidence been the best available and had the government asked the Board to accept it, "the situation could have been entirely different."[17]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1458"></span>In <span class="Italic">Browne v.

In <span class="Italic">Martin v. Secretary of HEW</span>,[19] the court similarly refused to consider a report prepared by a physician who had not examined the claimant as substantial evidence. The court held that "an examination of a claimant adds such significant weight to a medical opinion as to the presence or absence of disability that, without it, the opinion, standing alone, cannot constitute substantial evidence to support a conclusion which relies solely on it..."[20]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Henley v. United States</span>,[21] the court also concluded that the agency's evidence, which was quite similar to the evidence presented in the instant case, was devoid of substantiality. In that case, the agency presented two live witnesses, who were agency employees but who had no direct personal knowledge of the charges against the plaintiff, as well as documentary evidence consisting of mostly unsworn and unsigned statements. The court noted that the entirety of the evidence presented against the plaintiff was non-expert testimony in a situation where the credibility of witnesses was crucial.[22] In criticizing the evidence, the court stated that not only was the evidence primarily unsworn hearsay, but it could not depend on any of the factors that ordinarily redeem hearsay. The court explained: "the already undesirable nature of hearsay was compounded by the inability of the witnesses to verify anything about credibility."[23]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cooper v. United States</span>,[24] the Court of Claims recently found that the decision to terminate an employee on the basis of alleged acts of sexual misconduct was not supported by substantial evidence where the removal was based upon information contained in four paragraphs of an investigatory report. The contents of the report consisted of data excerpted from state arrest records, a police officer's report of interviews with witnesses, and an interview with an investigator. The court, noting that the agency's investigator failed to take the stand at plaintiff's hearing, concluded that this type of evidence was "attenuated and highly unreliable," and at best was "triple hearsay."[25] Although plaintiff never denied the charges against him, and neither testified on his own behalf nor produced any witnesses attesting to his innocence at the hearing, the court believed the inferences from such inaction were insufficient to overcome the lack of evidence supporting plaintiff's removal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[25]&#x2003;At p. 730</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the judicial precedents examining the weight to be given hearsay evidence such as an administrative record, included the following factors in considering the probative value of the hearsay evidence:</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">(1)</span> the availability of persons with firsthand knowledge to testify at the hearing;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">(2)</span> whether the statements of the out-of-court declarants were signed or in affidavit form, and whether anyone witnessed the signing;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">(3)</span> the agency's explanation for failing to obtain signed or sworn statements;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">(4)</span> whether declarants were disinterested witnesses to the events, and whether the statements were routinely made;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">(5)</span> consistency of declarants' accounts with other information in the case, internal consistency, and their consistency with each other;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">(6)</span> whether corroboration for statements can otherwise be found in the agency record;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">(7)</span> the absence of contradictory evidence;</p>
<p class="list2"><span class="list2">(8)</span> credibility of declarant when he made the statement attributed to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the same time, judicial precedent has held no more than that hearsay evidence may be "substantial" evidence to support an administrative determination upon judicial review. As emphasized earlier, we are bound by the statutory standard that precludes our sustaining an agency adverse action under Chapter 75 unless the agency's action is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 U.S.C. 7701(c)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hearsay evidence that meets the "substantial" standard may not have sufficient probative value or weight to meet the preponderance standard. These standards have been distinguished and set forth by the Board in <span class="Italic">Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>[26] for the benefit of presiding officials. The substantial evidence standard requires evidence only of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair minded persons in exercising impartial judgment might reach different conclusions, while the preponderance standard requires evidence that a reasonable person would accept as sufficient to find a contested fact more probably true than untrue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[26]&#x2003;1 MSPB 489, 508-509 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It must therefore be determined whether the agency's evidence in this case has sufficient reliability in the face of contradictory sworn live testimony to meet the preponderance standard. That determination must be made on the basis of the entire record before the Board.[27]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[27]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>., 508.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By not relying on the testimony of the agency's witnesses to support any of his findings of fact, the presiding officer presumably did not accord the testimony any probative value. If that was his intention, then he was correct. The agency witnesses' testimony on the first and second charges was wholly without probative value. The declarants had never made any statements on the subject in the presence of the witnesses. The witnesses were therefore unable to verify the accuracy of the transcriptions or recount what they heard and saw or in any way assess the probativeness of the statements when they were being made. The Board's judgment in this case is consistent with the judgments in <span class="Italic">Browne</span> and <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, in which the court refused to accept as substantial evidence reports of physicians who had not examined the claimant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But in ignoring the agency's testimony and relying on the investigatory record, the presiding official did not avoid the problem of hearsay. The presiding official has in effect, subsequent to the hearing, treated the agency's case as if it had simply offered the investigatory record at the hearing without introducing witnesses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statements that form the basis for the presiding official's findings of fact are hearsay, nevertheless, and the circumstances in which they are relied on dictate what weight they should have in this case.[28] Before accepting the statements as sufficient to sustain the agency's action, a reasoned judgment must be made as to their probative value, using the factors outlined above. The presiding official failed to make that judgment. We do so now.</p>

Cl. 631, 638 (1969), where the court stated that in reviewing an administrative decision, it must concern itself "not only with the mere existence of some evidence at some point in the record, but with the sort and type of that evidence, its credibility and trustworthiness, its relationship to the other evidence, and the amount, type, and credibility of the other evidence."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The court, recognizing the inherent superiority of testimony subject to cross-examination, concluded that the Civil Service Commission could not rationally choose to believe affidavits over oral testimony, unless the latter was inherently incredible.</p>

The appellant was removed for possession and distribution of marijuana. Evidence presented by the agency consisted of only an investigatory memorandum. The Board was required to <span id="Page_1459"></span>evaluate the memo according to whether it was in the form of an affidavit, whether the declarant was a credible and disinterested witness, what the reasons were for failing to obtain or supply sworn statements, and whether other corroborating evidence was in the record. The inspector who compiled the memo was not a witness. The agency presented no statements, under oath or otherwise, from the two employees who had allegedly dealt with the appellant. Those witnesses were not disinterested; they had also been charged with drug distribution. The result was that the investigation report was not considered sufficiently probative to support the agency charges; the removal was reversed:</p>
