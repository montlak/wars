<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-18"><span class="space">4.</span> Effect of Reinstatement of Employee</h4>
<p class="noindent">Termination of an employee presents an interesting issue should an appeal result in reinstatement. Dues deduction is stopped at the point of dismissal from the federal service. Under <span class="Italic">VAMC, Northport and AFGE Local 1843</span>, 25 FLRA 523, 526-28 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1843 v. FLRA</span>, 843 F.2d 550, 556 (D.C. Cir. 1988), an employee who is reinstated after a determination that his termination was unwarranted or unjustified has the option of having his union membership retroactively restored:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...When an agency calculates an employee's backpay award, some payments must be withheld from the award, some payments may not be credited to the employee, and some matters require the exercise of discretion by the affected employee. Thus, the courts have held that an agency must deduct from an employee's backpay award those payments for which the employee is legally obligated, including Federal and state taxes, Federal Insurance Contributions Act ("FICA") payments, retirement and Medicare deductions, annual leave payments, and any withdrawals which were made by the employee from the Civil Service Retirement Fund at the time of his separation. <span class="Italic">Tanaka v. Department of the Navy</span>, 788 F.2d 1552 (Fed. Cir. 1986). However, the courts have held that claims for such items as the monetary equivalent of annual leave, for per diem expenses, for interest, or for private insurance for which the employee only qualified when he was in a civilian technician status, are not lost "pay, allowances, or differentials" which an employee would have earned but for a wrongful discharge and therefore they may not be claimed as part of a backpay award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Polos v. United States</span>, 231 Ct. Cl. 929 (1982), and the cases cited therein.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Some Federal employee benefit programs require the employee to exercise options concerning whether or not to participate in the program and concerning the nature of their participation. When employees who are found to have been wrongfully terminated are reinstated, they are given the option of retroactively participating in these optional programs and paying for them out of their backpay award. Thus, employees may refuse to "purchase" life insurance through the government's program or they may choose varying levels of participation. For employees who are reinstated the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) provides that there will be no life insurance withholdings made from the retroactive pay adjustment of an employee who is retroactively restored to duty with pay after an erroneous separation, suspension or removal. However, if death or accidental dismemberment occurs during the period between the employee's separation, suspension or removal and the finding that <span id="Page_251"></span>the agency action was erroneous, premiums will be withheld from the backpay awarded for the period of separation, suspension or removal and the employee or their estate will be entitled to the benefits which would have accrued to them but for the erroneous agency action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, Federal employees can decide whether or not to participate in the health benefits program, and they have a variety of options regarding the medical insurance they want to choose. An employee who is removed or suspended without pay and whose enrollment in the health benefits program has been terminated is given the option when he is reinstated of having his prior health benefits reinstated retroactive to the date they were terminated or he may enroll in the same program as a new employee. If the employee elects to have the prior enrollment reinstated retroactively, withholdings and contributions must also be made retroactively just as though the erroneous suspension or removal had not taken place and the health benefits coverage is considered to have been continuously in effect, with the employee and any covered family members being entitled to the full benefits of the plan.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">From the above, we conclude that the Federal Personnel Manual's policy regarding retroactive payments for optional programs by an employee who is reinstated after a finding that the employee's removal was unwarranted or unjustified allows an employee to choose whether or not to have those payments made retroactively.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that an employee's decision to become a union member and to pay union dues through checkoff is a voluntary decision like those which an employee makes regarding life insurance and health benefits. Therefore, we conclude, in the absence of any statutory or regulatory constraint requiring a different policy, that the purposes of the Statute are best served by a policy which gives to an employee who is reinstated after a determination that his termination was unwarranted or unjustified the option of having his union membership retroactively restored. If the employee so chooses, he will incur a retroactive obligation for the dues not paid during the period of his termination and the union will be obligated to provide him with any benefits which might have accrued to him as a union member during that period. A reinstated employee should be given the option, alternatively, of joining the union as if he were a newly hired employee and his obligation to the union would then begin only with the signing of a new dues authorization form.</p>
<p class="noindent">The MSPB adopted FLRA's approach in <span class="Italic">Samuels v. USPS</span>, 95 MSPR 30, 33-36, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (2003), <span class="Italic">reopened as to deduction of union dues</span>, <span class="Italic">Samuels v. USPS</span>, 95 MSPR 512 (2004) (addressing complexities of union dues deductions for employees covered by the Postal Reorganization Act):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We first address the appellant's claim that the agency improperly deducted union dues from his back pay award. As noted, according to evidence that the appellant does not dispute, he was a member of both APWU and NAPFE at the time of his removal. He argues, however, that he did not have the benefit of union representation during the period following his removal, and that he never signed any document requesting that union dues be taken out of his back pay award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Back Pay Act provides, in pertinent part, that an employee who is found to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of his pay, allowances, or differentials, is entitled, on correction of the personnel action, to receive for the period for which the personnel action was in effect an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable, which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i). The Back Pay Act applies to preference eligible Postal Service employees who, like the appellant, prevail in appeals before the Board. <span class="Italic">Andress v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 56 M.S.P.R. 501, 506-08 (1993). Regulations promulgated by OPM pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(c) set forth how back pay is to be computed. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805. Those regulations specifically provide that, in computing the net amount of back pay payable under &#x00A7; 5596, an agency must make certain offsets and deductions from the gross back pay award, including authorized deductions of the type that would have been made from the employee's pay (if paid when properly due) in accordance with the normal order of precedence for deductions from pay established by the agency, subject to any applicable law or regulation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(c)(3). Those deductions include, but are not limited to, mandatory employee retirement contributions, social security and Medicare taxes, health benefit and life insurance premiums under certain circumstances, and federal income tax withholdings. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(3)(i)(v); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Tanaka v. Department of the Navy, </span>788 F.2d 1552, 1553 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deducting dues payable to both unions from the appellant's back pay award, the agency reasoned that, had he not been removed, it would have continued to automatically deduct dues from his salary pursuant to his own authorizations. And, the agency asserted, the appellant did not show that he was removed from membership with the unions during the back pay period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) is charged with using its specialized experience in the field of labor relations to give content to the principles and goals set forth in the Civil Service Reform Act<span class="Italic">. Bureau of</span> <span class="Italic">Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms v. FLRA, </span>464 U.S. 89, 97, 104 S. Ct. 439, 78 L. Ed. 2d 195 (1983). "[T]he [FLRA] is entitled to considerable deference when it exercises its special function of applying the general provisions of the [Civil Service Reform] Act to the complexities of federal labor relations." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (internal quotations omitted). Section 7115(b) of that statute provides that an employee's authorization for deduction of union dues terminates when the agreement between the agency and the exclusive representative involved ceases to be applicable to the employee. In examining the case of a federal employee whose removal was reversed by the Board, the FLRA found that an agreement for dues deduction authorization no longer applies to an employee when his employment is terminated. <span class="Italic">American</span> <span class="Italic">Fed'n of Gov't Employees Local 1843, </span>25 F.L.R.A. 523, 526, 1987 WL 90307 (1987), <span class="Italic">petition</span> <span class="Italic">denied, American Fed'n of Gov't Employees Local 1843 v. FLRA, </span>843 F.2d 550 (D.C. Cir. 1988). In the FLRA's view, an employee's decision to become a union member and to pay union dues through automatic payroll deduction is a voluntary decision, and that, in the absence of any statutory or regulatory constraint requiring a different policy, the purposes of its statute are best served by a policy which gives to an employee who is reinstated after a determination that his removal was unwarranted or unjustified the option of having his union membership retroactively restored. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 528. In other words, if the reinstated employee so chooses, he would incur a retroactive obligation for the dues not paid during the period of his removal, and the union would be obligated to provide him with any benefits which might have accrued to him as a union member during that period. Alternatively, he should be given the option of joining the union as if he were a newly hired employee, in which case his obligation to the union would begin with the signing of a new dues authorization form. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In affirming the FLRA's decision finding it proper for the agency not to have deducted union dues from the employee's back pay award, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit found no indication that Congress specifically intended that an employee's dues withholding authorization, having been terminated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7115(b)(1), should be revived automatically by a subsequent reinstatement of that employee after a finding of wrongful discharge<span class="Italic">. American Fed'n of Gov't Employees Local 1843, </span>843 F.2d at 556.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board will usually defer to an administrative interpretation of a statute by an agency charged with its administration when that interpretation is reasonable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., True v. Office of Personnel Management, </span>44 M.S.P.R. 251, 254 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd, </span>926 F.2d 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Because the FLRA's interpretation of its statute is reasonable, we find it appropriate to, and do, defer to it.[3] We find, therefore, that the appellant's obligation to pay dues ended on May 9, 1999, when he was removed, and that, because he did not indicate that he wished his prior dues-paying status to be restored retroactively, the obligation did not automatically revive on July 8, 1999, when he was restored to duty. Therefore, the agency's deduction of dues from his back pay award for the back pay period was improper, and this case must be remanded for a determination of the amount to which the appellant is now entitled. The extent of his entitlement may be affected by the provision found in both authorizations of deductions he signed to the effect that the assignment of funds is irrevocable for the period of one year from the date of delivery, unless written notice is provided to the agency within a distinct time frame. On remand, the parties shall offer evidence and argument in support of their respective positions on this point.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;We do not defer to the rule applied by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in <span class="Italic">Vu v. Postmaster General, </span>EEOC No. 04950020, 1996 WL 197412 (1996), wherein EEOC held that union dues are properly deducted from an employee's back pay award. EEOC is not charged with the administration of either the Federal Labor-Management Relations Statute or the Back Pay Act. We also note that, in finding that the dues deduction was proper, the AJ relied on <span class="Italic">Konieczko</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service, </span>56 M.S.P.R. 660 (1993), wherein the Board stated in a footnote, and without explanation, that it concurred in the AJ's holding that a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, under which the appellant was a dues-paying union member, required deduction of union dues. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 663 n.2. To the extent that our holding today is inconsistent with the statement in <span class="Italic">Konieczko, </span>it is hereby overruled.</p>
