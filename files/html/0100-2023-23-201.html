<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-196"><span id="Page_5062"></span><span class="space">b.</span> Mutual Breach; "Clean Hands"</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If both the agency and the appellant unjustifiably breach related material provisions of a settlement, the appellant's enforcement petition may be dismissed. But the agency may raise the appellant's failure to abide by the agreement without itself filing an enforcement petition. The Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Caston v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 108 MSPR 190, 196, 198 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17, 20-21, 2008 MSPB 42 (2008) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Caston v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 22616 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP No. 2008-3226), <span class="Italic">post</span>), involving the appellant's allegation that the agency breached a confidentiality agreement by releasing case-related materials during an EEO proceeding and the agency's allegation that the initiation of the EEO proceeding violated the appellant's agreement in the settlement to refrain from further litigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has the authority to enforce a settlement agreement which has been entered into the record in the same manner as any final Board decision or order. <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Environmental Protection Agency,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 248, 250 (1981). A settlement agreement is a contract, and the Board will therefore adjudicate a petition to enforce a settlement agreement in accordance with contract law. <span class="Italic">See Greco v. Department of the Army,</span> 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Under contract law, substantial performance by one party is sufficient to require the other party to perform, and a party's performance is considered substantial when there is no material failure of performance. <span class="Italic">Muzzipapa v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. 559, 562 (1994), <span class="Italic">citing</span> Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 237, cmt. d (1981). Whether there has been a material failure to perform depends on the extent to which the injured party is deprived of the benefit reasonably expected from the contract. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at &#x00A7; 241. A party's breach of an agreement is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge found that the appellant breached the agreement, she found that the agency's failure to file a petition for enforcement based on the breach precluded any further consideration of it. This was error. It is well established that a material breach of a contractual promise by one party discharges the other party from his <span id="Page_5063"></span>contractual duty to perform what was exchanged for the promise. <span class="Italic">See Thomas,</span> 124 F.3d at 1442, <span class="Italic">citing</span> Restatement (Second) of Contracts, &#x00A7; 237, cmt. a (1979). In <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> the employing agency's material breach of a settlement agreement's confidentiality provision was found to have discharged the employee from his contractual duty under the agreement to resign from his position. <span class="Italic">Id. See also Muzzipapa,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. at 562 (the appellant's failure to render substantial performance of his promise to have knee surgery removed agency's obligation to reinstate him with back pay). <span class="Italic">Cf. Farrero v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 382, 388 (1998) (a material breach by the appellant of his obligations under the settlement agreement could have precluded his obtaining enforcement of a provision of the agreement violated by the agency, but his delay in performance did not show such bad faith here as to deny him a remedy for the agency's breach), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds,</span> 194 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there can be no doubt that the appellant's promise not to bring further actions concerning the subject matter of his removal appeal was of vital importance to the agency and related to the essence of the parties' contract. The agency's submission in the EEO proceeding of information about the appellant's removal and the subsequent settlement of his appeal was prompted by the appellant's raising of the same matter in that proceeding in violation of the settlement agreement. Certainly it would be inequitable to require the agency to remain silent concerning the removal in order to adhere to the agreement's confidentiality provision when the appellant has also violated that provision as well as his obligation under provision 1 of the settlement agreement not to bring further actions concerning the subject matter of his MSPB appeal. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's breach of the agreement was a material one that discharged the agency from its obligation to perform. We find that the agency is in compliance, and we deny the appellant's request for rescission of the settlement agreement and reinstatement of his appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Caston</span> was affirmed on appeal, <span class="Italic">Caston v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 22616 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP No. 2008-3226):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, Caston first argues that he did not breach the settlement agreement. We conclude that the Board did not err in finding that Caston breached the agreement. Caston "agree[d] not to file <span class="Italic">any</span> additional administrative or judicial actions regarding the <span class="Italic">subject matter</span> of this appeal...." (emphases added). Caston argues we should not construe the settlement agreement to preclude claims of a hostile work environment, even if based on the same factual predicate as the settled MSPB action. We need not decide this issue, however, as Caston raised not only a hostile work environment claim in his EEO complaint, he also raised the issue of his removal, which is indisputably covered by the settlement agreement. Caston thereby breached the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Caston also argues that any such breach was not material. The Board found, and we agree, that Caston's breach is material. "A breach is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance, or goes to the essence of the contract." <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev.</span>, 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (citing 5 Arthur L. Corbin, <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 1104 (1964)). From the agency's perspective the primary value of a settlement agreement is that it settles the dispute with the employee and ends the litigation. Breaching this provision by reinitiating administrative or judicial procedures "goes to the essence of the contract" by completely destroying the most valuable aspect of the agreement for one of the parties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Caston's breach was therefore material.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Caston finally argues that even if he materially breached the agreement, the agency's breach was not excused. We agree with the Board that when Caston materially breached the agreement by filing a complaint alleging discrimination in his removal and settlement, the agency was not obligated to remain silent, but was entitled to defend itself. "In resolving disputes among parties who each claim that the other has breached, courts will '[o]ften...impose liability on the party that committed the first material breach.'" <span class="Italic">Christopher Vill., L.P. v. United States</span>, 360 F.3d 1319, 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (emphasis omitted) (quoting E. Allen Farnsworth, <span class="Italic">Farnsworth on Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 8.15, at 439 (1990)); <span class="Italic">see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 237 (1979) ("[i]t is a condition of each party's remaining duties to render performances...that there be no uncured material failure by the other party...."). This principle applies to settlement agreements of Board appeals. <span class="Italic">See Thomas</span>, 124 F.3d at 1442. Of course, this principle is not without limits; had the agency elected not to terminate the agreement but engaged in an unrelated breach of the agreement in disclosing information to prospective employers, that breach might not be excused by Caston's prior breach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's decision to engage in a responsive breach does not mean that the agency has constructively elected to rescind the agreement; Caston's obligations under the agreement remain in force. <span class="Italic">See Restatement (Second) of Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 237 cmt. a, illus. 1, 2 (1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, the Board correctly held that Caston's material breach of the settlement agreement excused the agency's actions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Advancing beyond <span class="Italic">Caston,</span> the Board announced a "clean hands" approach to enforcement of settlements where the party seeking enforcement has breached the agreement. <span class="Italic">Wofford v. DOJ,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WOFFORD_MISTY_L_DA_0752_02_0325_C_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_562596.pdf">115 MSPR 367</a>, 368-73 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-5, 11, 13-16, 2010 MSPB 249 (2010), applied the doctrine to an appellant who initiated litigation in violation of the settlement and complained of noncompliance by the agency when, during the litigation, the appellant learned the agency maintained information about her prior case, allegedly in violation of the agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the underlying appeal, the appellant challenged her removal from her Immigration Enforcement Agent position. On June 18, 2002, the appellant and the agency executed a settlement agreement. In exchange for the appellant's resignation and dismissal of any and all claims she may have had against the agency arising from her employment, the agency agreed, among other things, to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">within fourteen (14) days of the date of this agreement, purge any and all files it maintains on [the appellant] of any and all negative information, including, but not limited to any and all discipline matters (actual and proposed), all documents...memoranda and files concerning any and all investigations, management inquiries and other examinations of [the appellant's] conduct (including the investigations conducted by Susan Friesenhahn and the Office of Internal Audit);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In executing the agreement, the parties settled all known and unknown claims that the parties might have had against each other arising from the appellant's employment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2008, the appellant filed a discrimination appeal with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), alleging that the agency subjected her to disability discrimination, which ultimately resulted in her removal. In February 2009, she filed a lawsuit against the agency in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, captioned, <span class="Italic">Misty L. Wofford v. Janet Napolitano, Secretary, U.S. Department of Homeland Security</span>, Case No. 2:09-cv-38 (U.S. District Court case), alleging claims of discrimination, hostile work environment, and disparate treatment under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In September 25, 2009, the appellant filed a petition for enforcement with the Board, alleging that, apparently during the U.S. District Court case, she discovered that the agency had not purged negative information about her from the litigation database and the Internal Audit case report. The agency responded that the appellant untimely filed her petition for enforcement and that only in response to the appellant's filing the U.S. District Court case did it seek to locate information concerning the settlement agreement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency moved to dismiss the petition for enforcement based upon the Board's findings in <span class="Italic">Caston v. Department of the Interior</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 190 (2008). Caston's removal appeal was resolved in a written settlement agreement in which the agency agreed to limitations on its ability to disclose information about the adverse action in exchange for the appellant's agreement not to file additional administrative or judicial actions concerning the subject matter of the appeal. Caston later filed an equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint concerning matters covered by the settlement agreement, and the agency's response included a chronology of the appellant's removal and its subsequent rescission per the settlement agreement. The Board held that Caston materially breached the settlement agreement when he filed the EEO action and that this breach discharged the agency from its obligation to perform.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's petition for review fails to establish any error in the compliance initial decision.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appears to argue that she did not breach the settlement agreement in filing a lawsuit against the agency in U.S. District Court. She alleges that the case was dismissed for want of prosecution on March 9, 2010, and thereby "relieved [the agency] of the burden of having to defend this referenced litigation." The appellant's alleged decision not to prosecute her case in U.S. District Court does not erase the fact that she filed the lawsuit. <span class="Italic">See Bables v. Department of the Army</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 171, &#x00B6; 19 (2000) (the mere fact that the agency cured the breach does not mean that there was not one).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We discern no error with the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant breached the agreement based on the appellant's 2008 EEOC complaint and her 2009 U.S. District Court case. The administrative judge found that the agency materially breached the settlement agreement by maintaining the Internal Audit case report.[3]...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In light of this finding, we need not address whether the <span id="Page_5064"></span>agency's decision to maintain information about the appellant in a litigation database violates the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Baig v. Department of the Navy</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 269, 275 ("[a]n agency may retain a separate file containing documents related to the disciplinary action as long as the agency observes appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosures.") (internal citations omitted), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 64 F.3d 677 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the administrative judge's reliance on <span class="Italic">Caston</span> in the compliance initial decision is problematic. First, this matter is factually distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Caston</span>. The Board found that Caston materially breached the settlement agreement when he filed an EEO action, and that this breach discharged the agency of its obligation not to disclose information covered by the confidentiality provisions during the EEO proceedings. <span class="Italic">Caston</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 19-21. Caston's breach in filing an EEO action preceded the agency's "breach" in disclosing information that was required to be kept confidential. However, in this matter, the agency's breach preceded the appellant's breach. The agency breached the agreement in 2002 when it failed to purge the Internal Audit case report within fourteen days of the June 18, 2002 agreement, and then several years later, the appellant breached the agreement by filing complaints against the agency with the EEOC in 2008, and in U.S. District Court in 2009. Consequently, where the agency was the first party to breach the agreement, the <span class="Italic">Caston</span> holding that the appellant's breach discharged the agency's obligation to honor its obligations does not apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the compliance initial decision leaves the impression that the Board applied the doctrine of "unclean hands" in <span class="Italic">Caston</span>; however, this term of art was not used in <span class="Italic">Caston</span>.[4] The clean hands doctrine "closes the doors of a court of equity to one tainted with inequitableness or bad faith relative to the matter in which he seeks relief, however improper may have been the behavior of the defendant." <span class="Italic">Precision Instrument Manufacturing Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co.</span>, 324 U.S. 806, 814 (1945); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Filiberti</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 37, 39 (the clean hands doctrine holds that "the person who seeks equity must do equity"), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 577 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;"[I]t would be inequitable to require the agency to remain silent concerning the removal in order to adhere to the agreement's confidentiality provision when the appellant has also violated that provision as well as his obligation...not to bring further actions concerning the subject matter of his MSPB appeal." <span class="Italic">Caston</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 21. Consequently, the Board held that "the appellant's breach of the agreement was a material one that discharged the agency from its obligation to perform." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We believe that application of the "unclean hands" doctrine is appropriate in this matter. The administrative judge correctly observed that the appellant breached the agreement before she became aware of the agency's breach, and the appellant's breach in filing claims against the agency with the EEOC and in U.S. District Court was clearly a material one. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the appellant's actions were "tainted with inequitableness or bad faith relative to the matter in which [she] seeks relief, however improper may have been the behavior of the [agency]." <span class="Italic">Precision Instrument Manufacturing Co.</span>, 324 U.S. at 814. For these reasons, we affirm the compliance initial decision as modified herein.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "clean hands" doctrine was discussed as to an alleged breach of an employment reference provision of a settlement, <span class="Italic">Butler v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, AT-0752-11-0530-C-1 (NP 8/19/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency filed a cross-petition for review arguing that the administrative judge erred in finding that the agency breached the settlement agreement. Because the appellant materially breached the agreement before the agency disclosed her termination to a third party, her breach discharged the agency from its obligation to perform. <span class="Italic">See Caston v. Department of the Interior</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21 (2008) (finding that the appellant's material breach of the agreement discharged the agency's obligation not to disclose information that was required to be kept confidential).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore GRANT the cross-petition for review and MODIFY the compliance initial decision to VACATE the administrative judge's findings that the agency breached the settlement agreement and the appellant came before the Board with unclean hands.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Precision Instrument Manufacturing Co. v. Automotive Maintenance Machinery Co</span>., 324 U.S. 806, 814 (1945) (the clean hands doctrine "closes the doors of a court of equity to one tainted with inequitableness or bad faith relative to the matter in which he seeks relief, however improper may have been the behavior of the defendant").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Trobovic v. GSA</span>, 608 Fed. Appx. 927, 929 (Fed.
