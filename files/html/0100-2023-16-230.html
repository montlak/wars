<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-230"><span class="space">f.</span> Claims of Attorney Work Product Privilege</h5>
<p class="noindent">Interviews of unit employees may be conducted by agency counsel seeking to develop information to use in an adversarial proceeding or to use in assessing the strength or weakness of an agency's or union's case. The assertion was made that the attorney's work product is reflected through questioning of witnesses and that a union representative's presence impairs or destroys that privilege. FLRA determined that the claim of attorney work product privilege does not exempt it from ensuring that the union has notice of and an opportunity to be present during formal discussions, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Sacramento ALC, McClellan AFB and AFGE Local 1857</span>, 35 FLRA 594, 606-08 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent contends that to allow an employee to have union representation during a management attorney's interview before an upcoming arbitration hearing requires the Respondent to waive its "attorney work product privilege." The "work product" referred to by the Respondent is "the content of statements, opinions, and reports of witnesses obtained by an attorney in preparation for litigation." The Respondent relies on <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service,</span> 9 FLRA 951, in which the Authority held that the agency did not violate the Statute when its attorney interviewed bargaining unit employees in preparation for an unfair labor practice hearing without affording the union an opportunity to be represented at the interviews. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 12-16. In <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span>, the Authority adopted an Administrative Law Judge's rationale, which was based in part on the protection of the attorney work product. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no merit in the Respondent's argument and we reject the Respondent's exception. The question before us is whether the Respondent was required under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute to afford the Union an opportunity to be represented at interviews of bargaining unit employees known to be Union witnesses in a scheduled arbitration hearing. In <span class="Italic">McClellan AFB</span>, the Authority rejected the holding of earlier cases such as <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span> and found that unions must be afforded an opportunity to be represented at interviews of unit employees in preparation for third-party proceedings where the "formal discussion" criteria of section 7114(a)(2)(A) are met. <span class="Italic">McClellan AFB,</span> 29 FLRA at 598-603. Citing the court's discussion in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 774 F.2d 1181, the Authority noted that a union has a representational interest to safeguard in such interviews--to make sure "that its witness was not coerced or intimidated prior to his appearance at the scheduled arbitration hearing." <span class="Italic">McClellan AFB,</span> 29 FLRA at 598.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent has not cited any provision of the Statute or its legislative history which demonstrates that Congress intended to exclude from the coverage of section 7114(a)(2)(A) formal discussions which involve interviews by agency attorneys of unit employees who are known to be scheduled to testify for the union in upcoming third-party proceedings. The Respondent also has not shown how its position would be consistent with the purpose of section 7114(a)(2)(A), as recognized by the court in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span> and by the Authority in <span class="Italic">McClellan AFB,</span> to allow a union to safeguard its representational interest by making sure that its witness is not coerced or intimidated prior to appearing at a scheduled arbitration hearing. In the absence of any demonstration that the Respondent's contention is supported by the terms, the legislative history or the purpose of section 7114(a)(2)(A), we reject the contention.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that we are finding only that the Union has a right to have an opportunity to be represented during a management attorney's interview of an employee where, as here, the interview meets the test of a formal discussion under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. Our decision does not preclude an agency attorney from: (1) interviewing unit employees in preparation for upcoming arbitration or other third-party hearings; or (2) creating documents for the agency's use which reflect the attorney's thoughts or impressions resulting from the interview. Moreover, nothing <span id="page_1501"></span>in our decision requires an agency attorney to disclose to a union his or her thoughts or impressions, whether written or otherwise, resulting from the interview.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, contrary to the Respondent's contention, nothing in our decision would "effectively destroy management's right to prepare its defense and thus destroy its right to a fair hearing." Rather, our decision effectuates the intent of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute to allow a union to safeguard its representational interest by making sure that its witness is not coerced or intimidated prior to appearing at a scheduled arbitration hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Respondent's "attorney work product privilege" claim is not a valid defense to the alleged violation of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">The claim of work product privilege by agency counsel seeking to interview unit employees who may be witnesses in arbitration hearings was again considered, and again rejected, <span class="Italic">DHS, Border &#x0026; Transp. Security Directorate and AFGE Local 1929</span>, <span class="blue">62 FLRA 241</span>, 241-42, 244-47 (2007):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance challenging disciplinary actions taken against a bargaining unit employee, and the grievance was scheduled for an arbitration hearing. As relevant here, on May 21, an Agency labor relations specialist (LRS) notified the Union President that an attorney in the Office of Assistant Chief Counsel wanted to interview another bargaining unit employee (Employee T) in preparation for the upcoming hearing in Arbitration #1. The LRS also informed the Union President that the Union would be permitted to send a representative to the interview, but that the representative at the meeting could not be someone who would be representing the Union at the arbitration hearing (the Arbitration Representative). The reason cited by the LRS for this restriction was "attorney work product privilege." In further explanation, the Assistant Chief Counsel indicated that having the Arbitration Representative present at the employees' interviews would "preclude the Respondent from adequately preparing its case, by requiring the government counsel to either disclose attorney work product or to do an inadequate job of interviewing witnesses."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 26, the Agency's attorney interviewed Employee T. The Union President appeared at the May 26 interview of Employee T to represent the Union, but the Respondent's attorney and the LRS would not permit the Union President to represent the Union during the interview because the Union President was going to be the Arbitration Representative for the Union at Arbitration #1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent does not contest the Judge's finding that the meeting with Employee T constituted a formal discussion, and there is no dispute that the Union was entitled to--and did--receive notice and an opportunity to be represented at the meeting. The primary issue on exceptions is whether the Judge properly rejected the Respondent's attorney work product privilege claim in finding that the Union was entitled to designate the Union President as its representative at the meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that the Respondent failed to comply with &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a) (1) and (8) of the Statute, the Judge relied on <span class="Italic">McClellan II </span>[<span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Sacramento Air Logistics Ctr., McClellan Air Force Base, Cal.,</span> 35 FLRA 594 (1990) (<span class="Italic">McClellan II</span>)]. In that case, the Authority rejected the respondent's reliance on attorney work product privilege as a defense to a failure to comply with &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) and found that, where the formal discussion criteria under that section have been satisfied, unions have a right to be represented during a management attorney's interview of a bargaining unit employee. The Judge further found that the Authority has consistently held that unions have the right to designate their own representatives and an agency's interference with that right violates the Statute. In this regard, the Authority has specifically found that &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute "encompasses not only a union's right to notice of a formal discussion but also the union's right 'to designate its own representative to attend a formal discussion.'" <span class="Italic">Gen. Servs. Admin., Region 9, L.A., Cal.,</span> 56 FLRA 683, 685 (2000) (quoting <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Sacramento Air Logistics Ctr.,</span> <span class="Italic">McClellan Air Force Base, Cal.,</span> 29 FLRA 594, 605-07 (1987) (<span class="Italic">McClellan I</span>)). In <span class="Italic">McClellan I</span>, the Authority reviewed and clarified applicable principles regarding a union's opportunity to be represented at a formal discussion under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). The Authority rejected the holding of earlier cases, such as <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv., Region V,</span> 9 FLRA 951 (1982), and found that unions must be afforded an opportunity to be represented at interviews of unit employees in preparation for third-party proceedings where the formal discussion criteria of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) are met. <span class="Italic">See McClellan I,</span> 29 FLRA at 598-603. The Authority also held that it would examine whether notice received by a union of a formal discussion "was sufficient to establish that the union had an opportunity to be represented at the formal discussion within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), including the opportunity to designate a representative of its own choosing." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 606.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons--</span>and not <span class="Italic">McClellan II--</span>is controlling in the present case. However, as noted by the GC, <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span> did not involve an alleged failure to comply with &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute; rather, it involved an alleged failure to comply with &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B), which sets forth an exclusive representative's right to be represented at investigative examinations of bargaining unit employees. In <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons,</span> the Authority found, with respect to alleged &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) violations, that there is a presumption that a union can designate the individual it wants as its representative during the investigative (<span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>) examination. The Authority further found that an agency can rebut this presumption and "preclude a particular individual from serving as the union's designated representative only where the agency can demonstrate 'special circumstances' that warrant precluding a particular individual from serving in this capacity." <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons,</span> 54 FLRA at 1513 (citing <span class="Italic">NJ Bell,</span> 308 NLRB at 282). Additionally, the Authority noted that "'[s]pecial circumstances' will, consistent with its application in the private sector, be construed narrowly to preserve the union's normal prerogatives." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, unlike <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons,</span> there is no assertion that the interview constituted an investigative examination and there is no alleged violation of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. As such, <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span> is not dispositive and, therefore, the Respondent's exception fails to demonstrate that the Judge erred by applying <span class="Italic">McClellan II </span>and by not applying <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Authority has never applied the special circumstances exception in the context of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), in one instance the Authority set forth the special circumstances exception broadly enough to imply that it might apply in this context. In <span class="Italic">United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kansas,</span> 55 FLRA 704, 713-14 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Leavenworth</span>), the complaint alleged that the respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute by refusing to allow a union president access to a penitentiary in order to teach a class at a training to be held at the penitentiary. The Authority stated that "[a]n exclusive representative has the right to designate its representatives <span class="Italic">when fulfilling its responsibilities under the Statute</span>, and, absent special circumstances, an agency violates section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute when it refuses to honor the union's designation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 713 (emphasis added; citation omitted). The Authority found that a Federal correctional facility has special security concerns that may not be present at other work locations, and, as such, the union's representational rights did not trump the respondent's legitimate security concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Leavenworth</span> suggests that the special circumstances exception applies to any union selection of a representative under the Statute. Here, however, even if the special circumstances exception applies, we find, for the reasons set forth below, that the attorney work product privilege--the only special circumstance relied on by the Respondent--does not warrant preclusion of the Union President from serving as the Union Representative at the interview of Employee T.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has repeatedly rejected agencies' claims of attorney work product privilege as a defense to a failure to comply with &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. In <span class="Italic">McClellan II,</span> the Authority held that a union had the right to be present at an agency attorney's interview of a bargaining unit employee in preparation for a third-party arbitration hearing. The Authority rejected the agency's claim of attorney work product privilege and found that the presence of the union at this type of interview did not preclude the agency attorney from interviewing bargaining unit employees in preparation for upcoming third-party arbitration hearings, or creating documents for the agency's use which reflected the attorney's thoughts or impressions resulting from the interview. <span class="Italic">See McClellan II,</span> 35 FLRA at 607-08. In reaching a similar determination in <span class="Italic">McClellan IV</span>, the Authority additionally noted that "there was no attempt by the [u]nion to secure any notes, records or documents prepared by or for the [r]espondent's attorney in preparation for the third-party hearing or to prevent the [r]espondent from creating such material." <span class="Italic">McClellan IV,</span> 38 FLRA at 733.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach, California.,</span> 41 FLRA 1370 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr. v. FLRA,</span> 16 F.3d 1526 (9th Cir. 1994) (<span class="Italic">VA, Long Beach</span>), the Authority also rejected applying the attorney work product privilege to its determination that the union had a right to be present at telephone interviews that constituted formal discussions. In this regard, the Authority reaffirmed the reasoning of McClellan II and found that the union's presence did not require the respondent's attorney to "disclose anything about her thoughts, impressions, legal theories or litigation strategy." <span class="Italic">VA, Long Beach,</span> 41 FLRA at 1381. Moreover, the Authority stated that the attorney was not "precluded...from fully investigating her case through other means." <span class="Italic">Id.; see also, Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., Denver, Colo.,</span> 44 FLRA 768, 770 (1992) (rejecting attorney work product privilege argument).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our dissenting colleague's claim that the Authority's rejection of the <span id="page_1502"></span>Respondent's work product argument is an unduly "narrow application" of that doctrine demonstrates a misunderstanding of the scope of the work product privilege. A leading treatise defines the doctrine as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">By its own terms, the work product doctrine, as codified in Rule 26 (b)(3) [of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure], applies only to requests for production of documents and tangible things. However, because the doctrine is intended only to guard against divulging an attorney's strategies and legal impressions, it does not protect facts concerning the creation of work product, or facts contained within work product.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">6 James Wm.&#x2003;Moore <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, Moore's Federal Practice, &#x00A7; 26.70(2)(a) (3d ed. 2006). The treatise goes on to explain that the definition of "tangible things" is interpreted broadly to include a "compilation of facts" that collates or categorizes fact, interview notes, and interview transcripts. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2(a). It also explains that the doctrine has been applied in other contexts to prevent parties from "attempting to elicit an attorney's thought processes through depositions or interrogatories." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2(c). However, there is no indication that the doctrine has been applied to preclude a representative, who otherwise has a right to be present at the examination of a witness, from being present on the ground that the attorney's theories of a case will be revealed by questioning.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the above description of the doctrine, the statements of the witness here constitute the "facts contained within work product," not the work product itself. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2(a). Further, the right of a union to be represented at the discussion does not give the union any right to question attorneys about their theories or strategies or otherwise "elicit an attorney's thought processes."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 2(c). In reaching a contrary conclusion, the dissent relies primarily on <span class="Italic">Hickman v. Taylor,</span> 329 U.S. 495 (1947), and <span class="Italic">Judicial Watch v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 432 F.3d 366 (D.C. Cir. 2005). This reliance is misplaced, however, because both of these cases involved requests for documents that explained attorney impressions. Neither of these cases supports the dissent's position that a person's mere presence during an attorney's questioning of a witness is precluded by the work product privilege.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent acknowledges that its position would allow Union representatives other than the Arbitration Representative to attend the interview on the Union's behalf. In this regard, as it is clear under Authority precedent that unions have a right to be represented at these types of interviews, the Respondent has not cited anything that would prevent the union representative who attends the meeting from communicating any information derived from that meeting to the Arbitration Representative. Thus, even assuming that the Respondent's theory could support exclusion of the Union President as the Union representative at the pre-arbitration interview, the Respondent has not explained how its concerns would be addressed if another representative were present. In any event, the Respondent has not explained what it would have been prevented from doing if the Union President (or another representative) had been present; for example, which, if any, questions it would have been prevented from asking the witness. As such, the Respondent's attempt to distinguish its proposed use of the attorney work product privilege from previous Authority decisions is not persuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the MSPB and NLRB precedent cited by the Respondent does not establish special circumstances in the present case, or otherwise establish a limitation on the Union's &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) rights. This precedent recognizes two limitations on the right to designate a representative, one involving the unavailability of a designated representative and the other concerning a designated representative's prior obstructive behavior at a <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> examination. <span class="Italic">See Gonzales,</span> 22 MSPR at 2 (unreasonable to insist on designated representative when another representative available); <span class="Italic">NJ Bell,</span> 308 NLRB at 282 (prior obstructive behavior legitimate basis for exclusion); <span class="Italic">PGE,</span> 253 NLRB at 1143-44 (another representative available). <span class="Italic">Cf. United States, INS, N.Y. Dist. Office, N.Y., N.Y.,</span> 46 FLRA 1210, 1223 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 22 F.3d 1184 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (unavailability of a designated representative constitutes a limitation on the &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) right). Neither of those factors is present here: it is undisputed that the designated representative--the Union President--appeared at the interview of Employee T and was turned away; and there is no assertion or evidence that the Union President had previously engaged in obstructive behavior. Further, we note that the Respondent has not cited any decisions from the NLRB, MSPB, or other adjudicatory agencies holding that an attorney work product claim allows an agency to exclude a particular union representative from a meeting in which a union has a right to have a representative present. Accordingly, the Respondent has provided no support for its claim that special circumstances exist in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Judge properly applied applicable long-standing precedent to find that the Respondent's refusal to allow the Union President to serve as the Union's representative at the interview of Employee T constituted the unfair labor practice alleged in the complaint. In addition, for the reasons set forth above, we reject the Respondent's claim that <span class="Italic">McClellan II </span>should be reversed.</p>
