<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-117"><span class="space">8.</span> Constitutional Claim</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The probationary scheme passed constitutional muster as to due process protections, or lack of them, in <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. FAA</span>, 32 MSPR 100, 103 (1987). A probationer has neither a property interest nor a liberty interest in a Board hearing. If a constitutional interest other than tenure is implicated, the employee may have some forum, but it is not the Board. <span class="Italic">Link v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 3 MSPR 187, 189-93, 3 MSPB 287 (1980), considered the validity of procedures involving probationary terminations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In their petitions for review, appellants have alleged that the presiding official's interpretation of the applicable law and regulations conflicts with presumed Congressional intent and with Supreme Court decisions which discuss the rights of probationary employees. Appellant Link contends, specifically, that <span class="Italic">Board of</span> <span class="Italic">Regents v. Roth,</span> 408 U.S. 564, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed.2d 548 (1972) and <span class="Italic">Perry v. Sindermann</span>, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S. Ct. 2694, 33 L. Ed.2d 570 (1972), acknowledge that probationary or nontenured employees have the right to procedural due process in dismissal situations, while appellant Mayfield has taken issue with the field office decision on the basis that it deprives probationary employees of all rights they previously had under 5 CFR parts 713 and 772 and is contrary to Congressional intent in that it leaves probationary employees without a forum in which to air their allegations of reprisal for whistle-blowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As noted above, appellant Link contends that his decision is in conflict with <span class="Italic">Perry v. Sindermann, supra, and Board of Regents v. Roth,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> which provide for the protection of an employee's liberty and property interests in continued employment. It is true that these cases speak in terms of such constitutionally protected interests and extend protection to non-tenured public employees; however, such protection is given only under certain circumstances. With respect to a property interest, in the <span class="Italic">Roth</span> case no such interest was found to exist where the plaintiff's terms of employment gave him no interest in re-employment at the expiration of his one year contract and where no state statute or university rule or policy created a legitimate claim to such an interest. In <span class="Italic">Perry v.</span> <span class="Italic">Sindermann</span> a question of fact existed as to whether it could be found that the university, which had employed the plaintiff on four successive one-year contracts, had a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> tenure system which would justify his claimed property interest of entitlement to tenure and continued employment absent sufficient cause. The Court stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A person's interest in a benefit is a "property" interest for due process purposes if there are such rules or mutually explicit understandings that support his claim of entitlement to the benefit and that he may invoke at a hearing. (<span class="Italic">Supra</span> 408 U.S. at 601, 92 S. Ct. at 2699).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The present cases are clearly distinguishable from the situation addressed in the <span class="Italic">Perry</span> case. Here, specific laws and regulations exist which foreclose the possibility of finding that appellants have a claim of entitlement to the benefit of hearing if dismissed during probation: 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(A), 5 CFR 315.806, and the terms of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In terms of a liberty interest, <span class="Italic">Roth</span> and <span class="Italic">Perry</span> protect such an interest when the underlying action adversely affects the plaintiff's reputation or ability to secure future employment. In the instant cases, as noted above, neither appellant was actually removed from his/her position. However, the record reflects that the reasons on which the agency would have relied if it became necessary to terminate either employee's appointment related directly to the performance of their duties. A termination on the basis of such a reason has been held not to invoke a liberty interest. <span class="Italic">Mazaleski v.</span> <span class="Italic">Treusdell,</span> 562 F.2d 701 (D.C. Cir. 1971). <span class="Italic">Accord: Paige v. Harris,</span> 584 F.2d 178 (7th Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">Stretten v. Wadsworth Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Hospital,</span> 537 F.2d 361 (9th Cir. 1976); <span class="Italic">Adams v. Walker,</span> 492 F.2d 1003 (7th Cir. 1974). While the last case does not involve a Federal employee, and the others do not concern probationary employees, they clearly indicate the courts' consistent interpretation of this particular matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the courts have examined the probationary employee termination systems employed by the Federal government and found it proper. Although the matter of the propriety of the system for effecting termination of probationary appointments was not directly at issue at the time, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Sampson v. Murray</span>, 415 U.S. 61, 94 S. Ct. 937, 39 L. Ed.2d 166 (1974), when reviewing the circumstances surrounding the grant of an injunction against the termination of the appointment of a probationary employee, did discuss the function of the Civil Service Commission review procedure in such cases. Applicable statutes and regulations provided a similar scope of review, except that probationers were permitted to file appeals to the Civil Service Commission if they alleged that their terminations were due to discrimination based on those factors for which jurisdiction has now been transferred to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission by the terms of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978. The Court found, 415 U.S. at 80-81, 94 S. Ct. at 948, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We are dealing in this case not with a permanent Government employee, a class for which Congress has specified certain substantive and procedural protections, but with a probationary employee, a class which Congress has specifically recognized as entitled to less comprehensive procedures. Section 3321 of Title 5 of the United States Code, derived from the original Pendleton Act, requires the creation of this classification:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"The President may prescribe rules, which shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, that there shall be a period of probation before an appointment in the competitive service becomes absolute."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is clear from other provisions in the Civil Service statutory framework that Congress expected probationary employees to have fewer procedural rights than permanent employees in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Civil Service Regulations are consistent with these statutes. [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, other courts have examined and approved the exclusion of probationary employees from the right of appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Donovan v. U.S.,</span> 433 F.2d 522 (D.C. Cir. 1970), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 401 U.S. 944, 91 S. Ct. 955, 28 L. Ed.2d 225 (1971); <span class="Italic">Toohey v. Nitze</span>, 429 F.2d 1332 (9th Cir. 1970), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 400 U.S. 1022, 91 S. Ct. 584, 27 L. Ed.2d 633 (1971); <span class="Italic">Jaeger v. Freeman,</span> 410 F.2d 528 (5th Cir. 1969). One case specifically examined the plaintiff's claim that, as a probationary employee, he had liberty and property interests in continued employment and found it without merit: <span class="Italic">Heaphy v. U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury Department,</span> 354 F. Supp. 396 (S.D.N.Y. 1973), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 489 F.2d 735 (2nd Cir. 1974).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of these cases, appellant Link's contention that the presiding official's interpretation of the terms of 5 USC 7511 is at odds with <span class="Italic">Roth and Perry</span> lacks merit. Moreover, a review of the legislative history of the Reform Act evidences no Congressional intent to extend to probationers the protections given tenured employees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, H.R. Rep. No. 95-1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1978), and S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 9, 47, 48 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, p. 2723. This is so even though the constitutional interests had been brought to the attention of Congress (see the report of <span class="Italic">Civil Service Reform Act of</span> <span class="Italic">1978 and Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978: Hearings on S.2640,</span> <span class="Italic">S.2702, and S.2830 Before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs,</span> 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 254, 1333 (1978)) and a suggestion had been made that they be extended to probationary employees (Hearings, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 677, 678). In this regard, also <span class="Italic">see Allison v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 301 F.2d 670, 157 Ct. Cl. 7 (1962), and the cases cited therein, where at page 673 the court held:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is a firmly established principle of law that administrative interpretations of statutes, consistently followed by the agencies charged with their administration, and not expressly changed by Congress, are entitled to great weight. <span class="Italic">Billings v. Treusdell</span>, 321 U.S. 542, 64 S. Ct. 737, 88 L. Ed. 917; <span class="Italic">United States v. Bergh</span>, 352 U.S. 40, 77 S. Ct. 106, 1 L. Ed.2d 102; <span class="Italic">Hevenor v. United States,</span> 101 F. Supp. 465, 121 Ct. Cl. 77; <span class="Italic">Luna v. United States</span>, 108 F. Supp. 510, 124 Ct. Cl. 52.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It has also been held by this court that repeated enactment of an act that has been construed by the department charged with its enforcement, evidences congressional sanction of the construction the department has placed upon it. <span class="Italic">Ware Knitters, Inc. v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 168 F. Supp. 208, 144 Ct. Cl. 141, 147.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, appellant Mayfield's contention that the Civil Service Reform Act cannot be used to deprive persons of rights established by judicial <span id="Page_180"></span>authority also must fail. Her allegation that she is left without a remedy and that the presiding official's interpretation of the law takes away from her rights she previously had under Civil Service regulations is without merit. In fact, as found above, appellant's constitutional rights were in no way diminished by the Civil Service Reform Act and Reorganization Plan No. 1. She retains the right to vindicate any constitutionally protected interest she may have by bringing to the attention of the Special Counsel her allegation that her termination was due to a prohibited personnel practice and by filing a discrimination complaint in accordance with procedures set out by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission at part 1613 of Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations. She also has the right to file a grievance within her agency. Accordingly, her right to remedy has not been abrogated. Rather, only the avenues to which she may look for relief have been changed by the Civil Service Reform Act and Reorganization Plan No. 1. While the Supreme Court has stated that the government may not deny a benefit to a person on the basis of a reason that infringes his constitutionally protected interest, <span class="Italic">Perry v. Sindermann</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> 408 U.S. at 597, 92 S. Ct. at 2697, the fact that these alternate methods for examining the merits of her claim exist negates a contention that this constitutionally required protection has been abandoned for probationary employees. To comport with due process requirements, an employee who alleges reprisal for a constitutionally protected activity must have a proper forum in which to seek redress. That, because of duly promulgated laws and regulations, this forum is not the Board does not render the procedures followed here invalid.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Colon-Rivera v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3142), reviewed a constitutional challenge to the differences in initial appeal rights between first year competitive and excepted service personnel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, on the ground that petitioner was a probationary employee in the excepted service, held that by virtue of 5 USC 7511(a)(1) and 4303(f)(3) petitioner had no statutory right of appeal, and dismissed the petition. The Board held, correctly, that appeal on the basis of alleged discrimination due to marital status or political affiliation is by statute not available to probationary employees in the excepted service. 5 CFR 315.806, 210.101(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner agrees that the applicable statutes and regulations deny appeal rights to probationary employees in the excepted service, but argues that since probationary employees in the competitive service do have appeal rights on certain limited bases, the due process and equal protection constitutional guarantees of himself and others in the same category are violated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered whether petitioner has presented a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> constitutional claim, for a violation of fundamental rights can not be authorized by statute or regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perry v. Sindermann</span>, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972). The government states that the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Sampson v. Murray</span>, 415 U.S. 61, 80-82 (1973), sustained the practice of creating different protections for different classes of public employees. Not quite. The Court in <span class="Italic">Murray</span> indeed discussed that Congress has created such classes, has authorized periods of probation, and has recognized that probationary employees have fewer procedural safeguards under the personnel laws. But no constitutional issue was there raised or decided.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is insufficient for petitioner merely to assert that he is a member of a class subject to different laws or regulations than members of another class. Petitioner has not explained how that situation violates his fundamental constitutional rights. So grave a challenge to laws in long existence requires some minimum substantiation of their asserted illegality. Petitioner has presented no support for his allegations, and has not raised a justiciable constitutional issue.</p>
