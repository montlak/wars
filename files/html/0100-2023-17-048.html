<p class="noindent">Matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) include similar matters covered under 5 USC 7512 arising under other personnel systems. Concerning the relation of the concept of "[an]other personnel system" to employees in the excepted service, refer to <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 32 FLRA 79, 84-86 (1988). An award was not reviewable by FLRA that arose under the personnel system governing professional employees of the VA Department of Medicine and Surgery (demotion of physician assistants). <span class="Italic">VAMC, Chillicothe and AFGE Local 1631</span>, 15 FLRA 448, 449 (1984). Review of the VA case is obtained in the same manner and on the same basis as from a final decision under the applicable appellate system, not through exceptions to FLRA. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Hines and Illinois Nurses Ass'n, Hines Local Unit</span>, 16 FLRA 303, 304 (1984). Under 7121(f), review was precluded of an arbitration award concerning the removal of a Title 38 VA physician. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lebanon and AFGE Local 1966</span>, 16 FLRA 813, 813-14 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2094 and VA, Manhattan Med. Ctr.</span>, 44 FLRA 1192 (1992) (removal of ward clerk). Lack of FLRA jurisdiction to review an award reinstating a Title 38 employee--a registered nurse--was confirmed in <span class="Italic">VAMC Dayton and National Nurses United</span>, 70 FLRA 803, 803-04 (2018) (Member Abbott dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant is a registered nurse.&#x2003;A patient's wife reported that the grievant verbally abused the patient (the allegation). An Agency Administrative Investigation Board (Investigation Board) investigated the allegation and recommended that the Agency terminate the grievant. The Agency did so. The Union filed a grievance alleging that the termination violated the parties' collective-bargaining agreement because the Agency lacked just cause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 18, 2017, Arbitrator Howard Tolley issued an award finding that the Agency failed to show that it had just cause for terminating the grievant. As a remedy, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to reinstate the grievant, with backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 16, 2018, the Agency filed exceptions to the award. On February 20, 2018, the Union filed an opposition to the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The Authority does not have jurisdiction over the exceptions.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the Agency argues that the award is based on nonfacts. On January 26, 2018, the Authority's Office of Case Intake and Publication issued an order directing the Agency to show cause why the Authority should not dismiss the exceptions for lack of jurisdiction because the award concerns a termination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the order, the Agency argues that the Authority must assert jurisdiction because the grievant cannot appeal her termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). However, for the reasons discussed below, the MSPB's lack of jurisdiction[3] does not mean that the Authority has jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;As a registered nurse, the grievant is not the type of employee who can appeal a termination to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(10) (excluding persons who hold "a position within the Veterans Health Administration which has been excluded from the competitive service by or under a provision of title 38, unless such employee was appointed to such position under" 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(3)); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. &#x00A7; 7701(a) ("An employee, or applicant for employment, may submit an appeal to the [MSPB] from any action which is appealable to the <span id="page_1761"></span>[MSPB] under any law, rule, or regulation."); <span class="Italic">Mfotchou v. Dep't of VA</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 317, 319-21 (2010) (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">Pichon v. Dep't of the VA</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 325, 326-28 (1995) (citations omitted).</p>

Employees appointed under this provision (appointees) are treated differently than those appointed under other subsections of &#x00A7; 7401 and those appointed under title 5.

Generally, a party may file exceptions to an arbitration award with the Authority. However, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to review an arbitration award "relating to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f)" of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute).[9] As relevant here, the matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) include adverse actions that: (1) arise under "other personnel systems" outside title 5;[10] and (2) are "similar to" serious adverse actions,[11] such as removals, covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 (Chapter 75).[12] The legislative history of the Statute states that appointees like the grievant belong to an "other personnel system."[13] The MSPB and federal courts also recognize that appointees are part of an "other personnel system."[14] Further, the grievant's termination is "similar to" a removal covered by Chapter 75.[15] Thus, because the grievant's termination arises under an "other personnel system[&#8197;]" and is "similar to" a Chapter 75 adverse action,[16] the only potential review would be "judicial review of [the Arbitrator's] award...in the same manner and on the same basis as could be obtained of a final decision in such matters raised under applicable appellate procedures."[17]</p>

<p class="noindent">Removals of teachers in schools operated by the Department of Defense are cases not reviewable by FLRA on exception to arbitration awards. The Defense Department Overseas Teachers Pay and Personnel Practices Act, 20 USC 901-907, establishes a personnel system within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(f).

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">DoDDS, Pacific Region</span>, the Authority concluded that the Defense Department Overseas Teachers Pay and Personnel Practices Act, 20 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 901-907 (the Act), established "[an]other personnel system[&#8197;]" within the meaning of section 7121(f). Although section 7121(f) does not define the phrase "[an]other personnel system[&#8197;]," the Authority noted that the legislative history of section 7121(f) provides, as a specific example of another personnel system, the system established by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4101-4119 for Department of Medicine and Surgery (DM&#x0026;S) professional employees of the Veterans Administration. Using the DM&#x0026;S system as a guide, the Authority concluded that the Act established a personnel system for "teachers in schools operated by the Department of Defense (DOD) in an overseas area for dependents of "members of the Armed Forces and dependents of civilian employees of DOD." 22 FLRA at 599.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority noted, in <span class="Italic">DODDS, Pacific Region</span>, that the purpose of the Act was "to no longer generally subject such teachers to civil service laws and regulations as the source of their personnel system and instead to have the Secretary of Defense prescribe and issue regulations to provide for a system of personnel administration." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 600.

(quoting S. Rep. No. 141, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1959)). Finally, the Authority stated that, under 20 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 902(a), the Secretary of Defense had authority to promulgate regulations governing: (1) the establishment of teaching positions; (2) the fixing of basic compensation for teachers and teaching positions; (3) the entitlement of teachers to compensation; (4) the payment of compensation to teachers; (5) the appointment of teachers; (6) the conditions of employment of teachers; (7) the length of the school year; (8) the leave system for teachers; (9) quarters, allowances, and additional compensation for teachers; and (10) such other matters as may be relevant and appropriate to the purposes of Chapter 20.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Nieuwdorp</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Library of Congress</span>, 872 F.2d 1000, 1002 (Fed. Cir. 1989)], the Federal Circuit disagreed with the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">DoDDS, Pacific Region</span>. The court stated that the Authority "did not consider whether DODDS employees were within the definition of employee under sections 4301(2) and 7501(1) [sic] and thus whether the first sentence of section 7121(f) was applicable."...&#8197;The court stated further that by "focusing solely on the second sentence of section 7121(f), the <span id="page_1762"></span>FLRA reached a decision that is plainly inconsistent with the language of the statute."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After careful examination of the parties' positions in this case, including the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Nieuwdorp</span>, we adhere to the Authority's holding in <span class="Italic">DoDDS, Pacific Region</span>, and respectfully disagree with the Federal Circuit. For purposes of section 7121(f), a finding that certain DoDDS employees fall within the definition of "employee" under section 7511(a)(1) does not, in our view, mandate a conclusion that the DoDDS personnel system is not another personnel system. Rather, we conclude that the determinative factor in deciding whether a personnel system constitutes another system, within the meaning of section 7121(f), is whether the personnel system is intended to operate separate and apart from the personnel system which is applicable to general Federal Civil Service employees and is governed by Title 5 of the United States Code. For the reasons fully stated in <span class="Italic">DoDDS, Pacific Region</span>, we find that the Act constitutes such a separate personnel system. The fact that certain DoDDS employees are included within the statutory definition of "employee" for other purposes does not, alone, provide a basis for concluding otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, as the Arbitrator's award with respect to the grievant's removal relates to a matter described in section 7121(f), exceptions to the award may not be filed with the Authority pursuant to section 7122(a).

<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(f) addresses the review of arbitration awards resolving grievances encompassed by section 7121(e). For employees in other personnel systems, section 7121(f), provides that, if the employee has filed a grievance over a matter similar to one covered under section 4303 or 7512, the resulting award has the same review as if the administrative appeal option, if one exists, were chosen. Under section 7122(a), the Authority is without jurisdiction to review these awards. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Army and Air Force Exchange Service, Dallas, Texas and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3854</span>, 51 FLRA 1651, 1653 (1996) (<span class="Italic">AAFES</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to other personnel systems, section 7121(e) refers to the right of employees to appeal "[s]imilar matters" without regard to whether the employee actually has an administrative appeal alternative. Therefore, the Authority does not look beyond the specific personnel actions listed in sections 4303 and 7512 when determining whether a grievance implicates "similar" matters within the meaning of section 7121(e) and (f). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1654.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(f) does not define the phrase "[an]other personnel system." The Authority has concluded that the determinative factor in deciding whether a personnel system constitutes another personnel system within the meaning of section 7121(f) is whether the system is intended to operate separate and apart from the personnel system that is applicable to general civil service employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense Dependents Schools, Germany Region and Overseas Education Association</span>, 38 FLRA 1432, 1436 (1991) (<span class="Italic">DODDS</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Authority Lacks Jurisdiction To Resolve Exceptions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 347(b) of the Appropriations Act and Pub. L. No. 104-122, 110 Stat. 876, the FAA personnel management system is exempt from all of title 5 of the U.S. Code, except for the following: (1) section 2302(b); (2) sections 3308-3320; (3) chapter 71; (4) section 7204; (5) chapter 73; (6) chapter 81; and (7) chapters 83-85, 87, and 89. Under section 225 of the Air Management System Performance Improvement Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-264, 110 Stat. 3213 (Performance Improvement Act), the Administrator of the FAA is authorized to appoint, transfer, and fix the compensation of employees. As a result, the FAA personnel management system is exempted from substantially all of title 5. "The [Appropriations] Act clearly manifests Congress's intent to grant to the FAA the power to promulgate its own personnel system to address 'the unique demands on the agency's workforce.'" <span class="Italic">Allen v. MSPB</span>, 127 F.3d 1074, 1076 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (quoting section 347(a) of the Appropriations Act). Accordingly, we conclude that the personnel management system established by the Agency is intended to operate separate and apart from the personnel system that is applicable to the general civil service. Consequently, it constitutes another personnel system within the meaning of section 7121(f) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DODDS</span>, 38 FLRA at 1436.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also conclude that the award relates to the removal of the grievant, which is a matter that is similar to a matter covered under section 4303 or 7512. Consequently, the award relates to a matter described in section 7121(f). Under section 7122(a), exceptions to the award may not be filed with the Authority, and the Authority is without jurisdiction to review the exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's arguments to the contrary are unavailing. First, as explained in <span class="Italic">AAFES</span>, 51 FLRA at 1654, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to review awards regardless of whether an election is offered an employee between the appellate procedure and the negotiated grievance procedure. Second, even if there were no review of arbitration awards available under the new system, this is not the type of matter that under <span class="Italic">AG, State of Oregon</span>, the Authority has discretion to refuse to decline jurisdiction. Despite the Agency's claim that its exceptions address matters other than the removal itself, it is clear that the award resolves a "pure" removal matter and not a matter "relating to" a removal. As such, the Authority is without discretion to dismiss the exceptions for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AG, State of Oregon</span>, 51 FLRA at 1554-55.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 54 FLRA 240, 241-42 (1998) (no jurisdiction to review union's exceptions to award mitigating the removal of ATCS to suspension). [The current status of FAA employees' appeal rights should be checked; refer to Broida's <span class="Italic">A Guide to Merit Systems Protection Board Law and Practice</span> (<a href="http://deweypub.com/mspbguide">Dewey Publications, Inc</a>. 2023), Chapter 1, "Federal Aviation Administration."]</p>
