<p class="Body-Text">"A competitive area may consist of all or part of an agency. The minimum competitive area is 'a bureau, major command, directorate or other equivalent major subdivision of an agency within the local commuting area.' <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.402(b)." <span class="Italic">Cox v. TVA</span>, 41 MSPR 686, 692 (1989). A competitive area is not improper because it contains but one person. <span class="Italic">O'Connell v. DHHS</span>, 21 MSPR 257, 260-61 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Welch v. Dept. of Army</span>, 323 F.3d 1042, 1046 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (RIF is permissible, although it affects but one position, if there is a legitimate basis for the RIF). What counts is the organizational identity of the competitive area, not its size, as was pointed out in a challenge to an OPM RIF, <span class="Italic">Whitsell v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 97-3054):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress has directed OPM to prescribe regulations for the release of employees in a reduction of force, giving due effect to tenure of employment, military preference, length of service, and efficiency or performance ratings. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 3502(a). Pursuant to that directive, OPM has promulgated regulations requiring each agency to establish "competitive areas" and "competitive levels" that determine employees' retention rights when a reduction in force requires that some employees be released. The regulation that addresses competitive areas states that a competitive area "may consist of all or part of an agency." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.402(b). The regulation further provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The minimum competitive area in the departmental service is a bureau, major command, directorate or other equivalent major subdivision of an agency within the local commuting area. In the field, the minimum competitive area is an activity under separate administration within the local commuting area. A competitive area must be defined solely in terms of an agency's organizational unit(s) and geographical location, and it must include all employees within the competitive area so defined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. A competitive level consists of</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">all positions in a competitive area which are in the same grade (or occupational level) and classification series, and which are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay schedules, and working conditions so that an agency may reassign the incumbent of one position to any of the other positions in the level without undue interruption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.403(a)(1). When a reduction in force is announced, an employee is permitted to compete for retention with employees who are within the same competitive area and competitive level. The agency's selection of competitive areas is therefore important, because it is a significant factor in determining the number of positions within an agency for which the employee affected by a reduction in force can compete for retention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, OPM designated each of its headquarters divisions, including OIT, as a separate competitive area. Ms. Whitsell was therefore limited to competing for retention with employees in the OIT headquarters operation, rather than being able to compete for retention with employees in other components within the agency. She argues that it was improper for OPM to designate OIT as a separate competitive area because OIT did not possess the necessary degree of administrative independence to qualify as a major subdivision of OPM. Specifically, Ms. Whitsell claims that because no one within OIT had separate personnel appointing authority, OPM could not properly designate OIT as a separate competitive area.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulation that defines "competitive area," 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.402(b), provides only limited guidance as to how a competitive area is to be determined. With respect to field operations, the regulation provides that the minimum competitive area "is an activity under separate administration within the local commuting area." For headquarters operations such as OIT's activities within OPM's central office, the regulation states only that a competitive area must comprise at least a major subdivision of an agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the 1995 reorganization, OIT could be considered a "major subdivision" of OPM in a formal sense, in that it was one of 17 separate entities within the agency that reported directly to the Director. An office's placement on an agency organizational chart, however, is not enough to render it a "major subdivision" of the agency within the meaning of the competitive area regulation. By the same token, the relatively small size of OIT does not disqualify it from being considered a "major subdivision" of the agency. <span class="Italic">See Finch v. United States</span>, 179 Ct. Cl. 1, 5 (1967). Instead, the pertinent Board decisions and regulatory materials have focused on whether the office in question enjoys substantial independence in operation, function, and personnel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In expounding upon the regulatory provision governing competitive areas, the Federal Personnel Manual explained that a competitive area is a "primary subdivision of the agency, with work function and operation separately organized and clearly distinguished from other primary subdivisions." It added that "[t]he authority to take personnel actions is usually one factor in the extent of the competitive area." <span class="Italic">Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Manual</span> 351-19 (1980). The 1989 supplement to the Federal Personnel Manual expanded upon that description and stated that a competitive area "may be identified as an organizational segment that is separately organized and clearly distinguished from others in operation, work function, staff, and personnel management." Personnel management, in turn, was defined in the Manual as "the <span class="Italic">authority</span> to take or direct personnel actions (i.e., the authority to establish positions, abolish positions, assign duties, etc.) rather than the issuance or processing of the documents by which these decisions are effected" (emphasis in original). Although the Federal Personnel Manual was not in effect at the time of the reduction in force at issue in this case, the Manual was long regarded as a useful source of guidance as to the proper construction of the "competitive area" regulation, which was promulgated while the Manual was still in effect. <span class="Italic">See Grier v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 750 F.2d 944, 946, 947 (Fed. Cir. 1984). It therefore continues to be a valuable resource for construing regulations, such as section 351.402(b), that were promulgated or were in effect before the Federal Personnel Manual was abolished in December 1993.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Whitsell argues that OPM's proof before the administrative judge fell short because OPM failed to demonstrate that the head of OIT had "appointing authority" for personnel within his office, and thus the office could not constitute a separate competitive area. "Appointing authority," if understood to mean the formal authority to appoint, is not a proper test of organizational separateness. Agencies often repose formal appointing authority in a single office, such as a personnel office, while granting the heads of the agency's major divisions substantial <span class="Italic">de facto</span> independence in making appointments. The Board has explicitly rejected the proposition that organizational units serviced by the same personnel office must be grouped into a single competitive area. <span class="Italic">See Coleman v. Department of Educ.</span>, 21 MSPR 574, 577 (1984). The Board found in <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>, and we agree, that the designation of a competitive area is properly based on where substantial decisionmaking authority resides in an organization rather than on where the paperwork implementing those decisions is processed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, to the extent that "appointing authority" is understood to mean the responsibility to create positions and designate the persons who are to fill them, rather than the formal power of appointment, we agree that "appointing authority" is an important factor in determining whether a particular agency subdivision has sufficient independence in personnel management to qualify as a competitive area. It was in that sense that the Board used the term "appointing authority" in <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 15 MSPR 13, 15 (1983), and that Vice Chair Slavet used the term in her dissent in this case. The question posed by this case, then, is whether OIT enjoyed sufficient administrative independence in personnel matters to qualify as a "major subdivision" of OPM within the meaning of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.402(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence before the administrative judge establishes that OIT was a separate entity in operation, work function, and staff: it had its own management hierarchy, its own designated area of work responsibility, and its own employees. The remaining inquiry is whether OIT was "separately organized and clearly distinguished" from other divisions with regard to personnel management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3055"></span>On that issue, the evidence before the administrative judge supports the agency's contention that the head of OIT was the substantive decisionmaker with respect to personnel management. A personnel management specialist who participated in the reorganization that established OIT as a separate competitive area testified that OPM's policy was to designate any office with full personnel authority as a competitive area, and that OIT had full personnel authority at the time it was made a competitive area. In addition, Walter Sutton, the acting head of OIT, testified that he had authority to take personnel actions for positions in OIT at grades 15 and below. Although the evidence presented to the administrative judge lacks detail regarding Mr. Suffon's authority in personnel matters, the limited attention given to that matter is understandable in light of the fact that the issue of the scope of the competitive area was not a principal focus of Ms. Whitsell's case and was not contested at the hearing before the administrative judge. In the absence of any contrary evidence from Ms. Whitsell, there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion of the administrative judge that OPM satisfied its burden of showing that OIT had sufficient independence with respect to personnel management to be designated as a separate competitive area.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Whitsell emphasizes two points in the record below to support her contention that OIT lacked sufficient independence in personnel management to constitute a separate competitive area. Neither point is persuasive, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, noting that Mr. Sutton stated in his declaration that his authority to take personnel actions was limited to "positions within OIT at grades 15 and below," Ms. Whitsell argues that because Mr. Sutton lacked personnel authority over Senior Executive Service employees, OIT lacked the requisite independence in personnel management. The evidence shows, however, that at the time of the reduction in force OIT had only two Senior Executive Service positions--the head of the division and his deputy--and that one of those positions was vacant. The lack of control over the two top positions in an agency subdivision does not deprive that subdivision of independence in personnel management. By definition, no subdivision of an agency has independent control over the selection of its own leadership; if complete control over all employees--including the leaders of the subdivision--were required, no agency subdivision would qualify as a separate competitive area.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Ms. Whitsell argues that OIT should not be recognized as a competitive area because Mr. Sutton's testimony demonstrates that he played no major role in planning or implementing the reduction in force. The need for a reduction in force, however, is often determined on an agency-wide basis rather than by a particular agency subdivision. To hold that an agency subdivision could not serve as a valid competitive area for a reduction in force if the need for the reduction in force was determined by the head of the agency rather than the head of the subdivision would bar many otherwise qualified agency subdivisions from serving as separate competitive areas. Moreover, the evidence in the record shows that while Mr. Sutton was told how much the budget of his division would be cut and was given some guidance as to how to conduct the reduction in force, it was his responsibility to "develop a plan" for the reduction in force in light of the target budget level that he was given. When Mr. Sutton had completed that task, he provided the personnel office with a list of the positions within OIT that were to be abolished. In light of that evidence and the other evidence relating to OIT's administrative independence within OPM, we conclude that the administrative judge's ruling that OIT was a proper competitive area within OPM was supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another decision of the Federal Circuit sustained an OPM RIF despite a challenge to the size of the competitive area, <span class="Italic">Markland v. OPM</span>, 140 F.3d 1031, 1033-36 (Fed. Cir. 1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 3502(a) (1994), OPM has promulgated regulations that agencies must follow in conducting a RIF, one of which requires the establishment of competitive areas in which separated employees may compete for jobs that survive the RIF. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.402 (1997). "A competitive area must be defined solely in terms of an agency's organizational unit(s) and geographical location, and it must include all employees within the competitive area so defined," and "may consist of all or part of an agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 351.402(b). With respect to departmental service, which includes OCAS, this sub-section requires that the minimum competitive area be "a bureau, major command, directorate or other equivalent major subdivision of an agency within a local commuting area." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This requirement replaced the previous regulation, which defined a competitive area as "all or that part of an agency in which employees are assigned under a single administrative authority" and further defined a departmental service competitive area as "a primary subdivision of an agency." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.402 (1983). OPM adopted the "new definition of what constitutes a minimum competitive area...to provide agencies with better guidance." Reduction in Force, 51 Fed. Reg. 318, 318 (Office of Personnel Management 1986) (final rule).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the changes in the regulation, OPM revised the <span class="Italic">Federal Personnel Manual</span> <span class="Italic">(FPM)</span> to eliminate the "single administrative authority" language of the old regulation and the requirement that departmental service competitive areas be "large enough to permit adequate competition among employees." <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">FPM Letter</span> 351-20 (Mar. 4, 1986) (New Interim FPM Chapter 351 on Reduction in Force) (superseded by <span class="Italic">FPM Letter</span> 351-22 (Sept. 17, 1987)) <span class="Italic">with FPM</span> 351-11 (1981). This revision defined departmental service competitive areas as those that are "separately organized and clearly distinguished from others in operation, work function, staff, and personnel administration." <span class="Italic">FPM Letter</span> 351-20 (Mar. 4, 1986). The next revision retained this definition, but substituted "personnel management" for "personnel administration." It defined "personnel management" as "the <span class="Italic">authority</span> to take or direct personnel actions, rather than the issuance or processing of the documents by which these decisions are effected." <span class="Italic">FPM Letter</span> 351-22 (Sept. 17, 1987) (New Final FPM Chapter 351 on Reduction in Force) (emphasis in original) (superseded by <span class="Italic">FPM Supplement</span> 351-1 (Sept. 18, 1989)). Before completely abolishing the <span class="Italic">FPM,</span> OPM equated the authority to take or direct personnel actions with "the authority to establish positions, abolish positions, assign duties, etc." <span class="Italic">FPM Supplement</span> 351-1, S3-2(c)(3) (Sept. 18, 1989) (provisionally retained until December 31, 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the <span class="Italic">FPM</span> was not in effect at the time of the OCAS RIF, it was when OPM promulgated the "competitive area" regulation at issue here. Furthermore, we have previously found the <span class="Italic">FPM</span> instructive in construing the meaning of "competitive area." <span class="Italic">See Grier v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 750 F.2d 944, 946-47 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Until OPM publishes another interpretation of the RIF regulations, the <span class="Italic">FPM</span> remains a valuable resource for that purpose. Therefore, we conclude that section 351.402(b) requires a separate departmental competitive area to be a bureau, major command, directorate, or other equivalent major subdivision that is separately organized and clearly distinguished from others in operation, work function, staff, and personnel management, the latter of which is satisfied if the head of the subdivision has the authority to take or direct personnel actions (i.e., the authority to assign duties, establish or abolish positions, etc.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Markland argues that the crucial factor for determining whether the head of an agency subdivision has the authority to take or direct personnel actions is whether he has appointing authority. Neither the regulation nor the abolished <span class="Italic">FPM</span> discuss appointing authority. Similarly, the cases binding on us have not relied upon appointing authority in evaluating competitive areas. <span class="Italic">Bashein v. United States,</span> 150 Ct. Cl. 138, 279 F.2d 255, 257 (1960), for example, finds separate competitive areas based on the installations' separate command, management, and retention registers. <span class="Italic">Finch v. United States,</span> 179 Ct. Cl. 1, 5 (1967), relies on only the organizational structure of the agency and its analogous relationship to a bureau. The cases that do consider appointing authority are board cases, which are not binding here. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Tuggle v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n</span>, 20 MSPR 100, 102 (1984) (upholding a competitive area because the "Commissioner of the agency was empowered by statute to exercise administrative authority in the appointment and supervision of the personnel on his or her immediate staff").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded that heads of competitive areas must have appointing authority in order for these competitive areas to be separate in personnel management. Section 351.402(b) requires only that subdivision heads have the authority to take or direct personnel actions (i.e., the authority to assign duties, establish or abolish positions, etc.). Evidence of appointing authority may indicate that a subdivision head has authority to take or direct personnel actions, but it is not required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that it correctly designated OCAS as a separate departmental service competitive area because it is a major subdivision that is separately organized and clearly distinguished from others in operation, work function, staff, and personnel management. The parties do not dispute and the record shows that OCAS was separately organized and clearly distinguished in operation, work function, and staff.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for personnel management, the record shows that the head of OCAS had the authority to take or direct personnel actions (i.e., the authority to assign duties, establish or abolish positions, etc.). The Revised Delegations state that the head of OCAS is "responsible for overall effective personnel management within [OCAS]." They allow the head of OCAS to approve leave without pay, alternative work schedules, and quality step increases, but not to authorize hazardous weather dismissals or set pay. The Revised Delegations also allow the head of OCAS, Furman, to approve intra-agency details. Furman stated, moreover, that he developed performance review standards for Markland, which were based on Markland's duties. This evidence shows that Furman could assign duties and had supervisory authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Significantly, the Revised Delegations state that the head of OCAS could "take position classification actions and establish or abolish subordinate positions within [his] organization...if delegated by agreement from the Director, Office of Human Resources and EEO." Although there is <span id="Page_3056"></span>no evidence in the record of a written agreement to that effect, Tyrrell stated by affidavit that Furman "had authority to abolish positions in Mr. Markland's competitive area."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence that the head of OCAS had authority to review employees, grant quality step increases, set schedules, assign duties, and abolish positions is sufficient to establish that he had authority to take or direct personnel actions and that OCAS' personnel management is distinguished from that of other subdivisions. Therefore, OPM has met its burden of producing evidence that OCAS is a separate departmental service competitive area under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.402(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon meeting its initial burden of production, the agency enjoys a strong presumption that its officers acted in good faith and otherwise in accordance with law in conducting the RIF, <span class="Italic">see Dancy v. United States,</span> 229 Ct. Cl. 300, 668 F.2d 1224, 1226 (1982), and the burden shifts to the aggrieved employee to rebut this presumption with clear and convincing evidence, <span class="Italic">see George v. United States,</span> 166 Ct. Cl. 527, 531 (1964) ("In the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, it must be presumed that the officials of the [agency] acted properly in effecting the plaintiffs separation from the service.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Stripped of his arguments that Furman did not have appointing or personnel authority, Markland supports his claim that OPM incorrectly defined his competitive area with no evidence except the existence of the fifteen competitive areas, which are smaller than those existing before OPM's reorganization. Size alone, however, does not show that OPM incorrectly established Markland's competitive area. <span class="Italic">See Ginnodo v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 753 F.2d 1061, 1063-64 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (upholding a competitive area of one). Therefore, we see no basis for reversing the board's decision that OPM properly established OCAS as a separate competitive area.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Markland</span>, <span class="Italic">Castro v. DOD</span>, 79 MSPR 152, 156-57 (1998), noted that the key to the competitive area is the authority to take or direct personnel actions, e.g., the authority to assign duties, to establish or abolish positions, not the authority to make the basic organizational or budget decisions that cause personnel authorities to be exercised:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the initial decision was issued, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued <span class="Italic">Markland v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 140 F.3d 1031 (Fed. Cir. 1998), construing 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.402(b). The court stated that section 351.402(b) requires a competitive area to be</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">separately organized and clearly distinguished from others in operation, work function, staff, and personnel management, the latter of which is satisfied if the head of the subdivision has the authority to take or direct personnel actions (i.e., the authority to assign duties, establish or abolish positions, etc.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">140 F.3d at 1034 (relying, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, on FPM Supplement 351-1, S3-2(c)(3) (Sept. 18, 1989), which equated the authority to take or direct personnel actions with "the authority to establish positions, abolish positions, assign duties, etc."). The court stated that once the agency meets its burden of production by presenting a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case on this issue, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1034, 1035, it "enjoys a strong presumption that its officers acted in good faith and otherwise in accordance with law in conducting the RIF...and the burden shifts to the aggrieved employee to rebut this presumption with clear and convincing evidence," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1035.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court specifically rejected the appellant's argument that the crucial factor in determining whether the head of an agency subdivision has the authority to take or direct personnel actions was whether he had appointing authority<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1034-35. The court stated that "[e]vidence of appointing authority may indicate that a subdivision head has authority to take or direct personnel actions, but it is not required." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1035. The court further stated that, in evaluating the propriety of a competitive area, whether it provides for adequate competition is not a consideration<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Ginnodo v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 753 F.2d 1061, 1063-64 (Fed. Cir. 1985), in which the court upheld a competitive area consisting of one employee).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as in <span class="Italic">Markland</span>, the record shows, and the parties do not dispute, that each commissary was separately organized and clearly distinguished from others in operation, work function, and staff. Thus, the only criterion for the Board to consider is whether each commissary was separately organized and clearly distinguished from others in personnel management. As noted above, this criterion would be satisfied if the commissary officer at the Imperial Beach Commissary had the authority to take or direct personnel actions (i.e., the authority to assign duties, establish or abolish positions, etc.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found in this regard that "each commissary [wa]s a separate administrative entity, with personnel decisions made by a commissary manager located at each commissary." He based this conclusion on both the testimony of the regional director for the agency and agency documents identifying competitive areas throughout the country. We find nothing inherently inconsistent between the AJ's adjudication of this matter and our precedent. Therefore, we find no error by the AJ in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellants challenge the AJ's determination and refer to record evidence in support of their claim that the commissary officers did not have the requisite administrative independence for each commissary to be designated as a separate competitive area. Specifically, they refer to the regional director's testimony that he, not the commissary officer, determines which commissary will have to reduce its number of positions, based on a comparison of the sales volume of the commissaries. However, taking the regional director's testimony at face value shows no more than that the determination to reduce positions was initiated at a level higher than the level at which the RIF was conducted, and that those decisions were based on the income at the particular commissary. It does not show that the decisions regarding <span class="Italic">which</span> positions to abolish were made anywhere other than at the local commissary level. Decisions on whether positions should be abolished in government organizations are made at many levels. Congress itself may even get involved in deciding that a particular agency or agency subdivision will need to be reduced in size. However, this does not mean that a competitive area must be established at the organizational level at which these broad managerial decision[s] are initiated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agencies have wide discretion in conducting a RIF. <span class="Italic">See Markland</span>, 140 F.3d at 1033; <span class="Italic">Grier v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human</span> <span class="Italic">Services,</span> 750 F.2d 944, 945-46 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (a RIF action is different from an adverse action, and an agency is accorded wide discretion in conducting a RIF). The AJ in this case evaluated the agency's evidence and concluded that the agency properly designated the Imperial Beach Commissary as a separate competitive area. The evidence to which the appellants refer on petition for review does not require a different conclusion. Applying the analytical framework provided in <span class="Italic">Markland</span>, the agency presented a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that it properly designated each commissary as a separate competitive area, thereby raising a strong presumption in its favor, and the appellants failed to rebut this presumption with clear and convincing evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another challenge to the OPM RIF was blunted by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">O'Brien v. OPM</span>, 144 F.3d 1458, 1463-64 (Fed. Cir. 1998), the court unmoved by arguments that large numbers of competitive areas provide few opportunities for employees displaced during a RIF:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. O'Brien acknowledges that there are situations in which members of a competitive area will not be able to compete for retention. For example, a competitive area may consist of a large subdivision of an agency or all employees of a regional office of an agency in a particular commuting area; if the subdivision or the regional office is abolished, all employees in the competitive area are subject to removal, and none will be entitled to compete for retention. Moreover, where circumstances require that a competitive area be small, Mr. O'Brien acknowledges that an employee may lawfully be denied the opportunity to compete for retention because of the small size of his competitive area. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ginnodo v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 753 F.2d 1061 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (upholding removal of employee in a one-person competitive area over objection that he should have been allowed to compete for retention with employees in other competitive areas). Mr. O'Brien's argument, in essence, is that OPM's only stated reason for making FQI a separate competitive area was that it was OPM's policy to make separate competitive areas of each subdivision of the agency with full personnel management authorities. That policy, according to Mr. O'Brien, is not a sufficiently compelling justification to override the statutory preference in favor of competition for retention, particularly in this case where FQI had previously been part of a larger competitive area and was made its own competitive area shortly before it was abolished.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that FQI was a very small competitive area, and that the smaller an employee's competitive area the poorer the employee's chances to compete successfully for retention in the event of a reduction in force. Nonetheless, there is nothing in the statute or its implementing regulations that guarantees competition. <span class="Italic">See Ginnodo,</span> 753 F.2d at 1063 ("[W]hile the regulations promulgated pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 3502 create retention rights among competing employees in a competitive area, they do not guarantee that there will be positions for which employees may compete."); <span class="Italic">Grier,</span> 750 F.2d at 945 ("We have found no statute, regulation or case law which requires an agency to expand a competitive area for the sole purpose of providing actual competition for a job."). Section 3502 merely requires the regulations to "give due effect" to the factors of tenure, length of service, military preference, and performance ratings. The OPM competitive area regulations do just that, by using those factors to determine the rankings of employees within each competitive area and competitive level. And the OPM regulations limit the extent to which agencies can reduce the size of their competitive areas: in the agency's headquarters operation, the competitive areas must constitute at least a "bureau, major command, directorate, or other equivalent major subdivision" of the agency. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.402(b) (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. O'Brien contends that a unit such as FQI, with only nine employees, cannot reasonably be considered a "major" subdivision of an agency with approximately 2000 employees in its headquarters operation. But <span id="Page_3057"></span>he does not suggest any criterion for determining how many employees would be required to constitute a "major" subdivision. OPM's functional definition of what constitutes a "major subdivision" of an agency--a unit that is separately organized and clearly distinguished from others in operation, work function, staff, and personnel management--represents a reasonable accommodation of the interest in promoting retention competition and the need for retaining flexibility for governmental organizations that differ greatly in size and structure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. O'Brien cites the opportunity for manipulation that is presented by interpreting the OPM regulations to permit competitive areas to be designed in accordance with the organizational independence of subdivisions within an agency. Although it is true that under the OPM regulations an agency can decentralize its operations and create multiple competitive areas if it wishes to do so, we think it unlikely that an agency would choose an organizational scheme for the sole purpose of enabling it to designate small competitive areas and deny employees the opportunity to compete for retention in the event of a reduction in force. In any event, OPM's competitive area regulation does not violate the statutory mandate in section 3502, which gives OPM broad discretion in formulating its retention regulations, and the selection of FQI as a separate competitive area did not violate any requirement of the OPM regulations. We therefore uphold the administrative judge's determination that FQI was validly made a separate competitive area within OPM.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency need not take positive steps to create an administrative unit large enough to provide competition beyond a one-person competitive area; there is no statutory guarantee of actual competition. <span class="Italic">Ginnodo v. OPM</span>, 753 F.2d 1061 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Grier</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. When each agency commissioner had his or her own staff and administrative authority, the competitive area was properly limited to a single commissioner, eliminating the right to bump from one staff to another. <span class="Italic">Tuggle v. CPSC</span>, 20 MSPR 100, 102 (1984). To prevail under <span class="Italic">Ginnodo</span>, an appellant challenging a one-person competitive area must demonstrate that there was a clear abuse of discretion, that his agency's decision was arbitrary or irrational, or that his treatment differed from that of his fellow employees. Judge Newman filed a dissent in <span class="Italic">Ginnodo</span>, arguing that, given the flexibility accorded to agencies that conduct RIFs, the use of a one-person competitive area under the circumstances does not serve the policy that a competitive area should be large enough to permit adequate competition. As to an employee who argued that a competitive area should have been regional, a national area was deemed reasonable. Offers of employment were extended to employees within appellant's office that would not have been provided had the area been regional. <span class="Italic">Rosenstiel v. BATF</span>, 19 MSPR 478, 479 (1984).</p>
