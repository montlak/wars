<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-264"><span class="space">c.</span> Violation of the Privacy Act; Disclosure in Violation of the ADA or Rehabilitation Act</h5>
<p class="noindent">The basic elements for a Privacy Act recovery were summarized, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1592 and Dept. of Air Force, Hill AFB</span>, 58 FLRA 584, 585 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To maintain a suit for an unauthorized disclosure of information under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(g)(1)(D), a claimant must prove the following four elements: <span id="page_2202"></span>(1) the information is covered by the Privacy Act as a "record" contained in a "system of records"; (2) the agency "disclose[d]" the information; (3) the disclosure had an "adverse effect" on the claimant; and (4) the disclosure was "willful or intentional." <span class="Italic">Quinn v. Stone</span>, 978 F.2d 26, 131 (3rd Cir. 1992). The "adverse effect" requirement is, in effect, a standing requirement<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 135.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the exceptions must be denied because the grievant testified that he would have given his consent if asked.&#x2003;We construe this as an argument that the disclosure had no adverse effect on the grievant. The Union has neither alleged nor demonstrated that the release of the information had an adverse effect on the grievant. In these circumstances and in light of such an admission, we conclude that the Union has failed to establish that the Agency violated the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987 and Dept. of Air Force, Robins AFB</span>, 57 FLRA 551, 553-57 (2001), determined that arbitrators may award damages under the Privacy Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The sole question presented by the exception is whether the Arbitrator has authority to award money damages for a violation of the Privacy Act.&#x2003;We find that the Arbitrator is empowered to make this assessment. Accordingly, we remand this case to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for a decision on the merits of the grievant's claim for damages under the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Complaints of violations of the Privacy Act fall under the definition of "grievance" set forth at &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) of the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) of the Statute, Congress defined "grievance" broadly to include complaints by any employee labor organization concerning any claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment. This intent is reflected by Congress' statement that "[a]ll matters that under the provisions of law could be submitted to the grievance procedures shall in fact be within the scope of any grievance procedure negotiated by the parties unless the parties agree as part of the collective bargaining process that certain matters shall not be covered by the grievance procedures." Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee on Conference, H.R. Rep. No. 95-1717, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2860, 2891.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, even assuming, without deciding, that the rationale of <span class="Italic">Customs Service </span>applies to this case, we would nonetheless find that the Privacy Act is a law affecting conditions of employment within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii). In <span class="Italic">Customs Service, </span>the court held that "[a] grievance claiming a 'violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of a law, rule, or regulation' may be brought under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) (assuming the relevant agreement tracks the statutory definition) if the particular legal authority relied upon was fashioned for the purpose of regulating the working conditions of employees." 43 F.3d at 690-91. In so doing, the court noted that the term "'law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment' can be only interpreted...to confine grievances to alleged violations of a statute or regulation that can be said to have been issued for the very purpose of affecting the working conditions of employees--not one that merely incidentally does so<span class="Italic">." Id. </span>at 689. In our view, as demonstrated below, the Privacy Act has more than a "merely incidental[ ]" effect on employees' working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Privacy Act's effect on employees' working conditions is evident from the large variety of situations in which the Privacy Act has been involved in federal sector labor-management cases. There have been numerous cases in which arbitrators have addressed and resolved grievances involving the Privacy Act. Similarly, even in cases where a grievance did not raise a Privacy Act claim, the Authority has reviewed numerous exceptions to arbitrators' awards involving alleged inconsistencies with the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Privacy Act protects the privacy interests of individuals in information collected about them by federal agencies.&#x2003;It prescribes certain duties for the agencies which collect, store, and disseminate such information. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a. Federal employees are included in the category of individuals whose privacy rights are protected by the Privacy Act. In this regard, the Authority has previously addressed the significant role the Privacy Act plays in agency maintenance of employee personnel records. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United</span> <span class="Italic">States Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., New</span> <span class="Italic">York TRACON, Westbury, N.Y., </span>50 FLRA 338, 339 n.3 (1995) (<span class="Italic">New York TRACON</span>) ("[w]ith certain enumerated exceptions, the Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of personal information about Federal employees without their consent."). Information that is contained in agency records and retrieved by reference to an individual's name or some other personal identifier, such as the employee personnel file at issue here, falls within the scope of the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force, 56th Support Group, Macdill Air Force Base,</span> <span class="Italic">Fla., </span>51 FLRA 1144, 1145 n.2 (1996) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(4), (5)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(e) sets forth the "[a]gency requirements" for maintenance of systems of records under the Privacy Act. For example, agencies are required to "maintain all records which are used by the agency in making any determination about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(e)(5). Agencies are also required to establish "appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to insure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(e)(10).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The rights and obligations created by the requirements of the Privacy Act demonstrate that it is a law that affects the working conditions of federal employees in a significant manner.&#x2003;In particular, proper maintenance of personnel records by agencies is an aspect of the working conditions of employees, and the Office of Personnel Management has issued regulations recognizing that the Privacy Act governs proper maintenance of those records. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. Part 293. Also, the Authority has long recognized the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of personnel records in the interest of precluding an unwarranted invasion of employees' personal privacy, consistent with the disclosure requirements set forth by &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., New York TRACON</span>, 50 FLRA at 347 (Authority held that disclosure of unsanitized employee performance appraisals would disturb the privacy interests of employees). Disclosure of favorable, as well as unfavorable, information could subject employees to embarrassment and jealousy among co-workers, which could result in discord at the workplace. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of Health and Human Services, Soc. Sec. Admin., New York Region,</span> N.Y., N.Y., 52 FLRA 1133, 1142 (1997). In addition, disclosure could "chill candor in the evaluation process" that is, "supervisors might withhold comments, both positive and negative, from inclusion in appraisals if they were aware that their comments could become known." <span class="Italic">New York TRACON,</span> 50 FLRA at 350 (internal citation and quotations omitted). As demonstrated by our case law, there is a direct nexus between the requirements of the Privacy Act and the employment relationship between agencies and their employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon the foregoing, we conclude that the Privacy Act is a law "affecting conditions of employment" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) of the Statute. As such, claimed violations of the Privacy Act come within the definition of "grievance" set forth at &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii), and are grievable and arbitrable under a broad-scope grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The money damages provision of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(g)(4), may be enforced at arbitration</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases where agencies violate the requirements of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(g)(1) provides for civil remedies. As relevant here, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(g)(1)(C) allows for civil remedies whenever any agency "fails to maintain any record concerning any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is necessary to assure fairness in any determination relating to the qualifications, character, rights, or opportunities of, or benefits to the individual that may be made on the basis of such record, and consequently a determination is made which is adverse to the individual." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(g)(1)(D) allows for civil remedies whenever any agency "fails to comply with any other provision of this section, or any rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual." For any claim brought under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(g)(1)(C) or (D), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(g)(4) allows for an individual to receive money damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency relies on the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(g)(4) to support its argument that a claim for money damages under the Privacy Act can only be brought in United States district court. That section provides, in relevant part, that an agency shall be liable for actual damages where "the court determines that the agency acted in a manner which was intentional or willful...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, it is well accepted that statutory language permitting a court to award money damages against the federal government does not deprive arbitrators of authority to also award such damages. For example, regarding analogous statutes with comparable language authorizing courts to award damages, it has been held that administrative bodies also have authority to award such damages. In <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA 1469 (1998), the Authority stated that the portion of 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b) that provides for liquidated damages constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity and "applies not only to suits brought in [f]ederal or state court, but also to arbitration proceedings<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1487 (upholding authority of arbitrators to award liquidated damages under the FLSA). That provision states, as relevant here, that "[a]n action to recover [liquidated damages] may be maintained against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction...." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b). In the same vein, the damages provision of the Privacy Act under &#x00A7; 552a(g)(4) provides a waiver of sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">Tomasello v. Rubin, </span>167 F.3d 612, 618 (D.C. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Gibson, </span>the United States Supreme Court found that the <span id="page_2203"></span>language of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(c), providing that "[i]f a complaining party seeks compensatory...damages under this section...<span class="Italic">any</span> <span class="Italic">party </span>may demand a trial by jury,"' did not act to deprive EEOC of authority to award compensatory damages against the federal government. 527 U.S. at 221-22 citing 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(c) (emphasis added). Moreover, in deciding whether statutory provisions are applicable to grievance and arbitration proceedings, the Authority has considered whether the provision encompasses substantive as opposed to procedural rights. Damages provisions have been viewed as substantive provisions applicable to grievance and arbitration proceedings. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS,</span> <span class="Italic">Washington, D.C., </span>46 FLRA 1063, 1073 (1992); <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Explosive Ordinance Disposal Tech. Div., Indian Head, Md., </span>57 FLRA 280, 284-86 (2001) (Authority held that the opt-in provision under FLSA requiring party plaintiffs to file written consents with the court was procedural, as opposed to substantive, and therefore not applicable to arbitration proceedings).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the damages provision is applicable to arbitration proceedings. Thus, we find that the Arbitrator erred in finding that he did not have authority to assess money damages under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(g). Accordingly, we remand the case to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for a decision on the merits of the grievant's claim for damages under the Privacy Act. In this regard, the Arbitrator is directed on remand to make findings and conclusions consistent with the requirements under &#x00A7; 552a(g).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VAMC Charleston and NAGE Local R5-136</span>, 58 FLRA 706, 708 (2003), reconfirmed the authority of arbitrators to entertain grievances and monetary claims based on Privacy Act violations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Arbitrators did not lack jurisdiction to resolve the alleged Privacy Act violations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve alleged Privacy Act violations.&#x2003;However, the Authority has long reviewed arbitration awards in which the underlying grievances concerned compliance with the Privacy Act<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3184</span>, 50 FLRA 449 (1995); <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R5-66</span>, 40 FLRA 504 (1991). The Authority's review of Privacy Act matters is consistent with &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) of the Statute, which defines "grievance" as "any complaint...by any employee, labor organization, or agency concerning...any claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law...affecting conditions of employment[.]" Applying this definition, it is clear that the rights and obligations created by the Privacy Act affect the conditions of employment of federal employees. For example, the Privacy Act plays a significant role in agency maintenance of employee personnel records<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Transp., FAA, N.Y. TRACON, Westbury, N.Y.</span>, 50 FLRA 338, 339 n.3 (1995); <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of the Air Force, 56th Support Group, Macdill Air Force Base, Fla.</span>, 51 FLRA 1144, 1145 n.2 (1996) (<span class="Italic">citing</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(4), (5)). As such, and as demonstrated by the Authority's precedent, the Privacy Act has had a prominent role in significant aspects of federal sector labor-management relationships<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States DOJ, Fed Corr. Facility, El Reno, Okla.</span>, 51 FLRA 584 (1995) (addressing disclosure requirements under the Privacy Act); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury</span>, IRS, 51 FLRA 310 (1995) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude, consistent with <span class="Italic">AFGE, </span>that the Privacy Act is a law "affecting conditions of employment" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) of the Statute. This conclusion is not inconsistent with the D.C. Circuit's decision holding that the term "'law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment' can be only interpreted...to confine grievances to alleged violations of a statute or regulation that can be said to have been issued for the very purpose of affecting the working conditions of employees--not one that merely incidentally does so." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, United States Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 689 (D.C. Cir. 1994). As demonstrated above, the Privacy Act's effect on federal employees' working conditions is more than "merely incidental[.]" <span class="Italic">AFGE, </span>57 FLRA at 555.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency disagrees with the Authority's precedent, relying on &#x00A7; 552a(g)(1)(D), which provides that an "individual may bring a civil action against the agency, and the district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction in the matter[.]" On its face, this provision establishes that federal district courts have jurisdiction to consider actions arising under the Privacy Act. However, nothing in this provision precludes jurisdiction over Privacy Act claims in other, appropriate fora<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 556-57. That is, nothing in the provision establishes <span class="Italic">exclusive </span>jurisdiction in the district courts<span class="Italic">. Compare id</span>. <span class="Italic">with </span>28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1346(b) ("the district courts...shall have exclusive jurisdiction" over certain civil actions arising under the Federal Tort Claims Act) and 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1251(a) ("[t]he Supreme Court shall have...exclusive jurisdiction of all controversies between two or more States"). Consequently, the Agency's reliance on the wording of &#x00A7; 552a(g)(1)(D) is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's reliance on decisions of the MSPB, the Tax Court and the Claims Court that they lack jurisdiction over Privacy Act matters is also misplaced. In this regard, none of those decisions is based solely on a finding that federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over Privacy Act matters<span class="Italic">. See Martin v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 2000 WL 1807419 at **2 (Fed. Cir.) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3 in concluding that MSPB lacks jurisdiction over Privacy Act claims); <span class="Italic">Strickland v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue</span>, 2000 WL 274077 (U.S. Tax Court) (citing <span class="Italic">Crowell v. Comm'r of Internal Revenue</span>, 102 T.C. 683, 693 (1994), which found, in part, that Tax Court lacks jurisdiction over Privacy Act matters because &#x00A7; 7852(e) of the Internal Revenue Code "expressly provides that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(g) shall not be applied directly or indirectly to the determination of liability of any person for any tax."); <span class="Italic">Frasier v. United States</span>, 43 F.3d at 1485 (holding that the Claims Court lacks jurisdiction over Privacy Act matters without explanation). In addition, the Authority is not bound by the decisions of the MSPB, the Tax Court or the Claims Court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we reject the Agency's argument that the Arbitrators lacked jurisdiction to resolve the alleged Privacy Act violations.</p>
<p class="noindent">For monetary damages to accrue under the Privacy Act, there must have been an intentional and willful, not a negligent, violation of the statute, and, as noted in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1592</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, there must be an adverse effect on the grievant, both elements leading FLRA to set aside an award favoring a grievant in <span class="Italic">VAMC Charleston and NAGE Local R5-136</span>, 58 FLRA 706, 709-11 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Arbitrators erred in concluding that the Agency violated the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Applicable Legal Standards</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 552a(e)(2) requires federal agencies "to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(e)(2). An individual who is adversely affected by an agency's intentional or willful failure to comply with this provision is entitled to relief under the Act<span class="Italic">. See id. </span>at &#x00A7; 552a(g)(1)(D) and (g)(4). To obtain such relief, a grievant must show that: (1) the agency failed to elicit information directly from him or her to the greatest extent practicable; (2) the agency's violation of the Act was intentional or willful; and (3) the agency's action had an adverse effect on the grievant<span class="Italic">. See Waters v. Thornburgh</span>, 888 F.2d 870, 872 (D.C. Cir. 1989). If these three factors are satisfied, then the grievant is entitled to the greater of $1,000 or the actual damages sustained, pursuant to &#x00A7; 552a(g)(4) of the Act<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;AR-3628</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's assertion that the award is contrary to the Privacy Act is based on its claim that "numerous other authorities" permitted its actions. The Agency's argument has merit. In this connection, the Privacy Act "does not make the [g]overnment strictly liable for every affirmative or negligent action that might be said technically to violate the Privacy Act's provisions." <span class="Italic">Albright v. United States</span>, 732 F.2d 181, 189 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">Albright</span>). Rather, liability is imposed "only when the agency acts in violation of the Act in a willful or intentional manner, either by committing the act without grounds for believing it to be lawful, or by flagrantly disregarding others' rights under the Act<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. Accordingly, federal courts have found no violation of the Privacy Act where agencies have acted pursuant to regulations or other authority that the agencies justifiably believed authorized their actions<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Wisdom v. Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev.</span>, 713 F.2d 422, 424 (8th Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 465 U.S. 1021 (1984) (intentional release of records pursuant to regulations not a willful violation of the Act); <span class="Italic">accord Bruce v. United States</span>, 621 F.2d 914, 917 (8th Cir. 1980). Even where an agency does not fully comply with the authority that authorized its actions, no violation of the Privacy Act occurs<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Wesley v. Don Stein Buick, Inc.</span>, 985 F. Supp. 1288, 1305-06 (D. Kan. 1997) (standard for willful violation not met where, although disclosure was "unlawful," agency acted with belief that disclosure was proper, and it would have been proper if procedures set forth in routine use had been followed) (<span class="Italic">Wesley</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims, among other things, that 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.506 permitted its actions. As relevant here, that provision expressly permits an agency to "contact the employee's physician in writing concerning the work limitations imposed by the effects of the injury and possible job assignments." 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.506. Thus, &#x00A7; 10.506 permitted the Agency to obtain information about the grievant's medical condition directly from her medical providers. The Agency's contacts here were by phone rather than in writing. However, the grievance did not allege a violation of &#x00A7; 10.506. Moreover, even assuming, without finding, that the Agency violated &#x00A7; 10.506, that violation would not, in and of itself, amount to a willful and intentional violation of the Privacy Act, where the Agency's actions would have been proper had it fully complied with the regulation<span class="Italic">. See Wesley</span>, 985 F. Supp. at 1305-06. Consequently, we conclude that the Arbitrator in AR-3628 erred in finding a violation of the Privacy Act, and we set aside the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;AR-3639</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Privacy Act's adverse effect requirement has two components: (1) an <span id="page_2204"></span>adverse effect standing requirement and (2) a causal nexus between the agency's action and the adverse effect.[8] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Quinn</span>, 978 F.2d at 131. The Agency argues that the Arbitrator "made no clear finding about any 'adverse effect....'"</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The adverse effect that a plaintiff must show within the meaning of (g)(1)(D) is not necessarily equivalent to "actual damages" recoverable under (g)(4)(A)<span class="Italic">. Quinn v. P.W. Stone</span>, 978 F.2d 126, 135 n.15 (3rd Cir. 1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Dickson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 828 F.2d 32, 37 (D.C. Cir. 1987)) (<span class="Italic">Quinn</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the facts were "sufficient to show an adverse effect upon the grievant[,]" but he did not find that the grievant actually suffered an adverse effect. For instance, although the Arbitrator found that the information "<span class="Italic">would </span>[result in] an adverse determination," if ultimately it proved that the grievant's injury did not affect her work, he did not find that the information <span class="Italic">did </span>result in an adverse determination. Similarly, although the Arbitrator found that the grievant was "under a cloud of suspicion," he did not conclude that this "cloud of suspicion" caused the grievant to suffer any adverse affects such as mental distress, emotional trauma, or embarrassment, which have been held sufficient to confer standing under the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">ee Quinn</span>, 978 F.2d at 135 (citing <span class="Italic">Albright</span>, 732 F.2d at 186); <span class="Italic">Parks v. United States</span>, <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 618 F.2d 677, 683 (10th Cir. 1980)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the record evidence demonstrates that the grievant did not lose any benefits to which she was entitled. To the contrary, the record shows that the grievant requested reimbursement for therapy sessions that she did not attend and that the Agency's actions prevented her from receiving benefits to which she was not entitled. In these circumstances, where the record does not support a finding that the Agency's actions caused an adverse affect, the Arbitrator's finding of a Privacy Act violation is deficient. Accordingly, we find that the award is contrary to the Privacy Act, and we set it aside.</p>
<p class="noindent">The significance of the causal connection between a violation of the Privacy Act and an award of damages was reiterated, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-27 and DOD, DCA, Ft. Lee</span>, 60 FLRA 14, 15-16 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Privacy Act requires federal agencies to "collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(e)(2). An individual who is adversely affected by an agency's intentional or willful failure to comply with this provision is entitled to relief under the Act. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at &#x00A7; 552a(g)(1)(D) and (g)(4). To obtain such relief, a grievant must show that: (1) the agency failed to elicit information directly from him or her to the greatest extent practicable; (2) the agency's violation of the Act was intentional or willful; and (3) the agency's action had an adverse effect on the grievant. <span class="Italic">See Waters v. Thornburgh</span>, 888 F.2d 870, 872 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">Waters</span>). In addition, a recent Supreme Court decision requires that an individual suffer actual damages to be entitled to relief for a violation of the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Chao</span>, 124 S. Ct. 1204, 1206 (2004). If the above factors are satisfied, then the grievant is entitled to the greater of $1,000 or the actual damages sustained, pursuant to &#x00A7; 552a(g)(4) of the Act. <span class="Italic">Waters</span>, 888 F.2d at 872.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Agency's inquiry to the social worker caused the grievant to suffer "a discrete and tangible loss of benefits" because she was denied the use of advanced annual leave and the ability to return to work with certain work limitations. We construe this as an argument that the Agency's action had an adverse effect on the grievant. The Privacy Act's adverse effect requirement has two components: (1) an adverse effect standing requirement and (2) a causal nexus between the agency's action and the adverse effect. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., Charleston, S.C.</span>, 58 FLRA 706, 710 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator specifically concluded that, because the Agency's inquiry was legitimate and no actual contact was made with the social worker, he did "not agree that [the grievant] was in any way harmed by the Agency [i]nquiry or that any adverse impact was sustained by [the grievant]." The Union has not provided any evidence indicating that the Arbitrator's findings are incorrect. Regarding the Union's claim that the Agency's attempted contact of the social worker caused the grievant to suffer the adverse effect of being denied the use of advanced sick leave, the Arbitrator found that the Agency properly denied the grievant's use of such leave and did so prior to the Agency's attempted contact of the social worker. As there is no causal nexus between the Agency's attempted contact of the social worker and the grievant being denied the use of advanced sick leave, the Union has not established that the grievant suffered an adverse effect. Moreover, regarding the Union's argument that the grievant suffered an adverse effect from not being able to return to work with certain work limitations, the Arbitrator determined that the Agency allowed the grievant to return to work on the medically proposed work schedule. As such, the evidence does not indicate that the grievant suffered an adverse effect in this respect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Union has not demonstrated that the grievant suffered any adverse effects, it has not established that the award is contrary to the Privacy Act. Therefore, we deny the exception.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;As noted above, for the grievant to obtain relief for a violation of the Privacy Act, she must show that (1) the Agency did not elicit information about the flexibility of the proposed work schedule from the grievant to the greatest extent practicable; (2) the Agency intentionally or willfully attempted to contact the social worker; and (3) the Agency's attempted contact of the social worker had an adverse effect on the grievant. As the Union has failed to establish that the Agency's attempted contact had an adverse effect on the grievant, it is unnecessary to address the Union's exceptions regarding the other two requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE</span> <span class="Italic">Local</span> <span class="Italic">1045</span> <span class="Italic">and</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC</span> <span class="Italic">Biloxi</span>, 64 FLRA 520, 521-22 (2010), reaffirmed that a grievance may encompass a Privacy Act violation, based on the agency's treatment of employees' medical records:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the Arbitrator's finding that alleged violations of the Privacy Act are not grievable, the Authority has specifically held to the contrary. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Charleston, S.C.</span>, 58 FLRA 706, 709 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring) (<span class="Italic">VAMC</span>). In doing so, the Authority specifically rejected arguments--raised by the Agency in its opposition in this case--that the Privacy Act provides the exclusive remedy for alleged violations thereof and that it was not issued for the purpose of affecting working conditions of unit employees. No basis to reverse <span class="Italic">VAMC </span>is demonstrated. Accordingly, we reject these arguments here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency's contention that rights set forth in the Privacy Act are personal and cannot be asserted derivatively by a labor organization is misplaced. Although the Agency cites <span class="Italic">Parks v. IRS</span>, 618 F.2d 677, that decision is inapposite because it did not involve grievability under the Statute; it resolved the issue of whether the labor organization met the requisites for associational standing before a federal court. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 684-85. Moreover, as noted, &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C) defines "grievance" to include any complaint "by any employee, labor organization, or agency concerning...any claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment[,]" and Article 42 parallels this by providing that such grievances may be filed by "an employee, the Union, or Management[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the award is deficient insofar as the Arbitrator determined that the alleged violation of the Privacy Act is not arbitrable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1045,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>, determined that liability as to improper disclosure of medical information could also be established through the grievance procedure based on record-handling requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act, 64 FLRA at 522:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the ADA, &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4) and 29 C.F.R. part 1630 (part 1630) prescribe requirements with respect to medical records that are similar to provisions of the Privacy Act. Consequently, for the same reasons that the Authority concluded that the Privacy Act affects federal employee conditions of employment, we similarly conclude that &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4) and part 1630 also are, respectively, a law and a regulation affecting conditions of employment within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii). In this regard, we note that the ADA imposes obligations, similar to the obligations of the Privacy Act, on employers in the maintenance and protection of information regarding the medical condition or history of their employees. Further, the ADA provisions apply to the Agency and unit employees through the Rehabilitation Act. As explained by the Authority, although the United States is not an employer within the meaning of the ADA, Congress has specifically adopted the standards of the ADA for determining violations of the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(g); <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Mgmt.</span>, 61 FLRA 358, 361 (2005) (then-Member Pope dissenting as to other matters). This adoption specifically includes the medical records provisions of &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4). <span class="Italic">Leach v. Mansfield</span>, 2009 WL 3190463 (S.D. Tex.). Accordingly, we conclude that the award is deficient insofar as the Arbitrator determined that the alleged violations of the ADA and implementing regulations are not arbitrable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Addressing both the Privacy Act and the Rehabilitation Act or ADA in the context of a disclosure of information by supervisors to one or more employees about a grievant's work-related injury, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1102 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Detention Ctr., Seattle</span>, 65 FLRA 148, 150-52 (2010), determined that an arbitrator properly declined to impose Privacy Act liability on the agency by reason of a non-willful violation of that statute, but FLRA left open for resolution on remand whether the disclosure violated the ADA or Rehabilitation Act provisions concerning confidentiality of medical information:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator's application of the confidentiality provisions of the Privacy Act is not contrary to law. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Privacy Act limits the disclosure of information.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Charleston, S.C.</span>, 58 FLRA 706, 710 (2003) (<span class="Italic">VAMC Charleston</span>). Section 552a(e)(2) of the Act permits federal agencies to <span id="page_2205"></span>disclose information only in accordance with the Act, and &#x00A7; 552a(g)(1)(D) and (g)(4) entitle an individual to relief if the agency intentionally or willfully fails to comply with the provisions of the Act. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(a)). To establish an unauthorized disclosure of information under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(g)(1)(D), a claimant must prove the following four elements: (1) the information is covered by the Privacy Act as a "record" contained in a "system of records"; (2) the agency disclosed the information; (3) the disclosure had an "adverse effect" on the claimant; and (4) the disclosure was "willful or intentional." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1592</span>, 58 FLRA 584, 585 (2003) (quoting <span class="Italic">Quinn v. Stone</span>, 978 F.2d 126, 131 (3d Cir. 1992)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union alleges that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator incorrectly concluded that the Agency's disclosure was not willful or intentional. The Union claims that the Arbitrator misapplied the intent requirement by requiring the management officials to have intended to cause harm to the grievant, rather than merely intending to disclose the information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument is without merit. The Arbitrator's findings are consistent with case precedent. The Authority has found that the Privacy Act "does not make the [g]overnment strictly liable for every affirmative or negligent action that might be said technically to violate the Privacy Act's provisions" and that liability is imposed "only when the agency acts in violation of the Act in a willful or intentional manner, <span class="Italic">either by committing the act without grounds for believing it to be lawful, or by flagrantly disregarding others' rights under the Act</span>." <span class="Italic">VAMC Charleston</span>, 58 FLRA at 710 (quoting <span class="Italic">Albright v. United States</span>, 732 F.2d 181, 189 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">Albright</span>)) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the Arbitrator's factual findings, the Agency did not disclose the grievant's medical information without grounds for believing its action to be lawful. The Arbitrator found that the management officials only intended to discuss the grievant's medical information among themselves. The Arbitrator noted that, when the disclosure was made, the officials believed that they had the right to discuss work-related issues, including work-related injuries of employees. <span class="Italic">VAMC Charleston</span>, 58 FLRA at 710 (quoting <span class="Italic">Albright</span>, 732 F.2d at 189) (citing <span class="Italic">Wisdom v. Dep't of HUD</span>, 713 F.2d 422, 424 (8th Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">cert denied</span>, 465 U.S. 1021 (1984) &#x0026; <span class="Italic">Bruce v. United States</span>, 621 F.2d 914, 917 (8th Cir. 1980)) (finding that the Privacy Act is not violated when agencies have acted pursuant to regulations or other authority that they justifiably believed authorized their actions). Additionally, the Arbitrator determined that, although a public lobby was an inappropriate place to engage in a conversation about an employee's back injury, management officials were authorized to discuss the grievant's work-related injuries among themselves. Award at 12; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c)(1) (authorizing "[s]upervisors and managers [to] be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee and necessary accommodations"); <span class="Italic">VAMC Charleston</span>, 58 FLRA at 710 (citations omitted) (determining that, even when an agency does not follow proper procedures in order to fully comply with the authority that authorized its actions, no violation of the Privacy Act occurs). Consequently, the Arbitrator's findings demonstrate that the officials justifiably believed that they were authorized to discuss the grievant's medical condition among themselves.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, based on the Arbitrator's factual findings, the Agency did not flagrantly disregard the grievant's rights under the Act. Although the Union alleges that the Arbitrator misapplied the intent requirement by requiring the management officials to have intended to cause harm to the grievant, the Arbitrator simply determined that the Agency did not intentionally disclose the information. The Arbitrator specifically found that the disclosure was not directed at any non-supervisory employees and that the disclosure was made carelessly or inadvertently, rather than willfully or intentionally. Moreover, the Arbitrator determined that the Union's contention--that the grievant's supervisor commented on his medical condition in a sarcastic tone of voice--did not provide a basis for proving that the Agency's disclosure was willful or intentional. Therefore, the Arbitrator's findings demonstrate that the Agency did not flagrantly disregard the grievant's rights under the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Arbitrator's conclusion that the Agency's disclosure was not willful or intentional is not contrary to law. Accordingly, we deny the Union's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The record is insufficient for a determination as to whether the award is contrary to law. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Union alleges that the award is contrary to law because it does not comply with the confidentiality provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. The Union claims that the Arbitrator added an additional, unnecessary requirement for proving a violation of the confidentiality provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. According to the Union, although the Privacy Act requires that an entity's disclosure of confidential medical information be willful or intentional for that entity to be liable, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act contain no such requirement.<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, the Arbitrator failed to address the merits of the Union's claim that the Agency's disclosure violated the confidentiality provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Although the Arbitrator noted the Union's statement of the issue and summarized the Union's arguments regarding the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, he devoted his entire discussion to reiterating the parties' arguments and addressing the elements of the Privacy Act. Finally, the Arbitrator only set forth the legal standard for the Privacy Act, and his findings mirror the elements of that Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Arbitrator failed to address whether the Agency's disclosure violated the confidentiality provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, we must determine whether the record permits us to ascertain whether the award is contrary to the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act or whether a remand is necessary. <span class="Italic">See U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, U.S. Penitentiary, Terre Haute, Ind.</span>, 60 FLRA 298, 300 (2004) (finding that, in cases where an arbitrator fails to make requisite factual findings, the Authority may remand the award if the record does not permit it to make a determination on the merits) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Penitentiary, Terre Haute</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A party violates the confidentiality provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act by disclosing confidential medical information regarding the medical condition or history of any employee obtained during a medical examination or inquiry.[3] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dominguez v.

Dep't of Agric.</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A52157, 2006 WL 1209770, at *4 (April 26, 2006) (determining that not all medically-related information "falls within the proscription of a confidential medical record" and that "a notation that an individual has taken sick leave or had a doctor's appointment [did] not [constitute] confidential medical information"). Moreover, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c)(1) authorizes the release of confidential medical information in limited situations, including where "[s]upervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee and necessary accommodations." [<span class="Italic">S</span>]<span class="Italic">ee also Tyson v. U.S. Postal Serv. (E. Area)</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01992086, 2002 WL 1999045, at *2 (Aug. 23, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The ADA confidentiality provisions apply to the Agency and unit employees through the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1045</span>, 64 FLRA 520, 522 (2010).

Mgmt.</span>, 61 FLRA 358, 361 (2005)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the record does not permit us to determine whether the confidentiality provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act were violated when management officials conversed about the grievant's back injury and leave status. As noted above, the Arbitrator failed to address the merits of the Union's claim that the Agency's disclosure violated the confidentiality provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. Moreover, although there are sufficient factual findings for the Authority to establish whether a disclosure occurred under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, the record does not permit us to determine whether the information disclosed constituted confidential medical information. In this regard, it is impossible, based on the findings that the Arbitrator made, for the Authority to ascertain whether the information disclosed related to the grievant's medical condition or history or whether the information was obtained during a medical examination or inquiry. <span class="Italic">See </span>Award at 3-4, 11-14 (containing no finding regarding whether "a back injury" is a medical condition, no discussion regarding how the information disclosed was obtained by the agency, and no determination regarding whether management officials conversed about grievant's confidential medical information). Consequently, the record does not permit us to determine whether the confidentiality provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act were violated. As a result, the award must be remanded to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator, absent settlement, for further findings. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1741</span>, 62 FLRA 113, 118 (2007) (citations omitted) (finding that, when the record does not contain sufficient findings for the Authority to resolve whether the award is contrary to law, the award should be remanded to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator, absent settlement, for further findings); <span class="Italic">U.S. Penitentiary, Terre Haute</span>, 60 FLRA at 300 (determining that, because the Arbitrator made no factual findings concerning whether the agency's violation was willful, and the record did not permit the Authority to make that determination, the case should be remanded); <span class="Italic">see also Gibson v.

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we remand this case to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement. Upon remand, we ask the Arbitrator to determine whether the Agency violated the confidentiality provisions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
