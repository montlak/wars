<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-9"><span class="space">a.</span> Filing Dates</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's regulation states the filing procedure for appeals involving EEO affirmative defenses, 5 CFR 1201.154 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Time for filing appeal.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of this section, the date an appellant receives the agency's decision is determined according to the standard set forth at 1201.22(b)(3) of this part. Appellants who file appeals raising issues of prohibited discrimination in connection with a matter otherwise appealable to the Board must comply with the following time limits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Where the appellant has been subject to an action appealable to the Board, he or she may either file a timely complaint of discrimination with the agency or file an appeal with the Board no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of the appellant's receipt of the agency's decision on the appealable action, whichever is later.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;If the appellant has filed a timely formal complaint of discrimination with the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;An appeal must be filed within 30 days after the appellant receives the agency resolution or final decision on the discrimination issue; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If the agency has not resolved the matter or issued a final decision on the formal complaint within 120 days, the appellant may appeal the matter directly to the Board at any time after the expiration of 120 calendar days. Once the agency resolves the matter or issues a final decision on the formal complaint, an appeal must be filed within 30 days after the appellant receives the agency resolution or final decision on the discrimination issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;If the appellant files an appeal prematurely under this subpart, the judge will dismiss the appeal without prejudice to its later refiling under &#x00A7; 1201.22 of this part. If holding the appeal for a short time would allow it to become timely, the judge may hold the appeal rather than dismiss it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To operate against adjudication of a Board appeal, an election of remedies depends on specific notice by the agency in the adverse action decision of the remedies available, <span class="Italic">Brewer v. Dept. of Army,</span> SF-0752-15-0216-I-1 (NP 7/22/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant's EEO complaint encompassed his removal, then we would ordinarily look to which one--the EEO complaint or the instant Board appeal--he filed first to assess the timeliness of his appeal. However, an agency is required to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]nform every employee who is the subject of an action that is appealable to the MSPB and who has either orally or in writing raised the issue of discrimination during the processing of the action of the right to file either a mixed case complaint with the agency or to file a mixed case appeal with the Board. The person shall be advised that he or she may not initially file both a mixed case complaint and an appeal on the same matter and that whichever is filed first shall be considered an election to proceed in that forum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(b). Because the appellant had filed an EEO complaint regarding the agency's proposed removal action and the investigation underlying the proposal, the agency should have provided him with the notice required by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(b) when it sustained the removal action. <span class="Italic">Cf. Mincey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 663, 666-67 (1998). Contrary to the agency's assertions, its removal notice did not include such notice. While the agency advised the appellant that he could file a Board appeal or an EEO complaint, and the time limits for filing either, it did not inform him that he could not do both. Thus, to the extent that his EEO complaint encompassed his removal, he cannot be considered to have made a valid election between pursuing the EEO process and filing a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Moore v. Department of Justice</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 382, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2009) (an election is not valid unless the agency has properly informed the appellant of the election requirements and its consequences).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant (or complainant) is represented by counsel, an agency may send its final agency decision to both the complainant and the attorney. If the attorney receives the final agency decision before the complainant, it is the attorney's receipt of the agency decision that triggers the time for filing a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Foley v. DHHS</span>, 84 MSPR 402, 404 &#x00B6; 5 (1999) ("The time limit under section 1201.154(b) begins to run when the appellant or his duly designated representative receives the agency's final decision, <span class="Italic">whichever is earlier</span>." (citing <span class="Italic">McGuire v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 247, 250 &#x00B6; 9 (1999), and <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dept. of State</span>, 60 MSPR 441, 444 (1994)); the delay was excused because the agency erroneously worded its notice to state that the time for filing ran from the time counsel received notice and the appeal was timely filed when clocked from counsel's receipt of notice); <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dept. of State</span>, 60 MSPR 441, 444 (1994) (excusing a delay in filing when the appellant's counsel failed to respond to her repeated inquires about the status of her case; the appellant and her counsel were not acting as one). But if there is no representative or other individual responsible for monitoring a final agency decision, the time for filing the MSPB appeal runs from the appellant's actual receipt of the final agency decision, not from the date he would have received the decision had he provided the agency timely notice of a change of address. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Saddler v. Dept. of Army</span>, 68 F.3d 1357 (Fed. Cir. 1995). When there are issues of fact concerning the timeliness of a Board appeal following an EEO complaint, the Board is obliged to make factual findings on those issues and to develop the factual record as necessary to make the findings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Whittington v. MSPB</span>, 80 F.3d 471, 474-75 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (citing <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. MSPB</span>, 75 F.3d 639 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bobonis v. Dept. of Army,</span> DC-0752-10-0350-I-1 (NP 3/7/2011), excused a brief delay in filing of a mixed-case appeal when the appellant relied on the language of the Board regulation and calculated the filing date from her receipt of the EEO final decision rather than from the earlier receipt by her counsel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a formal equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint with the agency on several matters and later amended her complaint to include her removal, which she alleged was based on race and disability discrimination. On January 21, 2010, the agency issued a final decision finding no discrimination. The agency served copies of its decision on both the appellant and Mr. Humphrey S. Cummings, the appellant's designated attorney representative in her EEO complaint. Mr. Cummings received his copy of the final agency decision on January 25, 2010, and the appellant received her copy on February 9, 2010. The appellant filed the instant appeal concerning her removal on March 8, 2010--27 days after she received her copy of the final agency decision and 42 days after Mr. Cummings received his copy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an appellant elects to file a Board appeal after filing a timely formal complaint of discrimination with the agency and receiving a final agency decision on her complaint, such an appeal must be filed with the Board "within 30 days after the appellant receives the agency resolution or final decision on the discrimination issue." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(1); <span class="Italic">see Whittington v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 80 F.3d 471, 473-74 (Fed. Cir. 1996);<span class="Italic"> Williams v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 15 (2007). Under Board precedent, the time limit under section 1201.154(b) begins to run when the appellant or her duly designated representative receives the agency's final decision, whichever is earlier. <span class="Italic">Foley v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 402, &#x00B6; 5 (1999); <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Department of State</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 441, 444 (1994); <span class="Italic">see also Gragg v. United States</span>, 717 F.2d 1343, 1344-46 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (the filing period for judicial review began to run when the appellant's union representative received the Board's final decision); <span class="Italic">Earls v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 391, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4 (the petition for review filing period began to run when the appellant's representative received the initial decision), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 113 F. App'x 924 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, it is undisputed that Mr. Cummings received the agency's final decision on January 25, 2010. Counting forward 30 days from that date, the filing deadline was February 24, 2010. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(1). We therefore agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's March 8, 2010 appeal was untimely by 12 days. Nevertheless, for the <span id="Page_3321"></span>following reasons, we find that there is good cause to waive the filing deadline in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish good cause for the untimely filing of an appeal, a party must show that she exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). To determine whether an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of her excuse and her showing of due diligence, whether she is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether she has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond her control that affected her ability to comply with the time limits or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to her inability to timely file her appeal. <span class="Italic">Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we find that the 12-day filing delay in this case was not minimal, <span class="Italic">see Gonzalez v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 697, &#x00B6; 11 (2009) (an 8-day filing delay is not minimal), we also find that it was not particularly lengthy, <span class="Italic">see Rothlisberger v. Department of the Army</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 450, &#x00B6; 7 (2010) (a 14-day filing delay is not very lengthy). We further find that the appellant has provided a reasonable excuse for her filing delay, i.e., that she interpreted 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(1) according to its literal requirements and calculated the filing period based on the date that she personally received the agency's final decision. <span class="Italic">See Walls v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (the appellant's reasonable misinterpretation of the instructions for calculating the filing period constituted good cause for his filing delay); <span class="Italic">Lott v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 463, 464-65 (1985) (the appellant's plausible confusion about the finality date of the initial decision constituted good cause for the petition for review filing delay). There is no indication that the appellant's interpretation of the regulation was disingenuous, in bad faith, or in any way calculated to undermine the proceedings. We find that the appellant exercised due diligence in filing her appeal within the deadline as she calculated it. <span class="Italic">See Walls</span>, 29 F.3d at 1582. For these reasons, we find that the appellant has established good cause for her filing delay. <span class="Italic">See Fitzpatrick v. Department of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 318, 320-21 (1996) (the appellant's misconstruction of the filing period constituted a reasonable excuse for his filing delay). <span class="Italic">See generally Sanford v. Department of Defense</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 207, 210 (1994) ("All that is required to establish good cause is a reasonable excuse and any doubts about whether good cause has been shown should be resolved in favor of an appellant.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When a final agency decision is issued, under the regulation, the Board appeal is to be filed within 30 days after the appellant receives the agency final decision on the discrimination issue in the otherwise appealable action. If there is a question concerning timeliness of the appeal, the AJ should order both parties to submit evidence on the issue. <span class="Italic">Vitale v. VA</span>, 107 MSPR 501, 506 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10, 2007 MSPB 300 (2007); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Nesmith v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-0752-16-0048-I-1 (NP 8/19/2016) ("In this case, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1210.154(b)(2) applies, because the agency did not issue a FAD within 120 days of the appellant's formal EEO complaint. Had the appellant filed a Board appeal after the 120-day period, but before the issuance of a FAD, his appeal would have been timely filed. However, once the agency issued its FAD on January 29, 2015, the appellant was required under the same regulation to file his Board appeal within 30 days of his receipt of the FAD."); <span class="Italic">Maynor v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, PH-0752-14-0904-I-1 (NP 8/11/2016) ("To the extent the appellant asserts that her appeal was timely filed under the 'exception to the 30-day filing rule' set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(2) because the FAD was not issued within 120 days after she filed her formal complaint...that provision only applies where the agency has not yet issued a FAD, which is not the case here. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(2) ("Once the agency resolves the matter or issues a final decision on the formal complaint, an appeal must be filed within 30 days after the appellant receives the agency resolution or final decision on the discrimination issue."). For purposes of the regulation, the Board appeal is considered filed (if by mail) on the mailing date indicated by the postmark date (or if the appeal is filed in person, it is considered filed on the date that it is received in the regional office); the date that the appellant signed the appeal is not determinative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 16 MSPR 386, 387 (1983). The presumptive date of filing the MSPB appeal in a mixed case is the mailing (not receipt) date for the appeal. <span class="Italic">Schrank v. USPS</span>, 20 MSPR 141, 142 (1984) (because the appellant's appeal was postmarked a day before his EEO complaint was filed, the Board had immediate jurisdiction over his appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Section 1201.154 is based on the filing of an EEO complaint. If no formal EEO complaint was filed following initiation of EEO counseling, the Board applies the usual time limit of 30 days for filing the appeal under 5 CFR 1201.22(b). <span class="Italic">Cranston v. USPS</span>, 106 MSPR 290, 294-95 n.1, 2007 MSPB 181 (2007); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Worthey v.
