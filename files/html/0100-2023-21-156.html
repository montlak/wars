<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-154"><span class="space">c.</span> Wording of Decree</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A divorce decree need not use a precise set of words to confer a survivor annuity to a former spouse if the intent is apparent from the language of the court order and the appellant's circumstances, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. OPM</span>, 46 MSPR 651, 653-56 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a Federal employee elects to receive a reduced annuity at the time of retirement in order to provide a survivor annuity to his spouse, and the couple later divorces, the former spouse is entitled to retain her survivor annuity benefit "if and to the extent <span class="Italic">expressly provided for"</span> in the terms of the decree of divorce or court-approved property settlement agreement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) (emphasis added). The "expressly provided for" requirement is further explicated in OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704(c)(2):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">For purposes of awarding a former spouse annuity, the court order must either state the former spouse's entitlement to a survivor annuity or direct an employee, Member, or retiree to provide a former spouse annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Thomas contends that the court-approved property settlement agreement in this case did not "expressly provide for" a survivor annuity as required by the statute and OPM's regulation because it did not use the specific phrases "survivor annuity" or "former spouse annuity." Although the property settlement agreement in this case could have been more artfully worded, we believe that the language used--"The Husband agrees to maintain all rights and benefits to which the Wife is entitled and may realize in connection with his retirement and pension package as a [Federal retiree] "--clearly and unambiguously referred to the appellant's then existing survivor annuity. Indeed, Mr. Thomas has failed to point to any other right or benefit to which this language could have been intended to apply, and we concur with OPM and the administrative judge that no other reasonable construction is possible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We view the "expressly provided for" requirement of the statute and OPM's regulation as precluding OPM or the Board from undertaking its own determination of spousal entitlements or making an award of survivor benefits based on uncertain or ambiguous state court orders.[3] To say that a provision must be "express," however, is not to say that it must contain particular "magic words." A provision is "express" when it is "clear; definite; explicit; plain; direct; unmistakable; not dubious or ambiguous." Black's Law Dictionary 521 (5th ed. 1979). We conclude that, since the clear and unmistakable intent of the court order in this case was to award the appellant a survivor annuity, it "expressly provided for" that benefit within the meaning off section 8341(h)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The legislative history of the Spouse Equity Act does not include any significant explication of the "expressly provided for" language in section 8341(h)(1). This language is identical, however, to language in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1), which authorizes OPM to honor a state court order dividing a Federal retiree's pension as a marital asset. The legislative history of that provision, which was enacted in 1978, reflects Congress's judgment that, rather than undertake its own determination of spousal entitlements, the Federal government should defer to state courts, the traditional arbiters in divorce proceedings, as to the equitable division of Federal retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">See McDannell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 716 F.2d 1063, 1065-66 (5th Cir. 1983). For OPM or the Board to construe unclear and ambiguous state court orders as they relate to former spouse annuities would improperly make them, and not the state courts, the arbiters of spousal entitlements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Thomas's reliance on <span class="Italic">Bottrell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 36 MSPR 338 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd per curiam,</span> 867 F.2d 1421 (Fed. Cir. 1989), is inapposite. We there held that a divorce decree was ineffective to award a former spouse annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1), where it named the wife as the "sole and primary beneficiary of any death benefits which her husband would receive by reason of his employment with the United States government...." We noted, however, the ambiguity of the term "death benefits," which can mean either a survivor annuity or a lump-sum payment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> There is no such ambiguity in the court order at issue in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In further support of his argument that a qualifying court order must contain certain specific phrases, Mr. Thomas relies on a set of Guidelines issued by OPM to explain how it will interpret terms and phrases frequently used in awarding survivor benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. Part 831, Subpart Q, Appendix B. These Guidelines state that "[t]o provide a section 8339(j) [former spouse] annuity, the order <span class="Italic">must</span> use terms such as 'former spouse annuity,' 'section 8339(j) annuity,' or 'survivor annuity.'"<span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, despite the use of the word "must," the Guidelines were intended as aids to the practitioner, not as mandatory requirements. First, it is apparent that OPM itself does not view the Guidelines as substantive rules, since it did not cite them in its reconsideration decision as a basis for granting Mr. Thomas's request for a life rate annuity, and since OPM's current position is that the court-approved property settlement agreement is a qualifying court order under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704. Second, it is significant that the Guidelines are not contained in the regulations themselves, but in a separate Appendix. They presumably would have been incorporated into the regulations themselves if intended as mandatory requirements. Third, the term <span id="Page_4344"></span>"Guidelines," as opposed to "rules," "regulations," or "requirements," connotes something of an advisory nature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two other considerations assist us in our interpretation of the statute and OPM's regulation. First, Congress enacted section 8341(h) as remedial legislation to close what it perceived to be a significant gap in the financial protection afforded former spouses of Federal retirees. Prior to the Spouse Equity Act, OPM could honor a state court order dividing a Federal pension as a marital asset, but could not honor a state court order awarding a survivor annuity to a former spouse. The legislative history reflects Congress's concern about this gap in coverage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">For most former spouses of Federal employees, the threat of living in poverty is exacerbated. Most of these women remained in the home during their marriages and are not eligible for either social security or private pensions. Access to survivor benefits is vital to this group of former spouses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">H.R. No. 1054, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 12, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1984 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 5540, 5542-43. Remedial legislation such as section 8341(h) must be broadly construed to achieve its remedial purpose. <span class="Italic">See Hollander v. Office of Personnel Management</span> 39 MSPR 195, 200 (1988), <span class="Italic">review granted sub nom. Horner v. Hollander,</span> 878 F.2d 1443 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table). To hold that a court order does not award a survivor annuity to a former spouse unless it employs certain "magic words," even where such a benefit was clearly and unambiguously intended, would elevate form over substance and frustrate the Congressional purpose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, if a divorce decree or other court order fails to use appropriate language to award a survivor annuity, the former spouse does not have the opportunity to go back into state court and amend or modify the decree to properly award a survivor annuity.[4] This lack of an opportunity to correct an ambiguously worded order further militates against an overly strict or hypertechnical reading of section 8341(h).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Section 8341(h)(4) of Title 5, U.S.C., precludes OPM from honoring a court order awarding a former spouse annuity if the order constitutes a modification to the divorce decree made subsequent to the annuitant's retirement. OPM's regulations further provide that an order entered after an employee's retirement will not be effective to award a former spouse annuity unless it is the first order terminating the marital relationship between the retiree and the former spouse, and that it will not recognize a later order, such as a <span class="Italic">nunc pro tunc</span> order, that purports to retroactively amend, explain, clarify, or interpret the earlier order. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704(e). We have invalidated this regulation to the extent that it requires that a qualifying order must be the first order terminating the marital relationship, holding that an order may be effective to award a former spouse annuity if it is the first order in the divorce action that adjudicates property division and alimony issues. <span class="Italic">See Love v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 46 MSPR 641 (1991). We have not, however, invalidated OPM's rule regarding clarifying or explanatory orders.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the court decree does not include a reference specific enough to identify a survivor annuity interest, the Board will not ordinarily rely on extrinsic evidence to interpret the decree, <span class="Italic">Summers v. OPM</span>, 46 MSPR 657, 659-60 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8341(h)(1) of Title 5, United States Code, provides that a former spouse of a deceased Federal employee who was separated from the service with title to a deferred annuity is entitled to a survivor annuity under that subsection, if, and to the extent <span class="Italic">expressly provided for,</span> in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under OPM's implementing regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704(c)(2), the court order must either state the former spouse's entitlement to a survivor annuity or direct an employee, Member, or retiree to provide a former spouse annuity. A "former spouse annuity" is defined to mean a recurring benefit under the Civil Service Retirement System that is payable to a former spouse after the employee's, Member's, or retiree's death. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.603 and 831.1703.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the March 20, 1989, divorce decree failed to state that the appellant was entitled to a survivor annuity and did not direct Mr. Summers to provide a former spouse annuity to the appellant. Therefore, it did not "expressly provide for" a former spouse annuity within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1). Contrary to the administrative judge, we find that extrinsic evidence could not be relied upon to meet the statutory requirement. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 46 MSPR 651, 653-54 (1991) (while "express" does not require particular "magic words," the Board views the "expressly provided for" language requirement of the statute and OPM's regulation as precluding both OPM and the Board from undertaking their own determination of spousal entitlements or making an award of survivor benefits based upon the ambiguity or uncertainty of state court orders); <span class="Italic">Bottrell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 36 MSPR 338, 342 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 867 F.2d 1421 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (an appellant was not entitled to a survivor annuity because her divorce decree, by its own terms, did not provide her with a survivor annuity, as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)). Because the divorce decree failed on its face to conform to the statutory requirement, OPM properly found that the appellant was not entitled to a court-awarded survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>

<p class="Body-Text">The need for clarity in court orders was emphasized in <span class="Italic">Turner v. OPM</span>, 60 MSPR 55, 61-64 (1993), involving a dispute over whether a retirement benefit for a former spouse would be adjusted upward as a result of the annuitant's salary adjustments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM must give effect to qualifying court orders pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1), which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(j)(1) Payments under this subchapter which would otherwise be made to an employee, Member, or annuitant based upon his service shall be paid (in whole or in part) by the Office to another person if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of any court decree of divorce, annulment or legal separation, or the terms of any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation. Any payment under this paragraph to a person bars recovery by any other person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.1004(a) ("A former spouse is entitled to a portion of an employee's retirement benefits only to the extent that the division of retirement benefits is expressly provided for by the court order.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that it views the "expressly provided for" requirement as precluding OPM or the Board from undertaking its own determination of spousal entitlements or making an award based on uncertain or ambiguous state court orders. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 651, 654 (1991). A provision is "express" when it is "clear; definite; explicit; plain; direct; unmistakable; not dubious or ambiguous." BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 580 (6th ed. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's "Guidelines For Interpreting State Court Orders Dividing Civil Service Retirement Benefits" provide at VI.A concerning "State Law not Specified in Court Orders" that "OPM will not research, interpret, or apply State law regarding community or marital property rights or divisions."<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. part 838, subpart J, Appendix A, VI.A.1. We find that this is a reasonable policy and that it would be administratively burdensome to require OPM to go behind the express language of each state court order. We find that OPM has not abused its discretion in implementing such a policy and, therefore, that implementation of this policy does not constitute any legal error. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. at 653-54<span class="Italic">.</span> Thus, there is no compelling reason not to defer to this policy and OPM need not implement what is not expressly provided for in a state court decree. The interpretation of what is expressly provided for must, of course, be made on a case by case basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM explains that it has not excluded salary adjustments from the computation of the apportionment until its implementation of the July 22, 1992 decree because the original decree did not expressly so provide. The administrative judge found, however, that the language in paragraph 12, namely, "as of the date of the Decree of Dissolution" meant that OPM should exclude the appellant's salary adjustments from its computation of Marjorie Turner's share. We find that this language cannot be read to exclude salary adjustments after the date of the decree, Feb. 26, 1986. OPM's guidance has consistently stated that a divorce decree that calculates the former spouses' share of the annuity on a percentage basis at the time of the divorce will not prevent salary adjustments after the date of the divorce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulations at the time of the divorce do not specifically address salary adjustments. OPM did, however, have guidelines on interpreting state court orders dividing retirement benefits as Appendix A to 5 C.F.R. part 831, subpart Q (1985). The preamble to the guidelines explains that the purpose of the guidelines was to explain how OPM interprets language commonly used in court orders to ensure consistent results.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are two provisions under Guideline I, entitled "Cost-of-living and Salary Adjustments" that appear to directly address the language used in the court order in this case. Guideline I.A. provides that unless the court "directly and unequivocally orders otherwise," decrees which divide annuities on a percentage basis will be interpreted as subject to adjustments for COLAs and salary adjustments occurring after the decree is issued. Further Guideline I.D. provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A formula containing an instruction to calculate the former spouse's share effective at the time of divorce will not be interpreted to prevent cost-of-living or salary adjustments. To award a fixed dollar amount based on the rate of annuity which would have been paid if retirement occurred at the date of divorce, the decree must either state the dollar amount of the award or explain with sufficient clarity that salary adjustments, as well as service, after the date of the decree are to be disregarded in computing the former spouse's share.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. part 831, subpart Q, Appendix A, I.D. (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4345"></span>OPM's current guidelines reflect the same policy but require more specific language in the court order to exclude salary adjustments after the date of the divorce in computing the former spouse's share. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. part 838, subpart J, Appendix A, I.B.1.-I.B.4. (1993). OPM also now has regulations to the same effect. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.622 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the language in the original court decree, "as of the date of the Decree of Dissolution" cannot be read to exclude salary adjustments after the date of the divorce. It did not "directly" and "unequivocally" provide for such exclusions and, in accordance with the guidance noted above, the court order must be interpreted as subject to salary adjustments. Thus, Marjorie Turner's share of the appellant's annuity must include such adjustments, OPM contends that it should.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor is this result altered by the language in the original court order stating that "any contribution to the Respondent's plan thereafter shall be his." Such language is not sufficiently clear to exclude salary adjustments after the date of the divorce. OPM has consistently distinguished between the terms "contributions" and "retirement benefits" and "annuities" in interpreting state court orders dividing retirement benefits. OPM uses the word "contributions" when referring to the division of refunds of contributions the employee paid into the retirement fund. There is no indication that the word "contributions" is interchangeable with "salary adjustments."<span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 C.F.R. part 838, subpart E (1993); Appendix A to 5 C.F.R. part 831, subpart Q at Guideline IV (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties to the divorce decree are obligated to make clear their intentions and the 1986 decree is not sufficiently clear so as to exclude salary adjustments after the date of the divorce. OPM's decision to exclude salary adjustments prospectively after it received the 1992 amended decree with clarifying language pertaining to salary adjustments is proper.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of the need for a decree to make plain the intent to provide a former spouse survivor annuity, rather than a division of an annuity interest, under <span class="Italic">Booker v. OPM</span>, 577 Fed. Appx. 1000, 1001-02 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The applicable regulations provide that a court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity must (1) identify the retirement system, and (2) expressly state that the former spouse is entitled to a former spouse survivor annuity using terms like "survivor annuity," "death benefits," or "former spouse survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1)." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 838.804, 838.912. Ms. Booker's divorce decree did neither. Thus, the Board did not err in concluding that the "decree contains no provision for a survivor annuity, or any other terminology that 'could fairly be read as awarding a CSRS survivor annuity.'" <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span> at 4 (quoting <span class="Italic">Fox v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 100 F.3d 141, 146 (Fed. Cir. 1996)). Rather, the Board concluded--correctly--that the "divorce decree did nothing more than divide the decedent's retirement annuity, which he never had the chance to receive and which would, in any event, cease upon his death." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, Ms. Booker cannot rely on the excuse that neither the judge nor the parties knew that the divorce decree was required to identify the retirement system or use sufficiently clear language, as the regulations establishing those requirements were in place well before the divorce decree was issued in 2002.</p>
