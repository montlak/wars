<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-76"><span class="space">8.</span> Discharge of Probationer</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considers appeals from agency actions adverse to probationary employees under OPM regulation, 5 CFR 315.806(b) (2022), if probationary employees allege that the adverse actions were the result of partisan political or marital status discrimination, <span class="Italic">Stokes v. FAA</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 687 (Fed. Cir. 1985), or if those employees allege procedural irregularities in termination for preappointment conditions [described in Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-105.html#sec1-104">Preappointment Conditions</a>"] . Under 5 USC 7703(b)(1) and 28 USC 1295(a)(9), the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over an appeal from a final MSPB order. 5 USC 7702 and 7703(b)(2) place jurisdiction in district courts over cases of discrimination <span id="Page_5281"></span>arising under the Civil Rights Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and &#x00A7; 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. However, marital status and partisan political discrimination, the bases for probationary appeals under 5 CFR 315.806(b) (2022), are not types of discrimination falling within &#x00A7; 7702. Appeals from decisions involving these two types of discrimination are within the jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Stokes v. FAA</span>, 761 F.2d 682 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not have jurisdiction to entertain a probationer's complaint that he was terminated solely due to national origin discrimination. Jurisdiction over Title VII discrimination suits lies in district courts; the Federal Circuit is then without jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a Board order. <span class="Italic">Granado v. DOJ</span>, 721 F.2d 804, 807 (Fed. Cir. 1983). In his dissent, Judge Miller noted that the better course would have been to affirm the Board's finding that it lacked jurisdiction rather than deciding that the court lacked jurisdiction to review the Board's ruling concerning its jurisdiction. The result would be to encourage simultaneous proceedings in district courts and the Federal Circuit to see who had jurisdiction to review a Board decision that the Board lacked jurisdiction, a circuitous means to address a simple question. The court does dismiss probationary employee appeals if a threshold jurisdictional basis is not established, irrespective of an attempt to plead a form of discrimination prohibited under Title VII. The Federal Circuit will review a Board decision dismissing a probationary employee's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, even though the employee would like to have adjudicated a claim of racial discrimination, if the Board does not reach that claim because the employee does not make a proper preliminary showing of marital status or partisan political discrimination. <span class="Italic">Hardy v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 86-1658).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Granado</span> jurisdictional analysis was questioned but not upset by <span class="Italic">Fox v. DOD</span>, 549 Fed. Appx. 969, 971-72 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP), involving the appeal of a terminated probationer who did not assert marital status or partisan political discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that there were only two ways for Mr. Fox to establish the Board's jurisdiction: he could show that he was not, in fact, a probationary employee, or he could show that he nevertheless had a regulatory right to appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b). Mr. Fox conceded that he was a probationary employee at the time of his allegedly involuntary resignation. Therefore, Board jurisdiction depended on whether Mr. Fox claimed that his removal "was based on partisan political reasons or marital status." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b). But Mr. Fox has never made any such allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Fox asserts instead that his involuntary resignation was the result of race and age discrimination and a hostile work environment. Those allegations do not give rise to a right to appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b). The Board may not consider a probationary employee's claims of age or race discrimination unless they are raised "in addition to" one of the claims that give rise to Board jurisdiction under subsection (b) or under subsection (c), the latter involving procedural error. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 315.806(d). But Mr. Fox undisputedly has made no allegations falling within subsections (b) or (c), leaving his discrimination claim outside the regulatory authorization of appeals to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the foregoing analysis, this court would have statutory jurisdiction to hear Mr. Fox's appeal. But the analysis that supports this court's statutory jurisdiction rests on, and therefore simultaneously would require affirming, the Board's conclusion that <span class="Italic">it</span> lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Fox's claim. The result would be to leave the Board's determination that it cannot hear Mr. Fox's claim in place.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The same bottom-line result for Mr. Fox's claim would follow, of course, if this court lacked statutory jurisdiction to hear Mr. Fox's appeal. That possibility is raised, not by any doubt about how the <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>-directed analysis of our jurisdictional statutes comes out, but by an old precedent of this court. <span class="Italic">Granado v. Department of Justice</span>, 721 F.2d 804 (Fed. Cir. 1983), held that this court lacked jurisdiction to review a Board decision that a probationary employee's appeal alleging national-origin discrimination must be dismissed as falling outside 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806. That precedent appears to be on point in the present case involving allegations of race and age discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, there is reason to question whether <span class="Italic">Granado</span> is any longer good law insofar as it found this court to lack jurisdiction. This court has apparently never relied on <span class="Italic">Granado</span> for its jurisdictional holding. Moreover, in unpublished decisions, this court has consistently affirmed, rather than dismissed appeals from, decisions of the Board that dismissed appeals of probationary employees for lack of Board jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 495 Fed. Appx. 68 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">Nguyen v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 360 Fed. Appx. 146 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 241 Fed. Appx. 705 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 55 Fed. Appx. 917 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Yu v. Dep't of Army</span>, 28 Fed. Appx. 968 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Dep't of Air Force</span>, 15 Fed. Appx. 869 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Robertson v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 826 F.2d 1072 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Stokes v. FAA</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 687-88 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (court has jurisdiction over the Board's dismissal of a probationary employee's appeal for failure to support the jurisdictional allegation of marital discrimination). And the result in <span class="Italic">Granado</span> stands in stark contrast to this court's recent holding in <span class="Italic">Conforto v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 713 F.3d 1111 (Fed. Cir. 2013), that this court has jurisdiction to review the Board's determination of its own lack of jurisdiction over an appeal by a (nonprobationary) employee who alleged discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has recognized that, in appropriate circumstances, an earlier panel decision must be treated by a later panel as having been superseded by an intervening Supreme Court decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Doe v. United States</span>, 372 F.3d 1347, 1354-56 (Fed. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Tex. Am. Oil Corp. v. U.S. Dep't of Energy</span>, 44 F.3d 1557, 1561 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Perhaps that is so for <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> and <span class="Italic">Granado</span>. But we need not say.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dispositive point here is that if <span class="Italic">Granado</span> deprives us of jurisdiction over Mr. Fox's appeal, we could not change the Board's decision that it lacked jurisdiction over his claim, which would therefore stand, and the same result for Mr. Fox's claim would follow if we recognized our own statutory jurisdiction, which would also leave the Board's decision in place. In these circumstances, we need not decide the question of our own statutory jurisdiction. No concrete result for Mr. Fox could be altered by such a decision. His appeal is therefore dismissed for want of a concrete controversy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Courts affirm Board orders dismissing probationary employees' appeals for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Budnick v. MSPB</span>, 643 F.2d 278, 279 (5th Cir. 1981), adopting the Board's view of limited jurisdiction over those cases. The Board's interpretation of partisan political discrimination in <span class="Italic">Sweeting v. DOJ,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SWEETING_AT315H09025_OPINION_AND_ORDER_253979.pdf">6 MSPR 715</a>, 6 MSPB 598 (1981), was accepted in <span class="Italic">Mastriano v. FAA</span>, 714 F.2d 1152 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The court did not explain whether the petitioner's claims of constitutional and other defects in his termination were cognizable in a forum other than the MSPB, e.g., the Court of Federal Claims or in a federal district court. In an opinion providing close statutory analysis, the First Circuit concluded that a probationary employee, who is specifically left uncovered by 5 USC 7513, has no statutory (as opposed to regulatory) right of appeal to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Piskadlo v. VA</span>, 668 F.2d 82, 84 (1st Cir. 1982). Written by the late Judge Davis of the Federal Circuit, sitting with the First Circuit by designation, the court's opinion determined that the regulatory authorization for appeal is limited to termination of a probationer based on marital status or partisan politics. No other type of discrimination provides an appeal right unless it is joined with one of the issues defined as appealable under the regulation. The court left open the question of whether a probationer could bring suit directly in district court or the Claims Court [now the U.S. Court of Federal Claims], with no review by MSPB:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to the effective date of the Civil Service Reform Act there were cases authorizing such a suit. <span class="Italic">Shaw v. United States</span>, 622 F.2d 520 (1980); <span class="Italic">Perlongo v. United States</span>, 566 F.2d 1192 (1977); <span class="Italic">Horne v. United States</span>, 419 F.2d 416 (1969); <span class="Italic">Dargo v. United States</span>, 176 Ct. Cl. 1193 (1966); <span class="Italic">Greenway v. United States</span>, 163 Ct. Cl. 72 (1963). The effect on those holdings of the Civil Service Reform Act, with its different provisions, will have to be decided in some other case and, at least initially, by another forum.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It was later determined that the Civil Service Reform Act does not provide a private right of action in the Claims Court [now the U.S. Court of Federal Claims] for probationary employees to seek judicial review of their removals. <span class="Italic">United States v. Connolly</span>, 716 F.2d 882, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Bante v. MSPB</span>, 966 F.2d 647, 650 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("Congress clearly intends review of the termination of probationary employees [to] be more limited than that of other employees."). Nor does the First Amendment provide a basis for recovery in the Claims Court under the Tucker Act for a probationer who alleges that his discharge was based on retaliation for protected speech or grievances. Unlike the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, the terms of the First Amendment neither explicitly nor implicitly obligate the federal government to pay damages, a condition of recovery under the Tucker Act. The court offered no opinion as to whether a First Amendment claim would be within the nonmonetary jurisdiction of a district court. The Back Pay Act is derivative in application, not a jurisdictional statute. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. United States</span>, 192 Ct. Cl. 765 (1970), and <span class="Italic">Swaaley v. United States</span>, 180 Ct. Cl. 1 (1967), were inapplicable because, although they involved First Amendment claims, they were within the joint purview of the Tucker Act and statutes mandating pay rates.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although little substantive review of probationary discharges is conducted by the Board, there may be some hope for review by the district courts. The problem has been that the government is expected to act rationally and abide by minimal due process standards in its treatment of citizens, yet summary discharge of probationers can result in the loss of jobs for reasons unsupported by evidence and occasionally motivated by far less than good judgment. Although the Special Counsel theoretically exists to remedy the most egregious prohibited personnel practices, historically OSC has not litigated many corrective action cases; for this reason, some probationers look to the courts. One interesting result appears as an unpublished opinion from the Tenth Circuit, <span class="Italic">Walker v. United States</span>, noted at 744 F.2d 67 (10th Cir. 1984). The plaintiff, a probationary Air Force employee, was fired for making a false statement on an employment application. He was allowed, and he used, a five-day notice period to deny the allegation orally and in writing. Nonetheless, he was fired. The court recognized that, as a probationer, the plaintiff lacked full due process protections; however, the court held that when during the <span id="Page_5282"></span>course of a discharge the government stigmatizes an individual or forecloses significant employment opportunities, the employee should have the opportunity for a hearing permitting him to test the validity of the proposed discharge. The main case cited in support of the court's conclusion was <span class="Italic">Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth</span>, 408 U.S. 564 (1972). The Tenth Circuit found that the charge of falsifying an employment application was stigmatizing, and such a charge foreclosed employment opportunities within the Air Force. The court reasoned that other opportunities within the government would be foreclosed because the employee would be required to disclose the past discharge and its basis. The court determined that the minimal due process due the plaintiff was comprised of an impartial tribunal, notice of the charges in a reasonable time before a hearing, and a hearing before the effective date of a termination (in a footnote, the court suggested that a post-termination hearing might be adequate). The plaintiff was not required to exhaust MSPB procedures. They only protected him if he charged covered discrimination or improper procedures. The case was remanded to a district court for consideration of an appropriate remedy. In some cases involving name-clearing hearings, the remedy is the hearing itself. If the plaintiff is successful, it would appear that the documents recording the reasons for the termination are changed. There does not appear to be a strong trend toward awarding back pay as a remedy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Walker</span> reflects an extension of the <span class="Italic">Roth</span> doctrine, interpreted by most courts to apply only when there is either public disclosure of stigmatizing information by the government or significant foreclosure of employment opportunity. The foreclosure concept has not been particularly well defined in government employment. Usually an individual who has been discharged is not actually barred from re-employment, but rather is placed at a somewhat speculative disadvantage. The <span class="Italic">Walker</span> result is interesting: it allows the probationer with an arguable constitutional deprivation to go straight to court, avoiding the Board and the Special Counsel.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cunningham v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/CUNNINGHAM_SUSAN_M_DE_315H_12_0263_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_791540.pdf">119 MSPR 147</a>, 152-53 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12, 2013 MSPB 7 (2013), determined that if the Board lacked jurisdiction over a probationer's appeal, it could not provide a mixed-case judicial review notice. Instead, the Board would identify the Federal Circuit as the only appropriate route of judicial review:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an individual alleges that a personnel action, which can be appealed to the Board, was taken against him because of discrimination, the dispute is referred to as a "mixed case appeal." <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(a)(2). The statute governing mixed cases provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, in the case of any employee or applicant for employment who--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;has been affected by an action which the employee or applicant may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-16),</p>

<p class="Block-Quote3">(iv)&#x2003;sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 631, 633a), or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(v)&#x2003;any rule, regulation, or policy directive prescribed under any provision of law described in clauses (i) through (iv) of this subparagraph,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the Board shall, within 120 days of the filing of the appeal, decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures under section 7701 of this title and this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). The appellant in a mixed case may seek review of the Board's final decision before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; he may also institute an action in federal district court, where the Board's findings and conclusions on issues other than discrimination are subject to review and the discrimination claim proceeds <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7702(b)(1) &#x0026; (d)(1), 7703(b)(2). By contrast, the appellant in a non-mixed case may seek review of the Board's final decision before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the past, the Board has provided notice of mixed-case appeal rights in its final decision only when the Board actually decided a claim of discrimination. In all other cases--including one in which a claim of discrimination was raised but not decided--the Board has provided notice of non-mixed appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Haffarnan v. Department of the Army</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 348, &#x00B6; 3 (2000) (the administrative judge "erred in failing to provide the appellant with notice of 'mixed case' appeal rights after she adjudicated the appellant's claim of disability discrimination"); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of the Army</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 678, 682-83 (1987) (providing non-mixed appeal rights in an appeal from a removal because, under the unusual circumstances of the case, the administrative judge "properly dismissed the appellant's claim of discrimination" without deciding it).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court's recent decision in <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-184_5ifl.pdf">133 S. Ct. 596</a>, 184 L. Ed. 2d 433 (2012), requires us to reexamine the circumstances under which we provide notice of mixed-case appeal rights in our final decisions. In <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, the appellant appealed her removal to the Board and claimed that the action was motivated by sex and age discrimination. She sought and received a dismissal of her appeal without prejudice, but she refiled her appeal beyond the deadline for doing so. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal as untimely refiled and did not decide the appellant's discrimination claims. <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Department of Labor</span>, MSPB Docket No. CH-0752-08-0150-I-1, Initial Decision (Feb. 27, 2008). Neither party filed a petition for review with the full Board, so the administrative judge's decision became final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant then filed an action in district court. The court dismissed the matter, reasoning that review lay in the Federal Circuit and not in district court because the final Board decision did not resolve "the merits of [the appellant's] discrimination claim[s]." <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, No. 4:09CV804-DJS, 2010 U.S. Dist. Lexis 14425 (E.D. Mo. Feb. 18, 2010). The Eighth Circuit affirmed based on the same rationale. <span class="Italic">Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, 639 F.3d 834, 838 (8th Cir. 2011) (the appellant's right of review was in the Federal Circuit because "the MSPB did not reach the merits of Kloeckner's discrimination claims").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the district court had jurisdiction. The Court began its analysis with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2), which provides that "[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;] 7702 shall be filed" in district court. <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, 133 S. Ct. at 603. The Court then explained that cases of discrimination "subject to" section 7702 are those in which the appellant "has been affected by an action which [she] may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board" and "alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination" prohibited by one of the listed statutes. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 603-04 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(A) &#x0026; (B)). The Court concluded that such cases must be filed in district court, not the Federal Circuit, even when the Board does not decide the discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 604.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of <span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span>, we shall now provide notice of mixed-case appeal rights in all cases in which the appellant was affected by an action that he or she may appeal to the Board and alleges prohibited discrimination, regardless of whether we decide the claim of discrimination. In providing such notice of the option to file a civil action in district court, we would make no representation whether the district court will determine that the appellant has met the administrative exhaustion requirements for filing a civil action before that court. In the present case, we provide notice of non-mixed appeal rights. Although the appellant alleges that the agency's decision to terminate her appointment during her probationary period was based on disability discrimination, as fully explained above she does not have the right to appeal her probationary termination to the Board.</p>
