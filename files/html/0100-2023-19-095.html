<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-91"><span class="space">2.</span> Evaluation of Reassignment Effort</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Reassignment is an accommodation, not an absolute requirement, for a disabled employee. The Rehabilitation Act does not require the employee to apply for reassignment; it is sufficient for the employee to refer to a specific position with duties he believes he could perform. <span class="Italic">Cavanagh v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 485, 491-92 (1990) ("Although an application for reassignment may be required under the agency's collective bargaining agreement, it is not required under the Rehabilitation Act."). General testimony concerning the availability of positions is unlikely to meet the appellant's burden of identifying a vacant funded position. The AJ should ensure that the appellant understands that <span id="Page_3502"></span>positions should be specifically identified, and the AJ should ensure the availability of discovery to develop evidence of positions available at the time of the appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kohl v. Dept. of Army</span>, 80 MSPR 678, 681-82 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Accommodation may depend on timing, <span class="Italic">Thibeault v. MSPB</span>, 611 Fed. Appx. 975, 978 (Fed. Cir. 2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...When determining if an agency failed to provide reasonable accommodations, a claimant must prove that such an accommodation was available at the relevant time. <span class="Italic">See Benavidez v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 241 F.3d 1370, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2001). If there was no accommodation available, then an agency cannot be found to have constructively suspended or removed a claimant. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Williams v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 227 Fed. Appx. 916, 919 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency attempts to find a position that would accommodate the appellant through a reassignment, but the agency is unsuccessful, removal of the employee is not a failure to accommodate, <span class="Italic">Massey v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MASSEY_DEBORAH_K_CH_0752_12_0362_I_3_OPINION_AND_ORDER_921746.pdf">120 MSPR 226</a>, 233-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13, 2013 MSPB 80 (2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an agency fails to meet its obligation to accommodate an employee before it removes her, the agency's failure at that time to look for a position as a reasonable accommodation nevertheless does not relieve the appellant of her burden of ultimately showing that such positions existed and were available. <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. at 54. Here, the appellant claimed that she applied for multiple positions primarily involving telephone duty. Although the appellant offered the sworn statement from a coworker, who stated that she helped her apply for those positions, the appellant did not submit other evidence that would have shown these positions existed, e.g., copies of vacancy notices, job applications, requests for a reasonable accommodation, etc.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the agency could have accommodated the appellant by reassigning her, it is unlikely she could have performed the essential functions of the new position. <span class="Italic">See Paris v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 331 (2006) ("In a disability discrimination case concerning denial of a reasonable accommodation, the appellant ultimately must prove that he is a qualified person with a disability, i.e., a disabled individual who can perform the essential functions of his position, with or without reasonable accommodation. The appellant cannot prevail merely by 'articulating' a reasonable accommodation."). Although she may have had the requisite nursing skills, the positions were located in the hospital, as was the position from which she was removed. She would have been exposed to the substances that aggravate her condition. The agency averred that it was unable to modify in-hospital positions for the appellant to allow her to avoid these substances. The agency also averred that it had unsuccessfully tried to find a suitable position for the appellant outside of the hospital, but she had been less than cooperative in that process. Further, the requirement that an agency accommodate a qualified disabled employee is not infinite--it must search its vacancies and take other potentially fruitful steps, but it need not consider reassignment <span class="Italic">ad infinitum</span> or create a position where none exists. <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Department of Education</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 519, 529-30 (Spec. Pan. 1986), <span class="Italic">vacated on other grounds</span>, 665 F. Supp. 62 (D.D.C. 1987). The appellant thus failed to meet her burden of proof. In contrast, the agency presented unrebutted evidence that it sought to accommodate the appellant's condition. Accordingly, we will not disturb the administrative judge's findings with respect to disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee identifies a position and the agency fails to convince the Board that reassignment of the disabled employee would pose an undue hardship or violate the employee's medical restrictions, the Board reverses the adverse action against the employee who was insufficiently accommodated. <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 60 MSPR 279, 281-85 (1994), involved the reversal of the removal of a machinist whose disability involved a disabling reaction to dust. The agency should have accommodated him by assigning him to an available position in a dust-free environment. The reinstatement order of the Board did not direct such an accommodation; it only reversed the removal based on a charge that the appellant was physically unable to perform the duties of his position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant conceded that medical restrictions against exposure to dust and solvents rendered him unable to perform the duties of the position, but he raised the affirmative defense of handicap discrimination, arguing that the restrictions did not prevent him from performing the duties of vacant positions in three specified locations. The agency stated that it had considered accommodating the appellant's restrictions by assigning him to one of those locations (the Cordax Room), but it argued that his restrictions nonetheless would have precluded him from working in that area.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge erred when he found that the appellant had shown that he had a handicapping condition. A "handicapped person" is defined as one who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities; one who has a record of such an impairment; or one who is regarded as having such an impairment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.702(a). The inquiry whether an employee is a "handicapped person" for purposes of working is an individualized one which focuses on whether the particular impairment constitutes for the particular person a significant barrier to employment; the impairment must foreclose generally the type of employment involved<span class="Italic">. See Miller v. United States Postal Service</span>, 43 MSPR 473, 477-78 (1990). Relevant to that inquiry are the number and type of jobs from which the impaired employee is disqualified, the geographic area to which the employee has reasonable access, and the employee's job expectations and training<span class="Italic">. See Miller</span>, 43 MSPR at 477.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence of record shows that the appellant was diagnosed in September 1989 as having headaches caused by allergic rhinitis, and it reveals that he was medically restricted thereafter from exposure to dust or solvents. It also shows that all of the appellant's Federal work experience and training prior to this diagnosis (since 1979) involved duties as a Machinist, Machine Tool Operator, or Mechanic. And, it reveals that the appellant was loaned after October 1989 to various jobs at Kelly Air Force Base while the agency tried to find a permanent position for him in which he could work within his restrictions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Evidence in the record also demonstrates that the agency could not place him in the type of position for which he was qualified (operating or repairing machines), because the work environments involved were in conflict with his medical restrictions. In contrast, the accommodation requested by the appellant (assignment to work as a Machinist in the Cordax Room) involves a work environment that is "unique" at the "Kelly [Air Force Base] industrial complex" because of its "ideal" climate-controlled environment; on that basis, an agency doctor recommended that the appellant be assigned to a position in the Cordax Room.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It therefore appears that the appellant's condition disqualified him from performing the duties of almost all positions at Kelly Air Force Base involving the operation and repair of machines and that it represented a significant impediment to his employability, given the extensive amount of work experience and training that he had invested in that type of position. As noted above, the recommendation that he work as a Machinist in the Cordax Room was premised on its especially clean work environment, differing from other such facilities at Kelly Air Force Base.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Examination of the facts in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> and of the cases discussed by the Board in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> also reveals that the appellant's situation is distinguishable from that of the employees who were held not to have a handicapping condition. In general, the appellant had greater job expectations and training invested in his position than those employees; the record evidence in this appeal also makes a stronger showing than in those appeals that the appellant's condition disqualified him from a broad range of positions whose duties he could perform<span class="Italic">. Miller</span>, 43 MSPR at 478-79. The record thus supports the administrative judge's finding, that the appellant was a handicapped employee, because it shows that his condition foreclosed generally the type of employment for which he had been extensively trained and in which he had ten years of work experience<span class="Italic">. See Miller</span>, 43 MSPR at 477-78.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also contends that assigning the appellant to the Cordax Room would be in conflict with his medical restrictions. The appellant's second-line supervisor (Mr. Gorden) testified that he considered the term "solvents" in the statement of the appellant's medical restrictions to include the oil and grease normally found in the Cordax Room; he reported that he had telephoned the clinic at Kelly Air Force Base and that the medical personnel there had confirmed his interpretation. The appellant, on the other hand, testified that he could work with oil, grease, and water-soluble coolants without allergic reactions. Both Mr. Melo and Mr. Gorden also claimed that the appellant, while walking through a workshop area to the Cordax Room, would be exposed to dust and solvents and could not perform the duties of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted, the agency did not introduce any evidence from clinic officials at Kelly Air Force that would confirm Mr. Gorden's account and his interpretation of the term "solvents." And, as the administrative judge also remarked, it is not clear why two doctors would restrict the appellant only from exposure to "dust or solvents" when they also intended him to avoid exposure to oil or grease. Moreover, the agency did not submit any evidence supporting the claims of Mr. Melo and Mr. Gorden that brief, infrequent exposure to dust or solvents while walking through a workshop area would foreclose the appellant from performing his duties in the Cordax Room.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency did submit a disability retirement application prepared by the appellant, in which he stated that he could not "work with solvents, coolants, oils, etc." and that he was "[a]llergic to dust." As noted above, however, two doctors who evaluated the appellant's condition concluded that he was allergic to dust and solvents but did not state that he was allergic to oils, grease, or coolants. And, the appellant clearly testified at the hearing that his condition would not prevent him from working with oils and coolants in the Cordax Room. The brief statement on the disability retirement application thus cannot overcome the specific <span id="Page_3503"></span>evidence of record and hearing testimony which show that the appellant could have been accommodated. The administrative judge therefore correctly found that the agency's stated reason for failing to assign the appellant to the Cordax Room was not legitimate and that the agency thus had not rebutted the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination made out by the appellant<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who prevails in a Board appeal is entitled to be placed in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> by being returned to a position of the same grade, pay, status, and tenure<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 46 MSPR 75, 79 (1990). However, a Board Order placing the employee in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> does not require the agency to assign him to a position at a specific work location<span class="Italic">. See LaBatte v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 586, 594 (1993); <span class="Italic">see also Adams v. Department of the Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 276, 282 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's Order directed the agency to assign the appellant "to a WG-10 position in the Cordax Room <span class="Italic">or to an equivalent position</span>." The phrase "or to an equivalent position" limits the scope of the Order, and it thus merely instructs the agency to restore the appellant without demoting him, by returning him to a position of the same grade, pay, status, and tenure as the WG-10 position that he held before his removal. The Order thus correctly directs the agency to place the appellant in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante. See Gonzales</span>, 46 MSPR at 79. Even with the limiting phrase, however, the Order still suggests at least implicitly that the appellant should be placed in a particular position at a specific work location (the Cordax Room). The administrative judge thus erred technically by including unnecessary language in the Order which made this suggestion<span class="Italic">. See LaBatte</span>, 58 MSPR at 594; <span class="Italic">Adams</span>, 51 MSPR at 282. Because the Order still permits the agency to return the appellant to his former position, however, we find that it has not been harmed by the administrative judge's error, <span class="Italic">see Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984), and have simply corrected that error below by modifying the Order.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">An agency is not required to consider every possible reassignment. If an agency has reasonably considered reassignment, it is not required to consider reassignment <span class="Italic">ad infinitum</span>. <span class="Italic">Malbouf v.

The same is true of the restructuring of a vacant position: the agency need not consider reassignment to a vacancy <span class="Italic">ad infinitum</span> or create a position where none exists; the agency must consider whether vacant positions identified by the appellant can be restructured to accommodate his disability. <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Army</span>, 46 MSPR 63, 68 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Mengine v.

<p class="Body-Text">The agency is not required to retain an employee in a position until a suitable position is found. <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 451, 457 (1989) (removal for the physical inability to perform the duties of a plastic fabricator helper). If there is no job that the appellant can be reassigned to and still perform useful work without injuring himself or others, assuming the agency's reassignment efforts are in good faith and that the appellant has not suggested reassignment possibilities unexplored by the agency, the failure to secure a successful reassignment does not demonstrate unlawful discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lamb v.

<p class="Body-Text">Reassignment efforts need not result in reassignment: an agency provided sufficient assistance to the employee by making one job offer that was refused. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Orias v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 11 MSPR 350, 352 (1982). The employee may not unilaterally decide the accommodation that is required, <span class="Italic">Hyatt v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 362, 365-66 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Appellant unilaterally decided that the only action that would accommodate his handicap would be reassignment to a carrier position. He would not report for duty so that the agency could modify the LSM position to accommodate him, nor would be accept other positions offered him which the agency believed would accommodate his handicap. The Board rejects appellant's implication that the agency must attempt to accommodate the employee in the manner he desires rather than through other appropriate accommodations which would serve the interests of both parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record demonstrates that the agency referred appellant's case to the light duty committee and that it stood ready to accommodate him. Appellant, however, failed to appear for work during a 9-month period, insisting that there could only be one accommodation for his handicap. The Board finds that the medical evidence submitted by appellant fails to support this assertion. Further, the agency stated that it considered the positions offered to require physical activities similar to those involved in a carrier position. The Board concludes that appellant's own actions prevented the agency from accommodating his handicap.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, the Board finds that the agency attempted to accommodate appellant's handicap, but that because he insisted on only one accommodation, appellant refused to appear for work to attempt to cooperate with the agency. Absent medical evidence that accommodations such as the agency suggested would be injurious to appellant or unsuccessful attempts by the appellant to work under those conditions, the Board concludes, as did the presiding official, that appellant's allegation of discrimination is unsupported.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Wilson v. INS</span>, 55 MSPR 40, 44 (1992) (although an agency must consider reassignment as a reasonable accommodation of a qualified disabled employee, there is no requirement that the employee select the position that he will receive by reassignment; the agency does not fail in its accommodative responsibilities if the employee will not cooperate by undertaking other positions offered as accommodation by the agency); <span class="Italic">Brunda v.

<p class="Body-Text">But if the agency does not make a good faith (reasonably searching) effort to find a reassignment for a disabled employee who identifies a possible vacancy, the employee may succeed in an affirmative defense to a medical disability removal, <span class="Italic">Kelly v. TVA</span>, AT-0752-15-0064-I-1 (NP 6/16/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed this appeal challenging the agency's action removing him from the position of Senior Nuclear Security Officer (NSO) at the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Watts Bar Nuclear Plant in Spring City, Tennessee, effective September 11, 2014. The agency based the action on a charge of failure to meet the requirements of the Senior NSO position due to medical restrictions.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The NSO position is a law enforcement officer position that includes medical standards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant was hired in June 2009, and that in 2013, he began to experience progressively more severe symptoms of an injury he sustained in 2005 while serving in the Department of the Army in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Because he was concerned about his symptoms, which include periodic loss of control over his legs, and his ability to respond in the event of an emergency, on November 19, 2013, the appellant had his physician write a letter detailing his medical restrictions. This letter stated that the appellant had been diagnosed with spastic gait, which interfered with "his ability to walk and makes running very difficult and decreases his ability to control his legs when necessary to stop," and that the appellant was having pain on the left <span id="Page_3504"></span>side of his spine that was worsened by strenuous movement or activity. This letter was provided to the agency in November 2013, and the agency immediately pulled the appellant's S11-Medical Clearance Form and placed him on administrative leave. The appellant later met with the agency's Site Security Superintendent who advised him that the agency would look for a job for him, and he provided her with a copy of his r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;. On November 22, 2013, the Site Security Superintendent emailed the appellant's r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; to the Senior Human Resources (HR) Generalist for Watts Barr. The Site Security Superintendent stated in her email that the appellant "had his S11 pulled last night" and "he's asked if we could help finding him another position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Senior HR Generalist testified that she had several conversations with the appellant by telephone and email about available jobs in TVA and about possible disability benefits and that she told him that he also should look for jobs. She also testified that she told him that she would do everything in her power to find him another position and that she followed the agency's standard process for reassignments by emailing his r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; to three other agency HR employees and asking if they knew of "anything in TVA in which he would be qualified." The Senior HR Generalist followed up with two additional emails asking to be contacted if the agency HR employees knew of an opening that might fit the appellant's qualifications. On June 1, 2014, the agency proposed to remove the appellant from his position for failing to meet the medical requirements of his position, and his removal was effective on September 11, 2014.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the administrative judge found that the medical documentation supported the agency's removal action by preponderant evidence. However, the administrative judge found that the agency failed to make a good faith effort to accommodate the appellant through reassignment. The administrative judge found no documentary evidence that the agency ever performed a search of available positions for the appellant or any other evidence showing that anyone looked at the appellant's qualifications to see if he could be placed in any of the vacant, funded positions during the relevant time period. Furthermore, the administrative judge found that the agency failed to produce any position descriptions of available funded positions. Thus, the administrative judge found that the agency failed to engage in a good faith effort to accommodate the appellant. The administrative judge found further that the appellant identified a vacant position, Custodian (Trainee) (Job Opening ID No. 501479), as one of the positions to which he could be reassigned and that the agency failed to address the appellant's qualifications for this position or otherwise rebut his assertions that he was qualified to perform the position of Custodian (Trainee). Thus, based on the appellant's unrebutted testimony that he was qualified for at least one position on the vacancy list, the administrative judge found that the appellant established by preponderant evidence that the agency failed to meet its obligation to reasonably accommodate him by reassigning him to another position. Accordingly, the administrative judge reversed the agency's removal action finding that the agency discriminated against the appellant based on his disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the agency argues that the appellant failed to prove his affirmative defense of disability discrimination. The agency asserts that the appellant failed to meet his burden of proof by identifying a vacant, funded position for which he was qualified, with or without accommodation, that existed at the time he requested accommodation. The agency contends that the appellant did not "request any particular reassignment opportunity" and he did not "articulate" prior to the hearing which of the 75 jobs on the job listing that he believed he was qualified for. The agency argues that, it is only if the appellant satisfies his burden of establishing that he met the minimum requirements for a reassignment job that the burden shifts back to the agency to establish that the requested accommodation would create an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. An agency must provide reasonable accommodation to the known limitations of a qualified individual with a disability unless to do so would create an undue hardship. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a); <span class="Italic">Simpson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 346, &#x00B6; 13 (2010); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9. A qualified individual with a disability is a person with skills, training, and experience to perform the essential functions of a position, with or without reasonable accommodations. <span class="Italic">Simpson</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 346, &#x00B6; 13; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m).

<p class="Block-Quote1">A disability discrimination claim will fail under the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Rehabilitation Act if the employee never requested accommodation while employed. <span class="Italic">Paris v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 17 (2006). Nevertheless, an employee only has a general responsibility to inform his employer that he needs accommodation for a medical condition. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630 App. &#x00A7; 1630.9. Once the employee has requested accommodation for a medical condition, the employer must engage in the interactive process in an effort to determine an appropriate accommodation. <span class="Italic">Paris</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 17; <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(3). As the Board has repeatedly stated, an employing agency is in a better position than a disabled employee to modify duties or working conditions to meet the needs of the employee. <span class="Italic">Paris</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 17; <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 680, 693 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With these principles in mind, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant met his responsibilities. In November 2013, the appellant provided the agency a letter from his physician dated November 19, 2013, which advised the agency of his diagnosed medical condition of spastic gait and of his related medical restrictions. The appellant also discussed reassignment with the Site Security Superintendent. On November 22, 2013, the agency's Site Security Manager emailed the appellant's r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; to the Senior HR Generalist. After receiving his r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;, the appellant and the Senior HR Generalist had several conversations by telephone and email about available jobs in TVA, and the Senior HR Generalist testified that she told the appellant that she would do everything in her power to find him another job. Thus, the record establishes that the appellant fully cooperated in the interactive process envisioned in 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630 App. &#x00A7; 1630.9 by providing the letter from his physician and in his meeting and discussion with the Site Security Manager and the Senior HR Generalist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues, in essence, that it was the appellant's duty to do all the searching for positions and to determine whether he met the requirements for the position descriptions for those positions. The agency also contends that the Senior HR Generalist would have "assisted him if he had identified an open job that he was interested in." The agency asserts that, because the appellant did not identify a specific position prior to the hearing, the agency "was not able to, and therefore did not, present rebuttal evidence, including medical testimony, to establish Appellant's lack of physical ability to perform the essential job duties of a custodian trainee."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts generally have required the parties to engage in the interactive process in good faith. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 15 (2014). Here, the agency appears to have made no effort to identify whether the appellant met the qualifications for any of the positions on the job listing that it provided to him, and it is undisputed that the agency failed to provide him with the position descriptions to accompany any of the positions on those listings. The agency further failed to provide any of the position descriptions during the proceedings below, including the position description for the Custodian (Trainee) position. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency failed to make a good faith effort during the interactive process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, moreover, that the appellant proved by preponderant evidence that the agency discriminated against him based on his disability because he identified a vacant position to which he could be assigned and the agency failed to address his qualifications for this position or otherwise rebut his assertions that he was qualified to perform the Custodian (Trainee) position. We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant identified a vacant funded position and the agency failed to rebut his assertions that he was qualified for that position below. Accordingly, we affirm the initial decision. <span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board explained its position concerning burdens of proof as to reassignment options for disabled employees, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 46, 53-54 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before discussing the ultimate question of whether the agency engaged in prohibited discrimination, we reaffirm our prior holding that an agency has an obligation under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(g) to identify vacant funded positions in the same commuting area, at or below the employee's current grade or level, to which a disabled employee can be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See Jackson,</span> 73 MSPR at 521. We also reaffirm our prior holding that the collective bargaining agreement did not relieve the agency of its obligations under section 1614.203(g)<span class="Italic">. See Jackson,</span> 73 MSPR at 524. However, we clarify that if the agency fails to meet its reassignment obligation before it removes the employee, the agency's failure at that time to look for a position as a reasonable accommodation does not relieve the appellant of her burden of ultimately showing, before the Board, that such positions existed and were available. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gonzagowski v. Widnall</span>, 115 F.3d 744, 748-49 (10th Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Shiring v. Runyon</span>, 90 F.3d 827, 832 (3d Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Runyon</span>, 987 F. Supp. 620, 622 (N.D. Ohio 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated in the Board's prior decision, the appellant identified no vacant funded positions at or below a PS-3 level which she could perform. <span class="Italic">See id,</span> at 521. Nor did the appellant establish that there were any Mail Processor positions graded at level PS-3 or below. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. As in our previous decision, we acknowledge the agency's claim that it could not assign the appellant to any of the positions she suggested because they all were at a PS-4 grade level or higher<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 522 n.9. We conclude here, however, that although the agency may not have fulfilled its obligation to look for a position to which the appellant could be reassigned, the appellant did not meet her ultimate burden of proving that there was a position the agency would have found and could have assigned her to if it had looked.</p>

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 161, 163 &#x00B6; 6 (1998) [discussed earlier under "<a href="0100-2023-19-072.html#sec12-68">Stress Disorder</a>"].</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may be required to adjudicate simultaneously the claims of an employee, who suffered an injury compensable under FECA, that she was not provided appropriate restoration rights and that she was discriminated against through removal when the employer did not find a position for her. <span class="Italic">Leach v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 61 MSPR 8, 20 (1994), remanded an appeal for further factfinding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted in <span class="Italic">Patrick v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 39 MSPR 392, 396 (1988), an agency's obligation to accommodate an employee's handicap is similar in nature and purpose to its obligation to restore her after a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See also</span> FPM ch. 353, subch. 2-4.d(l) (June 21, 1988) (an agency's obligation to restore a partially recovered individual means "[at] a minimum...treating these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973....")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For reasons similar to those set forth above regarding the agency's obligation to attempt restoration under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.304, we find that the administrative judge's fact findings are inadequate to properly resolve the handicap discrimination issue. Specifically, the administrative judge failed to make adequate findings on whether the agency conducted a search for full-time clerical vacancies to which the appellant could be reassigned, and considered her for any such vacancies before removing her. <span class="Italic">See Gumper v. Department of Justice</span>, 55 MSPR 173, 176-77 (1992); <span class="Italic">Clopton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 373, 376-80 (1988). We therefore find that this issue must be remanded for further adjudication.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Regardless of whether an agency conducts an adequate search for a position before removing an appellant, the appellant still bears the burden of proving that there was a position the agency could have found and could have assigned her to had the agency looked for the position. <span class="Italic">Nanette v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 92 MSPR 127, 132 &#x00B6; 16 (2002); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Walley v.

<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant cannot perform the essential functions of any assigned position, he is not a qualified disabled employee. <span class="Italic">Mims v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 8, 11 (1987) (employee who suffered from epileptic seizures and emphysema and whose limitations prevented him from heavy lifting and work in areas of high dust was disabled but not a qualified disabled employee because he could not perform the essential functions of his job or any job available through reassignment with reasonable accommodation). If a reassignment will not resolve the problem caused by the disabling condition, the agency need not use a reassignment that does not accommodate the appellant's disability. <span class="Italic">Cole v. VA</span>, 77 MSPR 434, 447 (1998) (citing <span class="Italic">Vande Zande v. State of Wisconsin Dept. of Admin.</span>, 44 F.3d 538, 543 (7th Cir. 1995), for the proposition that "the employee must show that the accommodation [shift reassignment] is reasonable in terms of both efficacy and proportionality to cost, before the issue of undue handicap is considered"; declining to credit the employee's argument that medical care would be available for her if she switched shifts; at her facility, a VA medical center, emergency medical care was available on-site at any time); <span class="Italic">Widger v. VA</span>, 37 MSPR 368, 372-73 (1988) (stress disorder); <span class="Italic">Morrow v. FAA</span>, 14 MSPR 354, 357 (1983) (reassignment was not shown to control an employee's allergy problem). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 512, 525 (1997) (agency discriminated when it failed to reassign an employee; the agency failed to show that the accommodation articulated by the appellant would be inadequate to allow her to perform), <span class="Italic">rev'd following reopening</span>, <span class="Italic">Jackson v.

<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant can perform essential duties, but he cannot fully perform some collateral responsibilities, the agency may be required to use reassignment as an accommodation. <span class="Italic">Ellis v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 503, 509-510 (1988) (accommodation should have included the reassignment of a maintenance mechanic to maintenance control clerk; typing at 30 words per minute was not considered an essential duty, although light typing appeared to be a requirement; the appellant welcomed training and had performed the duties of the clerk position for more than a year).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's view of how employees' qualifications for other jobs should be assessed by the agency can be restrictive. <span class="Italic">Clopton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 373, 379 (1988), involving the appeal of an employee removed because of her physical inability to perform the job, opined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]n employee is entitled to be considered for reassignment to a vacant position as an accommodation for her handicapping condition only upon a showing that she is able to perform the essential functions of the position in question....&#8197;The appellant claims that she holds both undergraduate and graduate college degrees that allegedly qualify her for work as a "mathematician, physicist, or psychologist."...However, the record reveals that the appellant never held a position during her more than thirty-two years of service with the Federal government that may have required the utilization of any "professional" skills such as those she now professes to have. Nor has she demonstrated her qualifications by establishing her eligibility through the Office of Personnel Management examination process. There is nothing to show that the appellant has the skills or ability to perform in a "professional" position at any grade level. The appellant's request to be reassigned to any of several unidentified positions for which she might qualify based on her professed educational background therefore does not constitute the articulation of a "reasonable" accommodation under [29 CFR 1614.203(c)].</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are limits on the reassignment option. The obligation of the agency is to search for vacancies and take other potentially fruitful steps, but it need not consider reassignment <span class="Italic">ad infinitum</span> or create a position if none exists. <span class="Italic">Malbouf v. Dept. of Army</span>, 43 MSPR 588, 593 (1990). The agency need not bump other employees from their positions to create a vacancy for a disabled appellant. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 91, 96 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">D'Leo v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 53 MSPR 44, 50 (1992) (agency must search vacancies and take other potentially fruitful steps, but it need not consider reassignment <span class="Italic">ad infinitum</span> or create a position where none exists; the agency need not permanently assign an employee to light duty tasks when those tasks do not comprise a complete and separate position); <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 154 (1988) ("Although federal employers may have 'affirmative action' obligations that extend beyond 'mere "evenhanded treatment,"' we know of no basis for requiring agencies to remove other employees from their positions so that handicapped employees may be reassigned to those positions.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency need not assign a TAPER employee to a competitive position as an accommodation for a disabling condition. <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 451, 457 (1989). The agency need not assign an excepted service part-time employee to a competitive service full-time position to accommodate a disabled employee. The appellant was entitled only to a reasonable accommodation, not to a windfall, <span class="Italic">Patrick v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 392, 396-97 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has not previously addressed the issue of an agency's obligation to accommodate a part-time employee's handicapping condition by assignment to a full-time position. We note, however, that the purpose of 29 USC &#x00A7; 794, the statutory basis of the requirement that federal employees' handicaps be reasonably accommodated, is to protect employees against discrimination on the basis of their handicaps, S. Rep. No. 318, 93rd Cong., 1st Sess., <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1973 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 2076, 2143; H.Conf. Rep.

News 7312, 7375, 7403, rather than to provide handicapped employees with greater rights than they otherwise would have.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The requirement that an agency accommodate a handicapped employee is not infinite. While the agency must search its vacancies and take other potentially fruitful steps, it need not consider reassignment "ad infinitum" or "create a position where none exists." <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Department of Education,</span> 31 MSPR 519, 529-30 (Spec. Pan. 1986), <span class="Italic">vacated on other grounds sub nom. Lynch v. Bennett</span>, 665 F. Supp. 62 (D.D.C. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that an agency's obligation to accommodate its employee's handicap instead of removing him, when reasonable accommodation can be made, could be regarded as somewhat similar in nature and purpose to an agency's obligation to restore its former employee after that employee has recovered from a compensable injury. The purpose of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act was to provide "equitable compensation for workers injured in the performance of their duties." <span class="Italic">Raicovich v. United States</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service,</span> 675 F.2d 417, 419 (D.C. Cir. 1982). In light of that purpose, "Congress sought to accord injured workers treatment equal to that which they would have received but for their injury. They are not to be afforded <span class="Italic">greater</span> rights than they would have had employment been continuous....<span class="Italic">" Id.</span> at 424 (emphasis in original). Thus, regulations governing these latter obligations provide no right of assignment to a position with higher pay than the position the employee previously occupied.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Reduction-in-force assignment rights also might be considered somewhat analogous to the accommodation rights at issue here. In reduction-in-force actions, agencies are required under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.402 to place part-time employees in separate competitive levels from full-time employees, and while they may, at their discretion, offer a vacant full-time position to a part-time employee in lieu of separation by reduction in force, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.704(a)(2), they are prohibited from displacing a full-time employee with a part-time employee or from satisfying the part-time employee's right to assignment by assigning the employee to a vacant full-time position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.704(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was entitled only to a reasonable accommodation, and not to a windfall. <span class="Italic">See Clopton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 373, 378-79 (1988) (an agency is not required to accommodate an employee's handicap by assigning her to a position at a higher grade). <span class="Italic">Cf. Wright v. Department of Commerce,</span> 29 MSPR 363, 365-66 (1985) (a make-whole <span id="Page_3506"></span>order is intended to place the appellant in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, not to give the appellant a windfall benefit). Under the law, an agency is required only to make an employee whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,</span> 422 U.S. 405, 418-19, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 2372, 45 L. Ed.2d 280 (1975); <span class="Italic">Phelps</span> <span class="Italic">Dodge Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board,</span> 313 U.S. 177, 194, 61 S. Ct. 845, 852, 85 L. Ed. 1271 (1941). Thus, where an employee's removal was found to be discriminatory because the agency imposed a two-week suspension on a comparison employee involved in the same incident, the Board ordered the removed employee's retroactive reinstatement and the imposition of no more than a two-week suspension. <span class="Italic">Esparza v. Department of the Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force,</span> 32 MSPR 517, 520 (1987). We find that the appellant in these circumstances is not entitled to more, that he has not shown that the agency's position constitutes pretext, and therefore that the agency did not unreasonably refuse to reassign him to the full-time position of Telephone Operator.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gray v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 142, 147-48 (1993), reemphasized the need for an appellant to demonstrate the existence of a vacancy if reassignment is claimed as an accommodation that would make the appellant a qualified disabled employee for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Gray</span> made plain the Board's disinclination to require agencies to establish new positions for employees as an accommodation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination, an employee must show that he is a "handicapped" person within the definition of 29 CFR 1613.702(a), and that the agency's action, a removal in this case, was based on the handicap. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Latham v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 132, 134 (1992). He must also articulate a reasonable accommodation under which he believes he could perform the necessary duties of his position or a vacant position to which he could be assigned, without endangering the health and safety of the himself or others. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. By so doing, he meets the definition of a "qualified handicapped" person. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1613.702(f); <span class="Italic">Morey v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 22, 26 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant here has failed to show that he is a "qualified handicapped" person. He has made no claim that he could perform the duties of his letter carrier position. Moreover, he has failed to identify a vacant position in which he could perform the essential functions, with or without reasonable accommodation. He reasserts in his petition that the clerical duties he accomplished in the agency's communication office proved that he was a "qualified handicapped" person. The administrative judge, however, correctly found that the appellant was not assigned a permanent position in the communications office but rather was performing work that the agency assigned to temporary light-duty employees. The administrative judge made a further finding, which the appellant has not directly challenged, that the agency had presented credible evidence to show that it had no position to which the appellant could be assigned on a permanent basis for which he met the physical requirements. We note that, even if the agency had a duty to accommodate the appellant, its obligation would not require it to create a position where one did not exist. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McQueen v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 53 MSPR 530, 535 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although an agency is required to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of a "qualified handicapped" person, 29 CFR 1613.704(a), it is not required to accommodate the physical or mental impairment of an individual who is not a "qualified handicapped" person, unless required by its own regulations or by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ransom v. Dept. of Army</span>, 49 MSPR 553, 556-57 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tyler v. Runyon</span>, 70 F.3d 458, 467-68 (7th Cir. 1995) (concerning mental disability: "[A]t the time Tyler requested preparation as a window clerk, the Post Office at Rantoul had no opening, thus no need for any replacement window clerks, and it was not training anyone for that position."); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 46 MSPR 506, 509 (1991) (the agency is not required to create a new position to accommodate the appellant's disability).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency does not establish an undue hardship justifying failure to reassign if the only bar to the reassignment is the necessity for the appellant to familiarize herself with duties of the position. <span class="Italic">Warren v. VA</span>, 60 MSPR 97, 100-02 (1993), commented on whether an agency is required to provide a preference to a disabled employee competing for a position with qualified individuals not asserting accommodation claims:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, an agency has a duty to accommodate a qualified handicapped employee, unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would create an undue hardship, such as an undue administrative or financial burden, or would require a substantial modification of job requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gumper v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 55 MSPR 173, 176 (1992). The necessity of incurring some actual costs to accommodate a handicapped employee does not constitute undue economic hardship. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 156, 160 (1988). Reassignment to a vacant position that an employee can perform with or without accommodation may be a reasonable accommodation of the employee's handicap. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 471, 485-87 (Spec. Pan. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's personnel officials found that the appellant was qualified for a vacant Telephone Operator position, apparently based on her work as a taxicab company dispatcher. The agency referred the appellant, along with other qualified applicants who had answered a vacancy announcement for the Telephone Operator position, to the selecting official. The selecting official, however, did not award the position to anyone on the list of qualified applicants, and the position remained open.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not determine whether the agency would have been required to place the appellant in the Telephone Operator position even if another candidate referred to it along with the appellant had proved to be acceptable.[*] Even if it would have had no such obligation, the fact that no one was selected from the list of employees referred to the selecting official, and that the agency continued to attempt to fill the Telephone Operator position, establishes the existence of a vacant position located in the same component part of the agency for which she was qualified. The agency therefore had an obligation to reassign the appellant, a qualified handicapped employee, to the position, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">McQueen</span>, 53 MSPR at 536, unless to do so would be an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;We note that recently published regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission appear to indicate that the employing agency is required to consider nonhandicapped candidates on an equal basis with qualified handicapped employees under circumstances such as those present here. These regulations provide, in part, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">If the agency has already posted a notice or announcement seeking applications for a specific vacant position at the time the agency has determined that [A]nonprobationary employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position even with reasonable accommodation, then the agency does not have an obligation...to offer to reassign the individual to that position, but the agency must consider the individual on an equal basis with those who applied for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">57 Fed. Reg. 12,634, 12,652 (Apr. 10, 1992) (to be codified at 29 CFR 1614.203(g)). The regulations did not become effective until October 1, 1992, however, after the date of the appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 57 Fed. Reg. 12,634, 12,634.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency did not show that placing the appellant in the Telephone Operator position would be an undue hardship. In not selecting the appellant, the selecting official stated, "I do not feel...[the appellant is] qualified for the...position which requires performance of clerical duties, extensive public contact, and immediate and competent response in emergencies and in daily contacts."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the record as a whole, this statement does not prove undue hardship. Agency personnel officials testified that the appellant was qualified for the position, and that nothing in her record showed that she was unable to perform the clerical duties, or to handle the public contact responsibilities and respond to emergencies. The appellant's performance evaluations were always fully successful or above, and her supervisor on light duty called her a highly productive employee who completed all of her assignments in a timely, dedicated, and caring manner. An agency personnel official testified that the appellant was an excellent employee who did a good job wherever she worked.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Apparently, the only accommodation that the appellant needed to perform the duties of the Telephone Operator position was a reasonable interval to master the full range of clerical functions that she was qualified to perform. Allowing such an interval to the appellant, who established herself as a motivated employee, is not an undue economic hardship. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 42 MSPR 10, 13-15 (1989) (additional time required for performance of duties with special equipment would result in decrease in productivity and therefore would impose undue hardship on agency). We therefore find that reassignment to the Telephone Operator position would have constituted a reasonable accommodation of the appellant's handicap, that the agency's failure to reassign her to that position constituted handicap discrimination, and that the appellant's removal cannot be sustained, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency should offer clear evidence of its accommodative and reassignment efforts, i.e., the vacancies the agency considered for the employee, <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 74, 76-79 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that the administrative judge erred in his findings with respect to the appellant's affirmative defense of disability discrimination. Under <span class="Italic">Stalkfleet v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPB 536, 6 MSPR 637, 647-48 (1981), and <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 151-52 (1988), an appellant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination by showing that he is an "individual with a disability" under the applicable statute and regulations; by showing that the agency action he is <span id="Page_3507"></span>appealing was based on his disability; and, to the extent possible, by articulating a "reasonable accommodation" under which he believes he could perform the essential duties of his position or of a vacant position to which he could be reassigned. In <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, the Board noted that the extent to which the appellant is able to articulate a reasonable accommodation will vary according to the circumstances of the case, but that in general, the agency can be expected to know more than the appellant about the availability of positions that could be filled by employees with certain medical restrictions. <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 152 n.2. The Board stated that the appellant "initially has the burden of coming forward with evidence to make at least a facial showing that his handicap can be accommodated." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, quoting <span class="Italic">Treadwell v. Alexander</span>, 707 F.2d 473, 478 (11th Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden of going forward shifts to the agency to show that its action was based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. The agency can meet this burden by showing that the appellant was not a qualified individual with a disability, as defined in the applicable regulations, that the action being appealed was not based on his disability, or that the reasonable accommodation suggested by the appellant would impose undue hardship on the agency's operations. <span class="Italic">See Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 153. If the agency makes such a showing in rebuttal of the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the appellant must be afforded the opportunity to show that the agency's stated reason for failing to accommodate his disability is in fact a pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Stalkfleet</span>, 6 MSPR at 648.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge set forth the correct legal framework for analyzing the burden of proof in disability cases, but he did not make use of it to analyze the evidence presented. Instead, he began and ended his analysis with the agency's efforts at reasonable accommodation, including its search for vacant positions within the appellant's restrictions. The administrative judge's approach is not erroneous, if we assume that he impliedly found that the appellant is a "person with a disability" under the regulations and that the removal action was based on his disability. We find erroneous, however, the administrative judge's analysis of the evidence with respect to the agency's search for a vacant position for the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The applicable regulations require that when an employee becomes unable to perform the essential functions of his position due to a disability--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an agency shall offer to reassign the individual to a funded vacant position located in the same commuting area and serviced by the same appointing authority, and at the same grade or level, the essential functions of which the individual would be able to perform with reasonable accommodation if necessary unless the agency can demonstrate that the reassignment would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program. In the absence of a position at the same grade or level, an offer of reassignment to a vacant position at the highest available grade or level below the employee's current grade or level shall be required....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 CFR 1614.203(g)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence on the sufficiency of the agency's search for vacant positions is thus inconclusive. Neither of the witnesses who testified that all available vacancies were considered had first-hand knowledge, but instead based their testimony on hearsay and what they believed must have been done. The person who carried out the search did not testify. In addition, significant evidence--the list of positions searched that Ms. Johnston said she looked at--was not included in the record. We find that the record is thus insufficiently developed to determine whether the agency failed to reasonably accommodate the appellant by considering him for all vacant positions for which he was qualified. In these circumstances, we find that a remand for the taking of additional evidence is necessary....</p>
