<h3 class="h3" id="sec1-123"><span class="space">H.</span> TEMPORARY AND TERM APPOINTMENTS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The discussion of temporary and term appointments is a component--an unfortunately prolonged and sometimes confusing extension--of the jurisdictional discussion in earlier sections of this chapter of the <span class="Italic">Guide</span> relating to appeal rights: whether service in a variety of appointments create the status and appeal rights of an "employee" under 5 USC 7511 and other statutes; whether terminations permit the exercise of appeal rights as a probationer; or whether terminations or other actions adversely affecting appointees allow no direct access to the Board, other than through another form of action, e.g., USERRA, VEOA, IRA. We again turn to the jurisdictional statute, and refer to discussion earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-048.html#sec1-49">Employees Who May Appeal; Appealable Issues</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-08-072.html#sec1-73">Probation or Trial Period</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-08-094.html#sec1-93">Appeal Rights of Probationer</a>."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Turning to the singularly significant definition of an "employee" for purposes of ascertaining temporary appointees' Board appeal rights, 5 USC 7511 provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Definitions; application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;For the purpose of this subchapter--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;"employee" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;an individual in the competitive service--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;in an Executive agency; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;in the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(C)&#x2003;an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less[.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM regulations, 5 CFR Part 316 (2022), define appointment and tenure of term and temporary employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 316.301 <span class="Italic">Purpose and duration</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An agency may make a term appointment for a period of more than 1 year but not more than 4 years to positions where the need for an employee's services is not permanent. Reasons for making a term appointment include, but are not limited to: project work, extraordinary workload, scheduled abolishment, reorganization, contracting out of the function, uncertainty of future funding, or the need to maintain permanent positions for placement of employees who would otherwise be displaced from other parts of the organization. Agencies may extend appointments made for more than 1 year but less than 4 years up to the 4-year limit in increments determined by the agency. The vacancy announcement should state that the agency has the option of extending a term appointment up to the 4-year limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;OPM may authorize exceptions beyond the 4-year limit when the extension is clearly justified and is consistent with applicable statutory provisions. Requests to make and/or extend appointments beyond the 4-year limit must be initiated by the employing office and sent to the appropriate OPM service center.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)(1)&#x2003;An agency may make a term appointment for a period of more than 1 year but not more than 10 years to a covered position defined in (2) when the need for an employee's services is not permanent. An agency may extend an appointment made for more than 1 year but fewer than 10 years up to the 10-year limit in increments determined by the agency. The vacancy announcement must state that the agency has the option of extending a term appointment under this section up to the 10-year limit. No appointment made under this section may last longer than 10 years from the date of the initial appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;An agency may make a term appointment for more than 1 year but not more than 10 years to the following positions (as described in OPM's Handbook of Occupational Groups and Series):</p>

This certification may constitute appropriate documentation of compliance with the limits set out in paragraph (c) of this section. The reason(s) for making a temporary limited appointment must be stated on the form documenting each such appointment.</p>

The appointment may be extended up to a maximum of 1 additional year (24 months of total service). Appointment to a successor position (<span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> to a position that replaces and absorbs the position to which an individual was originally appointed) is considered to be an extension of the original appointment. Appointment to a position involving the same basic duties and in the same major subdivision of the agency and same local commuting area as the original appointment is also considered to be an extension of the original appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;An agency may not fill a position by temporary appointment if that position has previously been filled by temporary appointment(s) for an aggregate of 2 years, or 24 months, within the preceding 3-year period.</p>

Reappointment must be to the same position or another position appropriate for temporary appointment with the same qualification requirements. If the compensable injury disqualifies the former individual from performing such a position, reappointment may be to any position for which the individual is qualified. Reappointment must be for a minimum of 120 days.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board looks to the totality of the circumstances involving an appointment, alleged by the agency to be temporary, to determine an employee's tenure. The language on the SF-50 is significant but not conclusive, <span class="Italic">Hainey v. Dept. of Labor,</span> DC-315H-11-0088-I-1 (NP 5/9/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge properly set forth how an individual in the competitive service can show that she is an "employee," as defined at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), with appeal rights to the Board. We agree with the administrative judge's findings that the appellant was serving under a trial period at the time of her termination. Admittedly, the appellant's initial SF-50 indicates that she received a career conditional appointment. However, while an executed SF-50 is the customary documentation for a personnel action, it does not constitute the personnel action itself, and does not on its face control an employee's status and rights. <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. Department of</span> Commerce, 729 F.2d 772, 774-76 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of the Air</span> Force, 113 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 8 (2010). Rather, the Board looks at the totality of the circumstances in determining the nature of the appointment. <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the vacancy announcement for the appellant's position stated that she was being hired to a temporary position not to exceed September 30, 2011. The appellant's selection notification letter also specified that <span id="Page_196"></span>the appellant's position was temporary and not to exceed that date. While the appellant's confirmation letter erroneously stated that her appointment was career conditional, the appellant herself recognized that her appointment was temporary. Moreover, the agency corrected the appellant's initial SF-50 to reflect that she was hired to a term position. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the totality of the circumstances indicate that the appellant was appointed to a term, and not a career conditional, position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant served in her program analyst position for less than 10 months. As stated by the administrative judge, the first year of service of a term employee is a trial period regardless of the method of appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gamble v.

Thus, at the time of her termination, the appellant was serving under a trial period, and therefore failed to satisfy the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i). Furthermore, the appellant failed to meet the requirements under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii) because she did not complete 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit declined to credit an estoppel argument as to individuals who asserted they were misled as to the type or duration of appointments they received, <span class="Italic">Anderson v. MSPB</span>, 12 F.3d 1069, 1070-72 (Fed. Cir. 1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The gravamen of petitioners' appeal to the MSPB is that they understood their appointments to be VRA appointments, and that their positions would become protected positions in the competitive service. Thus they were misled into accepting their appointments as temporary employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7513(d) of U.S. Code Title 5 gives the MSPB subject matter jurisdiction over agency decisions to remove an employee. An "employee" is defined as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an individual in the competitive service who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment or who has completed 1 year of current continuous employment <span class="Italic">under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC 7511(a)(1)(A) (emphasis supplied). Petitioners were hired on a one year temporary basis pursuant to the Code of Federal Regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Noncompetitive temporary limited appointments</span>. An agency may give a <span class="Italic">noncompetitive temporary limited appointment</span> without regard to the existence of an appropriate register to an individual in one of the categories set out below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Any veteran who meets the qualifications for a veterans readjustment appointment is eligible for employment under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 316.402 (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners were aware of the temporary character of their appointments. The SF-50 forms with which they were hired plainly stated that the positions they held were temporary. Petitioners also must have known that they were receiving fewer benefits, notably health care, than employees in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners do not deny that they were employed as temporary employees with one year appointments, but contend that the Government's misconduct in appointing them estops the Government from denying that they are protected employees within the competitive service. In essence, petitioners contend that they are employees in the competitive service by judicial construction, and therefore that the MSPB has subject matter jurisdiction over the decision to terminate them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners argue that the MSPB is authorized to examine the Government's determination of employee status. In <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. United States Dept. of Commerce</span>, 729 F.2d 772 (Fed. Cir. 1984), the official record of employment, the SF-50, establishing Grigsby's status was wrong due to a clerical error. This court held that the appointment paper is "not a legally operative document controlling on its face an employee's status and rights." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 776. In that case, the Government was able to show that Grigsby did not have the employment status indicated by the form.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, petitioners use <span class="Italic">Grigsby</span> to argue that the employment status shown on their SF-50 forms does not preclude their equitable estoppel argument. In <span class="Italic">Grigsby</span>, however, the SF-50 did not accurately reflect the Government's intention with regard to employment status. Here, it is conceded, the Government's intention is accurately reflected in the SF-50; it is the propriety of the Government's intention that is at issue, not the correctness of the record of its intention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners present no evidence that the form was incorrect, and that they are not in fact temporary appointees. In making their estoppel argument, petitioners assert just the opposite: that although appointed as temporary employees, their status was based on Government deception. Petitioners in effect argue that, while facially accurate, the SF-50 form is not legally controlling, leaving the MSPB, or this court, free to invent theories of jurisdiction. Even if petitioners' argument from <span class="Italic">Grigsby</span> were accepted, it provides no affirmative support for petitioners' basic contention that MSPB jurisdiction may be derived from Government misconduct in the initial employment decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners quote a plethora of cases to show that the doctrine of equitable estoppel applies to the Government. Although estoppel is often mentioned in dicta, the cases that actually estop the Government are few and far between. Petitioners' best case, <span class="Italic">Watkins v. United States Army</span>, 875 F.2d 699 (9th Cir. 1989), concerned the employment status of a homosexual soldier in the U.S. Army. The court's jurisdiction to hear Watkins's case, however, was not based on his employment status. Nor was Watkins's standing to sue at issue. In short, Watkins had an authoritative forum in which he could argue the doctrine of estoppel. In the present case, in contrast to <span class="Italic">Watkins</span>, it is precisely these threshold requirements of jurisdiction and standing that are contested, and that petitioners seek to satisfy through estoppel arguments. Petitioners place the cart before the horse. Estoppel requires a forum; it cannot be used to build a forum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is important to understand what is at issue here. The question before us is not whether the Government behaved in a way that entitles these petitioners to redress; the question is only whether, if redress is to be sought, Congress has authorized the MSPB to provide it. Petitioners seek MSPB review of an agency action that they concede is unreviewable by the MSPB on a plain reading of the statute. For this court to hold for petitioners would improperly broaden the scope of MSPB authority to include equitable review of agency appointment processes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the district court, petitioners were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction in view of their failure to exhaust their administrative remedies. The district court reasoned that Congress provided a comprehensive scheme of administrative review of agency employment policy under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, and concluded that it was inappropriate for the district court to interfere. This court affirms the MSPB ruling that it has no jurisdiction over the claims of these petitioners.</p>
