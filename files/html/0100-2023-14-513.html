<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-514"><span class="space">1.</span> Search of Offices, Furniture</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although an agency may not be required to negotiate its internal security practices, it can be required to negotiate proposals that are consistent with those security objectives. The agency desired to ensure that all cabinets and desks were locked and advised the union that it would check those items after hours and search and secure them if they were not locked. The union proposed that the agency lock the furniture it found unsecured and search it later in the presence of the employee whose desk or cabinet had been left unlocked. The negotiable proposal did not preclude the agency from achieving its security objectives. <span class="Italic">NTEU and NTEU Chap. 61 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Albany Dist.</span>, 7 FLRA 304, 305-07 (1981). A proposal was negotiable that required an agency to permit an employee and his union representative to be present during a noncriminal search of an employee's possessions at the worksite if the employee is on the worksite when the agency decides to conduct the search. There was no demonstration that the agency's internal security practices would be disrupted through the procedure. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 9 FLRA 983, 987 (1982) (Article 3, Section 14). A similar proposal, requiring searches in the presence of the employee and conducted to avoid embarrassment to the employee, was approved in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1759 and DOD, Dept. of Army, Hq., Ft. McPherson</span>, 29 FLRA 261, 265-66 (1987) (Proposal 3). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-508.html#sec6-509">Lockers, Storage Facilities</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-14-182.html#sec6-183">Search</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-14-173.html#sec6-174">Investigatory Protections</a>," for proposals about lockers and searches.]</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1759</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, another proposal was negotiable that: "Employees have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their personal belongings and in lockers furnished to them by the government. Searches of personal belongings or employee lockers may be permitted only on the basis of reasonable suspicion, based on specific objective facts and reasonable inferences drawn from those facts." FLRA determined, 29 FLRA at 264-65:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency relies on two Authority decisions, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapter 21 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 18 FLRA 405 (1985), and <span class="Italic">NAGE and Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB</span>, 16 FLRA 361 (1984), to support its contention that Proposal 3 is outside the duty to bargain. Its reliance is misplaced. In those cases the proposals held to be nonnegotiable limited searches to instances "authorized by warrant and/or incident or an arrest" and to instances in which the Agency had "sufficient and reasonable grounds to suspect that the employee has stolen an item(s) and is attempting to transport it from the premises." In contrast, Proposal 3 merely requires that any search of an employee locker be based on a "reasonable suspicion." The United States Supreme Court has <span id="page_997"></span>specifically held that in searches conducted pursuant to an investigation of work-related misconduct a public employer may intrude on the constitutionally protected privacy interests of Government employees based upon a standard of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">O'Conner v. Ortega</span>, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 1502 (1987). It is undisputed that the searches of employee lockers contemplated by the Agency are to be conducted pursuant to an investigation of potential work-related misconduct: the theft of its property. Proposal 2 does not prevent the Agency from searching employee lockers to safeguard its property. Rather, in our view, it merely incorporates into the parties' collective bargaining agreement the reasonableness standard established by the Supreme Court for searches of an area given over to a government employee for his exclusive use.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA sustained an arbitration award that applied a negotiated provision requiring that absent an overriding exigency a union representative be present during the search of an employee's desk or workstation, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI El Reno and AFGE Council of Prison Locals Local 171</span>, 59 FLRA 536, 538-39 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we conclude that, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator in this case, Article 6 does not excessively interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices and, as a result, is enforceable as an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). Accordingly, we do not address whether the contract provision also would be enforceable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a contract provision, as interpreted and applied by an arbitrator, excessively interferes with a management right, the Authority weighs the benefits that the provision affords employees against the intrusion on the agency's exercise of its right<span class="Italic">. See BOP</span> <span class="Italic">I</span>, 58 FLRA at 120. As set forth above, Article 6 provides that management searches of employee desks or workstations will be conducted in the presence of a Union representative "absent an overriding exigency." The Arbitrator interpreted Article 6 consistent with its plain wording, finding that the Agency violated Article 6 in the circumstances of this case and requiring the Agency to cease and desist "from conducting searches of employees' desks or workstations unless a Union representative is present, absent an overriding exigency."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the benefits that Article 6 affords employees, the Union claims the article benefits employees by ensuring both the integrity of the search and the authenticity of any findings. We find that the provision does benefit employees and that these benefits are significant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the intrusion on management's right to determine its internal security practices, the Agency claims that, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, Article 6 "means that, absent an extraordinary or emergency situation, the Agency cannot conduct unannounced and unwitnessed searches or employee desks, workstations, or property." Assuming that the phrase "overriding exigency" in Article 6 encompasses the "extraordinary or emergency situation" referenced by the Agency, this claim merely restates the requirements imposed by Article 6. How the phrase "overriding exigency" would be applied, however, is purely speculative. This is because, in this case, the Agency never claimed--either before the Arbitrator or before the Authority--that there was an overriding exigency permitting it to search the grievant's workspace without a Union representative present. Indeed, the Agency claimed throughout the proceeding that it never searched the workspace. As a result, the award does not in any way define the phrase "overriding exigency." Moreover, although the award requires the Agency to comply with Article 6 in the future, it imposes no additional requirements beyond those in the provision itself. It does not, for example, require the Agency either to notify the employee before conducting a search or to permit the employee to be present during the search. Furthermore, as the Union points out, the award concerns only searches of desks and workstations; the award does not concern, or limit, searches of employees themselves.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we find no support for a conclusion that, on its face--apart from how it was interpreted and applied in this case--Article 6 excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine internal security practices. In this regard, the Agency's reliance on the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">BOP</span> <span class="Italic">I and BOP II </span>is misplaced because the awards in those cases interpreted and applied a different contract term in different circumstances. In particular, the awards in <span class="Italic">BOP I </span>and <span class="Italic">BOP II </span>interpreted and applied the contractual term "without good cause" to mean that the agency could not vacate posts absent an emergency<span class="Italic">. See BOP</span> <span class="Italic">I</span>,<span class="Italic"> </span>58 FLRA at 120; <span class="Italic">BOP</span> <span class="Italic">II</span>, 58 FLRA at 303. The Authority found in <span class="Italic">BOP I</span> that the award left "virtually no non-emergency circumstance--whether related to work reasons, security reasons, or both--under which the [a]gency may leave posts vacant." 58 FLRA at 120. In <span class="Italic">BOP</span> <span class="Italic">II</span>, the Authority found that the award "effectively remove[d] the [a]gency's authority to determine the staffing necessary to maintain the security of its facility." 58 FLRA at 303.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, by contrast, there is no indication how the Arbitrator would interpret and apply the requirement for an "overriding exigency," and the Arbitrator's conclusion that there was no overriding exigency in this case was inevitable because the Agency never claimed to the contrary. Also unlike the <span class="Italic">BOP </span>cases, the Arbitrator did not otherwise define the phrase "overriding exigency" as requiring the Agency to have a particular reason or justification for conducting a search. Indeed, as interpreted and applied by this Arbitrator, the Agency may, consistent with Article 6, conduct a search for any reason or for no reason at all, so long as the Union is present when there is no overriding exigency. As there is no claim or evidence that the Union's presence during searches, in and of itself, excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices, we find no basis to reach that conclusion here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency's reliance on the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Fort Jackson, NAGE, and NFFE</span> does not persuade us to reach a different result. In <span class="Italic">AFGE and</span> <span class="Italic">Fort Jackson</span>, the Authority never even considered whether the disputed proposals were negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)<span class="Italic">. See AFGE, </span>42 FLRA at 1301 and<span class="Italic"> Fort Jackson, </span>49 FLRA at 729. And, in <span class="Italic">NAGE </span>and <span class="Italic">NFFE</span>, where the Authority did address that issue, the Authority found the proposals nonnegotiable because one would have required the agency to give the union advance notice of "all" gate inspections, <span class="Italic">see NAGE</span>, 45 FLRA at 960-62, and the other would have permitted the union, "in every instance, to observe spot checks of bargaining unit employees." <span class="Italic">NFFE</span>, 47 FLRA at 883. Consequently, these cases are inapposite.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Article 6, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator in this case, is enforceable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) and, therefore, satisfies prong 1 of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework. As the Agency does not challenge the award on prong 2 grounds, and as the award merely requires the Agency to comply with Article 6 of the parties' agreement, we find that the award is not deficient as contrary to the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Considered a nonnegotiable infringement upon management's rights to determine internal security and assign work was the proposal in <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2830 and DOJ, Office of Justice Programs</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-131.html">60 FLRA 671</a>, 672-73 (2005), that the employer agree not to open or enter any desk, cabinet, or personal work space regularly used by an employee unless through officially authorized management activities. Accepting the union's explanation that the proposal was intended to require authorization of a search by the agency head through the chain of command, FLRA stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Internal Security</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, management's right to determine its internal security practices includes the right to determine the policies and practices which are part of its plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property, and operations against internal and external risks. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2143</span>, 48 FLRA 41, 44 (1993) (Member Talkin concurring as to other matters). Where an agency demonstrates a link or a reasonable connection between its goal of safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations and its practice or decision designed to implement that goal, a proposal that conflicts with the agency's practice or decision conflicts with the agency's right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1920</span>, 47 FLRA 340, 348 (1993). The Authority does not review an agency's determination as to how the agency may best achieve its security objectives. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 349.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Agency has demonstrated a link between its goal of safeguarding its workplace and equipment and its decision to conduct searches when necessary, but especially when something is missing. The Agency argued that when property is missing, the quicker a search is conducted the more likely the chance of finding the property. The Agency also asserted that there are instances when an employee is absent when it is necessary to enter his or her work area to obtain time sensitive material. The Agency's arguments establish a link between its need to safeguard its workplace and equipment and its decision to conduct searches. Accordingly, the Agency's decision to conduct searches constitutes an exercise of its right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute to determine Agency internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal requires the Agency head's approval, either directly or through an issued directive, before management may conduct a search of any desk, cabinet, or personal work space regularly used by an employee. By conditioning the Agency's right to conduct work-related searches on either specific Agency head approval or the issuance of a directive, the proposal affects the right to determine internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1411</span>, 32 FLRA 990, 993-94 (1988) (<span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1411</span>) (proposal requiring management to make an effort to locate and contact a vehicle's driver before towing the vehicle held to affect right to determine internal security practices).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the proposal constitutes a negotiable procedure.&#x2003;Consistent with Authority precedent, which is not contested here, a proposal that affects a management right does not constitute a procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA 844, 847 (2004). Applying this precedent to our finding that the proposal affects the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices, we conclude that the proposal does not constitute a procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. Therefore, the proposal is outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Assign Work</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute encompasses the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom or what position the duties will be assigned. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3529</span>, 56 FLRA 1049, 1050 (2001); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1985</span>, 55 FLRA 1145, 1148 (1999). Proposals which require the assignment of specific duties to identified individuals, including management officials, affect management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1923</span>, 44 FLRA 1405, 1428 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, under the proposal the phrase "officially authorized management activities" means that, in the absence of a standing directive, the Agency head was required to specifically authorize the activity each time a search was made. As the proposal assigns work to the Agency head and requires the Agency head to perform certain specific acts, we find that the proposal affects the Agency's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the alternative, the Union explained that the Agency head could issue a directive delegating the authority to authorize searches or could establish a standing order to authorize searches. Requiring the Agency head to issue a directive also constitutes an assignment of work to the Agency head. Moreover, the right to assign work also includes the right not to assign work. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R12-33</span>, 40 FLRA 479, 486 (1991). Accordingly, requiring the Agency head to issue a directive authorizing the searches also affects the Agency's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, with regard to the Union's claim that the proposal constitutes a procedure, the Authority has held that proposals requiring management to assign particular individuals specific tasks do not constitute procedures within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3529</span>, 56 FLRA at 1051; <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 12</span>, 36 FLRA 70, 73 (1990). The proposal here would require management to assign duties to the Agency head regarding authorizing searches. Consistent with Authority precedent, which is not challenged, we conclude that the proposal does not constitute a procedure within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the proposal is inconsistent with the Agency's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
