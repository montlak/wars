<p class="Body-Text">What OPM giveth, OPM may taketh away. OPM may waive RIF appeal rights for employees covered by personnel demonstration projects authorized by statute, <span class="Italic">Kohfield v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 75 MSPR 1, 3-8 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by statute or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Shaw v. Department of the Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 586, 588 (1989), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds, Joyce v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Air Force</span>, 74 MSPR 112 (1997). The Board's jurisdiction over RIF appeals is not statutory, and instead derives from regulation. <span class="Italic">See Grubb v. Department of the Interior</span>, 73 MSPR 296, 299 (1997). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also Gaxiola v. U.S. Department of the Air Force</span>, 6 MSPB 432, 6 MSPR 515, 519 (1981) (OPM has power to create the right of appeal to the Board by regulation). Section 3502, 5 USC, sets forth the basic RIF principles, and empowers OPM to promulgate regulations to carry them out. Neither it nor any other statutory provision provides for a right of Board appeal for a RIF action. Pursuant to this statutory mandate, OPM promulgated 5 CFR Part 351. It includes 5 CFR 351.901, which provides that an employee who has been furloughed for more than 30 days, separated, or demoted by a RIF may appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 CFR 1201.3(a)(10).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Part 47, 5 USC, however, also provides OPM with authority to approve demonstration projects and to waive regulations to facilitate a demonstration project. The statute defines a "demonstration project" as a project conducted by OPM, or under its supervision, to determine whether a specified change in personnel management policies or procedures would result in improved Federal personnel management. 5 USC &#x00A7; 4701(a)(4). The statute allows OPM, either directly or through agreement with other agencies, to conduct and evaluate demonstration projects. It further provides that the demonstration project is not limited by either any lack of specific authority under Title 5 to take a contemplated action, or any rule or regulation prescribed under Title 5, which is inconsistent with the action contemplated, including any law or regulation relating to, among other personnel actions, the methods of reducing overall agency staff and grade levels. 5 USC &#x00A7; 4703(a)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before conducting or entering into any agreement to conduct a demonstration project, however, the statute requires OPM to develop a plan that identifies enumerated aspects of the project, including a specific citation to any provision of law rule or regulation that, if not waived, would prohibit conducting the project or any of its parts, and to publish that plan in the Federal Register. 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4703(b)(1)(J), 4703(b)(2). The statute also identifies certain provisions of law that may not be waived, none of which pertain to reductions in force. 5 USC &#x00A7; 4703(c). The statute further requires that each demonstration project terminate before the end of the 5-year period beginning on the date on which the project takes effect, except that the project may continue beyond the date to the extent necessary to validate the project's results. 5 USC &#x00A7; 4703(d)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency submitted a proposal to OPM for a demonstration project at its China Lake facility. OPM published the proposed demonstration project in the Federal Register on December 4, 1979. 44 Fed. Reg. 69,876 (1979). Following submission and consideration of comments to this proposal, OPM approved the agency's China Lake demonstration project on April 18, 1980. 45 Fed. Reg. 26,504 (1980). The approved plan contained major modifications to the RIF procedures, and included an agency-run reconsideration request procedure for reviewing challenges to RIF actions. 45 Fed. Reg. 26,511, 26,520-22 (1980). In approving the plan OPM specifically recognized that various provisions of Civil Service law or regulations "must be waived" in order for the project "not to be prohibited." 45 Fed. Reg. 26,532 (1980). Included in the list of provisions requiring waiver were various portions of the RIF regulations, including sections 351.901 through 351.903--governing RIF appeals. 45 Fed. Reg. 26,533 (1980). OPM later approved several amendments and modifications to that original plan, none of which affected its waiving of the RIF appeals regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 52 Fed. Reg. 15,870 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants' assertion that OPM may not waive their statutory right to appeal an adverse action is unavailing. RIF demotions and separations are excluded from the coverage of the adverse action provisions of 5 USC Chapter 75, subch. 11, and, as discussed above, are only appealable to the Board by regulation. <span class="Italic">See Grubb</span>, 73 MSPR at 299; <span class="Italic">Pritchett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 MSPR 35, 39-41 (1996). Thus, OPM has not waived the appellants' adverse action appeal rights, but such rights do not apply in these RIF cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> 45 Fed. Reg. 26,532-33 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we find that appellant Kohfleld's allegation of disability discrimination does not provide a basis for Board jurisdiction under 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4703(c) and 7702. As mentioned above, in providing OPM authority to approve demonstration projects and to waive laws, rules, or regulations, Congress also enumerated various laws that OPM may not waive. It stated that no demonstration project could provide for a waiver of any provision of law, or any rule or regulations prescribed under any provision of law, referred to in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), or any provision of law implementing, or providing any right or remedy to an employee under any provision of law referred to in section 2302(b)(1). 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4703(c)(2)(A), 4703(c)(2)(B)(ii), 4703(c)(4). Section 2302(b)(1), 5 USC, prohibits discrimination against employees or applicants for employment on the bases of race, color, religion, sex or national origin, as prohibited under section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, on the basis of age, as prohibited under sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, on the basis of sex, as prohibited under section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, on the basis of a disabling condition, as prohibited under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or on the basis of marital status or political affiliation, as prohibited under any law, rule or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7702, 5 USC, empowers the Board, "notwithstanding any other provision of law, "to adjudicate allegations of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, and age discrimination, where the employee or applicant for employment has also been affected by an action which the employee or applicant could otherwise appeal to the Board. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1). Thus, if section 7702 is a provision of law that implements and provides a right and a remedy for violations of section 2302(b)(1), OPM would arguably lack authority under section 4703(c) to waive RIF appeal rights in a case involving an allegation of discrimination prohibited by section 2302(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that section 7702 is not part of the body of discrimination law precluded from waiver under section 4703(c). For purposes of construing section 7702, discrimination law includes the body of law centering on section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, and section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and all of the rules, regulations and policy directives promulgated under these statutory provisions, and does not include section 7702 itself. <span class="Italic">See Ignacio v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 471, 476 n.2 (Spec. Pan. 1986), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Konieczko v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 47 MSPR 509 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather than constituting a part of discrimination law, section 7702 is a procedural provision that distinguishes between discrimination laws and civil service laws. It recognizes the respective expertise of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in discrimination law, and the Board in civil service law, ensures that the Board refrain from basing decisions on incorrect interpretations of discrimination law and that the EEOC correctly interprets civil service law, and preserves the employee's right to court review of claims arising under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 139 (1978); S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 56-60 (1978). "Mixed" cases, involving alleged discrimination, although initially decided by the Board, may, at the appellant's option, be reviewed by the EEOC, which is primarily responsible for interpreting discrimination law. <span class="Italic">See King v. Lynch,</span> 21 F.3d 1084, 1088 (Fed. Cir. 1994); Ignacio, 30 MSPR at 481. Section 7702 is, we conclude, not part of the body of discrimination law that OPM is precluded from waiving under section 4703(c); Congressional concern for protecting employees working in the demonstration projects from prohibited personnel practices is addressed by continuing to allow them to raise their discrimination allegations through the EEOC, while exempting them from Title 5 laws, including Board review, which Congress found it important to waive. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 92-94 (1978). Thus, appellant Kohfield's allegation of disability discrimination does not provide a basis for conferring Board jurisdiction over her RIF appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1998, Congress provided the agency with authority to conduct a demonstration project to determine whether specified changes in personnel management policies or procedures would result in improved personnel management. Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute Administrative Systems Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-337, 112 Stat. 3171 (Oct. 31, 1998) (codified at 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3731 note). The statute specifically states that conducting the demonstration project</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">shall not be limited by any lack of specific authority under title 5, United States Code, to take the action contemplated, or by any provision of such title or any rule or regulation prescribed under such title which is inconsistent with the action, including any provision of law, rule, or regulation relating to...the methods of reducing overall staff and grade levels.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at section 4(a)(8). The statute further provides that, before commencing a demonstration project, the agency was to develop a plan with certain identified features and to publish the plan in the Federal Register. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at section 4(b) (1)-(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 8, 2000, the agency published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register. 65 Fed. Reg. 26,728 (May 8, 2000). The notice stated that SIPI employees would no longer be covered by title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations but instead would be covered by title 25, part 38. The proposed regulation, 25 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 38.15, states,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The [SIPI] has an independent personnel system established under Pub. L. [No.] 105-337, the Administrative Systems Act of 1998, 112 Stat. 3171. The details of this system are in the Bureau of Indian Affairs Manual at 62 BIAM, which may be found in Bureau of Indian Affairs Area and Agency offices, Education Line Offices and the Central office in Washington, DC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. On September 27, 2000, the agency published its substantially similar final rule in the Federal Register. 65 Fed. Reg. 58,182 (Sept. 27, 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows, and the appellant does not dispute, that, pursuant to the authority provided by 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3731 note, the agency developed a Personnel Manual which details the procedures to be followed when it conducts a RIF. Specifically, in regard to appeal rights, the Manual states,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee may appeal the procedures used in the conduct of the RIF but not the reasons for the RIF. Appeal procedures will be through a negotiated grievance procedure if one is in existence for employees normally covered by a negotiated agreement or through the grievance and appeal procedures listed in this Manual, but not both."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Personnel Manual, chapter 3.4 (F). The Manual further describes the grievance procedures without any reference to a right to pursue relief before the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., chapter 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3731 note affords the agency discretion to develop its own personnel system without regard to title 5 of the United States Code or the OPM regulations at title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, with certain exceptions not here relevant. We further find that the agency exercised that discretion when it developed and made effective its Personnel Manual. The agency's personnel system does not provide employees separated by RIF with a right to appeal that action to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency's RIF procedures set forth in the Personnel Manual were ineffective because the agency failed to follow the statutory requirement to publish the plan in the Federal Register. Accordingly, he concluded that the right to appeal provided by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.901 remains in effect. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge found, 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3731 note requires the agency to develop a plan with certain specific features, publish the plan in the Federal Register, submit the plan to public hearing, and provide notice to identified parties of the final version of the plan. The agency's May 8, 2000 notice of proposed rulemaking quoted above does not include an actual copy of the plan but merely instructs the reader as to the location of "the details of [its independent personnel system]." Likewise, the final version of the plan is not set forth in the Federal Register notice of the final rule changing the agency's regulations. It may well be that the agency did not comply with the Federal Register publication requirement of section 4(b)(2) of 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3731 note. Nevertheless, 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3731 note does not provide the Board with authority to enforce the procedural requirements of that statute or to nullify actions taken pursuant to that statutory authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v</span>. <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 184 &#x00B6; 8 (2000) (determining whether OPM followed the proper procedures in issuing its regulations--here, regarding the calculation of overtime pay--is not enumerated among the powers and functions of the Board). Nothing in the statute or its legislative history indicates that Congress intended that the Board should have a role in overseeing the agency's exercise of its statutory authority to waive provisions of title 5 and OPM regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 794 F.2d 1013, 1014-15 (5th Cir. 1986) (in exercising its statutory authority to determine the bargainability of a union proposal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1) because the proposal is inconsistent with any Federal law or government-wide rule or regulation, the Federal Labor Relations Authority has no authority to adjudicate the validity of a government-wide regulation promulgated by another federal administrative agency). It is well-settled that the Board's jurisdiction does not extend to any action that is alleged to be improper. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 573, 577, <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 65 F.3d 186 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency exercised its authority to develop a personnel system without regard to title 5 and that its system does not provide for a right to appeal a separation through its RIF procedures to the Board. Thus, the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal and it must be dismissed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Redditt v</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of the Army</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 41 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11 (2001) (OPM specifically waived application of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5335 and 5 C.F.R. part 531, subpart D, pursuant to its authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4703(a)(2) to conduct a demonstration project and the provisions of the project gave the appellant no right to appeal to the Board); <span class="Italic">Kohfield v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 1, 6 (1997) (under 5 U.S.C. part 47, OPM had the authority to waive the portions of the RIF regulations providing for a right to appeal a RIF demotion or separation to the Board, and did so as part of the China Lake demonstration project).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit was not impressed with the Board's failure to address the appellant's complaints of rulemaking infractions and remanded the appeal for reconsideration, <span class="Italic">Parrish v. MSPB</span>, 485 F.3d 1359, 1362-64 (Fed. Cir. 2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the Act, Congress authorized the Institute to conduct demonstration projects to determine whether particular changes in personnel practices and policies would improve personnel management, and provided that such projects may be implemented despite any "inconsistent...provisions of law, rule, or regulation." It is conceded that such a plan may make significant changes in previously existing personnel practices, including the elimination of the Board's jurisdiction over appeals in particular kinds of cases. Here, the Institute substituted an internal agency grievance procedure for the existing appeal to the Board to challenge removals effected through RIFs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress specified in considerable detail the procedures and limitations the Institute must follow and apply in taking such action. One of those conditions is that before implementing such a plan, the Institute must publish it in the Federal Register. It is conceded that the Institute did not so publish its proposed Personnel Manual, which apparently it views as its statutory "plan," in the Federal Register before implementing it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Parrish contends that this failure to publish, and the failure to specify that the plan would eliminate the right to appeal RIFs to the Board, vitiated the Institute's implementation of its plan and therefore that the plan did not supersede the Board's existing jurisdiction to review RIFs. The Institute responds that the statement about the Manual that it published in the Federal Register satisfied its statutory publication obligation. The Board did not resolve this issue, because it ruled that the Institute exercised its "discretion to develop its own personnel system without regard to title 5 of the United States Code or the OPM regulations...when it developed and made effective its Personnel Manual [which] does not provide employees separated by RIF with a right to appeal that action to the Board." <span class="Italic">Parrish</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. at 672.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The right to appeal to the Board is a settled part of the procedures and standards governing RIFs generally. One would expect that, before concluding that an agency had ended Board jurisdiction over a particular category of RIFs, the Board would fully and carefully analyze the agency's action to ensure that the agency had complied with the requirements Congress had imposed as a condition for limiting the Board's jurisdiction. Such an analysis and evaluation would be a necessary and an appropriate part of the Board's determination of its own jurisdiction. It would not be, as the Board apparently viewed it, an unwarranted attempt "to enforce the procedural requirements of that statute [the Act] or to nullify actions taken pursuant to that statutory authority," nor would it give the Board an inappropriate "role in overseeing the agency's exercise of its statutory authority to waive provisions of title 5 and OPM regulations." <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 673. The fact that the Institute "develop[ed] its own personnel system," which did not provide for RIF appeals to the Board and which the Board in turn deemed dispositive of its own jurisdiction, does not address or answer the question whether in taking that action the Institute complied with the requirements Congress imposed as conditions for such action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, in its earlier decision in <span class="Italic">Kohfield v. Department of Navy</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 1 (1997), the Board recognized its obligation to determine whether in connection with a demonstration project OPM "specifically waived the RIF regulations" providing for Board review. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 6. There, a removed <span id="Page_3016"></span>employee argued that OPM, in approving an agency demonstration project under a similar statute, had not properly waived the application of OPM's regulation providing for Board review in RIF proceedings. In rejecting that contention, the Board conducted a detailed analysis of whether OPM had taken the necessary steps and followed the necessary procedures in terminating Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 5-6. The Board has not given any convincing reason why it did not follow the same course in the present case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither of the two cases upon which the Board primarily relied in its opinion support its decision. In <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 184 (2000), which involved a dispute over hours of work, the Board held that it had no jurisdiction to "review...'the Director of Personnel Management's decision to implement'" certain OPM regulations because "determining whether OPM followed the proper procedures in issuing its regulations is not enumerated among the powers and functions of the Board." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 187-88. In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 794 F.2d 1013 (5th Cir. 1986), the Fifth Circuit held that the Federal Labor Relations Authority had no jurisdiction to decide whether a union proposal conflicted with a government-wide OPM regulation and therefore, the dispute was not a matter over which a federal agency was required to bargain collectively because the Labor Relations Authority "has no authority to adjudicate the validity of a government-wide regulation promulgated by another federal administrative agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1014.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although both cases dealt with the jurisdiction of an administrative agency, they involved quite different issues from the question here, which is whether the agency conducting the personnel demonstration project satisfied the conditions Congress imposed for eliminating Board jurisdiction over appeals in a particular category of cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, on remand, the Board should first determine whether the Institute's elimination of Board jurisdiction over its RIF appeals satisfied the statutory requirements for effecting such action, including publication of its plan in the Federal Register and identifying the statutory and regulatory provisions that, if not waived, would have prohibited the proposed personnel-practices changes. If the Board holds that the Institute did not comply with the statutory requirements, it would then face the question whether such non-compliance vitiated the Institute's supersession of the Board's jurisdiction over RIF actions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand, the Board determined that the demonstration project was not properly publicized in the Federal Register and that, as a consequence, the appellant's RIF appeal rights to the Board were not divested, <span class="Italic">Parrish v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 106 MSPR 185, 188-92 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-16, 2007 MSPB 162 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1998, Congress enacted Public Law No. 105-337, authorizing SIPI to conduct a demonstration project "to determine whether specified changes in personnel management policies or procedures would result in improved personnel management." Pub. L. No. 105-337, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3(a)(4), 4(a), 112 Stat. 3171, 3171-72 (1998). This legislation provided that the "conducting of any such demonstration project [would] not be limited by...any provision of law, rule, or regulation relating to...the methods of reducing overall staff and grade levels." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 4(a)(8). It also provided, however, that, "[b]efore commencing a demonstration project under this Act, the president of the institution involved" was to "develop a plan for such project"; that the plan was to identify "a specific citation to any provision of law, rule, or regulation which, if not waived, would prohibit the conducting of the project, or any part of the project as proposed"; and that the president of the institution was to "publish the plan in the Federal Register" and "submit the plan so published to public hearing." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 4(b)(1)(J), (b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency subsequently issued a "Personnel Manual," in which it indicated that it had developed an "alternative personnel system" pursuant to Public Law No. 105-337, that the system included "procedures for the furlough and reduction-in-force of SIPI employees under" that legislation, and that it would "commence with a demonstration project at SIPI to begin on October 22, 2000." Personnel Manual at 16. The manual provides that employees are entitled to appeal RIF actions under a negotiated bargaining procedure or, if no such procedure is applicable, through the grievance and appeal procedures described in the manual. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 18. It does not, however, include any citation of 5 C.F.R. part 351, of the provision in that part that provides employees with the right to appeal RIF actions to the Board, or of any law, rule, or regulation whose waiver would be necessary to conduct the new SIPI personnel system. In fact, nothing in the manual even refers to any Board appeal right or other right or requirement that SIPI might have intended to supersede.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that, although the agency has promulgated regulations providing that SIPI has established "an independent personnel system...under" Public Law No. 105-337, those regulations also do not refer to any Board appeal right that SIPI might have intended to supersede. <span class="Italic">See</span> 25 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 38.15. The regulations indicate only that the new SIPI personnel system addresses certain "areas," including the area of "separation," and that the "details of this system are in the Indian Affairs Manual...at Part 20," a manual that "may be found in" certain agency offices. 25 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 38.15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that the agency did not publish the SIPI personnel manual or any detailed description of its contents in the Federal Register. The agency did publish notices of the regulations mentioned above in the Federal Register, both when it was inviting public comment on them and when it was announcing their issuance in final form. <span class="Italic">See</span> 65 Fed. Reg. 58,181, 58,182 (Sept. 27, 2000); 65 Fed. Reg. 26,727, 26,728 (May 8, 2000). The notice of the proposed regulations included a statement that "a separation from Title 5 requirements was necessary" in order to achieve the goals of SIPI's demonstration project," and a statement that "SIPI employees [would] no longer be covered by Title 5 of the CFR, but [would] be covered by Part 38 of Title 25...." 65 Fed. Reg. 26,727, 26, 728. Neither notice, however, included any specific citation of the provision of 5 C.F.R. part 351 that gives the Board jurisdiction over RIF appeals; neither included any statement that the provision was being waived or superseded; and neither included even a reference to the existence of a provision giving the Board jurisdiction over RIF appeals. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 65 Fed. Reg. 58,181; 65 Fed. Reg. 26,727.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the agency itself acknowledges, in effect, that it did not publish in the Federal Register any document specifically identifying the regulatory RIF appeal provisions it intended to waive or supersede. It argues instead that, by adopting the procedures described in its personnel manual, it "implicitly waived application of the OPM regulations concerning reduction in force at 5 CFR Part 351." As indicated above, however, Public Law No. 105-337 requires any such waiver to be explicit and to include specific citations of any regulations the agency intends to waive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we find that the agency did not satisfy the statutory requirements specified in Public Law No. 105-337 for eliminating Board jurisdiction over RIF appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The plain language of section 4(b) of Public Law No. 105-337 indicates that the development and publication of a plan prior to the commencement of any demonstration project, as well as the inclusion in the published plan of a specific citation of any regulatory provision that must be waived in order to conduct the project, are prerequisites for the effective waiver of such a regulatory provision. <span class="Italic">See Taxera v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 97, &#x00B6; 6 (2003) ("The starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself, which governs absent a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary."). In describing the actions to be taken "[b]efore commencing a demonstration project," Congress used the word "shall," a word indicating that the actions were mandatory, rather than discretionary. Pub. L. No. 105-337, &#x00A7; 4(b); <span class="Italic">see Andersen Consulting v. United States</span>, 959 F.2d 929, 932 (Fed. Cir. 1992). Similar language is used in the House of Representatives committee report on this legislation. That is, the report includes a statement that the demonstration project plan "<span class="Italic">must...</span>describe aspects of the plan for which there is no specific authority and cite existing laws, rules, or regulations that must be waived," and that it "<span class="Italic">must</span> be published in the Federal Register and submitted to a public hearing." H. Rep. No. 105-700, at 6 (1998) (emphasis added). The reference in the statute to regulatory and other provisions that, "if not waived, would prohibit the conducting of...any part of the project as proposed" provides an additional indication that, if the agency failed to comply with the requirements stated in section 4(b), the waiver would not be effective, i.e., the agency would be prohibited from conducting the project as proposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision in a case addressing a similar statutory provision also supports the proposition that the agency's failure to comply with statutory requirements in waiving a regulatory provision precludes a finding that the intended waiver is effective. <span class="Italic">Kohfield v. Department of the Navy</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 1, 3-4 (1997), like the present appeal, raised the issue of whether the regulatory right to appeal RIF actions to the Board had been superseded pursuant to a statutory provision authorizing demonstration projects. Although <span class="Italic">Kohfield</span> involved a statutory provision other than the one at issue here, that provision is essentially the same as Public Law No. 105-337 in all respects material to this case. That is, the provision in <span class="Italic">Kohfield</span> includes an essentially identical requirement for the specific citation of any law, rule, or regulation that is to be waived for purposes of the demonstration project; it includes identical language requiring publication of the project plan in the Federal Register; and the language elsewhere in the section describing the required contents of the plan is very similar to that in Public Law No. 105-337. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4703(b) <span class="Italic">with</span> Public Law No. 105-337, &#x00A7; 4(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found in <span class="Italic">Kohfield</span> that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the agency responsible for waiving the regulatory appeal provision for purposes of the demonstration project at issue there, had effectively done so. <span class="Italic">Kohfield</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. at 6. It indicated in doing so, however, that OPM's failure to comply with the statutory provisions governing waiver would have led to a contrary finding. Specifically, its finding that the waiver was effective was based largely on evidence <span id="Page_3017"></span>that OPM had published a plan for the proposed demonstration project in the register; that it had approved that project after consideration of comments on the proposal; and that it had included the RIF appeal rights provisions at issue there in a list, published in the Federal Register, of provisions requiring waiver for purposes of the demonstration project. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 5. The Board also referred to OPM's "recogni[tion] that various provisions of Civil Service law or regulations 'must be waived' in order for the project 'not to be prohibited.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing Federal Register notice).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that this is not a case in which the agency diligently attempted to comply with applicable statutory provisions, and in which its failure to achieve full compliance was minor in nature and inadvertent. The agency's actions in this case fell far short of complying with section 4(b) of Public Law No. 105-337.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we find that the agency's noncompliance with the statutory provisions addressed above vitiates its attempt to supersede the regulatory section providing employees with a right to appeal their RIF separations to the Board, and that the Board therefore has jurisdiction over the appellant's RIF appeal.
