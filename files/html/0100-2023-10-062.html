<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-62"><span class="space">b.</span> Treatment of EEO and Other Affirmative Defenses; Summary Judgment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In its 2022 decision, <span class="Italic">Thurman v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 21, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-28 (2022), the Board revised preexisting practice, developed through <span class="Italic">Wynn v. USPS</span>, 115 MSPR 146, 2010 MSPB 214 (2010), <span class="Italic">post</span>, by placing the burden on the appellant clearly to assert and develop affirmative defenses in the course of an appeal, on pain of waiving those defenses. Under <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, the AJ had the responsibility of identifying affirmative defenses and, when necessary, attempting to determine, through "show cause," prehearing, or similar orders, whether the appellant intended to develop an affirmative defense when the pleadings were not otherwise clear. <span class="Italic">Thurman</span> established a factor analysis to determine whether an affirmative defense, once advanced by the appellant, was waived or abandoned: (1) the thoroughness and clarity with which the appellant raised an affirmative defense; (2) the degree to which the appellant continued to pursue the affirmative defense in the proceedings below after initially raising it; (3) whether the appellant objected to a summary of the issues to be decided that failed to include the potential affirmative defense when specifically afforded an opportunity to object and the consequences of the failure were made clear; (4) whether the appellant raised the affirmative defense or the administrative judge's processing of the affirmative defense claim in the petition for review; (5) whether the appellant was represented during the course of the appeal before the administrative judge and on petition for review, and if not, the level of knowledge of Board proceedings possessed by the appellant; and (6) the likelihood that the presumptive abandonment of the affirmative defense was the product of confusion, or misleading or incorrect information provided by the agency or the Board. The Board explained its rationale for a more restrictive approach to treatment of affirmative defenses, and applied that analysis to the facts of Mr. Thurman's appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from his position as a PS-4 Laborer Custodial based on a single charge of "improper conduct" following an investigation conducted by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service into two workplace incidents....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a Board appeal in which he asserted, among other things, that the evidence did not show that he engaged in the alleged misconduct. He also indicated on his appeal form that he was raising the <span id="Page_1353"></span>affirmative defense of retaliation for prior protected activity, including his filing of a Board appeal challenging his placement on an emergency suspension for essentially the same conduct that formed the basis of the removal action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After holding the appellant's requested hearing, the administrative judge found that the agency proved the improper conduct charge by preponderant evidence. The administrative judge also found that the agency established a nexus between the misconduct and the efficiency of the service, and that the penalty of removal was reasonable. He affirmed the removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a petition for review in which he argues, among other things,...that the agency violated title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it towed his vehicle but did not tow the vehicles of other employees and that the agency used his filing of grievances and discrimination complaints to show that he made threats, but that his past filings show that he resolved his problems through means other than threats....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues for the first time on review that the agency engaged in "intentional discrimination in violation of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964" by towing his vehicles, but not those of a number of other agency employees. The Board generally will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence. <span class="Italic">Clay</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980). Here, the appellant has not explained why this argument could not have been raised before the administrative judge, and thus we need not consider it. In any event, the claim is unduly vague; the appellant does not identify which type of discrimination this action represented, and he provides no explanation for how this alleged discrimination related to his removal for improper conduct. Thus, the argument provides no basis to grant the appellant's petition for review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's argument that the agency used his history of filing grievances and discrimination complaints to show that he "must have made the threats as alleged," the appellant similarly did not make this argument before the administrative judge, and therefore we need not consider it either. <span class="Italic">See Clay</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Banks</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 271....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">We overrule the holding in Wynn that the Board must always remand a case for consideration of an affirmative defense if an administrative judge has failed to comply with its requirements and now make clear that the Board will consider a number of relevant factors in determining whether an appellant's apparent waiver or abandonment of a previously raised affirmative defense was effective</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to a matter that was not addressed in the appellant's petition for review but that nonetheless requires our attention. As noted above, the appellant indicated on his appeal form that he was raising the affirmative defense of retaliation for prior protected activity, including filing a Board appeal. In an order summarizing the prehearing conference that took place on February 15, 2017, the administrative judge identified the issues presented on appeal and noted that, during the conference, the appellant's representative indicated that the appellant was "raising no affirmative defenses." The order also noted that the issues included in it were "<span class="Italic">to the exclusion of all others</span>" (emphasis in original) and allowed either party to object to the summary, which neither party did. The appellant did not discuss the prior Board appeal or his claim of retaliation for filing that appeal in any subsequent filing or during the hearing, and the administrative judge's initial decision made no reference to the appellant's prior Board appeal or to any potential affirmative defense. Additionally, neither the appellant's petition for review, nor the agency's response, mentioned the prior Board appeal or a claim of retaliation for filing a prior appeal or the administrative judge's handling of the appellant's retaliation claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 10, the Board held that when an appellant raises an affirmative defense, the administrative judge must address the affirmative defense in a close of record order or prehearing conference summary. Additionally, the Board held that if an appellant expressed an intention to withdraw or abandon an affirmative defense, the administrative judge must, at a minimum, identify the affirmative defense, explain that the Board will no longer consider the affirmative defense in deciding the appeal, and provide the appellant with an opportunity to object to the withdrawal of the affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If an administrative judge failed to take the above steps in confirming an appellant's withdrawal or abandonment of a previously raised affirmative defense, and neither the administrative judge's orders nor the agency's submissions provided the appellant with notice of the proper burdens and elements of proof for that affirmative defense, the Board determined that remand would be necessary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not specifically stated in <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, a careful reading of that decision reveals that the appellant did not raise his affirmative defenses or the administrative judge's handling of them in his petition for review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 5. Nevertheless, the Board in <span class="Italic">Wynn</span> remanded the appeal with instructions for the administrative judge to address the appellant's affirmative defenses. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 14. The Board followed the approach set forth in <span class="Italic">Wynn in Hall v. Department of Transportation</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 180 (2013), where again, even though there is no indication that the appellant raised several of his affirmative defenses or the administrative judge's handling of them on petition for review, the Board remanded the appeal for adjudication of all of the appellant's affirmative defenses, even the ones he did not raise on review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 6-7, 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board followed the approach set forth in <span class="Italic">Wynn</span> in <span class="Italic">Hall</span>, the Board has not been entirely consistent in its application of <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, and in a number of nonprecedential decisions issued after <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, the Board identified an administrative judge's failure to provide the notice required by <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, but nonetheless declined to remand the case for continued consideration of the affirmative defense claim. For example, in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Defense</span>, MSPB Docket No. SF-0752-15-0761-I-1, Final Order, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-18 (Dec. 29, 2016), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 705 F. App'x 966 (Fed. Cir. 2017), the Board noted that the administrative judge failed to address the appellant's due process affirmative defense and, citing <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, identified that failure as error. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 15. Nonetheless, the Board determined that remand was not necessary because the matter could be resolved on the undisputed record. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-18. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Richard v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, MSPB Docket No. DE-0752-12-0398-I-1, Final Order at 4-8 (July 14, 2014), the Board noted that the administrative judge failed to specifically inform the appellant that his affirmative defense of reprisal for the use of Family and Medical Leave Act protected leave would be considered waived unless he raised an objection to its exclusion from the prehearing conference summary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 6. Based on the administrative judge's failure to inform Mr. Richard of his ability to object to the summary and of the consequence of failing to object, the Board found that his affirmative defense was not waived. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Nonetheless, the Board found that the record on the affirmative defense at issue in that case was sufficiently well developed to decide the question without a remand. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 6-8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are also a significant number of nonprecedential decisions in which the appellant raised an affirmative defense in the proceedings before the administrative judge, the administrative judge failed to follow the instructions of <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, the appellant either did not raise the affirmative defense or the administrative judge's failure to follow <span class="Italic">Wynn</span> on review, and the Board did not address the matter in the final decision. For example, in <span class="Italic">Day v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, the appellant originally asserted that he was filing claims under both the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) and the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998....Although obedience to the holding in <span class="Italic">Wynn</span> would have required remand for consideration of the appellant's USERRA claim even though the appellant did not raise the claim in his petition for review,...the Board nonetheless issued a Final Order affirming the initial decision without any mention of the USERRA claim or of <span class="Italic">Wynn's</span> remand requirement. <span class="Italic">Day v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, MSPB Docket No. PH-3330-13-0004-I-1, Final Order (Dec. 23, 2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Freeland v. Department of Defense</span>, on the initial appeal form contesting his removal, the appellant checked the box identifying the affirmative defense of discrimination. As in <span class="Italic">Day</span>, the administrative judge did not provide the appellant with notice regarding his burden of proving the affirmative defense, did not address the affirmative defense in any close of record order or prehearing conference summary and order, and did not address it in his initial decision. Additionally, the appellant did not raise the matter in his petition for review. In the Board's Final Order, it did not state that the discrimination affirmative defense was waived and made no mention of the affirmative defense, or of <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>. <span class="Italic">Freeland v. Department of Defense</span>, MSPB Docket No. PH-0752-12-0072-I-1, Final Order (Jan. 22, 2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By obligating the Board on review to address apparently waived affirmative defenses <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, <span class="Italic">Wynn</span> also represented a significant departure from the cases that preceded it and upon which it purported to rely. In <span class="Italic">Erkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 367, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 9 (2008), a case <span class="Italic">Wynn</span> identified as "similar," the Board remanded for adjudication of the appellant's affirmative defenses when the appellant specifically raised the administrative judge's failure to address his retaliation affirmative defense in his petition for review. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Carlisle v. Department of Defense</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 280, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2003), relied on in the <span class="Italic">Erkins</span> decision, the Board remanded the case to the administrative judge for consideration of the appellant's disability discrimination affirmative defense claim, concluding that, although the administrative judge adjudicated the claim, he improperly failed to consider evidence related thereto and failed to apprise the appellant of the applicable burdens for proving it. But, as in <span class="Italic">Erkins</span>, the Board highlighted the fact that the appellant had specifically raised the affirmative defense claim below and preserved the issue by raising it again in his petition for review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 11. The inconsistent manner in which the Board has treated the requirements <span id="Page_1354"></span>set forth in <span class="Italic">Wynn</span> and the departure that <span class="Italic">Wynn</span> represents from prior precedent leads us carefully to consider the wisdom of the inflexible approach articulated in that decision. Moreover, a rule that almost mechanically requires a remand in most situations in which an appellant raises an affirmative defense in his initial appeal and then makes little or no effort to pursue it further could easily result in a remand to address an affirmative defense that the appellant decided he did not want to pursue or wanted to pursue in another forum. Such meaningless process is not an efficient use of the Board's limited adjudicatory resources, costs the parties needless time and expense, and delays closure of the Board appeal. For example, in <span class="Italic">Iskander v. Department of the Navy</span>, MSPB Docket No. DC-0752-11-0090-I-1, Final Order at 5-7 (Dec. 20, 2011), the Board concluded that the administrative judge failed to address the appellant's discrimination affirmative defense and, citing <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, issued an order remanding the case with instructions for the administrative judge to consider the affirmative defense, which was the only matter at issue on remand. On remand, the appellant withdrew her discrimination affirmative defense, stating that she intended to litigate her discrimination claim through the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission process, and the administrative judge issued a second initial decision that did little more than note the appellant's withdrawal and adopt the findings of the first initial decision. Thus, the Board remand served no apparent purpose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After careful consideration, we find that, to the extent <span class="Italic">Wynn</span> held that, when an administrative judge has failed to comply with its requirements, the Board always must raise an affirmative defense waiver or abandonment issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> and remand the case for consideration of the affirmative defense, it is overruled.[6] Instead, in determining whether an administrative judge erred in not addressing an appellant's affirmative defenses such that remand is necessary, the Board will examine a number of factors that are instructive as to the ultimate question of whether an appellant demonstrated his intent to continue pursuing his affirmative defense, and whether he conveyed that intent after filing the initial appeal.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Cases that followed the approach set forth in <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, such as <span class="Italic">Hall</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 180, are also overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Nothing in our decision alters the requirement set forth in <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 10, that administrative judges must, at a minimum, identify all affirmative defenses raised in an appeal in any close of record order or prehearing conference summary and order, explain that the Board will no longer consider an affirmative defense if an appellant expresses the intention to withdraw it, and give the appellant an opportunity to object to withdrawal of the affirmative defense. We are also mindful of Board and U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit precedent noting that an appellant must be provided with notice of his burden in establishing Board jurisdiction over his claim, and nothing in our decision here alters that obligation. <span class="Italic">See Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Niemi v. Department of the Interior</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 143, &#x00B6; 8 (2010). Consistent with <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> and its progeny, if the Board determines that an administrative judge's abandonment or waiver determination was erroneous, and neither the initial decision nor the agency's filings placed the appellant on notice of his burdens, a remand still will be necessary to provide the appellant with adequate notice of his burdens. <span class="Italic">See Parker v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 329, &#x00B6; 8 (2007) (stating that an administrative judge's failure to provide proper <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> notice can be cured if the agency's pleadings or the initial decision contain the required notice).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The factors articulated below are not exhaustive, and none of the individual factors identified will be dispositive in determining whether a particular appellant will be deemed to have waived or abandoned a previously identified affirmative defense. Instead, the applicability and weight of each factor should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Among the relevant factors are: (1) the thoroughness and clarity with which the appellant raised an affirmative defense; (2) the degree to which the appellant continued to pursue the affirmative defense in the proceedings below after initially raising it; (3) whether the appellant objected to a summary of the issues to be decided that failed to include the potential affirmative defense when specifically afforded an opportunity to object and the consequences of the failure were made clear; (4) whether the appellant raised the affirmative defense or the administrative judge's processing of the affirmative defense claim in the petition for review; (5) whether the appellant was represented during the course of the appeal before the administrative judge and on petition for review, and if not, the level of knowledge of Board proceedings possessed by the appellant; and (6) the likelihood that the presumptive abandonment of the affirmative defense was the product of confusion, or misleading or incorrect information provided by the agency or the Board. We now apply the factors set forth above to the facts of the instant case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">(1)&#x2003;The thoroughness and clarity with which the appellant raised his affirmative defense</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On his appeal form, the appellant raised "an affirmative defense of retaliation for [ ] prior protected activity," including, "filing of a Board appeal concerning his emergency placement suspension." This is the only information the appellant provided related to his purported affirmative defense of retaliation for filing a prior Board appeal. The appellant described the nature of his prior Board appeal as a challenge to his "emergency placement on suspension," but he did not provide any additional information about the prior appeal or offer any explanation of how the agency's later removal decision was taken in retaliation for his filing of that appeal. The only additional information in the record concerning the prior appeal was provided by the agency in its response to the instant appeal, in which it confirmed that the prior appeal was filed and was later resolved by settlement agreement. The appellant did not challenge this characterization in any subsequent filing or at the hearing, or offer to expand upon it. Such sparse information regarding the potential affirmative defense amounts to little more than a <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegation of wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">E.g., Pinegar v. Federal Election Commission</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 31-32 (2007) (finding insufficient a bare allegation of gender discrimination unsupported by any factual assertions); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 322, 328 (1997) (determining that the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> sex and race discrimination claims on petition for review were inadequate to show that the administrative judge erred in finding those claims unproven); <span class="Italic">cf. Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 466, &#x00B6; 7 (2016) (setting forth examples of cases in which the Board distinguished between nonfrivolous and <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegations and finding that mere conclusory pleadings are insufficient), <span class="Italic">aff'd per curiam</span>, 679 F. App'x 1006 (Fed. Cir. 2017). The fact that the appellant failed to provide a thorough and clear explanation of his affirmative defense also supports a finding that he abandoned his claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">(2)&#x2003;The degree to which the appellant continued to pursue his affirmative defense in the proceedings below after initially raising it</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As previously discussed, on his appeal form the appellant stated that he was raising "an affirmative defense of retaliation for [ ] prior protected activity," including "filing of a Board appeal concerning [the appellant's] emergency placement suspension." Following his initial filing, the appellant did not reference this purported affirmative defense at any point thereafter. The appellant's silence on this point spanned his additional filings below and the entirety of the hearing. The failure to mention the affirmative defense after the initial appeal suggests that the appellant no longer wished to pursue the claim. This factor supports a finding that the appellant abandoned his affirmative defense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">(3)&#x2003;Whether the appellant objected to a summary of the issues to be decided that failed to include the potential affirmative defense when he was specifically afforded an opportunity to object and the consequences of his failure were made clear</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, following a February 15, 2017 prehearing conference, the administrative judge issued an order that identified witnesses, approved exhibits, and summarized all of the issues to be decided in the appellant's case. The summary stated that, during the conference, the appellant's representative "indicated that he was raising no affirmative defenses." The order allowed the parties to object to the content of the summary within 7 days and stated that a failure to object to an issue would preclude later challenge of that issue, including on petition for review. Neither party objected to the content of the order, nor have they challenged its accuracy since its issuance. Thus, despite being afforded the opportunity to do so, the appellant did not object to the administrative judge's prehearing conference summary stating that he was not raising an affirmative defense and that his failure to object to the content of the summary would preclude raising the issue at a later date. Accordingly, this factor supports a finding that the appellant abandoned his affirmative defense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">(4)&#x2003;Whether the appellant raised either his affirmative defense or the administrative judge's processing of the affirmative defense claim in his petition for review</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations provide that "[t]he Board normally will consider only issues raised in a timely filed petition for review or cross petition for review." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115. This adjudicatory approach is consistent with the concept that the Board's administrative judges are in the best position to, among other things, develop the record and simplify the issues and that the Board's role is to address contentions of error. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.41(b), 1201.115. The Board has consistently followed an approach of declining to address matters that were not raised on petition for review on matters other than affirmative defenses. In <span class="Italic">Scoggins v. Department of the Army</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 592, &#x00B6; 6 n.4 (2016), for example, the Board found that, because the appellant did not contest the administrative judge's finding that one of his disclosures was not protected and because neither party challenged the administrative judge's findings regarding which contested actions constituted personnel actions covered by the <span id="Page_1355"></span>whistleblower protection statutes, the Board would not consider the issues. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Ferrin-Rodgers v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 140, &#x00B6; 4 n.3 (2010), the Board declined to address the administrative judge's findings of a lack of jurisdiction over several of the appellant's claims because the petition for review did not challenge the findings. Finally, in <span class="Italic">Cross v. Department of the Army,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 62, &#x00B6; 7 n.8 (2001), the Board did not address whether the administrative judge properly found that the agency failed to prove a specification because the agency did not allege error regarding the specification on review. Board precedent since its creation is replete with similar examples.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Similarly, several U.S. Courts of Appeals generally deem issues not raised on appeal to be abandoned. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Butts v. Martin</span>, 877 F.3d 571, 584 n.6 (5th Cir. 2017) (noting the general rule that issues and arguments not briefed on appeal are abandoned); <span class="Italic">Waldman v. Conway</span>, 871 F.3d 1283, 1289 (11th Cir. 2017) ("Issues not briefed on appeal...are deemed abandoned."); <span class="Italic">New Jersey v. Merrill Lynch &#x0026; Co</span>., 640 F.3d 545, 547 n.3 (3d Cir. 2011) (holding that a failure to set forth an issue on appeal and present arguments in support of that issue in an opening brief generally amounts to abandonment and waiver of that issue); <span class="Italic">Advanced Magnetic Closures, Inc. v. Rome Fastener Corp</span>., 607 F.3d 817, 833 (Fed. Cir. 2010) ("This court has consistently held that a party waives an argument not raised in its opening brief."); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Marsh</span>, 194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir. 1999) (finding that arguments not raised by a party in its opening brief on appeal are deemed waived); <span class="Italic">United States v. Quiroz</span>, 22 F.3d 489, 490 (2d Cir. 1994) (noting the well-established principle that an argument not raised on appeal is deemed abandoned); <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Ford Motor Co</span>., 948 F.2d 283, 284 (6th Cir. 1991) (finding that issues raised in the district court but not raised on appeal are considered abandoned on appeal and not reviewable). The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission likewise held that an appellant abandoned certain discrimination claims when she made "no mention of either of these bases in her statements in support of [her] appeal" of a final agency decision. <span class="Italic">Hipp v. Department of the Air Force</span>, EEOC Document No. 01862916, 1987 WL 769084 (Jan. 13, 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Seemingly, only in the realm of affirmative defenses has the Board strayed from the general practice of only addressing allegations of error raised on petition for review, and, while the affirmative defenses addressed in <span class="Italic">Wynn</span> are important, we can discern no principled basis for the decision to treat these types of claims differently than other types of claims within the Board's jurisdiction. In the instant case, then, the appellant's failure to address his affirmative defense of retaliation for filing a prior Board appeal or the administrative judge's handling of the affirmative defense claim in his petition for review supports a finding that the appellant intended to abandon the claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">(5)&#x2003;Whether the appellant was represented during the course of his appeal before the administrative judge and on petition for review and, if he was not, the level of knowledge of Board proceedings possessed by the appellant</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In some circumstances, the Board will take an appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status into consideration and be more lenient in the application of Board rules and procedures. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ramos v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 65, &#x00B6; 7 (1999) (taking into consideration an appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, among other factors, in determining that he did not intend to withdraw his appeal); <span class="Italic">Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995) (noting that the Board will consider, among other things, the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status in determining whether good cause exists to waive the time limit for filing a petition for review), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). Here, the appellant was represented by a union representative at all stages of the proceeding, from the time the initial appeal was filed through the hearing and on petition for review before the Board. Thus, the practice of leniency toward <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigants in certain instances is not applicable here. Accordingly, this factor supports a finding that the appellant intended to abandon his affirmative defense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">(6)&#x2003;The likelihood that the presumptive abandonment of the affirmative defense was the product of confusion, or misleading or incorrect information provided by the agency or the Board</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that it will not give effect to the withdrawal of an appeal that was based on misleading or incorrect information provided by the agency or the Board. <span class="Italic">Rose v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 611, &#x00B6; 7 (2007); <span class="Italic">see Potter v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 15 (2011). Similarly, the Board has, on occasion, granted leniency to appellants in circumstances in which they obviously were confused or mistaken about the Board's instructions. <span class="Italic">See Luna v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 578, &#x00B6; 9 (2000) (finding good cause for the appellant's untimely petition for appeal based, in part, on his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status and his obvious confusion), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 15 F. App'x 876 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Caldwell v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 674, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2000) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If there is reason to believe that an appellant's withdrawal or apparent abandonment of a previously raised affirmative defense was the result of confusion, or misleading or incorrect information provided to the appellant or his representative by the agency or the Board, that would weigh in favor of a finding that the appellant did not intend to withdraw or abandon his claim. This may be especially true if the appellant is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and if there is evidence in the record clearly demonstrating that he either does not understand the nature of the affirmative defense or does not understand the consequences of its withdrawal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, there is no evidence that the appellant's representative was confused or was misled by the agency or the administrative judge concerning the affirmative defense of retaliation for the appellant's prior Board appeal. As previously noted, the appellant's only reference to the claim was in his initial appeal. Moreover, the only additional information provided by the agency concerning the affirmative defense was factual in nature, and the agency did not provide inaccurate or misleading information about the appellant's burden in proving the affirmative defense. For the above reasons, this factor, which considers whether the waiver or abandonment was the product of confusion, mistake, or misleading information provided by the agency or administrative judge, also favors a finding that the appellant intended to abandon his affirmative defense in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, applying the nonexhaustive list of factors set forth in this decision for determining whether an appellant abandoned his affirmative defense, we find that the appellant in this case abandoned his affirmative defense and that there is no basis for the Board to address the affirmative defense waiver issue on review. Accordingly, we conclude that there is no basis to remand the appeal for additional proceedings regarding the appellant's affirmative defense.</p>

USPS</span>, AT-0752-20-0275-I-3 (NP 4/19/2023) ("Sparse information regarding a potential affirmative defense, like the appellant provided in his second refiled appeal, amounts to little more than a <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegation of wrongdoing, which supports a finding of abandonment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thurman</span>, 2022 MSPB 21, &#x00B6; 19.").</p>

The present case, however, is similar to <span class="Italic">Erkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 367, &#x00B6; 7 (2008), in that the record below does not establish that the appellant withdrew or abandoned his affirmative defenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now make clear that when an appellant raises an affirmative defense in an appeal either by checking the appropriate box in an appeal form, identifying an affirmative defense by name such as "race discrimination," "harmful procedural error," etc., or by alleging facts that reasonably raise such an affirmative defense, the administrative judge must address the affirmative defense(s) in any close of record order or prehearing conference summary and order. If an appellant expresses the intention to withdraw such an affirmative defense, in the close of record order or prehearing conference order the administrative judge must, at a minimum, identify the affirmative defense, explain that the Board will no longer consider it when deciding the appeal, and give an appellant an opportunity to object to withdrawal of the affirmative defense. The record in this appeal simply does not establish that the appellant abandoned or withdrew the affirmative defenses he had raised in his appeal. As explained below, in the absence of evidence establishing the appellant had withdrawn or abandoned his affirmative defenses, it was incumbent on the administrative judge to advise the appellant of applicable burdens of proving a particular affirmative defense, as well as the kind of evidence the appellant is required to produce to meet his burden.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following up on <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. USPS</span>, AT-0353-11-0879-I-2 (NP 4/3/2014), declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Under the facts of this case, where the appellant raised allegations of disability discrimination in his initial appeal, and again asserted those claims in his prehearing submission, we find that the administrative judge should have addressed the appellant's disability discrimination claims in both his prehearing conference summary and order and his <span id="Page_1356"></span>initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Wynn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 13 (2010). In <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, the Board held that an administrative judge must apprise an appellant of the applicable burdens of proving a particular affirmative defense, as well as the kind of evidence required to meet those burdens. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, when an appellant raises affirmative defenses, the administrative judge must address those defenses in any close of record order or prehearing conference summary and order. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10. Additionally, if an administrative judge disposes of an affirmative defense in a close of record conference, he must identify the affirmative defense, explain that the Board will no longer consider it when deciding the appeal, and give the appellant an opportunity to object to the withdrawal of the affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, we find that remand of the appeal to the administrative judge for an assessment of the appellant's disability discrimination claims, insofar as they bear on the Board's jurisdiction over the restoration appeal, is necessary. <span class="Italic">See Hall v.

Unlike the appellant's sex discrimination claim, which he withdrew at the hearing, there is no evidence in the record that the appellant withdrew or abandoned his disability discrimination allegations. The Board, moreover, has held that the withdrawal of such claims cannot be presumed or implied without giving notice to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Hall</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 180, &#x00B6; 6. Because the administrative judge did not address the appellant's assertions of disability discrimination in both his prehearing conference summary and his initial decision, we must remand this case for further adjudication. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. On remand, the administrative judge shall inform the appellant of his burdens of proof regarding his disability discrimination claims, including his denial of reasonable accommodation allegations, and he shall afford the parties an opportunity to submit argument and evidence on these issues. The administrative judge should then issue a new initial decision that addresses the appellant's disability discrimination claims and their effect, if any, on the Board's jurisdiction over the appellant's restoration appeal. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> &#x00B6; 7....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Relying on <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, <span class="Italic">Richard v. USPS</span>, DE-0752-12-0398-I-1 (NP 7/14/2014), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Generally, the Board has held that an appellant is deemed to have abandoned an affirmative defense if it is not included in the list of issues in a prehearing conference summary and the party was afforded an opportunity to object to the conference summary. <span class="Italic">See Henson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 10 (2009). However, the Board has also found that, when an appellant raises an affirmative defense in an appeal by either checking the appropriate box in an appeal form, identifying an affirmative defense by name, or by alleging facts that reasonably raise such an affirmative defense, the administrative judge must address the affirmative defense in any close of record order or prehearing conference summary and order. <span class="Italic">Wynn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). Here, the administrative judge did not address the defense in her prehearing summary, did not advise the appellant that other issues not included in the summary would be considered waived unless he raised an objection, and did not advise the appellant of his ability to object to the content of the prehearing summary. Because the administrative judge did not inform the appellant of his right to object to the summary, we find the appellant did not waive his affirmative defense of retaliation for FMLA activity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wynn</span> was extended to other types of affirmative defenses, <span class="Italic">Pretlow v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> DA-0752-10-0516-I-1 (NP 4/20/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant may have been reasserting his allegation from below that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) with respect to the disclosures he made to the agency Inspector General (IG) and the Office of Special Counsel (OSC). Section 2302(b)(9)(C) prohibits any personnel action against any employee because he has cooperated with or disclosed information to an agency IG or the OSC. The appellant generally alleged to OSC, and before the administrative judge, that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) regarding his disclosures to the IG, and later, his disclosures to OSC. Although the administrative judge addressed retaliation pursuant to the appellant's equal employment opportunity activity, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A), his discussion of the appellant's disclosures to the IG and OSC was limited to potential violations of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's affirmative defense pursuant to section 2302(b)(9)(C) appears to have dropped from the case during the telephonic prehearing conference. In the conference summary, the administrative judge listed the issues in dispute, which included reprisal for protected whistleblowing activity, and stated that other issues were precluded. The administrative judge also set forth the burdens and elements of proof for each of the listed affirmative defenses. The administrative judge limited the discussion regarding the whistleblower retaliation to the burdens and elements of proof under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). He did not address the burdens and elements for that claim pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Wynn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-13 (2010), the administrative judge's failure to apprise the appellant of the burdens and elements of proof for 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) is reversible error. If the appellant, as he did here, raises an affirmative defense by checking the appropriate box on the appeal form, or by alleging facts that reasonably raise an affirmative defense, the administrative judge must address the affirmative defense in any close of record order or prehearing conference summary order. <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 10. If an appellant expresses the intention to withdraw such an affirmative defense, in the close of record order or prehearing conference order the administrative judge must, at a minimum, identify the affirmative defense, explain that the Board will no longer consider it when deciding the appeal, and give an appellant an opportunity to object to withdrawal of the affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 10. The prehearing conference order here does not establish that the appellant abandoned or withdrew his affirmative defense under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C), and the order likewise did not apprise him of the burdens and elements of proof with regard to that claim. We thus REMAND the appeal for further adjudication of this remaining affirmative defense.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">From 2006 through 2015, the Board decided that agencies may attempt to obtain summary disposition of EEO claims. <span class="Italic">Redd v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/REDD_FREDERICK_B_PH_0752_05_0162_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249848.pdf">101 MSPR 182</a>, 2006 MSPB 32 (2006), represented a revision in Board thinking that resulted in the availability of the same summary judgment procedures used to challenge EEO claims in the EEOC and in district courts. Although the authority to adjudicate summary judgment motions as to EEO defenses existed, many AJs preferred to take the motion under advisement and ruled on the EEO claim after a hearing on the underlying merits of the action on appeal. In an MSPB appeal, unlike a case before the EEOC (assuming the jurisdiction of the Board over an appeal and over an appellant), there will be a hearing if a hearing is requested. If the EEO claim or defense is defeated, the hearing proceeds on other matters. AJs generally decided that it was a more efficient use of their time to rule on all issues at one time, that is, after the conclusion of the hearing, instead of ruling once on summary judgment and then ruling as to other issues following a hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Redd</span> was summarily overruled in <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SAVAGE_TOMMIE_G_AT_0752_11_0634_I_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1217635.pdf">122 MSPR 612</a>, 2015 MSPB 51 (2015), eliminating summary judgment as a fast track disposition of EEO affirmative defenses. The reasoning in <span class="Italic">Savage</span> appeared to be that EEO claims in Board cases are decided as part of the Board's appellate authority under the Civil Service Reform Act. That statute (as informed by its legislative history) states that summary judgment is not to be used. The right to a hearing negates summary disposition of matters within the Board's appellate jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Redd</span> took a different tack: its logic was that EEO cases are decided under law as defined by courts, and courts routinely apply summary judgment in cases brought by federal (or other) employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the 2006 <span class="Italic">Redd</span> decision, starting in 1998, the Board prohibited its AJs from striking frivolous EEO affirmative defenses and required hearings on all EEO claims in cases within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Currier v.

<p class="Body-Text">Without regard to <span class="Italic">Redd</span>, <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, and summary judgment or its demise, the AJ may determine in her initial decision that an EEO claim was abandoned by the appellant's failure to identify it as an issue in prehearing submissions, <span class="Italic">Rivas v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 121, 128-29 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we find that the appellant is not entitled to review of his claims of discrimination based on handicap and national origin because the record shows that he effectively abandoned those claims. As the administrative judge found, the appellant did not identify those claims in his prehearing submission, nor were the claims discussed at the prehearing conference. Moreover, the administrative judge's prehearing conference summary advised the parties that any changes in the summary must be presented "in writing" immediately prior to the hearing. Not only did the appellant not present any written changes, but the discrimination claims were not mentioned at the hearing. Thus, they are not before the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tackett v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant must raise a discrimination claim when she has sufficient knowledge of facts and circumstances to form a reasonable suspicion that prohibited discrimination has occurred. <span class="Italic">Weslowski,</span> 80 MSPR at 591. An appellant's responsibility to raise the issue of discrimination is triggered when she possesses sufficient facts that she should have reasonably suspected discrimination, i.e., information that could reveal a discriminatory motive on the part of the agency, but before all of the facts that would have supported a charge of discrimination have become apparent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has established a factual dispute as to whether she timely raised her allegation of age discrimination. She stated that she had learned information that could reveal a discriminatory motive on the part of the agency just the day before the hearing when she learned that age was a factor in an employee's scanning rate. Further, in the proceedings below, she raised the issue almost immediately, at the hearing. The administrative judge, however, failed to allow the appellant to proceed at the hearing to establish whether she had in fact timely raised her allegation of age discrimination. This was error. <span class="Italic">See generally Hamilton v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 MSPR 354, 357 (1998) (if an appellant can establish a factual dispute as to whether he timely filed his appeal, and he requests a hearing, he is entitled to a timeliness hearing). It was also error to fail to describe and include in the record evidence relevant to the timeliness issue. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.61. On this state of the record, we simply have no basis to know exactly what evidence was excluded. Accordingly, we remand the appeal to allow the appellant a hearing on the issue of whether she timely raised the allegation of discrimination on the basis of age.</p>
