<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-117"><span class="space">A.</span> USE OF MOTIONS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">A motion is a request to a presiding official to take a particular action. 5 CFR 1201.4(c) (2022). It is a request for a AJ to do something: continue a hearing, order an agency to produce witnesses, compel a response to discovery requests, send the author a birthday card. A motion is any request that requires a ruling concerning the procedural or substantive aspects of adjudication. It is a formal communication to the AJ requesting action on an appeal, with notice to opposing counsel, and with the opportunity for opposing counsel to file a response. The motion is filed by either party, or it may be jointly filed as, for example, in a joint motion for a continuance. An oral motion may be made during the hearing; some AJs will accept oral motions during a prehearing or status conference; some AJs may require that the oral motion made during a conference be memorialized in writing; written motions may be submitted at any time, and they may be included as part of a response to an appeal or as part of prehearing submission. Some AJs wait until the prehearing conference to decide motions--not a great idea if the motions involve discovery; some AJs decide motions quickly after a response to the motion is received or after the time for filing a response expires. An AJ may decide to convene a conference call after a motion is received, ask for the oral response to the motion, then decide.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 1201.41(b) (2022), the AJ is required to conduct a fair and impartial hearing and take all action necessary to avoid delay in the disposition of the proceedings. To that end, the AJ has the authority to rule on all motions raised by either party. 5 CFR 1201.41(b)(8) (2022). AJs have substantial discretion as to motions. <span class="Italic">Reynolds v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 17 MSPR 564, 566 (1983). Rulings on motions, or procedural orders, that have not been reviewed and upheld by the Board lack precedential value. <span class="Italic">SSA v. Abell</span>, 47 MSPR 98, 101 (1991). A ruling on a motion could lead to an interlocutory appeal on a point of dispositive significance. Along with discovery practice, motion practice significantly contributes to quality adjudication.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's regulation on motions is 5 CFR 1201.55 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Form</span>. All motions, except those made during a prehearing conference or a hearing, must be in writing. All motions must include a statement of the reasons supporting them. Written motions must be filed with the judge or the Board, as appropriate, and must be served upon all other parties in accordance with &#x00A7; 1201.26(b)(2) of this part. A party filing a motion for extension of time, a motion for postponement of a hearing, or any other procedural motion must first contact the other party to determine whether there is any objection to the motion, and must state in the motion whether the other party has an objection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Objection</span>. Unless the judge provides otherwise, any objection to a written motion must be filed within 10 days from the date of service of the motion. Judges, in their discretion, may grant or deny motions for extensions of time to file pleadings without providing any opportunity to respond to the motions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Motions for extension of time</span>. Motions for extension of time will be granted only on a showing of good cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Motions for protective orders</span>. A motion for an order under 5 U.S.C. 1204(e)(1)(B) to protect a witness or other individual from harassment must be filed as early in the proceeding as practicable. The party seeking a protective order must include a concise statement of reasons justifying the motion, together with any relevant documentary evidence. An agency, other than the Office of Special Counsel, may not request such an order with respect to an investigation by the Special Counsel during the Special Counsel's investigation. An order issued under this paragraph may be enforced in the same manner as provided under subpart F for Board final decisions and orders.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board provides additional guidance on motions practice in the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> at Chapter 5:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">FORM OF MOTIONS</span>. Motions must be in writing, unless they are made in a prehearing or status conference or at a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">RULING ON MOTIONS</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time Limits for Rulings</span>. Although the Board's regulations contain no time limits for ruling on motions, an AJ should dispose of motions as quickly as possible. Accordingly, an AJ should take only a minimum number of motions under advisement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Due Process Considerations</span>. The AJ should not rule on substantive, controversial or complex motions without allowing the opposing party an opportunity to object. The AJ may initiate a conference call with the parties both to discuss the motion and to make an oral ruling. A conference call is especially appropriate when more facts are needed or the matter is time-sensitive. Frequently, the issue may be resolved without a ruling. If a ruling is needed, however, the AJ may rule orally and subsequently must memorialize his or her ruling or, rarely, take the motion under advisement for a later written ruling. Alternatively, if the opposing party files a written response or fails to timely respond to the motion, the AJ may rule on the motion in a written order. In either case, the AJ should rule promptly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Motions that are clearly without merit, inexplicably late, or are clearly noncontroversial, may be ruled on without seeking input from the opposing party. If an objection is received after a ruling is made, the AJ, according to the circumstances, may treat the objection as a motion for reconsideration of that ruling and, after consideration of the response, issue a new ruling either affirming the first or concluding differently.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">MEMORIALIZATION OF RULINGS</span>. For every motion filed, the record <span id="Page_1406"></span>must show a written disposition, i.e., GRANTED, DENIED, or WITHDRAWN. Thus, oral rulings and discussions must be memorialized in a written order reiterating the rulings made, compromises reached, or other dispositions of the motion. That order should be served on all the parties as soon as possible after the conference call, after receipt of a written response to the motion, or after the expiration of the deadline for responding to the motion. However, when the disposition of the motion is recorded on the official tape, CD, or transcript, including any official tape recording or CD of a prehearing or status conference, the requirement for a written disposition is met by the tape or transcript. It is important to assure that the record contains a clear ruling on all motions that may be significant so that the record reflects fully the AJ's actions and decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the motion is noncontroversial, has not been objected to, and is granted, the AJ's order need not contain reasons for the ruling. Otherwise, the order must describe the motion and the AJ's reasons for granting or denying the motion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board "encourage[s] the use of motion practice in proceedings before it, and the Board may look to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for guidance concerning the treatment of motions which are filed with it." <span class="Italic">Phillips v. DHEW</span>, 2 MSPR 315, 316, 2 MSPB 479 (1980). But the Board is not controlled by those rules. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 16 MSPR 397, 401 (1983); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. VA</span>, 9 MSPR 476, 477 (1982) (Federal Rules are instructive, not controlling, in Board proceedings). AJs should rule on motions presented, but if a specific ruling is not made, the AJ's error will not result in reversal of the initial decision without a showing of harm to the moving party. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 388, 392 (1988); <span class="Italic">Parker v. VA</span>, 30 MSPR 109, 110 n.1 (1986) (AJ should have ruled on an agency motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely; the error was not harmful when "it is apparent that she found good cause to waive the time limit by two days"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">SSA v. Anyel</span>, 58 MSPR 261, 273 (1993) (suggesting that the Board's ALJ should rule on motions to strike documents from the record).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board does not require that an AJ give detailed reasons for each of his rulings on motions, a ruling will receive less deference upon challenge if reasons are not provided. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">McAllister v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 658, 661 n.4 (1989). If the AJ fails to rule on a motion, the moving party must object to the AJ's error of omission if the failure to rule is to be presented through a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Matosian v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 689, 697 (1993), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Lopez v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 186, 193 (1991) ("The Board will not consider an allegation of procedural error on the administrative judge's part unless the appellant objected to the administrative judge's conduct below, however. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Valverde v. Dept. of Army</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 380, 383-84 (1989).") Since the AJ has no fixed time to issue a ruling, the timing of any required objection is unclear. It is probably best made in the prehearing submission (or, more tactfully, the prehearing submission could mention that motions are awaiting decision), assuming the case is going to a hearing. If the case is not going to a hearing, if a week passes after the reply to a motion was filed or should have been filed and no ruling is made, a letter to the AJ, duly served on opposing counsel, objecting to the lack of a ruling and requesting a conference call on the motion may move matters along or at least meet the formality required by <span class="Italic">Matosian</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ is obliged to rule on parties' motions. <span class="Italic">Fushikoshi v. USDA,</span> SF-0752-14-0599-I-1 n.7 (NP 10/29/2015). As to the adequacy of an AJ's ruling, the Board favors articulated rulings capable of review. <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 9 MSPR 569, 572-73 (1982), explained as to the failure of the AJ to rule on an agency's motion for a hearing (in the days when the Board permitted the agency to request a hearing):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case there is no sign that the presiding official exercised any discretion with respect to the agency's request. The presiding official's silence resulted in denial of the agency's request for a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires trial judges to make findings of fact. This requirement is intended to evoke care on the part of the trial judge in ascertaining the facts. Wright &#x0026; Miller, <span class="Italic">Federal Practice and Procedure:</span> &#x00A7; 2571. The Supreme Court has emphasized this function saying that judges "will give more careful consideration to the problem if they are required to state not only the end result of their industry but the process by which they reached it." <span class="Italic">United States v. Merz,</span> 376 U.S. 192, 199, 84 S. Ct. 639, 643, 11 L. Ed.2d 629 (1964).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even in areas where judicial discretion is very broad, the Supreme Court has seen fit to require federal judges to make an explicit finding to insure that they have exercised their discretion<span class="Italic">. Dorszynski v. United States,</span> 418 U.S. 424, 94 S. Ct. 3042, 41 L. Ed.2d 855 (1974). Explaining its imposition of the requirement that the exercise of discretion be explicit, the court held:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the finding may be implied from the record, appellate courts must go on to determine what constitutes a sufficient showing of the requisite implication. To hold that a...finding is implicit...would render (the statutory section) nugatory. Appellate courts should not be subject to the burden of case-by-case examination of the record to make sure that the...judge considered the...option made available by the Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 444, 94 S. Ct. at 3053.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the policy of liberally granting agency requests for a hearing, the policy which would have adjudicators state their conclusions, even in situations where they have broad discretion, and the recognition that regulatory language should not be rendered nugatory, the Board finds that it is an error by the presiding official to deny by silence an agency request for a hearing. Stated in the affirmative, presiding officials must make an express ruling upon an agency's request for a hearing pursuant to &#x00A7; 1201.25(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a motion is made, all other parties have the opportunity to object to it. 5 CFR 1201.55(b) (2022). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals v. Whittlesey</span>, 59 MSPR 684, 689 (1993) ("Nothing in the regulation [5 CFR 1201.41--stating the authority of judges in Board proceedings] or in fundamental notions of due process required the Chief ALJ to await a response by the agency before denying respondent's motion if the motion lacked merit or required him to grant such a motion on the ground that its arguments were not disputed."); <span class="Italic">Costello v. Dept. of Army</span>, 31 MSPR 18, 19 n.* (1986) (harmless error for the AJ to fail to permit the appellant to respond to an agency motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction; the appellant did not demonstrate jurisdiction through his PFR). If the AJ rules on a motion before receiving or considering the opposition, the "remedy" to the party seeking to reply is a request for reconsideration of the ruling. The AJ may, <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, consider the reply as a motion for reconsideration. If a party belatedly files a response, it is within the discretion of the AJ whether to consider the response. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Black v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 544, 546 (1988) (concerning the response to a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction). Should a motion arrive a few days before the date set by the AJ for the close of the record, the AJ properly considers an otherwise timely response after the record closing date. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sabio v. VA</span>, 124 MSPR 161, n.5, 2017 MSPB 4 (2017) ("Thus, because the appellant's motion to strike was filed only 5 days before the close of the record, the agency's rebuttal, filed 7 days later, is permissible.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although Board regulations now set a 10-day response time for a motion, the AJ can vary that time limit, but the AJ must ensure that the parties are aware of the variation as a matter of due process. Early on it its existence, the Board explained as to the timing of responses to motions, <span class="Italic">McGowan v. Int'l Communications Agency</span>, 3 MSPR 83, 86-87, 2 MSPB 198 (1980):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In the instant appeal, the agency filed its motion to dismiss on July 11, 1979, and its motion for postponement on July 19, 1979. The presiding official granted the postponement on July 23, 1979, in order to consider fully the motion to dismiss and to allow appellant "a reasonable opportunity in which to respond." The presiding official then filed his, initial decision on August 2, 1979, the day originally set for hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The lack of a time limit or other guidelines for a party's exercise of the "opportunity to object" to a motion under 5 C.F.R. 1201.55 (b), rests the issue of timeliness in the sound discretion of the presiding official. The presiding official should fix upon a reasonable time to respond to a motion under all of the circumstances of the particular case. A fair and reasonable amount of time must be afforded to a party to object to a motion particularly where, as here, no specific deadline was set and the grant of the agency's motion resulted in the adjudication of the appeal without a hearing. The Board finds that, under the circumstances of this case, the presiding official's decision to continue the hearing from August 2, 1979, to an unspecified future date, created the reasonable inference that he would make no decision on the case at least until after August 2, so as to afford appellant "an opportunity to object" to the agency's motion to dismiss. In fact, only ten days passed between the postponement and the issuance of the decision. The record shows that appellant's representative received the postponement notice two days after it was mailed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that due process should be utilized to protect a public employee's interest in his employment. <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Macy</span>, 357 F. 2d 62, 68 (8th Cir. 1966). Due process in administrative proceedings of a judicial nature generally requires conformance to fair practices of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence. <span class="Italic">Hornsby v. Allen,</span> 326 F. 2d 605, 608, <span class="Italic">reh. denied,</span> 330 F. 2d 55 (5th Cir. 1964). Although administrative agencies such as the Board are not bound by the same details of procedure as the courts, they are governed by the same basic requirements of fairness and notice, including specificity of notice and opportunity to respond if what is instituted (the agency's motion to dismiss) is intended to be a procedure for summary disposition without a hearing. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hess &#x0026; Clark, Division of Rhodia, Inc. v. Food and Drug Administration,</span> 495 F. 2d 975, 984 (D.C. Cir. 1974). Under all of the circumstances of the instant appeal, although appellant was served with a copy of the agency's motion to dismiss three weeks prior to the issuance of the initial decision and failed to object to it, we find that the presiding official did not afford appellant fair notice of the deadline for his response, and that appellant was thereby denied a reasonable "opportunity to object" to the agency's motion under 5 C.F.R. 1201.55 (b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant, therefore, should be permitted a specific opportunity to respond to the agency's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Parties frequently request extensions of time. They should be mindful of the provision of 5 CFR 1201.55, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, applicable to all procedural motions: "a party filing a motion for extension of time, a motion for postponement of a hearing, or any other procedural motion must first contact the other party to <span id="Page_1407"></span>determine whether there is any objection to the motion, and must state in the motion whether the other party has an objection."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It may occur that a single issue is raised through a jurisdictional order from the AJ and a motion to dismiss from the agency. If the appellant has the opportunity to respond to the jurisdictional order before the record closes, but the appellant's 10-day response time for the motion is eclipsed by the issuance of the initial decision, the appellant suffers no error warranting a remand since the appellant has had a fair opportunity to address the issue raised by the order and the motion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Christman v. Dept. of Army</span>, NY-315H-17-0086-I-1 (NP 6/14/2022) (probationary termination: "Thus, in light of the clear language in the acknowledgment order setting forth the applicable deadlines, we find unpersuasive the appellant's argument that she should have had 10 days to respond to the agency's motion to dismiss. Although the acknowledgment order also indicated that, <span class="Italic">unless otherwise specified</span>, a response to a motion must be filed within 10 calendar days, here, the jurisdictional deadlines were clearly and separately specified. The appellant, who was represented by counsel, simply failed to file a jurisdictional response within the required deadline.").</p>
