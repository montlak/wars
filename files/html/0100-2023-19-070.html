<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-66"><span class="space">8.</span> Limitation on General Employability</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Rehabilitation Act seeks to remedy perceived or actual disabilities that extend beyond an isolated mismatch of the employer and the employee. At issue is the general foreclosure of the type of employment involved. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Forrisi v. Bowen</span>, 794 F.2d 931 (4th Cir. 1986). <span class="Italic">Miller v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 473, 476-79 (1990), relying on <span class="Italic">Forrisi</span>, explained that disabling conditions are those that limit employment in a line of work rather than impair an individual's ability to work in a particular job or at a particular work site:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant in a removal or demotion appeal has the burden to prove an allegation of handicap discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56; <span class="Italic">Clancy v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 6 MSPB 173, 6 MSPR 196, 199 (1981). To do so, she must first establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. While the necessary elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case vary according to the particular facts and circumstances at issue, they generally include the following: (1) A showing that the appellant is a "handicapped person" as defined in 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a) and that the action appealed to the Board was based on her handicap; and (2) to the extent possible, articulation of a reasonable accommodation under which the appellant believes she could perform the essential duties of her position or of a vacant position to which she could be reassigned, <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the Navy,</span> 36 MSPR 148, 151-52 (1988); <span class="Italic">see Stalkfleet,</span> 6 MSPR at 647.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We concur with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to establish the first element of her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case--that she is a "handicapped person." Regulations define "handicap" as "a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of [a] person's major life activities...." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a). Regulations go on to define "major life activities" as "functions, such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and <span class="Italic">working</span>." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(c) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has observed,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The question of who is a handicapped person under the [Rehabilitation] Act is best suited to a "case-by-case determination," <span class="Italic">E.E. Black, Ltd. v. Marshall,</span> 497 F. Supp. 1088, 1100 (D. Haw. 1980), as courts assess the effects of various impairments upon varied individuals. The definitional task cannot be accomplished merely through abstract lists and categories of impairments. The inquiry is, of necessity, an individualized one--whether the particular impairment constitutes for the particular person a significant barrier to employment. Relevant to the inquiry are "the number and type of jobs from which the impaired individual is disqualified, the geographical area to which the individual has reasonable access, and the individual's job expectations and training." <span class="Italic">Jasany v. United States Postal Service,</span> 755 F.2d 1244, 1249 (6th Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Forrisi v. Bowen,</span> 794 F.2d 931, 933 (4th Cir. 1986). The fact that an impairment prevents an employee from meeting the demands of a particular job does not necessarily mean that she is handicapped; the <span id="Page_3450"></span>impairment must foreclose generally the type of employment involved. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 934-35.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these principles to the facts of this case, the Philadelphia metropolitan area where the appellant lives and worked is the relevant geographical area. The evidence did establish that the appellant's allergy to dust rendered her incapable of functioning as a Distribution Clerk in at least two major work locales in the Philadelphia area--the General Post Office and the Air Mail Facility. The appellant presented no evidence, however, that would establish that her allergies substantially limited her employability generally in the Philadelphia area. To the contrary, she testified that her condition clears up when she is absent from her work environment, and that, except for her employment as a Distribution Clerk, she has no history of significant impairment from her allergies either on or off the job. In addition, the appellant had limited training and job expectations as a Distribution Clerk, having occupied the position for only about two years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion that the appellant has failed to establish that she is handicapped is consistent with court and administrative decisions in similar cases. In <span class="Italic">Wright v. Tisch,</span> 45 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 151 (E.D. Va. Oct. 20, 1987), the plaintiff developed severe respiratory ailments as a result of dusty working conditions in a new location after she accepted a permanent reassignment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 152. The plaintiff testified that she had no history of respiratory ailments, that her symptoms disappeared after leaving the work environment, and that she had no difficulty with outdoor activity, such as would be required of a letter carrier. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court concluded that the plaintiff's allergy restricted her "only from the unusual, if not unique, environmental conditions" of the new work area, and held that the plaintiff was not handicapped. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 153.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner in <span class="Italic">Gomez v. Department of the Air Force,</span> Pet. No. 03890007, slip op. (EEOC Jan. 17, 1989), was removed following a fitness for duty examination when the agency physician determined that, as a result of his hypersensitivity to paint fumes, the petitioner was incapable of performing the essential job duties of his position as a painter. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) concluded that the petitioner was not handicapped because he had failed to show that the condition affected his employability generally.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]t cannot reasonably be concluded that because petitioner is unable to continue working in the narrow occupation of his choice, he has a substantial handicap to employment. The additional evidence submitted by the agency shows that petitioner held a variety of positions prior to his agency employment, and he only occupied the position of painter for a five-year period. Accordingly, although petitioner is disqualified from the field of painting, this disqualification does not drastically reduce his employability.... Considering petitioner, the extent of his allergy, and his job experience and expectations, the Commission finds that petitioner's allergy does not constitute an impairment which substantially limits a major life activity.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Commission stated that its construction of 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a) as to the existence of a handicapping condition was consistent with that of courts which have concluded that to permit those with minor impairments to avail themselves of the protections of the Rehabilitation Act would contravene the intent of the Act to protect those who are truly handicapped. <span class="Italic">Gomez</span>, slip op. at 4. The Commission's analysis in <span class="Italic">Gomez</span> is entitled to deference because EEOC was interpreting its own regulation. <span class="Italic">See Kimsey v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior,</span> 24 MSPR 528, 532 (1984). The present case closely parallels <span class="Italic">Gomez</span> in several important respects. In both cases, allergic conditions rendered the employees incapable of performing essential duties of their jobs, but did not generally preclude them from pursuing other lines of work for which they were qualified or significantly affect their lives outside the workplace. In addition, both employees had limited time and training in the jobs from which they were removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the appellant failed to establish by preponderant evidence that she is a handicapped person as defined in 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a), and that she failed to sustain her affirmative defense of handicap discrimination.</p>

See Miller v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 43 MSPR 473, 477-78 (1990). Rather, the inquiry is whether "'the particular impairment constitutes for the particular person a significant barrier to employment.'" <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Department of Defense</span>, 54 MSPR 641, 645 (1992) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant did not meet the definition of an "individual with handicaps" because he did not submit evidence or argument showing that the alleged handicapping conditions substantially limited one or more of his major life activities, including foreclosure generally of the type of employment involved. Although the appellant asserts on petition for review that he was "incapacitated from work due to psychological conditions," he refers to no record evidence showing that, for the relevant period, the alleged handicapping condition substantially limited one or more of his major life activities, and we could find no such evidence in the record. Thus, we find no error on the administrative judge's part as to this finding<span class="Italic">. See Joyner v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 154, 159 (1993).</p>

Dept. of Navy</span>, 92 MSPR 120, 126 &#x00B6; 16 (2002) ("That he could not perform those duties in a particular office or location is not enough to show that he was 'substantially' limited in the major life activity of working.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board reiterated that it is important to distinguish between a disability that limits employability in a particular line of work and one that prevents employment in any line of work, <span class="Italic">Gray v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 142, 146-47 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination includes a showing that the employee is a "handicapped" person under 29 CFR 1613.702(a). <span class="Italic">Cohen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 46 MSPR 369, 373-74 (1990). The question of who is a "handicapped" person is an individualized one, focusing on whether the particular impairment constitutes a significant barrier to employment. The fact that an impairment prevents an employee from meeting the demands of a particular job does not necessarily mean that he is handicapped; the impairment must foreclose generally the type of employment involved. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 374.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's finding that the appellant's removal did not constitute handicap discrimination was based on the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant did not meet the definition of a "handicapped" person since he did not have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited one or more of his major life activities. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1613.702(a). While the ability to work is defined as one of the major life activities, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 CFR 1613.702(c), and the administrative judge found that the appellant's medical condition precluded him from employment in positions involving the delivery of mail, he also found that it did not "preclude him from employment generally." The administrative judge based this finding on evidence that the appellant had been able to perform clerical duties while in a light duty assignment status. Consequently, the administrative judge determined that the appellant had failed to make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that he was physically handicapped.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's analysis is not consistent with Board precedent. We have not held that an employee is handicapped only if his condition precludes him from employment generally. Instead, we have held that an employee may be considered handicapped if he has an impairment that forecloses generally the type of employment involved. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 473, 477-78 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Forrisi v. Bowen</span>, 794 F.2d 931, 934-35 (4th Cir. 1986). Furthermore, in <span class="Italic">Joyner v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 596, 599 (1991), we held that no authority of which we were aware supported the view that an employee could be considered handicapped only if he was unable to perform other lines of work. Because the appellant is employed as a City Letter Carrier, and because his physical condition precluded his distributing or delivering mail, we find that his condition would foreclose generally the type of employment involved here; thus, the appellant has shown that he is a "handicapped" employee, whose removal was based on his handicap. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1613.702(a); <span class="Italic">Joyner</span>, 47 MSPR at 599-600 (a machinist whose physical disability made it impossible for him to perform the duties of his position effectively and safely was a "handicapped person" even though he was capable of performing various types of administrative work, which was not in the same type of employment as machinist work); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Carty v. Carlin</span>, 623 F. Supp. 1181, 1184-85 (D. Md. 1985) (postal worker with physical and mental impairment who was unable, because of impairments, to perform his laborer/custodian position was a "handicapped person" even though he was capable of performing the clerical duties of a distribution clerk).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "employability bar" test was met in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 53 MSPR 537, 540-41 (1992), involving a machinist subject to medical restrictions precluding heavy lifting and operation of machinery with moving parts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Based on the appellant's condition and prescribed medication, his medical restrictions are broad enough to preclude him from performing any type of activity related to heavy machinery. Moreover, since his entire career has been as a Machinist, his job expectations and training would foreclose him generally from that type of employment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3451"></span>Thus, we find that the appellant is a handicapped employee, under the definition of that term that has been adopted by the Board....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the appellant's work was delivering the mail, a bar to general employability was met by physical conditions impeding the ability of the employee to perform his particular job, <span class="Italic">Caseres v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 642, 644-45 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge determined that the evidence established that by using a cart rather than carrying a satchel on his shoulders, using a lumbosacral corset, and minimizing as much as practical any bending and lifting of heavy items, the appellant would be able to continue to perform his duties successfully. The administrative judge concluded that the evidence supported a finding of disability discrimination, but that the appellant did not prove race discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find it necessary to reopen the appeal to correct the administrative judge's analysis of the appellant's claim of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of who is a disabled person is an individualized one, focusing on whether the particular impairment constitutes a significant barrier to employment, i.e., that it forecloses generally the type of employment involved. <span class="Italic">See Gray v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 142, 146 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant was not disabled. Rather, he based his finding of disability discrimination on the agency's perception that the appellant was disabled. We find that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant did not have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited one or more of his major life activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant is employed as a postal carrier, and because his physical condition precluded his distributing or delivering mail, we find that his condition would foreclose generally the type of employment involved here. <span class="Italic">See Gray</span>, at 146-47. In addition, as a result of the restrictions regarding the appellant's ability to lift, push and pull heavy objects...his physical condition constitutes more than a minor impairment and affects his employability generally beyond his ability to perform his duties as a postal carrier. Consequently, the appellant's situation may be distinguished from that of other individuals whose physical conditions were determined not to be disabilities because they were unable to continue working in their narrow occupations. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 473, 478-79 (1990), <span class="Italic">citing Gomez v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, Pet. No. 03890007, slip op. (EEOC Jan. 17, 1989) (both cases involved individuals who experienced allergic conditions that rendered them incapable of performing the essential duties of their jobs, but did not generally preclude them from pursuing other lines of work for which they were qualified or significantly affect their lives outside the workplace). Thus, the appellant is a disabled person. <span class="Italic">Id.; see also Gray</span> at 146-47. Furthermore, the record demonstrates that the appellant was removed from his position primarily because of his disability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To say that a person is not qualified for accommodation without a disability that disqualifies him from more than a particular job does is not to suggest the employee must be unable to perform any work. It is a particular line of work that is examined, <span class="Italic">Joyner v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 596, 598-600 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a WG-10 Machinist, was removed effective June 6, 1990, based on a physical disability that made him unable to perform the duties of his position efficiently and safely. The removal action followed medical restrictions placed on the appellant by an agency physician after a December 15, 1989, medical evaluation. The agency stated in its proposal notice that its efforts to place the appellant in another position had been unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant had not shown that he was handicapped, the administrative judge noted that the appellant was first injured more than 10 years before his removal, and that he had spent most of the time since that injury working in positions other than Machinist positions. He stated that there was evidence that the appellant performed the duties of those other positions in a satisfactory manner; he found that the appellant therefore was "capable of performing other lines of work"; and he concluded that the appellant accordingly could not be considered handicapped.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant alleges that the administrative judge erroneously interpreted <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of the Navy,</span> 45 MSPR 136 (1990), and <span class="Italic">Miller v. United States</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service,</span> 43 MSPR 473 (1990), two decisions he cited in making the findings described above. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1613.702(a) of title 29, CFR, defines a "handicapped person" as "one who: (1) Has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities, (2) has a record of such an impairment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment." Section 1613.702(c) defines "major life activities" as including "performing manual tasks, walking,...and working." In <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> and <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, the Board held that an impairment that prevented an employee from meeting the demands of a particular job did not necessarily cause the employee to be handicapped, and that an employee could not be considered "handicapped" unless he had an impairment that "foreclose[d] generally the type of employment involved." <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 45 MSPR at 141, citing <span class="Italic">Forrisi v. Bowen,</span> 794 F.2d 931, 934-35 (4th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 43 MSPR at 477-78. Neither these cases nor any other authority of which we are aware supports the view that an employee can be considered handicapped only if he is unable to perform "other lines of work." We note further that Machinists' work concerns the manufacture, assembly, and repair of machinery, while the nonmachinist work the appellant performed between the time he was injured and the time he was removed evidently consisted of various types of administrative work. The administrative work the appellant performed is not, in our view, included in the same type of employment as machinist work. Furthermore, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency has demonstrated that the appellant is, as the agency alleged in its proposal notice, severely limited in his ability to lift, carry, climb, work on ladders or scaffolding, stoop, twist, bend, push, and pull, and that he is incapable even of walking from a reserved handicapped parking lot outside the industrial area to his work site or to the shuttle bus that would take him to the work site. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant is a "handicapped person" as that term is defined in 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702.</p>
