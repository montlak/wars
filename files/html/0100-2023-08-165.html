<p class="Body-Text">By memorandum of understanding of September 13, 2021, TSA and MSPB agreed that MSPB would adjudicate appeals by screening personnel of defined conduct and performance-based actions on the same basis as other appeals by employees covered by the CSRA. <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092721_tsa_mspb_moa_FNN.pdf">https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/092721_tsa_mspb_moa_FNN.pdf</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Before the 2021 MOU, Brooks v. DHS</span>, 95 MSPR 464, 466-70 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 9-15 (2004), determined that Transportation Security Administration security screeners' appeals were statutorily removed from Board jurisdiction--in the appellant's case, involving a 2003 reduction in grade during the appellant's probationary period:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, formerly a Supervisory Transportation Security Screener with the agency's Transportation Security Administration (TSA), filed an appeal asserting that he was a preference eligible employee, who had completed one year of current continuous service in the same position, and was appealing an "otherwise appealable action" based on the agency's June 11, 2003 decision to reduce him in grade to a nonsupervisory Transportation Security Screener position during his probationary period. The appellant asserted that he had completed his probationary period and noted that he had a whistleblowing case pending before the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) "for related actions taken against me."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that, even though his IRA appeal is ripe for adjudication, the Board should determine whether it has jurisdiction over his reduction in grade as an otherwise appealable action. In this regard, the appellant asserts that he was not a probationary employee under the agency's policies because he served in his position for over one year at the time of his reduction in grade. The appellant also asserts that Congress intended for the Board to have jurisdiction to review TSA actions when it enacted the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) and created TSA because Congress mandated that TSA adopt the personnel system in place at the Federal Aviation Administration and that system, set forth at 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2), references sections 1204, 1211-1218, 1221, and 7701-7703 of Title 5. The appellant argues that 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3) provides that an employee "may submit an appeal to the...Board...from any action that was appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further contends that section 111(d) of ATSA, which the agency relied upon to support its motion to dismiss, was codified as a statutory note to 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935, and while authoritative in interpreting the meaning of the U.S. Code, it is not a part of the U.S. Code and should not be allowed to defeat intention otherwise manifested in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g). The appellant asserts that the Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the functions, personnel, assets, and liabilities of TSA to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and provided that it was the Sense of Congress that employees of DHS are entitled to fair treatment in any appeals they bring in decisions relating to their employment and that, in prescribing regulations for any such appeal procedures, the Secretary should ensure that employees are afforded due process and should be required to consult with the Merit Systems Protection Board before issuing any such regulations. The appellant asserts that, in the absence of DHS appeal procedures, the Board must fill this void and accept jurisdiction. Finally, the appellant argues that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal and that the reduction in grade must <span id="Page_268"></span>be reversed because he completed his probationary period on June 11, 2003, and the agency did not provide him with minimum due process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board generally has jurisdiction over an appeal filed by an employee from a reduction-in-grade action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(3), 7513(a), (d); <span class="Italic">see Hogan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 218 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The term "employee" means a preference eligible in the excepted service, like the appellant, who has completed one year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress provided in &#x00A7; 101(a) of the ATSA (49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(n)), however, that "[t]he personnel management system established by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration under section 40122 shall apply to employees of the Transportation Security Administration, or, subject to the requirements of such section, the Under Secretary [of Transportation for Security] may make such modifications to the personnel management system with respect to such employees as the Under Secretary considers appropriate, such as adopting aspects of other personnel systems of the Department of Transportation." As noted by the appellant, 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2) references sections 1204, 1211-1218, 1221, and 7701-7703 of Title 5. Section 40122(g)(3) provides that, "[u]nder the new personnel management system developed and implemented under paragraph (1), an employee of the Administration may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board and may seek judicial review of any resulting final orders or decisions of the Board from any action that was appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, another provision of the ATSA specifically addresses the agency's authority over personnel actions affecting security screeners like the appellant and grants the agency broad authority to discipline such individuals. Section 111(d) of the ATSA, entitled "Screener Personnel," provides that, "[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security may employ, appoint, discipline, terminate, and fix the compensation, terms, and conditions of employment of Federal service for such a number of individuals as the Under Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out the screening functions of the Under Secretary...." Such a "notwithstanding" clause clearly signals the drafter's intention that the provisions of the "notwithstanding" section override conflicting provisions of any other section. <span class="Italic">See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group</span>, 508 U.S. 10, 18, 113 S. Ct. 1898, 123 L.

Cl. 1973) ("language such as 'notwithstanding the provisions of this or any other law' covers the waterfront regarding the operational scope of the statute"). Thus, regardless of whether the appellant had completed his probationary period, we find that the agency may discipline screener personnel like the appellant notwithstanding the provisions of 5 U.S.C. ch. 75, section 101(a) of the ATSA, and 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the above interpretation of sections 101(a) and 111(d) of the ATSA leaves neither provision inoperative, superfluous, redundant, or contradictory, <span class="Italic">see Johnson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant argues that section 111(d) is not a part of the U.S. Code, and, therefore, may not prevail over the provisions of 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g), we disagree. Although the U.S. Code is <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence of the laws contained therein, the Code cannot prevail over the Statutes at Large when the two are inconsistent. <span class="Italic">United States v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 21, 2002, Mr. Conyers filed an appeal with the Board, challenging the agency's decision not to select him for the screener position.

Dep't of Transp.,</span> No. NY-3443-03-0034-I-1 (Feb. 14, 2003). The AJ noted that section 111(d) of the Aviation and Transportation Security Act ("ATSA"), 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935 note, grants TSA power to appoint applicants to screener positions "notwithstanding any other provision of law." The AJ determined that this statutory language precluded the Board from asserting jurisdiction over Mr. Conyers' appeal. The AJ's initial decision became the final decision of the Board on March 15, 2004, after the Board denied Mr. Conyers' petition for review for failure to meet the criteria set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(d) (2002). This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over only those matters that are entrusted to it by statute or regulation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a); <span class="Italic">Meeker v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 319 F.3d 1368, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Mr. Conyers contends that the Board had jurisdiction over his appeal because he was challenging his non-selection by TSA under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501 (2002) (relating to unsuitability determinations), <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 300.104 (relating to alleged improper employment practices), 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324 (2002) (The Uniformed Service Employment and Reemployment Act of 1994), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) (2002) (The Whistleblower Protection Act), <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 3330a (The Veterans' Employment Opportunities Act of 1998), and <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 1203 (relating to review of agency regulations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no error in the Board's dismissal of Mr. Conyers' appeal for lack of jurisdiction. With certain exceptions specified by the Under Secretary of Transportation, TSA is subject to the personnel management system established by the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA"). <span class="Italic">See</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(n) (2002). Thus, the FAA's personnel management system applies certain personnel provisions of Title 5 specifically enumerated in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g) (2002). The Title 5 provisions enumerated in section 40122(g) include, among others, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b), relating to whistleblower protection, <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3308-3320, relating to veterans' preferences, <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 7204, relating to antidiscrimination, <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 73, relating to suitability, security, and conduct, and <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204, 1211-1218, 1221, 7701-7703, relating to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While these provisions generally apply to TSA, section 111(d) of the ATSA, codified as a note to 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935,[2] includes a specific provision regarding TSA security screeners:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security may employ, appoint, discipline, terminate, and fix the compensation, terms, and conditions of employment of Federal service for such a number of individuals as the Under Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out the screening functions of the Under Secretary under section 44901 of title 49, United States Code. The Under Secretary shall establish levels of compensation and other benefits for individuals so employed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Contrary to Mr. Conyers' suggestion, the fact that this provision was codified as a statutory note is of no moment. The Statutes at Large provide the evidence of the laws of the United States. 1 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 112 (2004). <span class="Italic">See United States v. Welden,</span> 377 U.S. 95, 98 n.4, 84 S. Ct. 1082, 12 L. Ed.2d 152 (1964) (noting that a provision of an Act must be read "in the context of the entire Act, rather than in the context of the 'arrangement' selected by the codifier").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that this provision confers upon the Under Secretary greater flexibility regarding screener positions than he or she may have with respect to other classes of employees. The language "[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law" signals that this screener-specific provision is to override more general conflicting statutory provisions to the extent that they would apply to screeners. <span class="Italic">See Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group,</span> 508 U.S. 10, 18, 113 S. Ct. 1898, 123 L. Ed.2d 572 (1993) (explaining that use of a "notwithstanding" clause "clearly signals the drafter's intention that the provisions of the 'notwithstanding' section override conflicting provisions of any other section"). We think that the "[n]otwithstanding <span class="Italic">any other provision of law</span>" language renders inapplicable general federal statutes that otherwise would apply to the Under Secretary's power to "employ, appoint, discipline, terminate, and fix the compensation, terms, and conditions of employment of Federal <span id="Page_269"></span>service" for screener positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935 note (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Liberty Mar. Corp. v. United States,</span> 928 F.2d 413, 416 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (interpreting same "notwithstanding" language to supersede all other laws, finding that a clearer statement of intent to supersede is "difficult to imagine"). Among the statutory provisions thus rendered inapplicable is section 7701(a) of Title 5, which states that "[a]n employee, or applicant for employment, may submit an appeal to the [Board] from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cases cited by Mr. Conyers that interpret "notwithstanding" clauses in other contexts are not inconsistent with our present interpretation of section 111(d) of the ATSA. Generally in the cases cited by Mr. Conyers, courts were required to determine the extent to which such clauses pre-empted state law, a question that often may turn on congressional intent. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., E.P. Paup Co. v. Dep't of Labor,</span> 999 F.2d 1341, 1348-49 (9th Cir. 1993) (explaining that a "notwithstanding" clause "does not always provide a clear indication that Congress intended to preempt, particularly when there is legislative intent to the contrary"). In this case, however, our acceptance of the plain meaning of the "notwithstanding" clause in section 111(d) of the ATSA fully comports with congressional intent to give the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security greater flexibility over screener positions <span class="Italic">vis-&#x00E0;-vis</span> federal laws than he or she has in the case of non-screener positions at TSA. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Conf. Rep.

<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 111(d) of the ATSA exempts TSA from laws that otherwise would apply to screener positions. As a consequence, the Board is divested of jurisdiction to hear appeals alleging violations of such laws insofar as TSA screener positions are concerned. That is the case here with respect to the position for which Mr. Conyers applied. Accordingly, the final decision of the Board dismissing Mr. Conyers' appeal for lack of jurisdiction is affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Teacher v. MSPB</span>, 211 Fed. Appx. 958 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP) (declining to reconsider the result and analysis of <span class="Italic">Conyers</span>); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Knight v. MSPB</span>, 420 Fed. Appx. 963, 965 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Conyers,</span> the Board also lacks jurisdiction over appeals of supervisory screeners. <span class="Italic">Spain v. DHS</span>, 99 MSPR 529, 532 &#x00B6; 9 (2005) (USERRA claim; "Although the relevant position in this case is a supervisory screener position, the 'notwithstanding' clause of the ATSA is equally applicable to supervisory screeners as to screeners.... Because USERRA appeals by screeners are excluded from the Board's jurisdiction under the ATSA, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the instant appeal regardless of whether the appellant was separated for cause.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Personnel in the 1802 series who are not screeners have Board appeal rights, <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DHS</span>, 122 MSPR 262, 264-68 n.6 &#x0026; &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-13, 2015 MSPB 20 (2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The agency further argued that the TSA Administrator exercised his authority under 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(n) to modify the FAA personnel management system to preclude the Board's jurisdiction over adverse actions taken against SCCOs. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (providing that the TSA Administrator "may make such modifications to the [FAA] personnel management system with respect to [TSA] employees as [he] considers appropriate"); IAF, Tab 7 at 7-8, 41-42 (citing the agency's MD 1100.75-3, Addressing Unacceptable Performance and Conduct, &#x00A7; J(2) (June 3, 2013) to argue that the TSA Administrator has made the claimed modification). It is undisputed that individuals determined by the Administrator to be necessary to carry out the screening functions under section 44901 lack Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Conyers v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 388 F.3d 1380, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 464, &#x00B6; 13 (2004). The threshold issue in this case, however, is whether the Administrator has determined that the appellant's position is necessary to carry out screening functions. Only if this question is answered in the affirmative is it necessary to consider the agency's position that the Board lacks the authority to review such a determination. Here, however, there is no indication in the record that the Administrator determined that the appellant's position was necessary to carry out screening functions. Thus, there is no indication that the Administrator deemed all of the positions within the 1802 occupational series, under which the appellant's position was classified, as necessary to performing screening functions. Accordingly, because there is no indication that the Administrator determined the appellant's position or occupational series as necessary to carry out screening functions, section 44935 does not deprive the Board of jurisdiction to consider this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant was not a screener excluded from Board appeal rights. The agency argues that the appellant was a screener because she performed functions connected to, and supporting, screening functions. We find that, because the appellant did not directly perform screening functions, she is entitled to appeal her demotion to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, an individual who carries out screening functions under section 44901 of Title 49 may not appeal an adverse action to the Board. 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935 note. Section 44901 requires the "screening of all passengers, and property, including United States mail, cargo, carry-on and checked baggage." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44901(a). The ATSA also lists a number of employment standards for screeners that anticipate that individuals in these positions will have direct contact with passengers and property. 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935(f). For example, the standards refer to screeners as working in "an active checkpoint environment," operating screening equipment, reading airline tickets, and "performing physical searches" of baggage and "pat-downs" of passengers. 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935(f)(1)(B), (C)(ii).[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The only definition of screening in chapter 449 of Title 49 is with reference to air cargo on passenger aircraft. <span class="Italic">See</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44901(g)(5) (defining screening of air cargo on passenger aircraft as "a physical examination or non-intrusive methods of assessing whether cargo poses a threat to transportation security"). The TSA regulations do not define screening. However, its regulation on "[s]creening of individuals and property" provides that its scope includes "the inspection of individuals, accessible property, checked baggage, and cargo." 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1546.207(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After conducting a thorough review of the record, including witness testimony, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant was not a screener. She examined the appellant's duties, which she found did not include screening passengers, baggage, or cargo. She also found that the appellant's position differed from that of a screener with regard to training and uniform requirements, and was subject to a different timekeeping system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge further found that, because the appellant was employed in the Coordination Center, she was not required to maintain certification as a screener. The agency does not dispute this finding, but argues, in essence, that this distinction between Supervisory TSOs who work in a Coordination Center and those who do not is insignificant. The agency notes that prior experience as a screener is a prerequisite for those, like the appellant, working in a Coordination Center. However, we find the distinction significant because an annual proficiency review is a statutory requirement for screeners. 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 44935(f)(5). The fact that the appellant was not subject to such a requirement belies her status as a screener. Therefore, we agree with the administrative judge that the fact that the appellant was not required to maintain her screening certification suggests that she was not working as a screener prior to her demotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge erred in determining that, to be a screener, an employee must be physically involved in screening passengers, baggage, or cargo.[10] Based on the statutory language above, we agree with the administrative judge that Congress intended screening to involve, at a minimum, direct contact with passengers, mail, cargo, or carry-on or checked baggage. Therefore, we find that the duties that the appellant performed that were related to screening did not exempt her from the right to appeal her demotion to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;According to the agency, the appellant was a screener within the meaning of the ATSA because some of her duties were connected to, and supported, screening functions at the airport, as part of a "multilayered screening approach." The agency provides examples of these duties, such as reporting metrics relating to screening to headquarters; monitoring closed-circuit televisions within the airport, including screening areas; notifying and recalling screening personnel in the event of an emergency; dispatching screening personnel to checkpoints; and implementing a program to ensure the continuation of essential security functions in the event of an unexpected disruption in operations. Further, the agency argues that the appellant was "essential staff," required to report to duty even in a government shutdown. While we are sympathetic to the agency's need to employ individuals other than screeners to ensure airport security, we agree with the administrative judge that such a broad definition of screening threatens to include virtually all TSA employees within its ambit, effectively eviscerating the Board appeal rights guaranteed to nonscreeners by 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we agree with administrative judge that the documentary evidence suggests that the agency itself considers SCCOs to be nonscreeners. According to the agency, it has designated all positions in the 1802 occupational series, including SCCOs, as necessary to the screening function under a job analysis tool (JAT) and the agency's MD <span id="Page_270"></span>1100.77-1, &#x00A7; A(14). The JAT reflects that Supervisory TSOs perform and supervise screening functions. However, as the agency acknowledges, the JAT further provides that, when assigned to a Coordination Center, a Supervisory TSO like the appellant "does not perform or supervise screening functions."[11] Based on this distinction in the JAT, we are not persuaded that it supports the agency's claims that the TSA Administrator has designated SCCOs as necessary for screening.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;The agency argues that the series 1802 designation is a "classification" over which the Board lacks jurisdiction. The agency is correct that the Board generally lacks jurisdiction over the proper classification of a position. <span class="Italic">Saunders v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1985). However, we do not determine in this appeal whether the classification of the appellant's position was correct. Rather, we are concerned only with her demotion. <span class="Italic">Cf. Russell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 698, 711 (1981) (finding that, under certain circumstances, a change in job classification can result in a reduction in grade appealable to the Board). The administrative judge properly looked at the JAT, among other factors, to determine whether the appellant was a screener.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MD 1100.77-1 also does not designate SCCOs as screeners. It provides that "as used in this policy," the title TSO includes Coordination Center officers. The MD 1100.77-1 concerns the procedures for the OPR Board, an internal agency body that reviews and decides adverse action appeals by TSOs, including Supervisory TSOs. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 54-55. The agency has pointed to no provision of the MD 1100.77-1 suggesting that the directive describes or designates TSOs or SCCOs as performing screening functions. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 8 (containing the agency's argument). Likewise, we have been unable to locate such a designation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 52-59. Therefore, we do not find the MD 1100.77-1 supports the conclusion that SCCOs are screeners.</p>

Under the ATSA, TSA employees are covered by the personnel management system that is applicable to employees of the Federal Aviation Administration under 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122, except to the extent that the Administrator of TSA modifies that system as it applies to TSA employees. <span class="Italic">Quinlan,</span> 118 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6; 8 (citing 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(n)).

We thus agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's reduction in pay band is appealable to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's review of a reduction in pay band or grade, however, is quite limited. <span class="Italic">See Bobie v.

In cases where an appellant has suffered a reduction in grade due to a downward reclassification decision, the Board's review of the agency's action is limited to whether the agency's action in effecting the reduction in grade was in accordance with law. <span class="Italic">See Quinlan</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6; 9. In conducting such an assessment, the Board will look to whether the agency adhered to its internal management directives in determining whether its actions were taken in accordance with law. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Gibson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 274, 277 (1984) (finding that the scope of review in an appeal of a reduction in grade due to a downward reclassification is limited to determining whether the agency showed that the reclassification decision comported with law).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the agency demonstrated it effected the appellant's reduction in pay band in accordance with law. The agency submitted preponderant evidence below that, consistent with its internal policies, it provided the appellant advanced notice of its proposed reclassification of his position and corresponding reduction in pay band, a copy of the materials in support of its proposal, and an opportunity to reply. <span class="Italic">Quinlan</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6; 10. The appellant has not specifically challenged these findings on review, and we concur with the administrative judge that the agency complied with its internal policies and directives when it proposed the appellant's reduction in pay band. Accordingly, under the Board's limited review of a reduction in grade based on a downward reclassification decision, we find that the agency's action comports with law and was properly affirmed by the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See Quinlan</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10; <span class="Italic">Gibson</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. at 277.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">TSA employees are subject to an agency disciplinary procedure, <span class="Italic">Brown v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-14-0816-I-1 n.3 (NP 1/19/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The provisions of Management Directive (MD) 1100.75-3 and the accompanying Handbook, rather than chapter 75, govern disciplinary actions against Transportation Security Administration employees. <span class="Italic">Buelna v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 5 n.2 (2014); <span class="Italic">Winlock v.

MD 1100-75.3 and the accompanying Handbook are found in the record at IAF, Tab 7, Subtabs 4G-4H. The Handbook requires consideration of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">See Winlock</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 521, &#x00B6; 25.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of mitigation of disciplinary penalties for TSA employees, guidance from <span class="Italic">Lindsay v. DHS</span>, AT-0752-16-0429-I-1 (NP 4/6/2023), was indirect:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was removed from his position as a Transportation Security Inspector--Explosives Detection Canine Handler with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) after he allegedly failed to provide an adequate breath sample for an alcohol test. He argues that his due process rights were violated because the deciding official lacked the authority, or believed that he lacked the authority, to mitigate the proposed removal regardless of any argument or evidence that the appellant presented in reply to the proposal notice....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's argument fails for two reasons. First, the provisions of Management Directive 1100.75-3 and the accompanying Handbook, rather than chapter 75 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code, govern disciplinary actions against TSA employees. <span class="Italic">Buelna v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 5 n.2 (2014); <span class="Italic">see</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 114(n), 40122(g)(2). The Handbook provides that the agency generally will take the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors into account when issuing disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 33. However, the Handbook provides that the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors do not apply to certain offenses for which removal is required, including the "[r]efusal to submit to TSA-ordered drug or alcohol testing." Accordingly, we find that if the deciding official had declined to consider any mitigating factors in this case, he did so in accordance with the law.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The Handbook provides for an exception to the mandatory removal policy. The deciding official testified to his awareness of the exception.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we find that the deciding official's testimony indicates he understood that if he had concluded that the appellant should not have been removed due to some exculpatory or mitigating reason, he would have sent such information to his supervisors to make a determination on what to do. We find that his testimony is consistent with the scope of his authority under the agency's rules for a mandatory removal offense, such as refusal to submit to alcohol testing, and that the appellant received a meaningful opportunity to invoke all of the discretion afforded by agency rules. Although due process requires that "a deciding official must possess authority to take or recommend action, due process does not require 'unfettered discretion to take any action he or she believes is appropriate' or require 'consider[ation of] alternatives that are prohibited, impracticable, or outside of management's purview.'" <span class="Italic">Calhoun v. Department of the Army</span>, 845 F.3d 1176, 1179 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (quoting <span class="Italic">Rodgers v. Department of the Navy</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 559, &#x00B6; 6 (2015)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Williams v. DHS</span>, AT-0752-11-0391-I-1 (NP 11/8/2011), said of performance cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">TSA may discipline screener personnel notwithstanding the provisions of 5 U.S.C. ch. 75, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over adverse actions filed by such personnel. <span class="Italic">See Brooks v.

Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 388 F.3d 1380, 1382-83 (Fed. Cir. 2004).
