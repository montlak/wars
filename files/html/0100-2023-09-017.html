<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-18"><span class="space">a.</span> Indefinite Suspension; Enforced Leave</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An indefinite suspension may be appealed at the onset, but the appellant may also decide that the suspension is appropriate when initiated and await future developments that require his reinstatement. The appellant may await the outcome of an indictment and, if disposition of the criminal case is favorable, file an appeal to obtain reinstatement (assuming that no appeal was earlier filed to contest the indefinite suspension). A delay following the dismissal of the indictment or acquittal was tolerated after the appellant attempted to obtain the voluntary agreement of the agency to reinstate him. <span class="Italic">Hofmann v. USDA</span>, 31 MSPR 399, 401 (1986) ("[A]ppellant should not be foreclosed from challenging the continuing nature of the suspension now because he recognized that an earlier challenge would waste his, the agency's, and the Board's time and resources[.] "); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 22, 25 (1993) (forgiving an "untimely" appeal from indefinite suspension when the appeal was filed after the date that the appellant believed the suspension should have been concluded; citing <span class="Italic">Hofmann</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board expanded the <span class="Italic">Hofmann</span> analysis in <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 22, 24-26 (1993), with additional comments concerning jurisdiction over indefinite suspensions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has long recognized that an indefinite suspension that is valid when imposed, may nonetheless become improper in light of later developments. Specifically, the Board has ruled that an indefinite suspension must terminate upon the occurrence of an ascertainable condition subsequent. <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 12 MSPR 12, 17 (1982); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Jarvis v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 45 MSPR 104, 111 (1990) (where an agency has relied solely on an indictment to establish its original indefinite suspension, and the only condition subsequent is the resolution of the criminal charges, it is unreasonable to continue the suspension after the date the indictment is dismissed, and appellant is entitled to back pay for such a period). The Board has further found that an order sustaining a suspension explicitly or implicitly mandates that the agency move expeditiously in terminating the suspension upon the occurrence of the condition subsequent, and that an agency's failure to do so may be brought before the Board by filing a petition for enforcement under 5 CFR 1201.181<span class="Italic">. Martin</span>, 12 MSPR at 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the Board lacks an order to enforce because the appellant did not appeal the imposition of the suspension action. Nonetheless, we find that the "appellant should not be foreclosed from challenging the continuing nature of the suspension now because he recognized that an earlier challenge would waste his, the agency's, and the Board's time and resources..." <span class="Italic">Hofmann v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 31 MSPR 399, 401 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hofmann</span> the agency indefinitely suspended the appellant because of an outstanding indictment against him, and the appellant subsequently withdrew his initial petition for appeal on the ground that he lacked a good-faith defense. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 400-401. Over two months after the effective date of the suspension, the indictment was dismissed, but the agency neither returned the appellant to duty nor instituted other disciplinary proceedings against him. <span class="Italic">Hofmann v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 42 MSPR 453, 454 (1989). Three months later, the appellant petitioned for "enforcement" of the initial decision dismissing his earlier appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 455. The administrative judge dismissed the petition on the grounds that there had been no decision on the merits and that there was therefore nothing to enforce. The Board, however, in granting his petition, stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]ppellant's petition for enforcement should be interpreted as a petition for appeal of his allegedly improper suspension. Moreover, under the facts of this case, we find that good cause exists for the delay in filing the petition for appeal. Specifically, we note that appellant promptly notified the agency that the indictment against him had been dismissed and allowed the agency a reasonable amount of time to cancel the suspension. When the agency failed to take action, appellant pursued the matter with the Board in a manner consistent with prior Board cases involving indefinite suspensions. Thus, to the extent that petition is untimely, we find good cause to waive the Board's regulatory time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Hofmann v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 31 MSPR 399, 401 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the appellant here also acted properly in awaiting the disposition of his criminal charge, and the agency's decision on whether to reinstate him, before bringing his appeal. Indeed, as he argues, until these events transpired, he had nothing to appeal, in that the initial imposition of the suspension was proper.[*] He promptly filed his appeal on October 1, 1992, two weeks after receiving written confirmation that the agency intended to return him to pay status effective September 5, instead of August 22, the day following his acquittal. We find that, under these circumstances, the appellant has established good cause for his untimely filing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ALONZO_DA075209013_OPINION_AND_ORDER_253126.pdf">4 MSPB 262</a>, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980).<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;The appellant's situation here is clearly distinguishable from one in which the untimeliness of an appeal to the Board is owing to an appellant's initial failure to realize he had grounds for such an action. The Board has found that this circumstance does not constitute good cause for an untimely filing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Burkhalter v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 190, 192 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 956 F.2d 1173 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There remains a question, however, as to whether the entire suspension is properly considered the action being appealed, as opposed to merely the last fourteen days of it. Under the latter view, the appellant's appeal would be timely, having been filed within 20 days following the effective date of the action (5 CFR 1201.22(b)), but the Board would lack jurisdiction to review the matter as it would represent a suspension of less than 15 days. 5 USC 7512. In <span class="Italic">Lester v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 57, 59 (1991), the Board found that the timeliness of an appeal of an indefinite suspension is measured from the effective date of the suspension itself, and not from any subsequent parceling of this suspension. We therefore find that an appeal of an indefinite suspension takes as its action the entire suspension, rather than any discrete portion of it. In the present case, we similarly find that, though the subject matter of the instant appeal is limited to the last fourteen days of his suspension, the appeal nevertheless relates to the entire suspension for jurisdictional purposes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">White</span> was extended, in turn, by <span class="Italic">Peyton v. DOJ</span>, 62 MSPR 113, 116-17 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has further found that an Order sustaining a suspension explicitly or implicitly mandates that the agency move expeditiously in terminating the suspension upon the occurrence of the condition subsequent, and that the agency's failure to do so may be brought before the Board by filing a petition for enforcement under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.181<span class="Italic">. White</span>, 58 MSPR at 24; <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 10 MSPB 568, 12 MSPR 12, 20 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Board lacks an order to enforce because the appellant did not appeal the imposition of the suspension action. Nonetheless, as we held in <span class="Italic">White</span>, the appellant should not be foreclosed from challenging the continuing nature of the suspension at the time she contends it has become improper because she chose not to challenge a prior valid suspension. <span class="Italic">White</span>, 58 MSPR at 24.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this instance, the appellant allowed the agency the opportunity to cancel the continuing suspension when she formally requested back pay. However, when the agency denied her request in writing, the appellant promptly pursued the matter with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, even though the appellant's petition for appeal requested back pay for the entire period of her suspension, whereas her petition for review requests back pay only for the continuation of the suspension after the dismissal of the charges, we find that her appeal of the denied back pay necessarily subsumes the request for the post-dismissal period, as well as the pre-dismissal period. We thus find no reason not to extend our holding in <span class="Italic">White</span>, where the appellant only requested back pay for the post-dismissal period, to these circumstances. Accordingly, the appellant should not be foreclosed from challenging the continuation of the suspension because of her failure to specifically argue on petition for appeal the denial of the post-dismissal back pay. <span class="Italic">White</span>, 58 MSPR at 24. <span class="Italic">Cf. <span id="Page_879"></span>Lester v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the appellant here acted properly in awaiting the resolution of the criminal charge, and the agency's decision on when it would reinstate her, before bringing her appeal with respect to the post-dismissal period. She appears to have abandoned her claim as to the earlier period, and to the extent she has not, she fails to show error in the administrative judge's finding concerning it. The appellant promptly filed her appeal within the twenty days allowed for filing a new appeal, after receiving a written confirmation that the agency did not intend to reinstate her from the date of the dismissal of the charges....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">McCardle v. EEOC</span>, SF-0752-15-0496-I-1 (NP 1/6/2023), noted the need for the agency promptly to conclude an indefinite suspension based on an employee's fitness, when the fitness concerns are resolved through medical evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that the Board's role in an appeal alleging an impermissible continuation of an indefinite suspension is limited to reviewing whether the condition subsequent identified by the agency occurred and whether the agency acted within a reasonable amount of time to terminate the suspension following the satisfaction of the condition subsequent. <span class="italic">Rhodes v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 487 F.3d 1377, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2007). For the reasons described in the initial decision, we agree with the administrative judge that, even if the indefinite suspension was valid when imposed, the agency was required to terminate the suspension once it received the detailed FFD narrative report because the appellant satisfied the condition subsequent identified in the proposal notice. Indeed, the deciding official, who was also the agency official responsible for determining if and when the appellant could return to work, conceded in her deposition that the doctor who wrote the FFD report performed psychological testing, answered all of the questions that the agency proffered in its medical questionnaire, and concluded that the appellant was not a threat to himself or others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency asserts that it was justified in continuing the suspension beyond its receipt of the FFD report because it "discovered" during this period that the appellant had "engaged in repeated and serious misconduct," which ultimately led to his removal. Any new information obtained by the agency during this period may have justified additional action against the appellant, but it does not justify the agency's refusal to terminate the indefinite suspension upon satisfaction of the condition subsequent.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an indefinite suspension must have a condition subsequent, i.e., there must be an event or circumstance that will cause the agency to terminate the suspension. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cooper v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 5 (1999).

<p class="Body-Text">An appeal from enforced leave may present a question of whether the appeal should be filed at the onset of the leave or after the 14th day has passed. The Board opted for the latter approach. The appellant appeals once the enforced leave has continued long enough so that it equates to a suspension of a duration within the Board's jurisdiction. Agency notice and due diligence in appealing enforced leave were reviewed, <span class="Italic">Dancy-Butler v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 80 MSPR 421, 423-28 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-7 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the appellant, the agency's Internal Revenue Service hired her in September, 1983, and it assigned her to work during the night shift in late 1994. The appellant alleged that she was diagnosed with hypertension and severe headaches in mid-1995, and that she could receive treatment for these conditions only from 5:30 <small>A.M.</small> to 9:00 <small>A.M.</small> The appellant requested a transfer to the day shift, but on September 8, 1995, the agency denied this request. According to her petition for review, the appellant attempted to work on the night shift until December, 1995, when she was physically unable to withstand it. A memorandum submitted by the agency confirmed that the appellant stopped reporting for work in December, 1995. While the appellant was absent, she continued to submit medical documentation to support her request for a transfer, including a January 4, 1996 letter from her doctor describing her condition and requesting a shift change. On March 21 and April 26, 1996, <span id="Page_880"></span>the agency denied the appellant's subsequent requests for reassignment to the day shift. On June 25, 1996, the agency granted the appellant's request for a leave of absence through January 4, 1997, with a starting date retroactive to January 7, 1996. However, the appellant did not return to work in January, 1997, and by April, 1997, she had retained the services of an attorney to represent her in requesting her reinstatement and back pay. On May 1, 1997, the agency provided the appellant with Internal Revenue Service Form 10060, Request for Reasonable Accommodation. Upon the appellant's submission of the completed form, accompanied by a letter from her doctor identical to the letter he provided on January 4, 1996, the agency reassigned the appellant to the day shift, and she reported for work on June 23, 1997.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Timeliness</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an employee who initiated his own absence requests to return to work within certain medical restrictions, and if the agency is bound by the Rehabilitation Act to accommodate the medical condition and to allow the employee to return, the agency's failure to reasonably accommodate the employee becomes a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See Schultz v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 78 MSPR 159, 161-64 (1998). Such a suspension is appealable to the Board once it extends for more than 14 days. 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2), 7513(d). When the agency does not make an express decision to suspend an employee for more than 14 days, the time in which the appellant may file a timely appeal begins to run when the appellant has been absent for more than 14 days. <span class="Italic">Greek v. U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service</span>, 78 MSPR 470, 474 (1998). According to the appellant, her constructive suspension began when the agency failed to reasonably accommodate her medical restrictions on January 7, 1996. Thus, according to the appellant's version of the events, the filing period began to run on January 21, 1996. At the time, Board regulations stated that appellants who file appeals raising issues of prohibited discrimination "may either file a timely complaint of discrimination with the agency or file an appeal with the Board within 30 days after the effective date of the agency action being appealed." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154 (1997). The record indicates that the appellant did not file a complaint of discrimination with the agency. Therefore, in order to be timely, the appellant would have had to submit her appeal to the regional office by February 20, 1996. Because the appellant did not submit her appeal until December 23, 1997, the administrative judge properly issued an order that provided the appellant an opportunity to show good cause why her appeal should not be dismissed as untimely....&#8197;Because the record is fully developed on the issue of timeliness, we will decide this issue without remanding the appeal to the regional office. <span class="Italic">See Chudson v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 71 MSPR 115, 118 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 132 F.3d 54 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Evidence in the record demonstrated that the appellant's attorney was aware of the basis for the appellant's appeal on April 16, 1997. On that date, he sent a letter to the agency in which he stated that the agency should have reasonably accommodated the appellant by reassigning her to the day shift, and he also requested back pay from January 7, 1996. When the appellant filed her appeal in late December, 1997, more than 23 months had elapsed since the agency denied the appellant's request to return to work within certain medical restrictions, and more than 8 months had elapsed since the appellant's attorney articulated the basis for the appellant's appeal. In response to the administrative Judge's timeliness order, the appellant's attorney alleged that the agency disregarded his representation of the appellant, thereby directly causing the delay in filing the appeal. Even if we were to accept this allegation as true, the appellant's attorney failed to explain how the agency's disregard caused the delay. Although he claimed that neither the agency nor the appellant informed him that the agency had reinstated the appellant until sometime after the fact, because the agency reinstated the appellant more than 14 days after it denied her original request to return to work within certain medical restrictions, the appellant's subsequent reinstatement did not affect the Board's jurisdiction or the appellant's right to file an appeal over her constructive suspension claim. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 MSPR 417, 419-20 (1998). Furthermore, even if the attorney intended to wait to determine how the agency would respond to his letter before advising the appellant to file an appeal with the Board, a decision to deal directly with the agency rather than to file an appeal with the Board does not demonstrate good cause for the delay. <span class="Italic">See Fredrick v. Department of Justice,</span> 76 MSPR 477, 480 (1997); <span class="Italic">Singleton v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 MSPR 339, 343 (1996) (an attempt to resolve an adverse action outside of an appeal to the Board does not excuse a late filing).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's attorney also alleged that the agency committed harmful error by not advising the appellant of her appeal rights. Assuming that the appellant was entitled to notice of her appeal rights,[3] the appellant failed to establish that she otherwise "acted promptly and within allowable time limits once [s]he was aware of the basis of [her] claim." <span class="Italic">Gordy v. Merit Systems</span> <span class="Italic">Protection Board,</span> 736 F.2d 1505, 1508 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Although the appellant's attorney responded to the administrative Judge's timeliness order by asserting that "[i]t took us until the latter part of 1997 to realize what the Agency had done and to articulate a position for [the appellant]," this assertion is inconsistent with his April 16, 1997 letter to the agency in which he articulated the basis for the appellant's appeal. An appellant who is not advised of her appeal rights must still demonstrate that she exercised due diligence in discovering and pursuing her appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See Martin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 MSPR 611, 616 (1996); <span class="Italic">Krizman v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 MSPR 233, 239-40 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 77 F.3d 434 (Fed.

Even if we would have been inclined to excuse the appellant's delay while she was proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, she has not shown good cause for the 8 month delay between the date when her attorney was aware of the basis for her appeal and the date on which she filed her appeal. <span class="Italic">See Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 MSPB 493, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981) (the appellant is responsible for the errors of her chosen representative). In light of the length of the delay, the appellant's failure to adequately explain the delay between April 16, 1997 and December 23, 1997, and the appellant's failure to exercise due diligence to discover and pursue her appeal rights, we find that the appellant has not shown good cause for the delay. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal as untimely filed. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;An employee is not entitled to notice of her appeal rights from a presumably voluntary employee-initiated action until she puts the agency on notice that she considers the action to be involuntary, or the circumstances show that the agency knew or should have known facts indicating that the action was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 MSPR 594, 597 (1995). In this case, the appellant never informed the agency that she considered her absence involuntary. In his letter of April 16, 1997, the appellant's attorney alleged that the agency involuntarily transferred the appellant to the night shift, but he did not allege that the agency initiated her placement on leave. In addition, an agency's failure to notify an employee of her appeal rights may be insufficient to establish good cause for the delay in filing an appeal if the right to appeal the action was not made clear until after the challenged employment action was taken. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 989 F.2d 1164, 1168 (1993). The Board did not issue the decision in <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 78 MSPR 159 (1998), the case that established that the agency's denial of reasonable accommodation could result in a constructive suspension, until after the appellant filed her appeal.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Donovan v. MSPB</span>, 204 Fed. Appx. 887, 889-90 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), without substantial analysis of MSPB law on when the appeal period begins to run for enforced leave, may have implied that the period for filing the appeal begins with the enforced leave begins. The court did not consider that an appeal on the first day of enforced leave would be premature if the Board lacks jurisdiction until a suspension exceeds 14 days:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 24, 2005, Mr. Donovan filed a second "enforced leave" appeal. In that appeal, he contended that he had been constructively suspended since September 29, 2004. The administrative judge assigned to that appeal directed Mr. Donovan to submit evidence and argument to show that he was constructively suspended during that time and thus that his appeal was within the Board's jurisdiction. Mr. Donovan responded that he had informed the Postal Service "as early as September 2004" that he was available for work within his medical restrictions, yet the agency had not allowed him to resume work. In response to that submission, the agency moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and for untimeliness. The administrative judge then directed Mr. Donovan to show cause why his appeal should not be dismissed for untimeliness, inasmuch as the alleged constructive suspension had begun in September 2004 and his appeal was not filed until April 2005.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After Mr. Donovan filed his response, the administrative judge found that he had not alleged that he had made any oral or written request to return to work before late January 2005. Mr. Donovan asserted that he had been told by an agency official on January 25 and 26, 2005, that he could not return to work until "an accommodation review panel had been completed." Based on that assertion, the administrative judge concluded that "any period of enforced leave would have commenced" on about January 25, 2005. Noting that Mr. Donovan's appeal was not filed until April 24, 2005, the administrative judge found that it was not filed within the 30-day period for appealing to the Board from an adverse agency action such as a suspension. The administrative judge noted that the delay in filing the appeal was substantial and that Mr. Donovan failed to show either that he was unaware of the timely filing requirement or that there were any circumstances beyond his control that prevented <span id="Page_881"></span>him from timely filing his appeal. Instead, Mr. Donovan argued that his appeal should not be dismissed as untimely because an earlier appeal "would waste his, the agency's, and the Board's time and resources." Finding that explanation an inadequate excuse for an untimely filing, the administrative judge ruled that Mr. Donovan had failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that he acted with due diligence or ordinary prudence in filing his appeal in a timely manner. Accordingly, the administrative judge dismissed Mr. Donovan's appeal for untimeliness. Mr. Donovan now seeks review by this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted, in the case of an untimely appeal, the appellant has the burden of proving that good cause existed for the delay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). The administrative judge analyzed the factors bearing on the good-cause inquiry and concluded that Mr. Donovan failed to establish good cause for the untimeliness of his appeal. We review that determination for an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Mendoza v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) ("We have often stated that whether the regulatory time limit for an appeal should be waived based upon a showing of good cause is a matter committed to the Board's discretion and this court will not substitute its own judgment for that of the Board."). We find no abuse of discretion here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge listed the factors bearing on the issue of good cause: the length of the delay, whether the appellant was notified of the time limit for filing the appeal, whether there were circumstances beyond the control of the appellant that affected his ability to comply with the time limit, the degree to which negligence by the appellant has been shown, circumstances that might show that the neglect was excusable, a showing of unavoidable casualty or misfortune, and, if the appellant has shown good cause for the delay, the extent and nature of the prejudice to the agency that would result from waiver of the time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge observed that Mr. Donovan had not been notified of the time limits for filing an appeal, such notification is not required in a case such as this one, which involves constructive action by the agency rather than actual agency action, such as a suspension or removal. <span class="Italic">See Carpenter v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 111 F.3d 118, 119-20 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Mueller v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 76 F.3d 1198, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Moreover, the administrative judge noted that Mr. Donovan, who was represented by counsel, did not assert that he was unaware of the timely filing requirement. Indeed, the administrative judge specifically found that Mr. Donovan knew of the timely filing requirement based on his involvement in several prior Board actions. In the absence of any challenge to that factual finding, we decline to overturn it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the administrative judge, Mr. Donovan argued that he had not filed his appeal promptly because he was waiting to see if the agency would accommodate his medical restrictions with an appropriate assignment. As the administrative judge noted, however, once the agency took action that constituted a constructive suspension, the time for his appeal began to run. He was not entitled to wait to see if his request for an accommodation would be resolved at some time in the future and to decide when to take an appeal based on his own decision as to when the agency had taken too long to act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the two-month delay in filing the appeal was a substantial delay and that Mr. Donovan had shown no circumstances beyond his control that prevented him from timely filing his Board appeal. Under the circumstances, we hold that the Board did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Mr. Donovan failed to satisfy his burden of showing good cause for the untimeliness of his appeal. We therefore uphold the Board's decision dismissing his appeal as untimely.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Sikes v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 2022 MSPB 12, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (2022), involved an indefinite suspension during a clearance review. The suspension began on June 18, 2015. On August 16, 2016, the appellant received a favorable security determination, and he then was informed he was eligible to return to work. He returned to duty of August 29, 2016. For the 13 days from the determination and return to work, appellant was involved in some training and he was on LWOP, but it was unclear whether the training was work-related. An appeal ensued; the AJ dismissed it because the LWOP period was 13 days, below the Board's usual jurisdictional threshold for a suspension. On PFR, the Board sent the appeal back for adjudication. The Board determined it would measure its jurisdiction over the suspension by considering its duration from start to finish:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...By regulation, an indefinite suspension ends with the occurrence of the pending conditions set forth in the notice of action. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402. The parties do not dispute that the condition subsequent that should have ended the indefinite suspension occurred when the appellant's access to classified information was restored on August 16, 2016. When a suspension continues after the condition subsequent that would terminate it, the continuation of the suspension is a reviewable agency action separate from the imposition of the suspension itself. <span class="italic">Rhodes v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 487 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Both the imposition of an indefinite suspension--and the continuation of that suspension after the condition subsequent--concern the same personnel action; thus, the appeal of the continuation of a suspension relates to the entire suspension for jurisdictional purposes. <span class="italic">White</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 25-26; <span class="italic">see also Rhodes</span>, 487 F.3d at 1382 (recognizing that the Board treats an agency's failure to end an indefinite suspension as a separately reviewable action from the imposition of the indefinite suspension, although both matters involve the same personnel action). As such, the length of the entire indefinite suspension is considered in determining if the Board has jurisdiction over the continuation of an indefinite suspension, regardless of whether the subject matter of an appeal concerning the continuation of an indefinite suspension is a suspension of 14 days or fewer. <span class="italic">White</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 25-26. Here, although the appeal concerned the improper continuation of the indefinite suspension for no more than 13 days, the entire indefinite suspension lasted over 14 days and is within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's role in an appeal alleging an improper continuation of an indefinite suspension is to ascertain whether the condition subsequent identified by the agency has occurred and whether the agency acted within a reasonable amount of time to terminate the suspension following the satisfaction of the condition subsequent. <span class="italic">Sanchez v. Department of Energy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 9 n.2 (2011). Here, there is no dispute that the identified condition subsequent, the restoration of the appellant's access to classified information, occurred. The issue is whether the agency acted within a reasonable amount of time to end the suspension once the appellant's access to classified information was restored.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, on August 16, 2016, the same day that DOD CAF issued a favorable security determination for the appellant, the agency contacted the appellant to advise him that he could return to work. The existing record reflects that the appellant asked instead to return to duty on August 29, 2016, to complete a training period he had begun. The record does not appear to indicate the nature of the training and whether it was work-related. The agency ultimately retroactively returned the appellant to duty on August 16, 2016, but carried him in an LWOP status through August 29, 2016.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, whether the agency acted within a reasonable amount of time to end the suspension once the appellant's access to classified information was restored may be affected by, among other things, whether the training the appellant requested to complete was work-related, and whether the agency was obligated to place him in a paid duty status during that training. <span class="italic">Cf. Boudousquie v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 10 (2006) (holding that an agency's misleading statements that the appellant must request LWOP may support a finding of a constructive suspension). Thus, the appellant's apparent request to continue training before his return, and the agency's placement of him on LWOP in response, may implicate whether the agency acted within a reasonable amount of time to end the suspension once the appellant's access to classified information was restored.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not have an opportunity to respond to the declarations regarding training that the agency submitted on the day the record closed. <span class="italic">See Schucker v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 401 F.3d 1347, 1355-56 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (noting the Board's longstanding policy of affording the parties an opportunity to submit rebuttal evidence); <span class="italic">White v. Department of the Army</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 63, 66-67 (1990) (closing of the record must comport with the basic requirements of fairness and notice, including an opportunity to respond to submissions of the parties); <span class="italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.59(c)(2)</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A delay of two years was reason to dismiss an enforced leave appeal when the appellant knew enough about Board litigation processes to have filed an earlier appeal, despite lack of notice from the agency of his Board appeal right, <span class="Italic">Gribcheck v. USPS</span>, 97 MSPR 355, 358-60 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11 (2004) (affirmed, <span class="Italic">Gribcheck v. MSPB,</span> 145 Fed. Appx. 359 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's placement on enforced leave for more than fourteen days, pending the agency's inquiry into his physical ability to perform, is a disciplinary-type action within the Board's jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Once an agency learns, however, that the employee is fit for duty, the employee must be restored immediately to active duty status. <span class="Italic">Sarratt v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 405 &#x00B6; 6 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_882"></span>In his initial decision, the administrative judge found that, when the agency continued to bar the appellant from work, it made a decision that he could not safely return to his position of record. According to the administrative judge, this decision was in fact a new action requiring new procedures under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, including a notice of proposed action, an opportunity to respond, and written notice of suspension. Because the agency failed to provide these procedures, the administrative judge reversed the action, ordering the agency to return the appellant to a pay and duty status effective March 6, 2000, the date that the agency received Dr. Kausch's report. He did not address the timeliness of such an appeal. We do so here and find that the appeal was untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The necessary starting place for any determination of whether an appeal has been timely filed is to identify the deadline for timely filing. <span class="Italic">O'Leary v.</span> <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 87 &#x00B6; 7 (2000). Even if we accept the agency's argument that it was not required to end the enforced leave as soon as the appellant submitted to the fitness-for-duty examination, it was obligated to return him to work when it had sufficient information to permit the appellant to return to duty. <span class="Italic">See Sarratt</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 405 &#x00B6; 8. We find that the agency determined in July 2000 that the appellant could return to work in a different capacity and identified an appropriate position, when it offered him a position consistent with Dr. Kausch's recommendation. Yet, it failed to return him. At that point, an action appealable to the Board had occurred, and the appellant should have filed an appeal within 30 days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that, while ensuing events may provide good cause for some of the subsequent delay in filing, they do not excuse the entire period of more than 2 years. Between July and October 2000, the appellant and the agency were in communication about his return. It may be that the appellant was led to believe that the agency would return him to work without further resort to the Board. However, on October 25, 2000, Butwin presented the appellant with a written agreement that made his return contingent on his acceptance of a settlement agreement that would resolve his appeals that were pending before the administrative judge, and his equal employment opportunity complaints, grievances, and a suit in Federal district court. The appellant clearly indicated that this term was unacceptable. The fact that the appellant declined to accept the October 25, 2000 settlement agreement did not relieve the agency of its obligation to return the appellant to work immediately after determining that he was fit for duty. We find that the agency's offer of a position contingent on his withdrawing his appeal constitutes a clear indication that the agency would not fulfill its obligation to end the enforced leave and return him to work, even though it had determined that it could safely do so. The appellant has not explained why he did not file an appeal at that time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the appeal of the agency's formal March 27, 1999 notice of placement on enforced leave was still pending on review with the Board in October 2000, and the appellant may have been confused about the necessity for filing another appeal. If he had prevailed in that appeal, the Board would have ordered the agency to return him to work. Even assuming that this circumstance warrants excusing his delay until the Board issued its January 25, 2001 decision sustaining the placement on enforced leave, it does not explain why he waited almost 2 more years to challenge the agency's failure to end the enforced leave. Although the appellant received no specific notice of the requirement that he appeal in a timely fashion after the agency determined not to end the enforced leave, he was well aware of the Board's appeal process, having participated in it very recently. His lengthy delay does not exhibit the diligence required under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See McClendon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 250 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2002) (when the agency does not provide required notice of the time limits for filing an appeal, the appellant need not show that he was diligent in attempting to discover his appeal rights; rather, he must show diligence in filing an appeal after learning that he could).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather than seek a remedy with the Board, the appellant pursued grievances, filed an unfair labor practice charge, and sought review of the Board's decision with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. He also filed suit in state court, which was removed to Federal district court. Not all of these actions involve the exact issue of whether the agency proved that placement on enforced leave since March 1999 was warranted, but they raise issues and facts related to the fitness-for-duty examination, the agency's handling of the matter, and the enforced leave. Pursuit of a remedy in a different forum does not excuse a late-filed appeal. <span class="Italic">See Zamot v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 475 &#x00B6; 6 (2002) (the appellant's decision to wait for a decision from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission before filing a petition for review with the Board does not constitute good cause), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 332 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
