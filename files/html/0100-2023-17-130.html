<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-128"><span class="space">b.</span> Contract Interpretation</h5>
<p class="noindent">Over the years, FLRA members have alternately accepted or rejected or modified arbitration awards based on the FLRA majority's view of whether an arbitrator properly interpreted and applied the contract. In the private sector, much deference is given to arbitrators' contract interpretations when their awards are challenged in court. In the federal sector, most arbitration awards that are reviewed by FLRA cannot be reviewed in court, the exception being an award that involves a ULP finding. An award that involved a ULP component was reviewed in court, and that court determined that the FLRA was providing too little deference to the arbitrator's contract interpretation. FLRA was instead itself construing the meaning of the contract. The D.C. Circuit tried to steer the FLRA on a path paralleling private sector precedent stemming from the <span class="Italic">Steelworkers' Trilogy</span> of decisions issued decades ago by the Supreme Court, <span class="Italic">NWSEO v. FLRA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200731295">966 F.3d 875</a>, 876-82 (D.C. Cir. 2020):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Weather Service Employees Organization (the "Union") challenges an order of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (the "Authority") overturning an arbitrator's award in a dispute arising from a termination provision of a collective bargaining agreement (the "CBA") between the Union and the National Weather Service (the "Employer"). When the Employer invoked that provision, the Union objected that the conditions of the termination provision had not been met and that the termination amounted to both a breach of the CBA and an unfair labor practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (a)(5), because the Employer repudiated the agreement. An arbitrator agreed with the Union that the Employer's termination was a breach of the CBA, but ruled that the Employer did not commit an unfair labor practice. Both parties filed exceptions. The Authority ruled that there was neither a breach of the CBA nor an unfair labor practice and vacated the Arbitrator's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union petitions for review, contending that the Authority acted contrary to law by improperly substituting its judgment for that of the Arbitrator on the breach issue, and acted arbitrarily and capriciously by disregarding its precedent in determining that the Employer did not commit an unfair labor practice. For the following reasons, we grant the petition for review as to the Authority's disposition of the breach claim and deny the petition as to the Authority's disposition of the unfair labor practice claim. In vacating the Arbitrator's breach determination, the Authority's thorough, substantive review failed to conform to the proper standard of review. In contrast, the Authority's explanation of the unfair labor practice issue, although terse, was not arbitrary or capricious. We remand the case to the Authority for any further proceedings that may be necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Employer is a federal agency whose non-management employees are represented by the Union. Since the 1980s, the Employer and the Union had been parties to a CBA. Article 29, &#x00A7; 1 of the CBA provides that the agreement shall continue from year to year unless one party notifies the other of its desire to renegotiate. Article 29, &#x00A7; 3 of the CBA provides that the CBA "will remain in effect for 90 calendar days from the start of formal renegotiation or amendment" of the CBA. NWS-NWSEO Collective Bargaining Agreement art. 29, &#x00A7; 3 (Oct. 25, 2001). Once the 90-day period has ended, either party may unilaterally terminate the CBA if "an agreement has not been reached and the services of neither [the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service] nor the [Federal Service Impasses Panel] have been invoked." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (the "Service") is "an independent agency that maintains a roster of arbitrators who handle labor-management disputes," <span class="Italic">Fed. Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 927 F.3d 514, 516 (D.C. Cir. 2019), responsible for "provid[ing] services and assistance to agencies and exclusive representatives in the resolution of negotiation impasses," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7119(a). If the agency and union are unable to "resolve a negotiation impasse," notwithstanding the assistance of the Service or third-party mediators, they may request the assistance of the Federal Service Impasses Panel (the "Panel"), an entity within the Authority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span id="page_1882"></span>&#x00A7; 7119(b). Its function "is to provide assistance in resolving negotiation impasses between agencies and exclusive representatives," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7119(c)(1), and it is empowered to "recommend to the parties procedures for the resolution of the impasse" or otherwise assist the parties in resolving the impasse themselves or, if that fails, "take whatever action is necessary and not inconsistent with [the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act] to resolve the impasse," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7119(c)(5). In sum, the "Panel serves as a mechanism of last resort in the speedy resolution of disputes after negotiations have failed." <span class="Italic">Council of Prison Locals v. Brewer</span>, 735 F.2d 1497, 1501 (D.C. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In July 2015, the Employer notified the Union of its desire to renegotiate the CBA. In November 2015, the parties had their first face-to-face negotiation over the ground rules that would govern renegotiation of the CBA. When the parties could not agree on ground rules, the Employer requested the assistance of the Panel. Finally, after further unsuccessful negotiation sessions, the Panel conducted a mediation in October 2016 during which the parties were able to agree on ground rules.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In January 2017, the Employer sent its first round of substantive bargaining proposals to the Union. The Union, concerned that the negotiations "would not go smoothly," preemptively requested the assistance of the Service, and then responded to the Employer with its own substantive proposals in March 2017. In April 2017, the parties met face-to-face to negotiate over their substantive proposals. In July 2017, the Employer provided written notice terminating the CBA. It notified the Union that "CBA terms continue as past practices and remain in effect until there is a new agreement"; so until that time the Employer would "maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, operating under the procedures and policies" of the CBA. Email from David Murray, Senior Adv'r to the Employer, to Dan Sobien, Union Pres. (July 21, 2017).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union objected that because the services of the Service and the Panel had been invoked during negotiations, Article 29, &#x00A7; 3 of the CBA prohibited the Employer from unilaterally terminating the CBA. As such, the Union argued, the Employer's termination was a breach of the CBA. The Union also argued that by unilaterally cancelling the agreement, the Employer had committed an unfair labor practice by repudiating the CBA in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (a)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties submitted their dispute to arbitration.&#x2003;An Arbitrator understood that the parties' dispute over whether the Employer had breached the CBA turned on when "formal renegotiation" of the CBA began. The Union submitted that it began when the parties started ground-rule negotiations in November 2015. If that were the case, then the Employer's November 2015 invocation of the Panel occurred within the 90-day window established by Article 29, &#x00A7; 3, and the termination of the agreement was improper. On the other hand, the Employer submitted that "formal renegotiation" did not begin until the parties began face-to-face negotiation of the substantive provisions of the new CBA, in April 2017. If that were the case, then the Union's July 2017 request for a mediator from the Service to attend the negotiations was outside the 90-day window, and the termination of the agreement was permitted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator first determined that the Employer breached the CBA by terminating the agreement in July 2017.&#x2003;His decision rested on an analysis of when "formal renegotiation" of the CBA began. He agreed with the Union's interpretation that such renegotiation began when the parties commenced ground-rule negotiations in 2015, stating that the parties' ground-rule negotiation "contain[ed] all of the indicia of 'formal' negotiations whether 'substantive' or not," pointing to the extended bargaining process, the fact that the parties ultimately agreed to a six-page memorandum of understanding on ground rules, and the participation of both the Service and the Panel. Dec. &#x0026; Award at 16 (Mar. 1, 2018). Second, the Arbitrator determined that the Employer had not committed an unfair labor practice. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 18. Although the Employer had breached the CBA when it announced it was terminating the CBA, the Arbitrator reasoned that the Employer had continued to honor its terms in practice by, for example, following the arbitration procedures provided in the CBA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In order to remedy the breach of the CBA, the Arbitrator ordered that the Employer rescind its notice of CBA termination and return to the contractual <span class="Italic">status quo ante. Id</span>. at 20. Both parties filed exceptions to the Arbitrator's Award, with the Employer contending that the Award failed to "draw its essence" from the CBA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority granted the Employer's exception, ruling that "the Arbitrator's reliance on several extraneous factors--on how long those preliminary negotiations dragged on, the length of the [memorandum of understanding], and the fact that [the Service] and [the Panel] had to get involved in those negotiations--led to conclusions about when 'formal' renegotiations began that are not consistent with the undisputed purpose and intent of Article 29, &#x00A7; 3." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Weather Serv. Emps. Org</span>., 71 F.L.R.A. 380, 382 (2019) ("Order"). The Authority stated that because the purpose of Article 29, &#x00A7; 3 was to "incentiv[ize] the <span class="Italic">completion</span> of negotiations, ground-rules bargaining--which merely marked the <span class="Italic">start</span> of negotiations--could not, and did not, trigger the ninety-day period for 'formal renegotiations' under Article 29." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In agreeing with the Arbitrator's determination that the Employer had not committed an unfair labor practice, the Authority rested on its determination that the Employer had not breached the CBA. The Authority stated that the Employer informed the Union that it would abide by the terms of the terminated CBA as past practices and had done so, such that "all provisions of the CBA remain in effect to date." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 383. Further, because the Employer's termination of the CBA rested on a "reasonable interpretation" of Article 29, &#x00A7; 3, the Authority stated that there would have been no unfair labor practice even if the Employer had breached the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority vacated the Arbitrator's Award. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. One Member dissented, taking the position that the Arbitrator had correctly interpreted "formal renegotiation" and that the Employer's termination of the CBA amounted to a repudiation and thus an unfair labor practice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 384-86 (Member DuBester, dissenting). The Union petitions for review of the Authority's Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union challenges the Authority's Order, contending that the Authority's searching, substantive review of the Arbitrator's interpretation of the CBA term "formal renegotiation" is contrary to the standard of review that the Authority must apply in reviewing an arbitrator's decision. The court's review, in turn, is limited to determining whether the Authority's Order is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When reviewing an arbitrator's award, the Authority is required to apply a similarly deferential standard of review to that a federal court uses in private-sector labor-management issues. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a)(2); <span class="Italic">see Am. Fed'n Gov't Emps., Council 220</span>, 54 F.L.R.A. 156, 159 (1998). The Authority may vacate an arbitrator's award only when it is "contrary to any law, rule, or regulation," or "on other grounds similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a). "Congress thus appears to have intended that in the area of arbitral awards the Authority would play in federal labor relations the role assigned to district courts in private sector labor law." <span class="Italic">Griffith v. FLRA</span>, 842 F.2d 487, 491 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The Authority has acknowledged that it "has consistently reviewed arbitral awards under the deferential standards adopted by the Federal courts." <span class="Italic">Social Security Admin</span>., 63 F.L.R.A. 691, 692 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the Authority reviews an arbitrator's decision highly deferentially, only to ensure that the arbitrator's award "draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement." <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of Am. v. Enterprise Wheel &#x0026; Car Corp</span>., 363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960). "[A]s long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority," the Authority may not reverse the arbitrator's award even if it is "convinced he committed serious error." <span class="Italic">United Paperworkers Int'l Union v. Misco, Inc</span>., 484 U.S. 29, 38 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Authority's sole inquiry under the proper standard of review should have been whether the Arbitrator was "even arguably construing or applying the [CBA]." <span class="Italic">Misco</span>, 484 U.S. at 38. Whether the Arbitrator correctly interpreted the CBA was beyond the scope of the Authority's review. Yet the Authority engaged in a much more searching review of the Arbitrator's decision than permitted by law. The Arbitrator recognized that the core dispute with respect to the Union's breach-of-CBA complaint involved a "determination as to when the parties' commenced 'formal renegotiation' of their CBA." More than three pages of his decision analyzed the meaning of the CBA term "formal renegotiation," and thus was "construing or applying the [CBA]," <span class="Italic">Misco</span>, 484 U.S. at 38. In concluding that the Arbitrator's Award "fails to draw its essence" from the CBA, the Authority offered no analysis other than to explain that Arbitrator's interpretation of "formal renegotiations" was incorrect. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Weather Serv. Emps. Org</span>., 71 F.L.R.A. at 381-82. The Authority's view that the Arbitrator erred in his interpretation of the CBA is inadequate to warrant vacatur of the Arbitrator's Award. Because the Authority failed to apply the correct standard of review, it acted contrary to law. The Authority's response, that its decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because its interpretation of Article 29, &#x00A7; 3 was not unreasonable, is beside the point. The issue is not whether the Authority reasonably construed Article 29, &#x00A7; 3 but rather whether it acted lawfully by applying the proper standard of review to the <span class="Italic">Arbitrator's</span> interpretation of Article 29, &#x00A7; 3.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to <span class="Italic">NWSEO</span>, in that decision, the court analyzed an Authority decision finding that an arbitrator's award failed to draw its essence from the collective-bargaining agreement at issue.[42] In the underlying decision, the Authority found that the arbitrator--in interpreting the phrase "formal renegotiations" as that term was used in the agreement and for purposes of determining whether the agency violated that agreement--improperly relied on several extraneous factors.[43] The Authority concluded that the arbitrator's interpretation manifested an infidelity to his obligation as the arbitrator of the dispute and, thus, the Authority granted the essence exception.[44]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[44]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NWSEO II</span>, 71 FLRA at 382.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its petition to the court challenging that decision, the union argued, as relevant here, that the Authority's review of the arbitrator's interpretation of the agreement was "contrary to the standard of review that the Authority must apply in reviewing an arbitrator's decision."[45] The court granted the union's petition, concluding that the Authority "acted contrary to law" because it "failed to apply the correct standard of review" to the essence exception.[46]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[46]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 882.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, the court held that, "[w]hen reviewing an arbitrator's award, the Authority is required to apply a similarly deferential standard of review to that a federal court uses in private-sector labor-management issues."[47] Applying this principle to essence exceptions, the court concluded that the Authority must review arbitrators' interpretations' "highly deferentially,"[48] explaining that the Authority's "sole inquiry" under the "proper standard of review" for essence exceptions should be "whether the [a]rbitrator was 'even arguably construing or applying the [collective[-]bargaining agreement].'"[49] More specifically, the court explained that, when applying this standard, "'[a]s long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract'...the Authority may not reverse the arbitrator's award even if [the Authority] is 'convinced [the arbitrator] committed serious error.'"[50]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Applying the principles articulated in <span class="Italic">NWSEO</span>, we conclude that <span class="Italic">DODEA</span> erred by granting the Agency's essence exception. In rejecting the Agency's timeliness argument concerning the Union's grievance, the Arbitrator recognized that "[u]nder Article 12, [Section] 5(C) of the CBA, the Union is required to file its grievance within 45 days after the incident or occurrence giving rise to the grievance." However, after finding "no record evidence that the Agency was at all tentative about its decision to implement DPMAP," the Arbitrator concluded that "the Union satisfied that requirement" and "did not have to wait until DPMAP went into actual effect because the incident...giving rise to the grievance occurred on or about May 1, 2017, when the Agency announced it would be implementing DPMAP."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In granting the Agency's essence exception, DODEA concluded that the Arbitrator's "finding that the Agency's notification that it planned to implement DPMAP constituted the triggering event [for the grievance] d[id] not represent a plausible interpretation of the plain language of the parties' agreement."[53] On this point, <span class="Italic">DODEA</span> concluded that because Article 12, Section 5(C) "provides that the Union may file a grievance 'after the incident or occurrence giving rise to the grievance,'" the Agency's notification "could not be considered an 'incident or occurrence'" within the meaning of that provision because DPMAP's implementation had not yet occurred.[54]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[53]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">DODEA</span>, 71 FLRA at 766.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[54]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, this conclusion ignores that the Arbitrator <span class="Italic">applied</span> the plain language of this provision in finding the grievance was timely filed. Further, contrary to the principles set forth in <span class="Italic">NWSEO</span>, <span class="Italic">DODEA</span> fails to afford proper deference to the Arbitrator's finding that the "'incident...giving rise to the grievance' occurred...when the Agency announced it would be implementing DPMAP."[55] Accordingly, upon reconsideration of <span class="Italic">DODEA</span>, we deny the Agency's essence exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[55]&#x2003;Award at 13 (quoting Art. 12, &#x00A7; 5(C)). In the decision reviewed in <span class="Italic">NWSEO</span>, the Authority based its conclusion that the award failed to draw its essence from the parties' agreement upon its finding that the arbitrator misconstrued the term "formal negotiations" in the agreement. <span class="Italic">NWSEO II</span>, 71 FLRA at 382. As noted, the court reversed this conclusion because "the Authority's sole inquiry under the proper standard of review should have been whether the [a]rbitrator was 'even arguably construing or applying the [parties' agreement,'" and "[w]hether the [a]rbitrator correctly interpreted the [parties' agreement] was beyond the scope of the Authority's review." <span class="Italic">NWSEO</span>, 966 F.3d at 881 (quoting <span class="Italic">Misco</span>, 484 U.S. at 38). Applying this standard, the court concluded that the Authority's "view that the [a]rbitrator erred in his interpretation of the [parties' agreement] is inadequate to warrant vacatur of the [a]rbitrator's award." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 882.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In doing so, we emphasize that we are not eliminating the Authority's existing tests for analyzing essence exceptions. Under those tests, the Authority will find that an award fails to draw its essence from a collective-bargaining agreement when the appealing party establishes that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement.[56] As the Authority previously has stated, these tests are "[c]onsistent with" the notion that "the relevant question...is not whether the arbitrator erred--or even seriously erred--in interpreting the contract[,]" but "whether the arbitrator was 'even arguably construing or applying the contract.'"[57] In other words, the tests are consistent with <span class="Italic">NWSEO</span>. However, to the extent that other Authority decisions have applied those tests in a way that do not comport with <span class="Italic">NWSEO</span>, those decisions will no longer be followed.</p>
