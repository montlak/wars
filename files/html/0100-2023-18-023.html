<p class="noindent">A decision of FLRA's General Counsel (acting through a regional director) not to issue a ULP complaint is not judicially reviewable. <span class="Italic">Columbia Power Trades Council v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 671 F.2d 325, 327 (9th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1749 v. FLRA</span>, 842 F.2d 102, 104 (5th Cir. 1988) ("By analogy, the same result must obtain here, in regard to the public-sector counterpart to the NLRB. As is the case with the NLRB, the Authority's General Counsel has a role similar to that of a prosecutor, and his decision not to prosecute puts an end to the matter and is not reviewable, irrespective of the merits of the underlying unfair labor practice assertions. The General Counsel of the Authority having made his decision not to issue an unfair labor practice complaint, there is no "final order" of the Authority that confers jurisdiction on this court.").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Martinez v. Smith</span>, 768 F.2d 479, 480 (1st Cir. 1985), noted the lack of appellate jurisdiction to review the decision of the General Counsel not to issue a ULP complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plaintiff acknowledges in his brief that generally courts have no jurisdiction to review a decision of the FLRA to refuse to issue an unfair labor practice complaint.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Turgeon v. Federal Labor Relations Authority,</span> 677 F.2d 937, 940 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Columbia Power Trades Council v. U.S. Department of Energy,</span> 671 F.2d 325, 327 (9th Cir. 1982). <span class="Italic">See also Turgeon, supra</span> at 939-940 and <span class="Italic">Columbia Power Trades, supra</span> at 326-327 (analogizing FLRA to NLRB), and cases pertaining to NLRB's exclusive jurisdiction over General Counsel's decision not to issue a complaint, <span class="Italic">e.g., Saez v. Goslee,</span> 463 F.2d 214 (1st Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> 409 U.S. 1024, 93 S. Ct. 466, 34 L. Ed.2d 316 (1972), <span class="Italic">Rockford Redi-Mix Co., Inc. v. Zipp,</span> 632 F.2d 30, 32, 32 n.5 (7th Cir. 1980), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub. nom. Countryman v. Zipp,</span> 450 U.S. 929, 101 S. Ct. 1388, 67 L. Ed.2d 362 (1981). The plaintiff argues instead that the district court has jurisdiction under exceptions to this general rule that would permit a federal court to exercise jurisdiction when the General Counsel has violated express statutory requirements, <span class="Italic">see Leedom v. Kyne,</span> 358 U.S. 184, 188, 79 S. Ct. 180, 183, 3 L. Ed.2d 210 (1958) (NLRB) or has violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights, <span class="Italic">see Baker v. International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees,</span> 691 F.2d 1291, 1296 (9th Cir. 1982) (NLRB). We indicated in <span class="Italic">Saez v. Goslee, supra</span> at 215 (NLRB), that such exceptions may exist.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plaintiff's arguments fail, because he has not alleged any specific facts or cited any statutory or regulatory provisions which would show that the General Counsel violated any statutory requirements or any constitutional rights. To invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts, such allegations must clearly show that jurisdiction is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Bova v. Pipefitters &#x0026; Plumbers Local 60, AFL-CIO,</span> 554 F.2d 226, 228-229 (5th Cir. 1977). <span class="Italic">See also Baker, supra</span> at 1297; <span class="Italic">International Ass'n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO v.

<p class="noindent-1">...The Act provides that an aggrieved person may obtain judicial review in the appropriate court of appeals, with exceptions not here relevant, of "any final order of the Authority." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)....&#8197;This is the only judicial review provision in the Act. The Act affords the Authority no opportunity to review a decision of the General Counsel declining to issue an unfair labor practice complaint--it is only upon the issuance of a complaint by the General Counsel that the Authority is empowered to exercise its decision-making functions: conduct hearings, decide the merits of a complaint, and issue an appropriate remedial order....&#8197;Since the General Counsel has not issued a complaint, and the Authority has not acted at all in this case, it is clear that there is no "final order of the Authority" and hence no decision we can review pursuant to section 7123.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he General Counsel of the Authority must be accorded the same discretion with respect to issuance of unfair labor practice complaints as the General Counsel of the NLRB. Case law has established that the NLRB's General Counsel has unreviewable discretion in such matters....&#8197;<span class="Italic">NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &#x0026; Co.</span>, 421 U.S. 132, 138-39 (1975).</p>

Cir. 1992) (decision of General Counsel ordinarily unreviewable, even if error made in reasoning leading to decision not to issue complaint; remedy is request to General Counsel to reconsider decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">At least in the Ninth Circuit, there is an exception to the normal rule finding that the refusal of the General Counsel to issue a complaint is unreviewable. In <span class="Italic">Montana Air Chap. No. 29, ACT v. FLRA</span>, 898 F.2d 753, 756 (9th Cir. 1990), the General Counsel declined to issue a complaint after the union complained of a ULP as to the agency's refusal to accept a provision in the contract permitting civilian technicians to wear civilian attire while performing civilian duties. The complaint was not issued because the agency's actions were characterized as a "pure negotiability" issue. The district court refused to review the decision not to issue a complaint, and the case proceeded to the circuit court. The appellate court ruled in part that an agency error concerning its own jurisdiction is subject to judicial review:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...An agency's decision not to take enforcement action generally...is <span id="page_2535"></span>presumed to be immune from judicial review. <span class="Italic">Heckler v. Chaney</span>, 470 U.S. 821, 822 (1985). Specifically, the General Counsel's exercise of discretion not to file an unfair labor complaint generally is unreviewable....&#8197;The General Counsel's decision in this case, therefore, is presumptively unreviewable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Chaney</span>, however, suggested that discretionary nonenforcement decisions may be reviewable when "a refusal by the agency to institute proceedings [is] based solely on the belief that it lacks jurisdiction" or "where it could justifiably be found that the agency has 'consciously and expressly adopted a general policy' that is so extreme as to amount to an abdication of its statutory responsibilities."...&#8197;Similarly, the D.C. Circuit has recognized two exceptions to the general rule of unreviewability of agency nonenforcement decisions: (1) agency nonenforcement decisions are reviewable when they are based on a belief that the agency lacks jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">International Longshoremen's Ass'n v. National Mediation Bd</span>, 785 F.2d 1098, 1100 (D.C. Cir. 1986); and (2) an agency's statutory interpretations made in the course of nonenforcement decisions are reviewable, <span class="Italic">International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &#x0026; Agricultural Implement Workers v. Brock</span>, 783 F.2d 237, 245 (D.C. Cir. 1986)....&#8197;The General Counsel's opinion letters strongly indicate that his decision was based solely on the belief that he did not have jurisdiction to issue an unfair labor practice complaint. We also find that the General Counsel promulgated a new interpretation of a statute and of FLRA regulations in the course of his decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e believe that a decision by the FLRA's General Counsel not to issue an unfair labor practice complaint is reviewable when that decision is based solely on his belief that he lacks jurisdiction to issue such a complaint, thereby refusing to exercise the functions assigned him by the Federal Labor Relations Act....</p>
<p class="noindent">The court advanced in <span class="Italic">Montana Air Chap. No. 29</span> to consider whether ULP procedures could encompass the failure of an agency to adopt a negotiated provision and, finding that the actions could constitute a ULP, reversed the decision of the district court. The court concluded that the General Counsel had to consider the ULP charge, although the court made clear that it was not dictating what result should occur after the review.</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit reaffirmed <span class="Italic">Turgeon</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and impliedly declined to embrace the Ninth Circuit analysis in <span class="Italic">Montana Air Chap. No. 29</span>, when it again refused to consider a judicial challenge to the General Counsel's refusal to issue a ULP complaint, <span class="Italic">POPA v. FLRA</span>, 128 F.3d 751, 752-53 (D.C. Cir. 1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Association seeks review of the General Counsel's decision not to issue a complaint pursuant to the judicial review provision of the Labor-Management Relations Act, under which aggrieved persons can obtain judicial review of "any final order of the Authority" (with exceptions not pertinent here). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a) (1988). In <span class="Italic">Turgeon</span>, this court declared flatly that it has no jurisdiction to review decisions by the General Counsel of FLRA declining to issue unfair labor practice complaints because such decisions do not constitute final orders of the agency<span class="Italic">. See Turgeon</span>, 677 F.2d at 938-39. In an attempt to establish that this court has jurisdiction despite <span class="Italic">Turgeon</span>, the Association emphasizes the Supreme Court's intervening decision in <span class="Italic">Heckler v. Chaney</span>, 470 U.S. 821, 105 S. Ct. 1649, 84 L. Ed.2d 714 (1985). Yet that case <span class="Italic">narrowed</span> the class of decisions subject to review: the main proposition established in <span class="Italic">Heckler</span> was that agency decisions not to take enforcement actions are generally not subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 830-35, 105 S. Ct. at 1655-58. The Association, however, focuses on a footnote in <span class="Italic">Heckler</span> in which the Supreme Court noted that it did not decide whether an agency's discretionary decision not to exercise its enforcement authority might be subject to review if the decision was based either on the agency's conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction or on a general policy "so extreme as to amount to an abdication of [the agency's] statutory responsibilities." <span class="Italic">Heckler, </span>470 U.S. at 833 n.4, 105 S. Ct. at 1656 n.4 (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Adams v. Richardson</span>, 480 F.2d 1159, 1162 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (in banc)). The Ninth Circuit cited this footnote as a basis for its conclusion in <span class="Italic">Montana Air Chapter No. 29 v. FLRA</span>, 898 F.2d 753 (9th Cir. 1990), that the Supreme Court had endorsed such exceptions to the general rule that discretionary agency enforcement decisions are not reviewable. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 756. Thus, the Association contends, this court can review decisions of the General Counsel not to issue unfair labor practice complaints when such decisions are the result of a misguided agency policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lest there be any lingering confusion, we write to make clear that, even after <span class="Italic">Heckler v. Chaney, </span>it remains the law of this circuit that a decision of the General Counsel of FLRA not to file a complaint is not judicially reviewable given that the statute provides for review only of decisions of the Authority. In <span class="Italic">Heckler, </span>the Supreme Court dealt with jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act and, specifically, the provision that provides that "agency action...committed to agency discretion by law" is not subject to judicial review under the act. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 701(a)(2) (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Heckler, </span>470 U.S. at 828-35, 105 S. Ct. at 1654-58. Nothing in <span class="Italic">Heckler</span>--and especially not the Association's favored footnote--affects the reviewability of decisions of the General Counsel under the Labor-Management Relations Act, and this court has already held that the statute does not allow judicial review of the General Counsel's decision not to issue unfair labor practice complaints. <span class="Italic">See Turgeon</span>, 677 F.2d at 939. Nor could the Association claim the Administrative Procedure Act as an independent source of jurisdiction: agency actions are not reviewable under that act if other "statutes preclude judicial review," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 701(a)(1), and <span class="Italic">Turgeon</span> definitively establishes such preclusion by the Labor-Management Relations Act. Both this court and the Supreme Court have declared, even after <span class="Italic">Heckler</span>, that decisions of the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board whether to issue complaints are not subject to review by this court, <span class="Italic">see NLRB v. United Food &#x0026; Commercial Workers Union Local 23, </span>484 U.S. 112, 117-33, 108 S. Ct. 413, 417-26, 98 L.

Accordingly, because the court is without jurisdiction to review the General Counsel's decision not to issue an unfair labor practice complaint, we dismiss the petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Rizzitelli v. FLRA</span>, 212 F.3d 710, 711-13 (2d Cir. 2000), found the Second Circuit joining the others in rejecting a judicial challenge to the General Counsel's refusal to issue a ULP complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Labor Relations Authority (the "Authority") moves to dismiss Samuel M. Rizzitelli's petition for review of a decision by the Authority's General Counsel not to issue an unfair labor practice complaint. We grant the Authority's motion and dismiss the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the General Counsel's decision was not a "final order of the Authority" that we are empowered to review pursuant to Section 7123(a) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute ("FSLMRS"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In July 1998, petitioner filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Authority's Boston Regional Office against the American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1661, and the American Federation of Government Employees, Second District (collectively, the "Union"). Petitioner charged that the Union breached its duty of fair representation in connection with two grievances he filed while employed as a corrections officer in the federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After investigating--and later re-investigating--petitioner's charge, the Regional Director of the Authority's Boston office declined to issue an unfair labor practice complaint. A letter from the Regional Director to petitioner gave two reasons for this decision: (i) the charge was untimely under Section 7118 of the FSLMRS, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118, because it was filed more than six months after the Union's alleged breach; and (ii) the charge was meritless because the evidence did not show that the Union treated petitioner arbitrarily or that it treated him differently than similarly situated employees whom it represented.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner appealed the Regional Director's decision to the Authority's General Counsel. The General Counsel denied the appeal, and petitioner thereafter sought review of the General Counsel's decision in this court. In response, the Authority filed the instant motion to dismiss, arguing that we lack subject matter jurisdiction over a decision by the Authority's General Counsel not to issue a complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7123(a) is the only judicial review provision in the FSLMRS. That Section provides, in pertinent part, that "[a]ny person aggrieved by any final order of the Authority...may...institute an action for judicial review of the Authority's order in the United States court of appeals in the circuit in which the person resides or transacts business." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a). According to petitioner, the General Counsel's decision not to issue a complaint should be deemed a "final order of the Authority." We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner's charge that the Union breached its duty of fair representation is properly characterized as an unfair labor practice charge under the FSLMRS<span class="Italic">. See Karahalios v. National Fed'n of Fed. Employees</span>, Local 1263, 489 U.S. 527, 532 (1989) ("[The FSLMRS] makes it clear that a breach of the duty of fair representation is an unfair labor practice...."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(b)(8) (providing that it is unfair labor practice for union to violate any FSLMRS provision); <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) ("An exclusive representative is responsible for representing the interests of all employees in the unit it represents without discrimination...."). In connection with charges of unfair labor practice, the Authority is empowered to resolve complaints--and hold hearings thereon--and issue appropriate remedial orders<span class="Italic">. See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(G); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(6)-(8). It is not, however, empowered to decide whether to issue an unfair labor practice complaint<span class="Italic">. See generally id</span>. &#x00A7; 7105 (enumerating Authority's powers and duties). That power is vested exclusively in the Authority's General Counsel,<span class="Italic"> see id.</span> &#x00A7; 7118(a)(1), and the Authority has no power to review the General Counsel's decision, either<span class="Italic">. See Turgeon v. Federal Labor Relations Auth.</span>, 677 F.2d 937, 938 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) ("The Act affords the Authority no opportunity to review a decision of the General Counsel declining to issue an unfair labor practice complaint....").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It was the General Counsel, therefore, not the Authority, that made the final decision not to issue a complaint on petitioner's unfair labor practice <span id="page_2536"></span>charge. There is thus no "final order of the Authority," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a), before us,[1] and we lack subject matter jurisdiction over the instant petition<span class="Italic">. See Patent Office Prof'l Ass'n v. Federal Labor Relations Auth.</span>, 128 F.3d 751, 753 (D.C. Cir. 1997) ("[A] decision of the General Counsel of FLRA not to file a complaint is not judicially reviewable given that the statute provides for review only of decisions of the Authority."), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 523 U.S. 1006 (1998); <span class="Italic">see also American Fed'n of Gov't Employees Local 1749 v.

<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;Our conclusion is further supported by analogy to the National Labor Relations Act ("NLRA"), 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 151-169.

As a general matter, this proposition is instructive in construing the FSLMRS because Congress intended the FSLMRS to be the public-sector counterpart to the NLRA and structured the respective authority similarly. <span class="Italic">See American Fed'n of Gov't Employees Local 1749 v.

More specifically, practice under the NLRA is apposite to the question before us here because the legislative history to the FSLMRS manifests Congress's intent to allocate decision making between the Authority and its General Counsel in the same manner that it has been allocated between the NLRB and the NLRB's General Counsel. <span class="Italic">See </span>S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 102 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2824 ("The General Counsel is intended to be autonomous in investigating unfair labor practice complaints....&#8197;Specifically, the Authority would neither direct the General Counsel concerning which unfair labor practices cases to prosecute nor review the General Counsel's determinations not to prosecute, just as the National Labor Relations Board does not exercise such control over its General Counsel."); H.R.

<p class="noindent-1">A physician and his labor union brought this lawsuit seeking review of a decision by the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA") not to issue an unfair labor practice complaint. The plaintiffs contend that the FLRA General Counsel's decision not to issue the unfair labor practice complaint relied on an incorrect interpretation of a statutory term and that the General Counsel improperly denied as untimely the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of the decision. As a result, the plaintiffs claim that the defendants--the Chairman of the FLRA and the FLRA General Counsel--violated their procedural and substantive due process rights under the United States Constitution and that they misapplied applicable law, acted beyond their established authority, and engaged in conduct that is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. As detailed below, since decisions by the FLRA General Counsel to issue or not to issue unfair labor practice complaints are not subject to judicial review, the Court dismisses the plaintiffs' non-constitutional claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. In addition, the Court grants summary judgment for the defendants on the plaintiffs' constitutional claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 16, 2010, the plaintiffs brought this action alleging two counts. In Count I, the plaintiffs allege that "[b]y refusing to consider the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration on the pretext of an untimely filing of the motion, [the defendants] deprived plaintiff Hussain of a property interest in continued employment as restored by the arbitrator's award" in violation of "the rights of plaintiffs to procedural and substantive due process of law and equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution." In Count II, the plaintiffs allege that by refusing to issue a complaint, the defendants "violated plaintiff Hussain's procedural and substantive due process rights as provided by the United States Constitution, misapplied applicable law, acted beyond their established authority, and engaged in conduct that is arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion by operation of law." The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief that would force the defendants to reinstate the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration as timely; declare that the plaintiffs' interpretation of the term "matter" as used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) is correct and binding on the General Counsel; and enjoin a particular attorney in the FLRA Office of General Counsel from further participation in the plaintiffs' case. Prayer for Relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 7, 2010, the defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Alternatively, the defendants move for summary judgment on the grounds that there are no material facts in dispute and judgment as a matter of law is warranted.</p>

Cir. 1997) (hereinafter, "<span class="Italic">POPA</span>") (<span class="Italic">citing Turgeon, </span>677 F.2d at 938-39); <span class="Italic">see also Laird v. FLRA, </span>No. 03-1015, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 9709, 2003 WL 211954881 (D.C. Cir. May 19, 2003) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) ("This court lacks jurisdiction to review a decision by the General Counsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority not to issue an unfair labor practice complaint."); <span class="Italic">Brookens v. FLRA,</span> No. 02-1281, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 115, 2003 WL 40485 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 3, 2003) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (same). Indeed, the D.C. Circuit's pronouncements emphasizing the non-reviewability of decisions of the FLRA General Counsel have been strikingly unequivocal. <span class="Italic">See POPA,</span> 128 F.3d at 753 ("Lest there be any lingering confusion, we write to make clear that...it remains the law of this circuit that a decision of the General Counsel of FLRA not to file a complaint is not judicially reviewable given that the statute provides for review only of decisions of the Authority.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties on both sides of this case agree on the general non-reviewability of the General Counsel's decisions not to issue an unfair labor complaint. The plaintiffs argue, however, that their claims are nonetheless reviewable by this Court under three purported exceptions <span id="page_2537"></span>to this general rule precluding judicial review of the General Counsel's decisions. The plaintiffs argue that the General Counsel's decision is reviewable because it is a jurisdiction-disclaiming agency decision, because it embodies an official agency interpretation of a statute, or constitutes an agency order that violates clear statutory mandates. The Court is not persuaded by these arguments and will therefore dismiss the plaintiffs' non-constitutional claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See POPA, </span>128 F.3d at 753.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">No "Disclaimer of Jurisdiction" Exception Applies to the Plaintiffs' Claims Against the FLRA </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plaintiffs argue that, although the General Counsel's enforcement decisions are generally non-reviewable, "if an agency's non-enforcement decision is based on the agency's decision that it does not have jurisdiction over the matter to be enforced, the jurisdictional basis of the non-enforcement decision is subject to judicial review." The plaintiffs argue that the D.C. Circuit's 1986 ruling in <span class="Italic">International Longshoreman's Association, AFL-CIO v. National Mediation Board </span>recognized an exception to the general non-reviewability of discretionary agency decisions where an agency's non-enforcement decision rests on a disclaimer of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (<span class="Italic">citing Int'l Longshoreman's Ass'n, </span>785 F.2d 1098, 251 U.S. App. D.C. 410 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (hereinafter, <span class="Italic">"ILA")). </span>While this exception may be available in other contexts, the D.C. Circuit indicated in its ruling in <span class="Italic">POPA </span>that this exception does not apply to decisions of the General Counsel about whether to issue complaints. <span class="Italic">See POPA, </span>128 F.3d at 753 &#x0026; n.1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">ILA, </span>the D.C. Circuit held that federal courts could review otherwise non-reviewable orders of the National Mediation Board, an agency that coordinates labor relations in the railroad and airline industry, if the orders in question found that the Board lacked jurisdiction over an application for mediation. <span class="Italic">ILA, </span>785 F.2d at 1101. <span class="Italic">ILA </span>reaffirmed a similar holding in a previous decision involving the National Mediation Board. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1100-1101 (<span class="Italic">citing Air Line Dispatchers Ass'n v. Nat'l Mediation Bd.,</span> 189 F.2d 685, 89 U.S. App. D.C. 24 (D.C. Cir. 1951), <span class="Italic">cert. denied, </span>342 U.S. 849, 71 S. Ct. 77, 96 L. Ed. 641 (1951)). The plaintiffs argue that this Court should extend the <span class="Italic">ILA</span> exception to decisions of the FLRA General Counsel not to issue a complaint, if those decisions are based on the conclusion that the General Counsel lacks jurisdiction to issue a complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The D.C. Circuit has indicated, however, that the <span class="Italic">ILA</span> exception does not apply to the General Counsel's decisions about whether to issue complaints. In <span class="Italic">POPA,</span> the plaintiff argued for a substantially similar exception to the non-reviewability of a decision of the FLRA General Counsel not to issue a complaint. Specifically, the plaintiff in <span class="Italic">POPA</span> pointed to a footnote in the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Heckler v. Chaney,</span> 470 U.S. 821, 105 S. Ct. 1649, 84 L. Ed. 2d 714 (1985), "in which the Supreme Court noted that it did not decide whether an agency's discretionary decision not to exercise its enforcement authority might be subject to review if the decision was based either on the agency's conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction or on a general policy 'so extreme as to amount to an abdication of [the agency's] statutory responsibilities.'" <span class="Italic">POPA,</span> 128 F.3d at 753 (<span class="Italic">quoting Heckler, </span>470 U.S. at 833 n.4). The <span class="Italic">POPA </span>plaintiff, citing this footnote in <span class="Italic">Heckler</span>, argued that the "court can review decisions of the General Counsel not to issue unfair labor practice complaints when such decisions are the result of a misguided agency policy." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">POPA </span>noted that the Ninth Circuit had relied on this footnote in <span class="Italic">Heckler</span> to endorse exceptions to the general rule that discretionary agency enforcement decisions are not reviewable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (<span class="Italic">citing Montana Air Chapter No. 29 v. FLRA, </span>898 F.2d 753 (9th Cir. 1990)).[8] The D.C. Circuit roundly rejected this argument in the FLRA context, explaining that "[b]oth this court and the Supreme Court have declared, even after <span class="Italic">Heckler, </span>that decisions of the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board whether to issue complaints are not subject to review by this court, and we now reaffirm the same for the General Counsel of FLRA." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Montana Air Chapter No. 29, </span>the Ninth Circuit relied on both <span class="Italic">Heckler</span> and the D.C. Circuit's ruling in <span class="Italic">ILA</span> to hold that the court did have jurisdiction to review a decision of the FLRA General Counsel not to issue a complaint. 898 F.2d at 756-57. The fact that the D.C. Circuit squarely addressed this Ninth Circuit decision and rejected it seriously undermines the plaintiffs' reliance on <span class="Italic">ILA </span>here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The D.C. Circuit further added: "Our reasoning is specific to the [Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute], and we thus do not question the cases in this circuit that allow judicial review of agency nonenforcement decisions in certain other contexts. Most importantly, we do not disturb this circuit's exceptions to the general rule, under <span class="Italic">Heckler,</span> that &#x00A7; 701(a)(2) of the Administrative Procedure Act precludes judicial review over nonenforcement decisions." <span class="Italic">POPA, </span>128 F.3d at 753 n.1 (<span class="Italic">citing, inter alia, ILA).</span> Accordingly, in reaffirming the rule that decisions of the FLRA General Counsel not to issue a complaint are not subject to judicial review, the D.C. Circuit specifically noted that the <span class="Italic">ILA</span> exception advanced by the plaintiffs here remains valid in other contexts, but does not apply to the General Counsel's decisions. Therefore, this Court is bound by Circuit precedent to hold that the<span class="Italic"> ILA </span>exception for jurisdiction-disclaiming agency orders does not apply to decisions of the General Counsel of the FLRA regarding whether to issue complaints.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;Moreover, even if the <span class="Italic">ILA </span>exception were to apply to decisions of the FLRA General Counsel regarding whether to issue complaints, it is not clear that the decision challenged by the plaintiffs in this case is the type of jurisdiction-disclaiming order that could fall within the exception. Indeed, the defendant contends "the plaintiffs' suggestion that the General Counsel made a determination regarding the FLRA's jurisdiction is misplaced." The Court does not reach this issue, however, since it has concluded that the exception is inapplicable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The General Counsel's Decision Is Not Reviewable Merely Because It Embodied a Statutory Interpretation </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plaintiffs' second argument is that this Court may review the General Counsel's decision not to issue a complaint because this Circuit permits unreviewable agency decisions to be reviewed where a legal challenge focuses on an agency's announcement of a substantive statutory interpretation. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pls.' Mem. at 15-16 (<span class="Italic">citing Int'l Union, United Auto., Aerospace &#x0026; Agr. Implement Workers of America v. Brock, </span>783 F.2d 237, 251 U.S. App. D.C. 239 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (hereinafter,<span class="Italic"> "Int'l Union").</span> This argument fares no better for the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Int'l Union, </span>the D.C. Circuit held that "an agency's statutory interpretation was presumptively reviewable even if announced in the context of a non-enforcement decision." <span class="Italic">Crowley Caribbean Transp., Inc. v. Pena, </span>37 F.3d 671, 675, 308 U.S. App. D.C. 374 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (<span class="Italic">citing Int'l Union, </span>783 F.2d at 245-46). Subsequent D.C. Circuit and Supreme Court decisions have substantially narrowed the viability of the <span class="Italic">Int'l Union </span>exception, however. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 676. As the D.C. Circuit explained in <span class="Italic">Crowley,</span> the Supreme Court has "squarely reject[ed] the notion of carving reviewable legal rulings out from the middle of non-reviewable actions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (<span class="Italic">citing ICC v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng'rs, </span>482 U.S. 270, 107 S. Ct. 2360, 96 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1987)). <span class="Italic">Crowley </span>makes clear that while "an agency's statement of a general enforcement policy may be reviewable for legal sufficiency where the agency has expressed the policy as a formal regulation after the full rulemaking process or has otherwise articulated it in some form of universal policy statement," an individual non-enforcement decision that does not express a broad, general enforcement policy ordinarily should not be treated as a substantive agency statutory interpretation that rebuts the presumption against the non-reviewability of agency enforcement decisions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 676-77. Based on the Court's review of the record here, there is no indication that the General Counsel's decision not to issue a complaint in the plaintiffs' case reflected the sort of broad enforcement policy that could give rise to judicial review under <span class="Italic">Crowley.</span> Further, the D.C. Circuit's ruling in <span class="Italic">POPA</span> suggests that--like the <span class="Italic">ILA </span>exception--the <span class="Italic">Crowley</span> exception is also not available in the context of the FLRA General Counsel's decisions about whether to issue complaints. <span class="Italic">See POPA,</span> 128 F.3d at 753 n.1 (explaining that the D.C. Circuit's holding about the non-reviewability of the General Counsel's nonenforcement decisions is specific to the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute and does not disturb the holdings of other cases that have identified areas in which judicial review of agency nonenforcement decisions may be permitted, including, <span class="Italic">inter alia, Crowley, </span>37 F.3d at 674-77). Accordingly, the plaintiffs cannot obtain judicial review of the General Counsel's decision not to issue a complaint based upon any purported statutory interpretations embodied in that decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The </span>Leedom v. Kyne<span class="Italic"> Exception Does Not Apply To The Plaintiffs' Claims </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plaintiffs state that the Regional Director and General Counsel made "statutory interpretation errors" in their decision not to issue a complaint. In<span class="Italic"> Leedom v. Kyne, </span>358 U.S. 184, 79 S. Ct. 180, 3 L. Ed. 2d 210 (1958), the Supreme Court created a "narrow," "extremely limited" exception that confers federal jurisdiction even where Congress is understood generally to have precluded review. <span class="Italic">Griffith v. FLRA, </span>842 F.2d 487, 492, 268 U.S. App. D.C. 491 (D.C. Cir. 1988). This narrow exception may enable judicial review where an agency has clearly acted contrary to a statute, for example, by disregarding "a specific and unambiguous statutory directive." <span class="Italic">Griffith,</span> 842 F.2d 487 at 493, 268 U.S. App. D.C. 491 (<span class="Italic">citing United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 400 v. NLRB, </span>694 F.2d 276, 279, 224 U.S. App. D.C. 156 (D.C. Cir. 1982)). "Garden-variety errors of law or fact [committed by an agency] are not enough" to invoke <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plaintiffs state that they do not "rely solely or principally upon [<span class="Italic">Leedom</span>] as their basis of review of the instant case." They have not argued in detail in their brief that <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> should apply nor have they identified any clear and unambiguous statutory provision that the General Counsel has violated. To the extent that the plaintiffs do rely on <span class="Italic">Leedom,</span> however, that reliance is misplaced because "[g]arden-variety errors of law or fact," such as those alleged by the plaintiffs here, are not enough to invoke the <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Constitutional Claims</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the plaintiffs' non-constitutional claims must be dismissed for lack <span id="page_2538"></span>of subject matter jurisdiction, the plaintiffs' constitutional claims are reviewable in federal court. <span class="Italic">See Griffith,</span> 842 F.2d at 494 (finding judicial review provisions of the FSLMRS did not preclude plaintiff's as-applied constitutional due process challenge).[10] Accordingly, the Court turns to the merits of the plaintiffs' constitutional claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;D.C. Circuit authority subsequent to <span class="Italic">Griffith</span> has, in some instances, questioned the continuing vitality of some of the premises underlying the rationale for <span class="Italic">Griffith</span>'s conclusion. <span class="Italic">See Lepre v. Dep't of Labor, </span>275 F.3d 59, 67, 348 U.S. App. D.C. 280 (D.C. Cir. 2001). <span class="Italic">Griffith</span>'s ultimate conclusion that the FSLMRS's jurisdictional provisions do not bar review of constitutional claims has not been overruled, however. Accordingly, the Court considers the plaintiffs' Constitutional claims on the merits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plaintiffs contend that the arbitrator's award restored a constitutionally protected property interest in continued employment to Dr. Hussain. The plaintiffs argue that Dr. Hussain has been deprived of this property interest by the General Counsel's purportedly erroneous statutory interpretations and by the General Counsel's failure to accept the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration as timely filed. According to the plaintiffs, these alleged deprivations infringed the plaintiffs' rights to procedural and substantive due process of law in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Court disagrees and rules that summary judgment on the plaintiffs' constitutional claims should be granted for the defendants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"The first inquiry in every due process challenge is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a protected interest in 'liberty' or 'property.' Only after finding the deprivation of a protected interest do we look to see if the government's procedures comport with due process." <span class="Italic">Gen. Elec. Co. v. Jackson, </span>610 F.3d 110, 117, 391 U.S. App. D.C. 299 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (citation omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Griffith, </span>842 F.2d at 495-501 (upholding district court's rejection of due process challenge to FLRA's disposition of plaintiff's claim because plaintiff had no protected property interest in an annual within-grade pay increase). Even assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, however, that plaintiff Hussain has a protected property interest in this case and that the plaintiffs are correct that the General Counsel's decision not to issue a complaint was based upon a legal error, "a mere violation of law does not give rise to a due process claim." <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps., AFL-CIO, Local 446 v. Nicholson, </span>475 F.3d 341, 353, 374 U.S. App. D.C. 332 (D.C. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to prevail on a substantive due process claim, the plaintiffs would need to demonstrate "an act of grave unfairness," such as "a deliberate flouting of the law," and the plaintiffs in this action have not done so. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quotations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Tri Cnty. Indus., Inc. v. District of Columbia, </span>104 F.3d 455, 459, 322 U.S. App. D.C. 412 (D.C. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Elkins v. District of Columbia, </span>527 F. Supp.2d 36, 49 (D.D.C. 2007) ("The government's infringement of the recognized property interest must constitute a grave unfairness: Inadvertent errors, honest mistakes, agency confusion, even negligence in the performance of official duties, do not warrant redress.") (<span class="Italic">quoting Silverman v. Barry,</span> 845 F.2d 1072, 1080, 269 U.S. App. D.C. 327 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). Any legal errors in the General Counsel's decision not to issue a complaint on the plaintiffs' unfair labor practice charge or in the calculation of the timeliness of the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration would not rise to the level of substantive due process violation. To the extent the plaintiffs allege the denial of the motion for reconsideration as untimely was pretextual or in bad faith, that allegation is not supported by specific facts or factual allegations that would create a triable issue of fact on that question. Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment to the defendants on the substantive due process claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Summary judgment is also appropriate on the plaintiffs' procedural due process claim. Generally, procedural due process "requires notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case." <span class="Italic">Pearson v. District of Columbia,</span> 644 F. Supp.2d 23, 46 (D.D.C. 2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 377 F. App'x 34 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (<span class="Italic">citing Mathews v. Eldridge,</span> 424 U.S. 319, 333, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976)). The plaintiffs' allegations here show that they availed themselves of the procedures specified for requesting that the General Counsel issue an unfair labor practices complaint. The FLRA Regional Director considered the plaintiffs' unfair labor practice charge and issued a decision declining to file a complaint. The plaintiffs appealed this decision to the General Counsel, who upheld the decision not to file a complaint. As with the plaintiffs' substantive due process claim, even assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that the agency made an error in calculating the timeliness of the motion for reconsideration, that would not suffice to state a claim for violation of procedural due process. <span class="Italic">See Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps., Local 2741 v. District of Columbia,</span> 689 F. Supp.2d 30, 35-36 (D.D.C. 2009) (dismissing procedural due process claim where plaintiffs failed to "allege facts that suggest they were deprived of any process due to them" and noting that "[e]ven assuming the [defendant's] actions have run awry of [certain] statutes...such violations do not amount to a constitutional violation. 'A mere violation of law does not give rise to a due process claim.'") (<span class="Italic">citing Nicholson, </span>475 F.3d at 353). Accordingly, the Court will grant summary judgment for the defendants on the procedural due process claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;Conclusion</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons detailed above, the plaintiffs' non-constitutional claims are dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and summary judgment is granted for the defendants on the plaintiffs' constitutional claims. An appropriate Order will issue.</p>
