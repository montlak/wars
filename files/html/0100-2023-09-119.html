<p class="Body-Text">For an action to be well and truly canceled, the employee must be restored to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante.</span> He must be placed as nearly as possible in the same situation that he would have been in had the action rescinded never occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="italic">Daujotas v.

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 96 MSPR 193, 196 &#x00B6; 6 (2004) (restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> will generally entail return of the employee to his former position or in a position substantially equivalent in scope and status to his former position; the same grade, pay, and tenure; back pay, removal of all references to the adverse action from the appellant's personnel file; proper documentation of the restoration from the agency and an opportunity for the appellant to respond to the agency's submissions); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 120, 125 (1997) (an individual "cannot be left in a worse position as a result of a rescission of an action under the concept of <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>"); <span class="Italic">Thomas v.

Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">Mann v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[17]&#x2003;While the agency is generally required to reinstate the employee to his former position, where the agency claims that it has a strong overriding interest for not placing the employee in the identical position, the Board will analyze the legitimacy of the agency's proffered rationale in order to determine if it is sufficient to justify not returning the employee to his former position. <span class="Italic">See Saal v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency's representation that it intended to provide <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief as to 11 dates on which it incorrectly charged the appellant military leave was sufficient to render the appeal moot as to those dates. The administrative judge further found that any claim that the agency did not actually provide <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief was properly raised in a future petition for enforcement. This analysis is incorrect for three reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the dismissal of an appeal as moot amounts to a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Rojas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 400, 404 (1996) (when an agency completely rescinds the action appealed, the Board has no jurisdiction over the rescinded action), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Fernandez</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 5 n.1; <span class="Italic">Mobery v. Department of the Navy</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 110, 113 (1994) (when an agency completely rescinds an adverse action after an appeal is filed, the appeal is rendered moot and the Board is divested of jurisdiction). The Board lacks the authority to order enforcement if it lacks jurisdiction over the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hunter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 7, &#x00B6; 11 (1999) (absent a Board order with which the agency was directed to comply, the Board lacks the authority to order enforcement); <span class="Italic">Sellman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 145, 151 (1994) (absent a settlement agreement that has been entered into the record for enforcement purposes, the Board may not order enforcement in a matter that has not been adjudicated on the merits); <span class="Italic">Bell v. Department of the Army</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 86, 91 (1991) (because the Board lacked jurisdiction over the underlying appeal, it could not enter the parties' settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes). Therefore, where an appeal is dismissed as moot, the Board lacks the authority to adjudicate a petition for enforcement alleging that the appellant has not received the relief to which she is entitled. <span class="Italic">See Parkin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2006) (because the underlying appeal was properly dismissed as moot, the Board lacked jurisdiction to order compliance); <span class="Italic">McCulley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 207, 210 (1992) (where, after the appeal was dismissed as moot, a dispute arose as to whether the agency had afforded all appropriate relief, the Board was without authority to order the agency to provide relief because the Board cannot order compliance in a matter that has not been heard on the merits or resolved through a settlement agreement entered into the record); <span class="Italic">Sarver v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 685, 689 (1985) (where the underlying appeal was dismissed as moot upon the agency's incomplete cancellation of the appealed action, the Board lacked authority to order enforcement; rather, the proper remedy was to retain jurisdiction over the appeal and adjudicate it on the merits).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant could bring a petition for enforcement if she had any claims about the relief provided by the agency after the appeal was dismissed as moot, the administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Hill v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 453, 456, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 104 F.3d 376 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table), and <span class="Italic">Hatler v.

Although those cases support the administrative judge's conclusion, we find that the analysis underlying those cases is legally unsound for the reason noted above. Therefore, we OVERRULE those decisions and others that conclude that a petition for enforcement can be brought after an appeal is dismissed as moot.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an AJ receives an agency motion to dismiss an appeal as moot, the AJ will order the appellant to respond with evidence and argument as why the appeal is not moot. A substantive response from the appellant will likely lead the AJ to require evidence from the agency supporting its position, and the AJ will not likely dismiss the appeal as moot until the agency has met the appellant's objections. There may be several rounds of status conferences or orders until the mootness issue is resolved. If the appeal is dismissed as moot, the appellant properly challenges the improper dismissal for mootness through a petition for review, <span class="Italic">Stempihar v. USPS</span>, 106 MSPR 115, 119-20 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10, 2007 MSPB 151 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision was also incomplete on its own terms, insofar as it informed the appellant that he could file a petition for enforcement at some future time, but failed to include the Board's customary notice of the procedures and deadline for obtaining compliance. Moreover, the initial decision was misleading; a decision dismissing an appeal as moot is <span class="Italic">not</span> enforceable by the appellant because it is not a decision on the merits in the appellant's favor. <span class="Italic">See Parkin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 7 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, when the appellant objected to having his appeal dismissed as moot, the administrative judge informed him, in essence, that he could return to the Board for additional proceedings if he was dissatisfied with the agency's actions. The administrative judge did not explain when such a future proceeding should be instituted, the appellant never took any actions indicating an intent to abandon his claim for lost overtime, and the appellant acted promptly in filing what he thought was a petition for enforcement but which must be deemed a petition for review in light of <span class="Italic">Parkin</span>. Under the unusual circumstances of this case, we find that the appellant has shown good cause for the untimeliness of his petition for review.</p>

Although we have no reason to doubt the agency's good faith in this appeal, the fact remains that the agency's good faith assurance that it <span class="Italic">will</span> provide relief is not evidence that it <span class="Italic">has provided</span> relief, and an appeal simply is not truly moot until all appropriate relief has been provided.</p>

Although the screenshots may evidence the agency's payment of back pay and interest, and the restoration of his leave balances, the description of the evidence is terse and does not appear complete.

<p class="Body-Text">If there is a back pay dispute, the Board is not to reject its jurisdiction through an unwarranted assumption that the appellant agrees with the agency's calculations. <span class="Italic">Moore v.

<p class="Body-Text">Although a case is moot if the agency rescinds the action against the employee and the appeal will be dismissed if the agency restores the appellant to his former position, the matter does not end with the reinstatement at the equivalent grade and pay; the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> must be completely restored. The <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> is not achieved by an immediate detail of the appellant to a materially different position for one of the same reasons supporting the appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">Sarver v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1029"></span>The Board's authority to issue enforcement orders is derived from 5 USC &#x00A7; 1205(a)(1) and (a)(2). Those sections provide the Board with authority to order an agency to comply with any order or decision issued by the Board in any matter within its jurisdiction. Implicit in this authority, however, is the notion that, absent a settlement, the Board will not enforce a compliance order against a party unless that party has had the opportunity to be heard on the merits of the underlying case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a). In this case, the agency did not have the opportunity to be heard on the merits of the underlying case before it was ordered to place appellant in a police officer position. To the extent that the agency did not have this opportunity, the Board's order was incorrect. The proper remedy in this case, as with other cases where the agency has unilaterally modified the appealed action without rescinding it, is to retain jurisdiction and adjudicate the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Ferguson, supra;</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Director contends that our decision to assert jurisdiction in this matter will have a damaging impact on management of the Federal workforce. Specifically, the Director believes that such a ruling would prohibit an agency from ever reassigning an employee after he is reinstated to his former position by the Board. Our holding in this case should not be read so broadly. We hold only that where an agency unilaterally cancels an appealed adverse action, a subsequent detail and reassignment based on one or more of the same grounds as the adverse action revives the Board's jurisdiction to hear the case. We do not reach the broader question of whether the Board would have jurisdiction over such a reassignment if it were taken for a reason unrelated to the appealed adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;On remand the presiding official should determine, along with any other relevant issues whether the appellant's reassignment is justified by the suitability charges listed in the agency's proposal notice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The point made in <span class="Italic">Sarver</span> is significant. The AJ does not order the agency that has canceled an action to do anything to resolve a dispute concerning restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>. The AJ will hold conference calls to determine progress toward that restoration, make suggestions, perhaps, but in the end, if the agency does not restore the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, the AJ has no choice but to proceed with adjudication of the appeal on the merits. To get to that point can be a very time-consuming process, as the AJ tries to convince the agency to do what is required, and then await evidence that necessary actions have been completed by the agency.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, if the appeal had been adjudicated and the appellant had prevailed, a Board order to cancel the suspension would have required the agency to place the appellant in a duty status, unless the agency could establish a strong overriding interest in keeping the appellant in an administrative leave status. <span class="Italic">See Sredzinski v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 571, &#x00B6; 8 (2007) (an appeal may be considered moot notwithstanding the agency's refusal to return the appellant to duty status only if the agency's refusal to do so is supported by a strong overriding interest). In this case, the appellant alleged that the agency did not return him to a duty status after it rescinded his placement on enforced leave, and the agency did not deny these allegations. In addition, the agency did not establish that it had a strong overriding interest in keeping the appellant in an administrative leave status. According to the proposal notice dated January 26, 2007, the agency originally placed the appellant on administrative leave and proposed to suspend him pending the completion of its investigation into the appellant's alleged misconduct. The agency did not attempt to rescind the appellant's placement on enforced leave until April 19, 2007, and it did not indicate that the investigation that served as the basis for his placement on administrative leave or enforced sick leave was still ongoing at that time. In addition, the instant appeal is distinguishable from those cases in which the Board has found an appeal moot despite an agency's failure to return the appellant to a duty status because such cases typically involve an appellant who was in a non-duty status prior to the rescinded action for reasons unrelated to the action being appealed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Sherrod v. Department of the Navy,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18 (2001) (because the appellant should have been in an approved leave status prior to his removal due to the effects of a compensable injury, the agency returned the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> when it placed him in an authorized leave status upon its rescission of the removal); <span class="Italic">Sellman v.

Such circumstances do not exist in the instant appeal, where the suspension and the appellant's placement on administrative leave were based on the same allegations. <span class="Italic">See Burzinski v.

Because the record does not indicate that the agency purged the suspension proposal from the appellant's personnel file nor established a strong overriding interest in not returning the appellant to duty status, the AJ erred in finding that the agency completely rescinded the constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See Krisovitch v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. 611, 613-14 (1991).

Dept. of Navy</span>, 72 MSPR 656, 659 (1996) (although the appellant separated from the service following constructive demotion, his interest in accurate records of his past employment left a live controversy before the Board when the agency had not promoted the employee back to his former position; restoration of the appellant's pay, alone, did not moot the appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Return to administrative leave status is not restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> unless the employee was on administrative leave before the action against him was initiated and for reasons unrelated to the action appealed, as <span class="Italic">Tanner v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction over an agency action such as a removal is determined by the nature of an agency's action against a particular appellant at the time an appeal is filed with the Board, and an agency's unilateral modification of its adverse action after an appeal has been filed cannot divest the Board of jurisdiction unless the appellant consents to such divestiture, or unless the agency completely rescinds the action being appealed. <span class="Italic">Himmel v. Department of Justice</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 484, 486 (1981). The Board may dismiss an appeal as moot, however, if the agency cancels or rescinds an appealable action. <span class="Italic">Deas v.

Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 5 (2007). If an appeal is not truly moot despite the cancellation of the action under appeal, the proper remedy is for the Board to retain jurisdiction and to adjudicate the appeal on the merits. <span class="Italic">Deas</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 637, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">Fernandez</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, as discussed below, the agency subjected the appellant to an appealable action at the time he filed his appeal. That action was cancelled when the agency cancelled the removal action, placed the appellant on administrative leave, paid him back pay, and redacted all references to the termination from his Official Personnel File. However, the record supports the administrative judge's finding that the agency failed to take all the steps necessary to completely rescind the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appeal had been adjudicated and the appellant had prevailed, a Board order to cancel the removal action would have required the agency to place the appellant in a duty status, unless the agency could establish a strong overriding interest in keeping the appellant in an administrative leave status. <span class="Italic">See Deas</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 637, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Sredzinski v.

We agree with the administrative judge that, based on the current record, the agency failed to establish that it had a strong overriding interest in keeping the appellant in an administrative leave status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency stated as its reason for placing the appellant on administrative leave the same reason that it provided for relieving him from his position: it was considering "an appropriate resolution of the clear and undisputed misconduct which underlies the original termination." This does not demonstrate a strong overriding interest in keeping the appellant in an administrative leave status. <span class="Italic">See Deas</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 637, &#x00B6; 14. The instant appeal is distinguishable from those cases in which the Board has found an appeal moot despite an agency's failure to return the appellant to a duty status because such cases typically involve an appellant who was in a non-duty status prior to the rescinded action for reasons unrelated to the action being appealed. <span class="Italic">Id.; see, e.g., Sherrod v. Department of the Navy</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18 (2001) (because the appellant should have been in an approved leave status prior to his removal due to the effects of a compensable injury, the agency returned the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> when it placed him in an authorized leave status upon its rescission of the removal); <span class="Italic">Sellman v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Such circumstances are not present in the instant appeal. Indeed, to the extent that the agency maintains that it has an overriding interest in not returning the employee to his former position, namely, that it was considering whether to again effect his removal, this is essentially an argument concerning the merits of this appeal, which is not germane to the mootness issue. The question now is whether the agency rescinded the appealed action. <span class="Italic">See Yuni v. Small Business Administration</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 574 (1988); <span class="Italic">see also Burzinski v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency did not do so, this appeal was not moot, and the administrative judge correctly adjudicated it on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Holleman v. MSPB</span>, 629 Fed. Appx. 942, 948 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP), if while an employee is on indefinite suspension the agency removes the employee <span id="Page_1031"></span>and then cancels the removal, restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> is accomplished by return of the employee to indefinite suspension status:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On this record, because Holleman is not entitled to receive any back pay, the agency's decision rescinding his removal and placing him on "non-pay, non-duty" status returned him to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">See Harris</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. at 490-91. As such, there was no further relief the Board could grant in this appeal. <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 2015 MSPB LEXIS 850 at *7 (finding that Holleman "has no further cognizable interest in the outcome of the appeal"); <span class="Italic">see also Moore v.

Accordingly, we agree with the Board that Holleman's appeal was rendered moot and thus dismissal was appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency must take the steps needed to cancel adverse collateral effects of an action it decides to rescind. If the agency thinks better of a negative ALOC determination following a Board appeal, the agency must not only provide the employee with the step increase, but must also amend the ALOC determination and the underlying performance rating. <span class="Italic">Guy v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 37 MSPR 230, 232 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Shaishaa v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 450, 452 (1992) (appeal from denial of a within-grade increase was mooted by cancelation of the action, retroactive pay for the period of the denial, removal of all references from the personnel record, and amendment of the acceptable level of competence determination and the underlying performance evaluation); <span class="Italic">Jazdzewski v. USDA</span>, 35 MSPR 541, 543 (1987) (WIGI appeal was mooted by retroactive restoration of the step increase; an objectionable reassignment did not sustain Board jurisdiction). But restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> does not mean an improvement on it. If the agency takes action under a last chance agreement, the employee appeals, and the agency rescinds the action, the appeal will be dismissed as moot. The Board will not release the employee from the remaining term of the last chance agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCourt v. VA</span>, AT-0752-12-0251-I-1 (NP 11/21/2012); <span class="Italic">Rojas v.

Once the action is canceled and the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> is restored, the action is not ordinarily resurrected because the agency reassigns the appellant or because an AWOL charge is pending against the appellant that could lead to another removal. <span class="Italic">Maki v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 449, 457-60 (1989) (cancelation of an appealed action involving, among others, an AWOL charge did not require reversal of the AWOL charge as part of the restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>; reversal of the AWOL would have placed the appellant in a position better than she would have had without an adverse action); <span class="Italic">Bruning v.

<p class="Body-Text">The appellant need not be restored to a better position than he held before the initiation of the adverse action. In <span class="Italic">Hagan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 99 MSPR 313, 317-18 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2005), the employee was on AWOL status after his OWCP benefits were terminated and up to the time he was removed for AWOL when the employee did not return to work following the employer's request that he do so. OWCP benefits were reinstated, the agency rescinded the removal action, and it then placed the appellant on extended LWOP status. Restoration to LWOP status when the action was rescinded, rather than placement of the employee in pay status, was appropriate:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy does not require that the appellant be placed in a better position than he was in at the time of the agency's action. <span class="Italic">See Covert v. Department of the Navy,</span> 31 M.S.P.R. 376, 382-83 (1986). Because the appellant was in an unauthorized absence status and OWCP subsequently determined that the appellant had a compensable injury for the period of his absence, he should have been in an approved leave status. <span class="Italic">See Burton v. Department of the Army,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 392 (1994). Accordingly, the agency was required only to place the appellant in the position that he was in prior to his removal, which in this case, was an approved leave status while receiving OWCP benefits. <span class="Italic">See Sellman,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. at 154 n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the AJ properly found that placement of the appellant on LWOP constitutes a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. Because the appellant was returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, the removal appeal was properly dismissed as moot.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If AWOL was the status of the employee immediately prior to her removal, when the agency cancels the removal it restores the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> by returning the employee to AWOL, assuming no claim is made as to a constructive suspension, <span class="Italic">Hess v. USPS</span>, 123 MSPR 183, 187 &#x00B6; 7, 2016 MSPB 5 (2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant concedes that she was in an AWOL status during the period of time preceding her removal. The Board has found that it generally is inappropriate to direct an agency to change an employee's AWOL status or leave status prior to an appealable action because this status is not, in itself, appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Maki v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 449, 457 (1989). The Board does not have before it the circumstances of the appellant's AWOL prior to the effective date of her removal.[2] To require the cancellation of the appellant's preremoval AWOL status thus would violate the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> principle because it would place the appellant in a more advantageous position than she was in prior to her removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We therefore find that the agency properly returned the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> by rescinding all references to her removal and placing her in a nonpay status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The appellant appears to have absented herself from employment, and this case does not present whether she was subjected to a period of enforced leave prior to her removal. <span class="Italic">See Maki</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. at 457-58.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Guy</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the agency may not undercut the cancelation of the action appealed.

Dept. of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 14, 20 (1994) (suspension was not moot when the SF-50 suggested that cancelation would not be in the agency's best interests to avoid conflict with the subsequent action it took against the appellant).

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Lewis v. Continental Bank Corporation,</span> 494 U.S. 472, 481-82, 110 S. Ct. 1249, 108 L. Ed.2d 400 (1990). This exception requires that there be a reasonable expectation or demonstrated probability, rather than a mere physical or theoretical possibility, that the same controversy will recur involving the same complaining party. <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Hunt,</span> 455 U.S. 478, 482, 102 S. Ct. 1181, 71 L. Ed.2d 353 (1982). Here, even assuming that the appellant would not have retired, we find that the record contains no evidence to suggest that the agency was likely to reinstate the suspension action, after having rescinded it. Thus, the appeal is not affected by the "capable of repetition, yet evading review" exception to the mootness doctrine.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we find, in any event, that the agency has not shown that the matter that is the subject of this appeal, the 30-day suspension, is moot. In <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Department of the Navy,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1997432108f3d3241352">108 F.3d 324</a>, 326 (Fed. Cir. 1997), the court held that the Navy's cancellation of the removal action and removal of all references to that action from the appellant's official personnel file (OPF) eliminated all the consequences of that action and thus rendered the appeal moot. Here, although it is undisputed that the agency did not effect the 30-day suspension, it has not submitted documentation proving that it cancelled the suspension and removed all references to it from the appellant's OPF. <span class="Italic">See Gillespie,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 327 &#x00B6; 9 (the Board found that the appeal was not moot when the agency failed to submit a declaration attesting to the purging from the appellant's personnel record of all references to the removal); <span class="Italic">compare</span> <span class="Italic">Nguyen v. Department of the Navy,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 603 &#x00B6; 5 (1999) (the Board dismissed the appeal as moot after the agency, in response to the appellant's allegations that all references to the removal had not been removed from her OPF, submitted an affidavit declaring that they had been removed). Thus, there remains some relief that the Board can order the agency to afford, i.e., assuring that the appellant's OPF has been purged of all references to the suspension. Accordingly, we find it necessary to remand the appeal of the suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Overtime earnings may present issues concerning restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Dept. of Army</span>, 52 MSPR 87, 90 (1991) (appeal remanded, after <span id="Page_1032"></span>the demotion was canceled, for the AJ to determine whether the appellant had lost overtime opportunities during the period of his demotion). But collateral consequences have their limits. A claim that the appellant lost career activities as a result of a (canceled) demotion was "too general and speculative as a basis for the Board to retain jurisdiction or to fashion a remedy." <span class="Italic">Tyrrell v. VA</span>, 60 MSPR 276, 278 (1994). An unfavorable performance appraisal for a period postdating the canceled removal action did not preserve MSPB jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Powell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 32 MSPR 221, 224 (1987). When the appellant was furloughed, the agency then returned the appellant to work with pay for the period of the furlough, the appeal was moot despite the appellant's argument that the agency's original error placing the appellant's position was in the group permissibly to be furloughed might again occur, <span class="Italic">Blackwell v. DHS</span>, DA-0752-14-0030-I-1 (NP 7/30/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant alleged in her initial appeal that DHS erred in furloughing her, she did not identify a requested remedy. When asked by the agency what she was seeking, the appellant indicated that she was not seeking money but was seeking a change in the agency's policies of determining who was "essential" in order to prevent any potential harm in the future, such as another furlough or a denial of promotional opportunities. She also requested a change in classification from a 340 series manager to a 1895 series manager because the former was excepted during the shutdown and the latter was not. The appellant's response to the administrative judge's show cause order similarly pointed to fear of future harm. She argued that the back pay she received was not a remedy because she remained in a position where DHS could apply the same procedures during subsequent furloughs, shutdowns, or sequestrations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant's petition for review explained that, "The request for relief is a finding on whether the agency's decision to furlough the appellant showed harmful error."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). As detailed above, the appellant has consistently indicated that she is not appealing her back pay. Instead, she seeks either a change in classification or a declaration that the agency's shutdown procedures were applied inappropriately, so that she does not suffer future harm. However, the Board lacks jurisdiction over cases concerning the proper classification of a position. <span class="Italic">Saunders v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1985). In addition, speculation that an adverse action may occur in the future does not bring an appeal within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Larkin v. Veterans Administration</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 245, 247 (1981). To the extent that the appellant seeks to ensure that the agency institutes future furloughs in a particular manner, the Board is specifically prohibited from issuing advisory opinions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant seeks either a change in classification or a declaration that the agency erred in order to prevent future harm, neither is a remedy the Board can provide. Therefore, the dismissal of her appeal as moot is affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Rojas v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 400, 406-07 (1996), a hostile work environment upon restoration may preserve Board jurisdiction over an allegedly rescinded action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant claimed below that he had been subjected to a hostile work environment since his return to duty, and he has repeated that claim on petition for review. The administrative judge did not address that claim at all. This was error....&#8197;An employee subjected to retaliation for filing a Board appeal has not been returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tyrrell</span>, 60 MSPR at 279. The appellant thus should be provided an opportunity to clarify and support at the hearing on remand his allegations of harassment by the agency. He must introduce proof that, specifically as a result of his appeal or the agency's purported rescission, he is now being subjected to mistreatment by the agency; if he does so, the agency must be allowed to rebut this showing to meet its burden of proving that the removal action was fully rescinded. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wright v. VA</span>, 85 MSPR 358, 367-68 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 25-27 (2000), determined that an action was not moot, although allegedly rescinded, if the appellant is prevented from returning to the workplace because of continuing sexual harassment of the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Intolerable working conditions may render an action involuntary when, under all the circumstances, the working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to absent herself from the workplace. <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Services Administration</span>, 68 MSPR 513, 520 (1995). In addition, when discrimination is alleged in connection with a determination of involuntariness, evidence of discrimination or retaliation may only be addressed insofar as it relates to the issue of voluntariness and not whether the evidence would establish discrimination or reprisal under the standards used to prove discrimination. <span class="Italic">Markon v. Department of State,</span> 71 MSPR 574, 578 (1996). Thus, evidence of discrimination goes to the ultimate question of coercion, namely, whether, under all of the circumstances, working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign or retire. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The test for involuntariness in the context of a retirement or resignation also should apply here to the appellant's claim of that the agency's actions or inactions prevent her from returning to her job. Thus, her allegation of sex discrimination should be considered with respect to her claim that she was subjected to sexual harassment so pervasive that she effectively has been forced to stay off work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant has alleged, without contradiction, that she has received no back pay from the effective date of the removal action and because we are unable to determine if her inability to return to her GS-7 Medical Photographer position is due to the agency's purported action in allowing a hostile work environment to exist in the photography department so as to compel her to absent herself from the workplace, we must remand this appeal for adjudication of these issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge shall allow the parties to submit argument and evidence on issues of back pay and hostile working environment, and he shall convene a hearing if requested and necessary. If back pay was denied to the appellant for any part of the period after the effective date of the removal or if she is prevented from returning to her Medical Photographer position because of a hostile work environment, then the appeal of the removal action is not moot because she has not received all of the relief that she would have received if she had prevailed in that appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Leave status may complicate <span class="Italic">status quo</span> restoration. In <span class="Italic">Reedy v. USPS</span>, 84 MSPR 453 (1999), the appellant was removed for inability to meet requirements of her position. The appellant was on LWOP when she was removed. After her appeal the agency canceled the adverse action and placed her back on LWOP. The Board decided that further inquiry was necessary to determine whether the adverse action was really rescinded<span class="Italic">.</span> The appellant could protest continuation of LWOP, meaning that further LWOP would be a constructive suspension. There was the possibility that appellant could work following the removal and up to the cancelation of the adverse action, raising an issue of back pay entitlement. <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sherrod v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 90 MSPR 347, 353 &#x00B6; 17 (2001) ("The agency was required only to place the appellant in the position he was in prior to his removal, which in this case, was an approved leave status."); <span class="Italic">Sellman v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 145 (1994) (if the appellant was on approved leave when the action taken was canceled, restoration to the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> requires no more than restoration to approved leave (LWOP) status).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board examines the agency's action to ensure the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> is restored. A subsequent action should be challenged through a separate appeal, e.g., in a RIF appeal after the appellant is restored. <span class="Italic">Wilson v. SBA</span>, 27 MSPR 561, 563-64 (1985).
