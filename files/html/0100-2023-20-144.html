<p class="Body-Text">A hostile environment was determined to be a form of covered personnel action in an IRA appeal, <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Army</span>, 122 MSPR 612, 627, 629 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23, 27, 2015 MSPB 51 (2015) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0752-11-0634-B-1 (NP 10/31/2022), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The statute defines "personnel action" to include, among other listed actions, "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii). The legislative history of the 1994 amendment to the WPA indicates that the term "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions" should be interpreted broadly, to include "any harassment or discrimination that could have a chilling effect on whistleblowing or otherwise undermine the merit system." <span class="Italic">Roach v. Department of the Army</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 464, &#x00B6; 24 (1999) (quoting 140 Cong. Rec. H11, 421 (daily ed. Oct. 7, 1994) (statement of Rep. McCloskey)). Although the appellant alleged before both OSC and the Board that the agency subjected her to a hostile work environment in retaliation for her protected disclosures concerning the Ranges Program, the administrative judge did not address that alleged personnel action, except to the extent it also was implicated in the appellant's constructive suspension claim. Accordingly, the administrative judge should determine on remand whether the appellant established prohibited whistleblowing retaliation regarding the alleged creation of a hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the agency's refusal in March 2009, to extend the appellant's return-to-work date or grant her requests for advanced sick leave or LWOP, the administrative judge again relied solely on evidence tending to support the agency's actions. It is true that these actions may have been reasonable, given the appellant's failure to return to work on the previous dates projected by Dr. B.M. However, in determining whether the agency would have taken the actions in the absence of the whistleblowing activity, the administrative judge did not consider the possibility that the appellant's extended absences might never have occurred but for the agency's alleged retaliatory actions in creating a hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">See Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1376. On remand, the administrative judge should consider this possibility and examine any supporting evidence. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, the Board found the AJ's analysis was incomplete. Another remand resulted, with the Board commenting on the hostile environment allegations, <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0752-11-0634-B-1 (NP 10/31/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's allegations of a hostile work environment establish a significant change in working conditions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii)</span>.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant described numerous acts of alleged harassment, occurring over an extended period of time, involving staffing issues, perceived exclusions from meetings or email discussions, disagreements with contracting office personnel and her own supervisors over work policies and procedures, and an extremely heavy workload. As discussed above, we have found that the appellant suffered from a work environment that was the primary cause of her incapacitation and resulting absences. <span class="Italic">Supra</span> &#x00B6; 22. In light of that finding, we conclude that the alleged incidents of harassment, considered collectively, contributed to a "significant change in working conditions" as defined at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii). Accordingly, on remand, the administrative judge should determine whether the appellant's protected disclosures concerning the Ranges Program were a contributing factor in that change in working conditions and, if so, whether the agency would have imposed that change in working conditions in the absence of those protected disclosures.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The creation of a hostile work environment is a personnel action for purposes of the Whistleblower Protection Act. <span class="Italic">Savage v.

The appellant alleges that the agency, among other things, reassigned his staff to work for other supervisors, encouraged his staff to be insubordinate to him, denied him the opportunity to participate at a meeting in person, encouraged his staff to have their work reviewed by the Division Director rather than by the appellant, recommended some of his staff members for promotions and awards without his input, revised his job description so that nearly all of his duties were performed "at the direction of the Division Director," gave other individuals credit for his work, accused him of propagating a "culture of intimidation," and unceremoniously escorted him from the building when it placed him on administrative leave. Although it is questionable whether any one of these actions alone would constitute a significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions to create an actionable hostile work environment, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that such was their cumulative effect. <span class="Italic">See Holderfield v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 326 F.3d 1207, 1209 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (holding that numerous agency actions may amount to a covered personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii) collectively, even if they are not covered personnel actions individually).[6] The appellant alleges that two individuals were involved in the allegedly retaliatory actions--the Office Director and the Division Director.</p>

However, when the administrative judge ordered the appellant to identify the personnel actions that the agency took against him in reprisal, the appellant did not list these as separate personnel actions. Nevertheless, these matters may be relevant to the appellant's claim that the agency subjected him to a significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn now to the issue of whether the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that she suffered a personnel action when she was subjected to a hostile work environment, in light of additional details and documentation the appellant has provided on review. The administrative judge considered as separate, alleged personnel actions the appellant's claims that (1) she was subjected to a hostile work environment, and (2) her duties and working conditions were changed. We find that this interpretation is an overly narrow view of the appellant's allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant has not challenged the administrative judge's characterization of these personnel actions on review, we conclude that there is no basis to distinguish a "hostile work environment" from <span id="Page_3895"></span>a change in duties and working conditions. Both of these terms are different ways of framing the personnel action identified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii) as any "significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." <span class="Italic">Skarada</span>, 2022 MSPB 17, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16. By parsing the hostile work environment claim into two, separate personnel actions, the administrative judge may have unintentionally diminished the seriousness of the appellant's claims. <span class="Italic">See Hamley v. Department of the Interior</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 290, &#x00B6; 7 (2015) (observing, in the title VII context, that hostile work environment claims are different from discrete acts of discrimination or retaliation because, by their nature, they involve repeated conduct, a single incident of which may not be actionable on its own).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reasserts that actions by various agency officials amounted to a hostile work environment that continued until at least June 2020. Taking the appellant's pleadings below and on review together, and treating her hostile work environment claim as one, rather than two, personnel actions, the appellant's allegations appear quite serious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prevail on an allegation concerning a hostile work environment, an employee must show that the complained-of conduct was severe or pervasive enough to create a working environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Godesky v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 280, &#x00B6; 14 n.* (2006) (finding that an appellant's allegations did not establish hostile work environment discrimination under title VII because he did not show that the complained-of conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment); <span class="Italic">see also Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth</span>, 524 U.S. 742, 754 (1998) (finding that a hostile work environment under title VII requires a showing of severe or pervasive conduct). In determining whether an appellant has been subjected to a hostile work environment sufficient to rise to the level of a personnel action, the Board must consider the alleged agency actions both collectively and individually. <span class="Italic">Skarada</span>, 2022 MSPB 17, &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that undermining the supervisory authority of an employee may constitute a significant change in duties, responsibilities, and working conditions. <span class="Italic">McDonnell v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 23 (2008). Further, the Board also has found that an appellant nonfrivolously alleged he was subjected to a personnel action when an agency excluded him from meetings and conversations, subjected him to multiple investigations, accused him of fabricating data violating the Privacy Act, refused his request for a review of his position for possible upgrade, yelled at him on three occasions, and failed to provide him the support and guidance needed to successfully perform his duties. <span class="Italic">Skarada</span>, 2022 MSPB 17, &#x00B6; 18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, here, alleges that after a nurse threatened her with gun violence on February 23, 2018, the agency immediately placed her department on lockdown, and on February 26, 2018, an agency official called all department staff to a meeting to discuss the situation. However, an individual she identifies as the "Lead in Cardio," whom the appellant alleges was a friend of the nurse that threatened her, refused to go to the meeting, stating to the appellant in front of others, "all this shit is your fault." Despite a continuing instruction that the department was to be kept locked, this same individual "continued to unlock the doors," causing the appellant and her coworkers to fear that the nurse who threatened the appellant would "come in the clinic and shoot us all." On one occasion, after the appellant locked the doors after the Cardio Lead entered the department on March 2, 2018, the Cardio Lead allegedly responded, "you are the stupidest bitch I have ever seen, if you hadn't of [sic] reported [the nurse] for the needle stick, none of this would be happening." Not until February 19, 2019, almost a year after the agency put in place the requirement of locking the appellant's department, did the department install a door with a code lock, apparently resolving the concerns caused by the Cardio Lead leaving the door unlocked.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant reported that "every few days" the Cardio Lead continued to call her a "bitch and other things," through May 2018. According to the appellant, despite the agency's awareness of the Cardio Lead's hostility, it did not take sufficient action to correct the situation. While a doctor expressed to the appellant that he was frustrated by the lack of action from hospital administration, the Director of Nursing told the appellant to "get over it, let it go, no one died," and laughed. For the first time on review, the appellant also provides emails the former Chief of Cardiology sent to the Chief of Medicine and the VA Chief of Police expressing concerns about the "toxic environment" in the Cardiology department and the alleged "behind the back, behind the scenes" campaign against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, as described by the appellant, after a threat to her life by a coworker, for almost a year the agency allowed another coworker to undermine security efforts designed to protect her from the threat, made light of the incident, and permitted her to be insulted on a regular basis for reporting the threat. The appellant's allegations here are at least as serious as those in <span class="Italic">McDonnell</span> and <span class="Italic">Skarada</span> and rise to the level of a nonfrivolous allegation of hostile working environment sufficient to constitute a significant change in her duties or working conditions. <span class="Italic">See Skarada</span>, 2022 MSPB 17, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-18.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, as discussed above, the appellant's temporary relocation to a new duty station, suspension of his computer systems access, and assignment to administrative duties constitute significant changes in his duties, responsibilities, and working conditions under subsection 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii). Therefore, it is unnecessary to determine whether these actions also constitute a significant change in his duties, responsibilities, or working conditions based on a hostile work environment. To the extent the appellant argues that the investigation was part of a hostile work environment personnel action, we disagree because he not shown that the investigation, individually or considered collectively with other agency actions, had any practical and significant effect on the overall nature and quality of his working conditions, duties, or responsibilities. <span class="Italic">See Skarada</span>, 2022 MSPB 17, &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stern v. VA, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210611155">___Fed. Appx.___</a></span> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP), confirmed that a hostile environment may be a covered personnel action, although the circumstances presented did not warrant reversal of the Board's conclusion that a hostile environment was not adequately alleged or proved. The court added that if there was error as to analysis of the sufficiency of the allegations, a hearing denial was harmless error:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A hostile work environment can constitute a personnel action for purposes of the Whistleblower Protection Act. <span class="Italic">See Sistek v. Dep't of Veterans Affs.</span>, 955 F.3d 948, 955 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (noting that a hostile work environment can be actionable as a significant change in working conditions under the statute). Here, the Board determined that Ms. Stern "did not nonfrivolously allege the agency harassed her in reprisal for protected activity" because the conduct alleged did "not approach the threshold of severe or pervasive abuse" required to establish a hostile work environment. It therefore declined to hold a hearing on her hostile work environment claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first address whether the Board erred by refusing to hold a hearing on Ms. Stern's allegation that she was subjected to a hostile work environment because she was "denied courteous treatment" by supervisors and co-workers as a result of her disclosures relating to IDES claims processing, and her allegations that she was subjected to a wellness check and proposed removal. As to discourteous treatment, Ms. Stern alleged as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The IDES office and [VA] managers have been biased in favor of my MSC and Army co-workers, who were permitted to break the IDES rules and regulations without consequence, and I was repeatedly pitted against them by blaming me for causing timeline delays in IDES claims-processing, where I was adhering to the strict letter of the IDES law, rules and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> She also noted that "hostility [was] directed towards [her] as a result of [her] pushing back against those who did not follow IDES rules and regulations, as required by law." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no error as to the Board's determination that these allegations of discourteous treatment, even when combined with the wellness check claim and the charges in the proposed removal, did not rise to the level of severe and pervasive conduct needed to establish a hostile work environment. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.</span>, 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993) (explaining in the context of a Title VII claim that "whether an environment is 'hostile' or 'abusive' can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances," such as "the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Stern alleges that various other agency actions created a hostile work environment. As to these, whether or not the Board erred in determining that Ms. Stern failed to non-frivolously allege that these actions created a hostile work environment, any such error was harmless. Ms. Stern "failed to establish any reason why the outcome could have been different had the Board" conducted a hearing on the hostile work environment claim. <span class="Italic">Sistek,</span> 955 F.3d at 955-56 (finding harmless error when the Board failed to address whether an allegedly retaliatory investigation constituted a personnel action under the Whistleblower Protection Act because the appellant failed to establish that the challenged action constituted "a significant change of working conditions").[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also Trobovic v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 232 F. App'x 958, 963-64 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (finding that the administrative judge erred in failing to address appellant's specific hostile work environment allegations, but determining "that the Board's dismissal was proper" because "[t]he conduct that [the appellant] identifie[d], while <span id="Page_3896"></span>regrettable if it occurred, is not sufficiently severe or pervasive to satisfy the demanding legal standard of proving that the [agency] intentionally created a hostile work environment that would have coerced an employee...to absent himself from work").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A hostile work environment claim under the Whistleblower Protection Act must be proven based on actions that were themselves taken in retaliation for a protected disclosure or activity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mikaia v. Dep't of Com.</span>, No. DC-1221-17-0794-W-2, 2018 MSPB LEXIS 4411, at *39 (M.S.P.B. Nov. 16, 2018) (determining that identified personnel actions must be excluded from a hostile work environment claim because they predated any protected disclosure and thus could not have been retaliatory), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 809 F. App'x 899 (Fed. Cir. 2020); <span class="Italic">see also Kitlinski v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 857 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (determining that the appellant failed to non-frivolously allege a hostile work environment in violation of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act because he did not present "an allegation of anti-military animus as the basis for creating a hostile work environment").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Most of the other agency actions identified in Ms. Stern's jurisdictional declaration and not expressly addressed by the Board were not alleged to be taken in reprisal for protected activities. At the same time, the Board found after a hearing that the agency had non-retaliatory motives for taking the remaining non-frivolously alleged reprisals: (1) ordering Ms. Stern to work from home, (2) changing her work duties, (3) denying her access to certain tools of her MSC position, (4) giving her a "fully successful" performance rating, (5) denying her a performance award, and (6) charging her with (a) exercising poor customer service, (b) yelling at a DoD Supervisor, (c) being rude and combative toward the Assistant Veterans Service Center Manager, and (d) displaying disrespectful and rude behavior toward her immediate supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, any error by the Board in not holding a hearing on her hostile work environment claim to consider these allegations was harmless.</p>
