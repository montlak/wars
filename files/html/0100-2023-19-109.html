<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-105"><span class="space">b.</span> Restrictions in Collective Bargaining Contract</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Assessment of the impact of collective bargaining agreements on accommodative requirements arrived with <span class="Italic">Konieczko v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 509, 514-15 (1991), deciding that contracts may preclude or require some accommodation (but there was no contract bar to reassignment under the specifics of the appeal):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has held that where an agency demonstrates that its nondiscriminatory collective bargaining agreement precludes it from reassigning an individual with a handicap to another position, such evidence is sufficient to establish that the reassignment would place an undue hardship on the agency<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Wiley v. Frank</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01860672 (July 31, 1990)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the EEOC's holding in <span class="Italic">Wiley</span> represents a shift from the Special Panel's position in <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 30 MSPR 471, 485-87 (Spec. Pan. 1986), but one that is more in accord with Federal court decisions. <span class="Italic">See School Board of Nassau</span> <span class="Italic">County, Fla. v. Arline,</span> 480 U.S. 273, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 1131 n.19, 94 L. Ed.2d 307 (1987); <span class="Italic">Carter v. Tisch,</span> 822 F.2d 465 (4th Cir. 1987) (and cases cited therein). Moreover, as we noted in <span class="Italic">Calton v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army,</span> 44 MSPR 477, 478 (1990), the Board will not force Special Panel review of an EEOC decision on discrimination law unless it depends on civil service law or is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law. We therefore defer to the EEOC in this instance, as its rulings in <span class="Italic">Wiley</span> rest on its interpretation of discrimination law, and its decision to give force to provisions of negotiated collective bargaining agreements is not so unreasonable as to violate civil service <span id="Page_3527"></span>law. <span class="Italic">See Ignacio v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 28 MSPR 337, 340 (1985). The Board's prior decisions which held that the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement cannot override the agency's obligations under the Rehabilitation Act are modified consistent with this Opinion and Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, however, the agency argued only that Window Clerks have "preference" to vacant Window Clerk jobs--the agency did not demonstrate that its collective bargaining agreement <span class="Italic">precluded</span> it from reassigning the appellant to a Window Clerk vacancy. Indeed, Section 5 of Article 13 of the agency's collective bargaining agreement specifically provides that ill or injured employees may be permanently reassigned from one craft to another craft when necessary. Thus, we find that the agency relied on a legally insufficient reason to refuse to reassign (or to consider reassigning) the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Konieczko</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Podrazik v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 380, 384 (1992), declaring that "where an agency demonstrates that its nondiscriminatory collective bargaining agreement precludes it from reassigning an individual with a handicap to another position, such evidence is sufficient to establish that the reassignment would place an undue hardship on the agency." <span class="Italic">Konieczko</span> was distinguished, with some explanation of the Postal Service contract provisions pertaining to permanent light duty reassignments, in <span class="Italic">McClain v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 362, 367 (1991), concluding that the agency discriminated against the appellant when, as a result of an OWCP determination not available when the employee was discharged, the employee qualified for and did not receive reassignment to a light duty position under the negotiated agreement<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Schrodt v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 609, 620 (1998) (collective bargaining contract restricted reassignments but not the accommodation of the appellant in his current position). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-19-088.html#sec12-84">Postal Service Collective Bargaining Agreements</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board also discussed the effect of labor contract provisions on accommodation claims in <span class="Italic">Bozeman v. USPS,</span> DC-0752-11-0379-I-1 (NP 7/11/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the legal question identified above, and assuming that the appellant is a qualified disabled person under the Rehabilitation Act, the Board has held that when an agency demonstrates that its nondiscriminatory CBA precludes it from reassigning an individual with a handicap to another position, such evidence is sufficient to establish that the reassignment would place an undue hardship on the agency. <span class="Italic">See Konieczko v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 509, 514-15 (1991); <span class="Italic">see also Podrazik v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 54 M.S.P.R. 380, 384 (1992). The agency produced testimony that the union contract precluded it from reassigning the appellant to the vacant mail handler and custodial positions, and the appellant has not presented sufficient rebuttal evidence to meet his overall burden of persuasion on his claim of a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2009); <span class="Italic">cf. Miller v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 494, &#x00B6; 10 (2000) ("[I]t is true that employees of the Postal Service are not considered qualified for any offer of reassignment that would be inconsistent with the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">U.S. Airways, Inc. v. Barnett</span>, 535 U.S. 391 (2002). The Court held that an employer's showing that a requested accommodation conflicts with seniority rights that are unilaterally imposed by management is ordinarily sufficient to show, as a matter of law, that the accommodation is not reasonable; however, the employee remains free to present evidence of special circumstances that make a seniority rule exception reasonable in the particular case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 393, 403. The Court noted that the lower courts have unanimously found that collectively-bargained seniority trumps the need for reasonable accommodation in the context of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 403. The Court also found that if an employee can show "special circumstances" under which the expectations of fair, uniform treatment of a seniority system are altered, then the requested accommodation may be "reasonable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 405. For example, the Court noted that such expectations may be altered when an employer frequently changes the seniority system unilaterally, reducing employee expectations that the system will be followed to the point where "one more departure, needed to accommodate an individual with a disability, will not likely make a difference." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, a plaintiff might show that the system already contains exceptions such that, in the circumstances, one further exception is unlikely to matter. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Court held that the plaintiff must "bear the burden of showing special circumstances that make an exception from the seniority system reasonable in the particular case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 405-06.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> applied in this case, the appellant has not shown special circumstances that make an exception reasonable in this case. The CBA does provide that every effort shall be made to reassign the injured employees requiring light duty work within the employee's present craft or occupational group, and after all efforts are exhausted in this area, consideration will be given to reassignment to another craft or occupational group within the same installation. However, it also provides that through local negotiations, each office will establish the assignments that are to be considered light duty within each craft represented in the office, and that the number of assignments within each craft that may be reserved for temporary or permanent light duty assignments, consistent with good business practices, shall be determined by past experience as to the number of reassignments that can be expected during each year. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 85. As set forth above, the agency presented testimony that the vacancies identified by the appellant were reserved under the union contract for purposes other than light duty assignments. The appellant has not provided evidence to rebut that testimony, nor has he shown that the agency reduced employee expectations regarding the system of setting aside the mail handler and custodial vacancies such that a departure for the appellant would not likely make a difference, or that the system already contained exceptions to the withholding of the vacancies from light duty employees such that an exception for the appellant was unlikely to matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant relies on <span class="Italic">Jambora v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A40128 (May 16, 2006), and <span class="Italic">Burnett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01981618 (Sept. 26, 2002), those cases are distinguishable. In <span class="Italic">Jambora</span>, the EEOC held that allowing the complainant to remain on the day tour would not have resulted in a violation of the agency's seniority scheme because the agency abolished all of the day shift manual distribution clerk positions, no senior distribution clerks would be "bumped" from a position on that tour, and there was no impact on the excessed clerks' retreat rights. The EEOC also found that, even assuming that the complainant's request to remain in her Permanent Modified Job on Tour II would impact another employee's seniority rights, "special circumstances" under <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> existed because Article 13 of the CBA constituted an exception to seniority rights under which the agency established a detailed procedure for placing employees with impairments and disabilities into light and limited duty positions outside of the bid process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Burnett</span>, the EEOC held that the parties had specifically bargained for and agreed to an exception to the CBA requirement that vacant positions be posted for bid under Article 37, and that there was therefore no real conflict because the CBA provided under Article 13 for accommodations even when someone with a disability had less seniority, and the agency "fully embraced" the concept of reassignment as an exception to the duty to post positions, noting testimony from a labor relations specialist that Article 13 was an exception to the posting requirement when a job is used to accommodate an employee's physical or mental condition. Thus, the EEOC found that "special circumstances" under <span class="Italic">Barnett</span> existed and reassignment was a reasonable accommodation. Neither <span class="Italic">Jambora</span> nor <span class="Italic">Burnett</span>, however, involved vacancies that were shown to be set aside or under the withholding requirements of the CBA, as in this case. Thus, the appellant has not shown that the agency established an exception to the requirements described in the manager's testimony, under which employee expectations had been reduced regarding the system of setting aside the vacancies such that a departure for the appellant would not likely make a difference.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Mason v. Frank</span>, 32 F.3d 315, 319-20 (5th Cir. 1994), the employee asserted that since he could not do lower-level work because of physical disability, he should have been assigned either higher-level or light duty work. The court disagreed, based on restrictions in the labor agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mason also argues that the Postal Service should not only have considered him for entry-level positions but also for higher-level positions and light-duty status. The Postal Service properly terminated Mason's status as an employee following his continuous absence from work for more than one year. Pursuant to the Postal Service's collective bargaining agreement with its unions, former employees are not eligible for higher-level positions or light-duty assignments. Higher-level openings are reserved for current employees and are obtained through a bidding process based upon seniority. Likewise, light-duty assignments are available only to current employees. An employer is not required to accommodate a handicapped individual in a manner that would violate the rights of other employees under a legitimate collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Shea v. Tisch</span>, 870 F.2d 786, 790 (1st Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>); <span class="Italic">Carter v. Tisch</span>, 822 F.2d 465, 467-69 (4th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Jasany v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 755 F.2d 1244, 1251-52 (6th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Daubert v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 733 F.2d 1367, 1370 (10th Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the appellant's interest in a reassignment, the prohibitory provisions of a negotiated agreement are considered only after the appellant establishes a right to reassignment under EEOC regulations, <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 552, 565-67 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, reassignment should be considered only when accommodation within the individual's current position is unavailable or would pose an undue hardship. This is not the case here. Thus, we need not determine whether there was a vacant position to which the appellant could be reassigned without imposing an undue hardship upon the agency. We note, however, that the administrative judge erred in addressing this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3528"></span>First, she improperly placed the burden of identifying a vacant position to which he could be reassigned upon the appellant. It is the agency that has the obligation, when reassignment has been requested, and the agency has determined that other means of accommodation are unavailable, to determine whether it could reasonably accommodate the appellant through reassignment to a vacant position within the constraints of 29 CFR 1614.203(g) (same commuting area, same appointing authority, same grade or level, and, if no position is available at the appellant's same grade or level, a position at the highest available grade or level below the appellant's current grade or level).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, although the administrative judge correctly found that the collective bargaining agreement does not <span class="Italic">require</span> the agency to accommodate an individual who is not a <span class="Italic">qualified</span> disabled person, she erred in failing to first determine whether reassignment was available within the constraints of 29 CFR 1614.203(g). Thus, the appropriate inquiry with respect to the collective bargaining agreement was whether its provisions precluded the appellant's reassignment to positions for which he would otherwise have been eligible under the above-cited regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Article 13, Section 2, Subsection B of the collective bargaining agreement provides, in relevant part that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any ill or injured full-time or regular...employee having a minimum of five years of postal service, <span class="Italic">or</span> any full-time regular...employee who sustained on-the-job injuries, regardless of years of service, while performing the assigned duties can submit a voluntary request for permanent reassignment to light duty or other assignment...if the employee is permanently unable to perform all or part of the assigned duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This provision, however, does not limit eligibility for reassignment to five-year employees and/or those employees who suffered on-the-job injuries. In fact, contrary to the appellant's argument, and the implicit holding of the initial decision, such employees are not "entitled" to reassignment. Rather, the provision in question merely states that employees with five years of service, or who suffer on-the-job injuries, are entitled to apply and be considered for permanent reassignment, regardless of whether they are "disabled" and entitled to Rehabilitation Act reasonable accommodation consideration. Such employees, as well as others who do not fall under Subsection B but are "disabled," are eligible for reassignment as a means of reasonable accommodation unless the agency can show that another provision of the collective bargaining agreement (such as provisions relating to seniority) would preclude reassignment to the identified position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This provision does not apply to the appellant because he has less than five years in service. As the appellant argues, however, two other provisions of the collective bargaining agreement place a lesser burden on the agency to attempt reassignment. Article II, Sec. 1 requires the agency to comply with the Rehabilitation Act. Article 13, Sec. 4.A states that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[e]very effort shall be made to reassign the concerned employee within the employee's present craft or occupational group, even if such assignment reduces the number of hours of work for the supplemental work force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the appellant's reassignment rights are governed by 29 CFR 1614.203(g), which requires agencies to identify funded vacancies located in the same commuting area, serviced by the same appointing authority, at the same grade or level, the essential functions of which the individual would be able to perform with reasonable accommodation, unless reassignment would impose undue hardship on the agency's operations. <span class="Italic">See also Joe v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 62 MSPR 408, 412 (1994), <span class="Italic">opinion after remand,</span> 66 MSPR 280 (1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett</span>, 122 S. Ct. 1516, 1525 (2002), considered the role of seniority provisions of contracts in the analysis of a reasonable accommodation claim by a disabled employee seeking a different position within his qualifications. The Supreme Court decided that ordinarily the ADA does not require the assignment of a disabled employee to a particular position if another employee is entitled to that position under the employer's established seniority system. But the employee may be able to show entitlement to the job through evidence of special circumstances demonstrating that the assignment is reasonable, e.g., where the employer has the right to, and frequently does, unilaterally change the seniority system, or if the employee shows that the system already "contains exceptions such that, in the circumstances, one further exception is unlikely to matter."</p>
