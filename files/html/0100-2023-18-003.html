<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-4"><span class="space">B.</span> SUBSTANTIVE BASES FOR RECONSIDERATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">The bases for FLRA reconsideration of a decision are summarized by <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 70 FLRA 953, 954 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting), involving a unit clarification proceeding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's Regulations permit a party to request reconsideration of an Authority decision.[6] However, a "party seeking reconsideration bears the heavy burden of establishing that extraordinary circumstances exist to justify this unusual action."[7] The Authority has identified only a limited number of situations in which extraordinary circumstances have been found to exist.[8] These include situations where: (1) an intervening court decision or change in the law affected dispositive issues; (2) evidence, information, or issues crucial to the decision had not been presented to the Authority; (3) the Authority erred in its remedial order, process, conclusion of law, or factual finding; and (4) the moving party has not been given an opportunity to address an issue raised <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by the Authority in its decision.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.17.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Local 2238</span>, 70 FLRA 184, 184 (2017) (<span class="Italic">Local 2238</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA 1030, 1031 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to changes in law, under DODDEA and FEA, 73 FLRA 398, 400 (2022) (Member Kiko dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has repeatedly held that a party seeking reconsideration bears the heavy burden of establishing that extraordinary circumstances exist to justify this unusual action.[33] As relevant here, the Authority has held that extraordinary circumstances include situations where an intervening court decision affected dispositive issues in the underlying decision.[34]…</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;AFGE, Nat’l VA Council #53, 71 FLRA 741, 742 (2020) (Council #53) (then-Member DuBester concurring); AFGE, Loc. 2338, 71 FLRA 644, 644 (2020).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[34]&#x2003;U.S. Dep’t of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Elgin Air Force Base, Fla., 65 FLRA 1047, 1048 (2011).</p>
<p class="noindent">Facts available to a party at the time a ULP proceeding is litigated, but not then made a part of the FLRA record, cannot later be used to support a motion for FLRA reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard and Tidewater Virginia FEMTC</span>, 10 FLRA 685, 686 (1982). In resolving requests for reconsideration, FLRA declines to consider arguments that were not raised to FLRA in its review of an award upon a party's exceptions. <span class="Italic">SPORT and Dept. of Air Force, Edwards AFB</span>, 64 FLRA 1142, 1143 (2010) (citing<span class="Italic"> U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Food &#x0026; Drug Admin.</span>, 60 FLRA 789, 791 (2005)). The failure of FLRA to resolve an issue that was not specifically alleged in a ULP complaint does not constitute the extraordinary circumstance necessary to grant a motion for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 3342</span>, 12 FLRA 754, 755 (1983). FLRA may decline reconsideration of a ULP decision on the basis that the Statute specifically contemplates and provides for judicial review of a final FLRA decision. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 10 FLRA 704, 705 (1982). Dicta in an FLRA decision, e.g., an introductory sentence unnecessary to the decision, does not provide a basis for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Ind.

<p class="noindent-1">For the first time, on reconsideration, the Union argues that it cannot comply with the Authority's order because the Agency "refuses to recognize the Union's right to bargain and refuses to bargain with the Union." The Union did not previously raise this argument in its exceptions, despite the fact that the Authority's order is virtually identical to that recommended by the Judge. Consequently, the Union cannot raise this argument for the first time in its motion for reconsideration.[12]</p>

<p class="noindent">The assertion that FLRA reached the wrong result in a negotiability decision does not warrant reconsideration. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2663 and VAMC Kansas City</span>, 32 FLRA 619, 620 (1988). But the wrong result may lead to reconsideration, as occurred in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow and AFGE Local 1482</span>, 32 FLRA 638, 641 (1988). FLRA denied an agency exception to an arbitration award that granted FLSA overtime to an employee. In a reconsideration motion, the agency contended it misled FLRA by providing incorrect information in its exceptions and supporting documentation concerning the employee's FLSA entitlement status. Granting the motion and remanding the case for clarification by the parties, FLRA declared:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we grant the motion for reconsideration and remand the matter, we note that a mistake of fact by a party will normally not warrant reconsideration. However, in the instant case, the mistake as to the date on which the employee was made exempt from the FLSA is determinative of the legality of the award. Therefore, "extraordinary circumstances" exist for granting the motion. While we grant the Agency's motion, we do not condone the Agency's lack of care in its presentation of an essential fact to the Authority. The Agency's initial statement of the date in question and its subsequent claim that the statement was incorrect have required an unnecessary expenditure of the Authority's resources and do not promote efficiency in case processing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Reconsideration was granted when FLRA made a mistaken factual finding <span id="page_2502"></span>by assuming that an agency had the opportunity to, but did not, address a matter before an arbitrator. When FLRA, on reconsideration, concluded that the arbitrator injected a dispositive issue into his award for the first time, FLRA granted the reconsideration petition, still affirming the result first reached by the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-140.html">60 FLRA 737</a> (2005).

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority, like other administrative agencies and the courts, may enunciate a new rule of law without reopening previously decided cases and retroactively applying the new law. To do so would have chaotic results. The determination as to whether the new law will be applied retroactively to closed cases is based upon evaluation of the circumstances involved in each situation and consideration of a number of factors, including the effects of allowing relitigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chevron Oil Co. v.

<p class="noindent">Reconsideration was granted when FLRA failed earlier to consider an agency argument in a negotiability case that a proposal infringed on a management right to determine the means of performing work and the result of that issue would determine the outcome of the case. <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 64 FLRA 395, 396 (2010). That a court decision modifies or reverses an FLRA decision does not necessarily constitute a basis for the reconsideration unless FLRA decides to expand the impact of the court decision beyond the particular case that was before the court. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC Jackson and NFFE Local 589</span>, 49 FLRA 171, 175 (1994) (granting reconsideration after FLRA decided to accept position taken by court); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Border Patrol and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 44 FLRA 766, 767 (1992) (rejecting untimely reconsideration motion; delay not excused by intervening, allegedly material, circuit court decision). But an intervening court decision affecting dispositive issues may warrant reconsideration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Indian Educators Fed'n and Bureau of Indian Affairs</span>, 53 FLRA 352, 355 (1997) (decision of Federal Circuit that grievant's separation was not an adverse or performance-based action reviewable by that court, meaning that the action could be reviewed, through exceptions to an arbitration award, by FLRA without contravening 5 USC 7121(f) and 5 USC 7122(a); FLRA reopened its earlier decision dismissing those exceptions for lack of jurisdiction). Reconsideration was effectively granted, although the underlying case was not reopened, when an intervening court decision effectively negated the basis of an FLRA ULP decision in a refusal to bargain case, leading to another ULP complaint (while the court case was pending decision). When the court decision was issued denying enforcement to the underlying ULP case, FLRA dismissed the subsequent ULP complaint based on the court decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRBPA</span>, 65 FLRA 312 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the effect of creation and abolition of laws and regulations following events triggering litigation before FLRA, emphasis is placed on the impact of the changes on the rights of the parties at the time the operative events occurred under<span class="Italic"> Dept. of Transp., FAA, Little Rock and NATCA</span>, 51 FLRA 216, 224-26 (1995), involving the impact of the abolition of the Federal Personnel Manual on an information request by a union during a time when the FPM was extant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the FPM Letter adopted and applied by the Authority in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> <span class="Italic">and Treasury</span> was not retained after December 31, 1994, a threshold question is presented in the case now before us: Should the Letter's guidance be applied in interpreting the routine use exception in cases arising from conduct prior to its expiration? In addressing this question, we are aided by a recent decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court extensively discussed the circumstances when a change in the law should be applied in a case arising from conduct antedating such change. <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film</span> <span class="Italic">Products</span>, __U.S.__, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 1501-05 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>). The <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span> Court, addressing statutory changes in particular, stated that where the application of a new law would "impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed[,]" the traditional presumption against retroactivity operates to deny such retroactive effect in the absence of clear congressional intent to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1505.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although there are obvious distinctions between the expiration of an interpretive FPM Letter and the enactment of a new law,[7] the situations are sufficiently analogous to warrant applying the Court's reasoning in this case as well.[8] Doing so, we find that not applying the FPM Letter in this case would impair rights the Respondent possessed when it denied the Union's request for information. There is no indication in the FPM Sunset Document that OPM intended such retroactive result by its action abolishing the Letter.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">U.S. v. Walter Dunlap &#x0026; Sons, Inc.</span>, 800 F.2d 1232, 1238 (3d Cir. 1986) (Interpretive rules do not have the force and effect of law because they are statements of policy issued by an agency asserting its construction of a regulation.).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;In general, regulations and statutes have not been treated differently for retroactivity purposes. <span class="Italic">See Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital</span>, 488 U.S. 204 (1988) (agency lacked authority to promulgate a rule having retroactive effect); <span class="Italic">Association of Accredited Cosmetology Schools. v. Alexander</span>, 979 F.2d 859, 864 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (retroactivity of statute and related regulations discussed without distinction). The presumption against retroactivity has been applied to deny retroactive effect to the expiration of a regulation. <span class="Italic">Bankruptcy Estate of United Shipping Co. v. General Mills, Inc.</span>, 34 F.3d 1383, 1393 (8th Cir. 1994) (regulation, repealed at the time of adjudication, but in effect during conduct at issue, was correctly applied by the administrative agency to the conduct under consideration).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The case now before the Authority presents yet another issue to consider, however, because it arose prior to the date the FPM Letter was issued, rather than during the period when it was in effect. A similar situation was presented in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> <span class="Italic">and</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury</span>, where the Authority applied the FPM Letter to a case, like this, that arose prior to the Letter's promulgation. In addition, we note that the Letter expressly stated OPM's "longstanding policy guidance and interpretations" concerning systems of records which OPM administers, and that courts of appeals have agreed that this had been OPM's interpretation prior to the Letter's promulgation. <span class="Italic">See Veterans Affairs</span>, 958 F.2d at 515; <span class="Italic">Treasury, Financial Management</span>, 884 F.2d 1454. Moreover, in our view it would likely create considerable and unnecessary confusion to treat the period of time <span class="Italic">before</span> issuance of the FPM Letter differently from the period of time <span class="Italic">after</span> it issued, in determining whether to retroactively apply this change in law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we do not give any retroactive effect to the expiration of FPM Letter 711-164, and will apply its guidance in all cases that arose prior to or during its effective dates.</p>
<p class="noindent">An alleged error of law is not likely to cause reconsideration of a decision on exceptions to an arbitrator's award under <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Florence and AFGE Local 1302</span>, 65 FLRA 76, 77-78 (2010), involving interpretation of the FLSA and disavowing broad reliance on the doctrine of sovereign immunity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not dispute that it neglected to present its argument concerning &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1) to the Arbitrator. Instead, the Agency argues that extraordinary circumstances are established for reconsideration for two reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Agency contends that, by "allowing an award that is contrary to law to become binding[,]" the Authority erred in its conclusion of law. The Agency contends that the Arbitrator's award is clearly prohibited by &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1); as such, it asserts that, under principles of <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review, the Authority cannot permit the award to become "final and binding."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, according to the Agency, the Authority's decision to dismiss the Agency's exception allows "an improper monetary award against the United States Government to stand" even though principles of sovereign immunity require an express statutory waiver before the United States can be held liable for monetary damages. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(citations omitted). The Agency asserts that the Authority's dismissal of its exception contradicts Authority precedent that states issues of sovereign immunity may be raised at any time and that monetary awards "without proper statutory authority to waive sovereign immunity must be set aside." The Agency, accordingly, asks the Authority to grant its motion and set aside the Arbitrator's award of backpay and liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.17 of the Authority's Regulations permits a party who can establish extraordinary circumstances to request reconsideration of an Authority order. The Authority has repeatedly recognized that a party seeking reconsideration under &#x00A7; 2429.17 bears the heavy burden of establishing that extraordinary circumstances exist to justify this unusual action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 56 FLRA 935, 936 (2000). The Authority has identified a limited number of situations in which extraordinary circumstances have been found to exist. These include situations: (1) where an intervening court decision or change in the law affected dispositive issues; (2) where evidence, information, or issues crucial to the decision had not been presented to the Authority; (3) where the Authority erred in its remedial order, process, conclusion of law, or factual finding; and (4) where the moving party has not been given an opportunity to address an issue raised <span class="Italic">sua sponte </span>by the Authority in the decision. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, 375th Combat Support Group, Scott Air Force Base, Ill.</span>, 50 FLRA 84, 86-87 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency first argues that reconsideration of <span class="Italic">DOJ </span>is warranted because a "basic tenet behind <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review is that the Authority cannot allow an award that is contrary to law to become final and binding." The Authority has rejected this argument as a basis for permitting reconsideration of <span id="page_2503"></span>an underlying decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, </span>57 FLRA 592, 593-94 (2001) (rejecting argument that Authority was required to conduct <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review of award and set it aside as inconsistent with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulation even though agency failed to raise regulation below). Accordingly, we reject this argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency next argues that reconsideration is warranted because the remedy conflicts with &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1) and is, therefore, not based on a valid waiver of sovereign immunity. The Agency further contends that Authority precedent states that: (1) agencies may raise issues of sovereign immunity at any time; and (2) monetary awards that are not based on proper waivers of sovereign immunity must be set aside. Motion at 6 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, Detroit, Mich., </span>64 FLRA 325, 328-29 (2009) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wash., D.C., </span>61 FLRA 146, 151 (2005) (<span class="Italic">IRS I</span>) (then-Member Pope concurring) <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS v. FLRA, </span>521 F.3d 1148 (9th Cir. 2008) (<span class="Italic">IRS II</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question of sovereign immunity concerns whether Congress has validly waived the United States' immunity to monetary liability. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of the Army v. FLRA, </span>56 F.3d 273, 277 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citations omitted). The Agency does not dispute that the Arbitrator based his award, in part, on the FLSA. The Agency also does not dispute that, "[b]y authorizing suits against the United States, the [FLSA's amendment] waives the government's sovereign immunity[&#8197;]" or that "[g]overnment employees were given the right to sue for violations of the FLSA[.]" <span class="Italic">IRS II, </span>521 F.3d at 1154 (citations omitted). Finally, the Agency does not dispute that the FLSA permits compensation for pre- and post-shift activities and that it does not prohibit payments for <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, and contrary to the Agency's claim, the award <span class="Italic">is </span>based on a valid Congressional waiver of sovereign immunity. Because the award is based on a valid waiver of sovereign immunity, i.e., the FLSA, any alleged conflict the remedy has with &#x00A7; 551.412(a)(1) provides no basis for concluding that the award is based on an invalid waiver of sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">See IRS I, </span>61 FLRA at 151 (finding that remedy's alleged conflict with an OPM regulation provided no basis for concluding that sovereign immunity had not been validly waived where award was based on waiver under Portal-to-Portal Act); <span class="Italic">see also IRS II, </span>521 F.3d at 1156 (in affirming Authority's determination that award was based on valid waiver of sovereign immunity, court stated that alleged inconsistency with regulation did not address whether Portal-to-Portal Act was part of sovereign immunity found under FLSA).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">IRS I </span>is misplaced. As explained above, in <span class="Italic">IRS I</span>, the Authority rejected the agency's assertion that the waiver of sovereign immunity at issue was invalid because the arbitrator's remedy conflicted with an OPM regulation. <span class="Italic">See IRS I, </span>61 FLRA at 151; <span class="Italic">see also IRS II, </span>521 F.3d at 1156.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">FAA </span>is likewise misplaced. <span class="Italic">FAA </span>involves the Back Pay Act (BPA)--not the FLSA--which is a limited waiver of sovereign immunity. The BPA permits recovery of backpay if, among other things, it constitutes "pay, allowances, or differentials" within the meaning of the BPA. <span class="Italic">FAA, </span>64 FLRA at 329 (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of HHS, Gallup Indian Med. Ctr., Navajo Area Indian Health Serv., </span>60 FLRA 202, 212 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting in part; then-Member Pope dissenting in part)). Federal courts and the Authority have acknowledged that the foregoing requirement concerns whether sovereign immunity has been validly waived under the BPA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA, Balt., Md., </span>201 F.3d 465, 471 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (stating that liquidated damages did not constitute "'pay, allowances, or differentials within the meaning of the statutory waiver of sovereign immunity" under the BPA); <span class="Italic">U.S. DOL, </span>61 FLRA 64, 66 (2005) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring) (citation omitted) (acknowledging that "pay, allowances, and differentials" under BPA concerned sovereign immunity); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, </span>52 FLRA 46, 50 (1996) (citations omitted) (same); <span class="Italic">cf. U.S. DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Milan, Mich., </span>63 FLRA 188, 189-90 (2009) (finding that issue of whether remedy satisfied casual connection requirement of BPA was properly barred by &#x00A7; 2429.5--and would therefore not be considered on review--even though it was part of agency's sovereign immunity argument). Thus, <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, in accordance with related precedent, establishes only that sovereign immunity <span class="Italic">under the BPA </span>has not been waived if certain requirements <span class="Italic">under the BPA </span>have not been satisfied. <span class="Italic">See FAA, </span>64 FLRA at 329. Because this case does not involve the BPA, <span class="Italic">FAA </span>is inapplicable.</p>
<p class="noindent">New evidence may not be particularly persuasive. <span class="Italic">DHHS, HCFA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 44 FLRA 145, 146 (1992), found FLRA rejecting a reconsideration request based on "new evidence concerning the consequences of exposure to tobacco smoke" relating to a ULP finding resulting from a unilateral change by the agency in smoking policies. Although reconsideration may be supported when the moving party was not given the opportunity to address an issue raised <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by FLRA in making its decision, its application of an established legal framework as to an issue raised before it did not constitute raising an issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> warranting reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Indep. Union of Pension Employees and PBGC</span>, 69 FLRA 158, 159 (2016) (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 66 FLRA 1030 (2012)).</p>
<p class="noindent">Occasionally FLRA receives serial reconsideration petitions on the same case and issue and, tiring of it all, tries to end matters with the pronouncement: "We will not entertain further motions or arguments by the Union on these issues." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2017 and Dept. of Army, Army Signal Ctr., Ft.
