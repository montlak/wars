<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-192"><span class="space">1.</span> Summary</h4>
<p class="noindent">What follows is not a grand unified theory of the law governing unit issues resulting from reorganizations, but we attempt a summary of significant decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent">We begin with the statute, 5 USC 7112, Determination of Appropriate Units For Labor Organization Representation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;The Authority shall determine the appropriateness of any unit. The Authority shall determine in each case whether, in order to ensure employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed under this chapter, the appropriate unit should be established on an agency, plant, installation, functional, or other basis and shall determine any unit to be an appropriate unit only if the determination will ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit and will promote effective dealings with, and efficiency of the operations of the agency involved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;A unit shall not be determined to be appropriate under this section solely on the basis of the extent to which employees in the proposed unit have organized,...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;Two or more units which are in an agency and for which a labor organization is the exclusive representative may, upon petition by the agency or labor organization, be consolidated with or without an election into a single larger unit if the Authority considers the larger unit to be appropriate. The Authority shall certify the labor organization as the exclusive representative of the new larger unit.</p>
<p class="noindent">Two terms repeatedly appear in the decisions that follow: "accretion" and "successorship."</p>
<p class="noindent">Accretion has not been defined in simple terms by FLRA, but the Seventh Circuit offered in <span class="Italic">Lammert Industries, a Division of Componetrol, Inc., a Subsidiary of I-T-E Imperial Corporation v. NLRB</span>, 578 F.2d 1223, 1225 n.3 (7th Cir. 1978):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An accretion is simply the addition of a relatively small group of employees to an existing unit where these additional employees share a sufficient community of interest with the unit employees and have no separate identity.&#x2003;The additional employees are then properly governed by the unit's choice of bargaining representatives. <span class="Italic">N.L.R.B. v. Food Employers Council, Inc.</span>, 399 F.2d 501, 502-503 (9th Cir. 1968).</p>
<p class="noindent">According to the FLRA Representation <span class="Italic">Hearing Officer's Guide</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To find accretion, the acquired employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">are not in newly created positions that fall within the express language of the unit description. <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Headquarters, Fort Dix, Fort Dix, New Jersey</span>, 53 F[L]RA 287 (1997);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">do not constitute an appropriate separate bargaining unit on their own;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">become functionally and administratively integrated into the gaining organization's pre-existing unit(s), and that adding the transferred employees to the unit(s) would be appropriate under section 7112(a) of the Statute in that the employees in the resulting unit share a community of interest with employees in the established unit and the resulting unit promotes effective dealings with and efficiency of operations of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><a href="https://www.flra.gov/system/files/webfm/OGC/Manuals/Rep%20Case%20Handling%20Manual/hearing%20officer%27s%20guide%20-%20one%20document_compressed.pdf">https://www.flra.gov/system/files/webfm/OGC/Manuals/Rep%20Case%20Handling%20Manual/hearing%20officer%27s%20guide%20-%20one%20document_compressed.pdf</a></p>
<p class="noindent">Successorship involves a determination of the status of a bargaining relationship between an agency/activity that acquires employees who were in a previously existing bargaining unit and a labor organization that exclusively represented those employees before their transfer. <span class="Italic">VA Gulf Coast VHCS and AFGE</span>, 64 FLRA 452, 453 (2010) (referring to definition provided by regional director).</p>
<p class="noindent">Accretion will involve the movement of additional employees into an existing organization and bargaining unit. Those additional employees may have been in their own, separate bargaining unit before they were reorganized into the gaining organization. The accretion issue arises when the union that previously represented those employees desires to continue that representation. The representation question then becomes whether the union representing the employees in the gaining organization is the exclusive representative, or whether there should be an election between that union and the union that represented the employees before the move, or whether the accretion of employees is so numerous in comparison to the employee complement in the gaining organization that an election must be held to ascertain who, if anyone, should represent the expanded unit of the gaining organization.</p>
<p class="noindent">The successorship will often involve a newly-created organization that absorbs employees from previously-existing entities that had their own bargaining <span id="page_185"></span>units and unions. For example, the Air Force creates a new command and into that command are placed three Air Forces bases, each abolished effective with the reorganization, each base having its own bargaining unit and a different union before the reorganization. The question then becomes whether one or the other of the unions representing employees at the three bases represents the employees of the newly created organization, or whether an election must be held to determine the union, if any, to be accorded status as the exclusive representative.</p>
<p class="noindent">We turn to the FLRA's <span class="Italic">Representation Case Law Outline</span>, dated but useful, and with the cautionary note that FLRA decisions should be checked after 2008, here is the discussion presented in the <span class="Italic">Outline</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">6.&#x2003;SUCCESSORSHIP AND ACCRETION</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Is there Authority caselaw that governs what happens when an agency reorganizes its operations?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Yes. In 1995 the Authority issued the first successorship decision, <span class="Italic">U.S. Navy, Naval Facilities Eng'g Serv., Port Hueneme</span>, 50 FLRA 363 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What is successorship?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under successorship, a gaining entity is a successor employer and a union remains the exclusive representative of employees when all three successorship criteria are met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here are the three <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> criteria:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Part one of the standard involves the movement of employees: An entire bargaining unit (or portion) is transferred; the transferred employees are in an appropriate unit after the transfer; and the transferred employees constitute a majority of the employees in this unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Part two involves the continuity of operations: The gaining entity must have a similar mission as the former entity and employees must perform similar duties, under similar working conditions after the reorganization. The gaining and former entities don't need to have the exact same mission. Employees need not be performing the exact same duties, just similar ones.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Part three concerns the necessity for an election: When affirmative answers are given for the first and second parts, successorship will be found, unless other factors are present which require that an election be conducted among employees of the post-transfer unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">Simple majority requirement--50% plus 1: If one union is involved and remaining employees in the new unit had been unrepresented, an election is not necessary if employees who transferred from a bargaining unit constitute a majority of the employees in the new bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">BLM, Sacramento, Cal. &#x0026; BLM, Ukiah Dist. Office</span>, 53 FLRA 1417, 1422 (1998) (<span class="Italic">BLM</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-3">"Sufficiently predominant": If more than one union's employees are involved, an election is not necessary if one union has more than 70% of the employees in the post-transfer unit. <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Aviation Missile Comm., Redstone Arsenal, Ala</span>., 56 FLRA 126, 131 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Redstone</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When do you assess the numbers of bargaining unit employees to determine if the simple majority or sufficiently predominant requirement is met?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Authority has not addressed this yet. <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> is based on NLRB case law. Under NLRB case law you assess the numbers of employees at the time that the agency transfers the employees, or when there is a substantial and representative complement of employees, if there is a start-up period for the new entity. <span class="Italic">Fall River Dyeing &#x0026; Finishing v. NLRB</span>, 482 U.S. 27 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Will the Authority conduct an election after a reorganization occurs when the number of employees in the post-transfer unit is less than 50% plus one of all employees in the new unit?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Maybe. If one union is involved and the 50% plus one standard isn't met, an election will be conducted by the Authority as long as there is evidence that a genuine question of representation exists. A question of representation exists when 30% of employees in a unit seek an election. So if 30% to 50% of the employees in the post-transfer unit had been represented by the union, the Authority will conduct an election. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Facilities Eng'g Command, S.E., Jacksonville, Fla</span>., 62 FLRA 480, 489 (2008)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What happens if multiple unions are involved, and no union is sufficiently predominant, and the employees could be part of two different appropriate units?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In that situation the Authority conducts a self-determination election. Employees vote on which union, if any, will represent them, and they also vote on the scope of the unit (i.e., which bargaining unit they want to be in). <span class="Italic">Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Supply Ctr. Columbus, Columbus, Ohio</span>, 53 FLRA 1114, 1133-34 (1998) (employees voted on if they wanted to be in a stand-alone bargaining unit represented by one union, or in a consolidated bargaining unit represented by a different union, or no union); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Naval Dist. Wash</span>., 60 FLRA 469 (2004) (firefighters voted to be in a firefighter bargaining unit or to be in a unit with other nonprofessional employees, as well as their exclusive representative).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What happens if one party argues successorship to one appropriate unit, while another party argues successorship to a different, appropriate unit?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If the Authority finds that a bargaining unit continues to be appropriate, that appropriate unit claim will be chosen, since it most fully preserves the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> in terms of unit structure and the relationship of employees to their union. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Commander, Naval Base, Norfolk, Va</span>., 56 FLRA 328 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What happens if a union claims that through successorship it remains the exclusive representative, but another party claims that the employees accreted to a different bargaining unit?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Authority first determines if there is successorship. If successorship is not found, then the Authority determines if the employees accreted (see directly below) to the other bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Navy, Fleet &#x0026; Indus. Supply Ctr., Norfolk, Va</span>., 52 FLRA 950 (1997) (<span class="Italic">FISC</span>). The legal analysis is as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">First determine if the transferred employees are included in, and if they constitute a majority of, a separate, appropriate unit in the gaining organization.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">If they do, then you apply the remaining Port Hueneme criteria to determine if the gaining employer is the successor and if the union continues to represent employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">If the transferred employees aren't included in, and don't constitute a majority of a separate, appropriate unit in the gaining organization, then you apply the accretion criteria to determine if the employees accreted into an existing unit. </p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 958-59.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What is accretion?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Accretion is inclusion of a group of employees in an existing unit without an election. The employees must have been fully integrated into the organization, and the bargaining unit must be an appropriate unit with their inclusion. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Navy, Naval Air Warfare Command, Aircraft Div., Patuxent River, Md</span>., 56 FLRA 1005, 1006 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-3">Accretion is narrowly applied because it precludes employee self-determination (i.e., employees aren't given the opportunity to vote if they want to be a part of the bargaining unit). <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What happens when unrepresented employees accrete to an existing unit?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The existing-unit employees must constitute a simple majority of the expanded unit. If they don't the Authority conducts an election. <span class="Italic">BLM</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What happens when represented employees accrete to an existing unit?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The existing-unit employees must be sufficiently predominant in the expanded unit, to avoid a question of representation. If they don't the Authority conducts an election. <span class="Italic">Redstone</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Authority processes a petition, what happens to bargaining obligations?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Parties must maintain existing recognitions, adhere to terms of existing contracts, and fulfill all representational and bargaining responsibilities. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.34; <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Naval Weapons Station, Yorktown, Va</span>., 55 FLRA 1112 (1999). </p>
<p class="noindent">Refer to FLRA's powerpoint presentation, "Reorganizations: Impact on Bargaining Units and Impact On Bargaining Obligations." <a href="https://www.flra.gov/system/files/webfm/OGC/Training/Reorganization%20slides%20final.pdf">https://www.flra.gov/system/files/webfm/OGC/Training/Reorganization%20slides%20final.pdf</a></p> 
<p class="noindent">FLRA states that successorship may apply to newly-established or preexisting organizations. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Fleet and Indus. Supply Ctr. and AFGE Local 53</span>, 52 FLRA 950, 958 (1997). That result blurred prior distinctions between accretion and successorship principles and analysis. Under the 1997 <span class="Italic">FISC</span> analysis, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 958-59:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;Initially, we will determine whether employees who have been transferred are included in, and constitute a majority of, a separate appropriate unit(s) in the gaining organization under section 7112(a). The outcome of this inquiry will govern whether successorship or accretion principles should next be applied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;If it is determined that the transferred employees <span class="Italic">are included in a separate appropriate unit(s)</span> in the gaining organization under section 7112(a), and if they constitute a majority of the employees in that unit(s), we will apply the remainder of the successorship factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> with respect to the unit(s) determined to be appropriate. The outcome of the <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> analysis will determine whether the gaining <span id="page_186"></span>organization is a successor for purposes of collective bargaining with the labor organization(s) that represented the transferred employees at their previous employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;If it is determined that the transferred employees <span class="Italic">are not included in, and constitute a majority of employees in, a separate appropriate unit</span> in the gaining organization, we will apply the Authority's long-established accretion principles. The outcome of this analysis will determine whether the transferred employees have accreted to a pre-existing unit in the gaining organization.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(italics in original)</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">FISC</span> cited the successorship analysis from <span class="Italic">Naval Facilities Eng'g Serv. Ctr., Port Hueneme, Cal. and NAGE Local R12-28</span>, 50 FLRA 363, 368 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>), determining that if there is a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit, and the unit would promote effective dealings with, and efficiency of the operations of, the agency involved, and if a new employing entity is the successor to a previous one, an election is not necessary to determine representation rights of employees who moved to the successor when:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;An entire recognized unit, or a portion thereof, is transferred and the transferred employees: (a) are in an appropriate bargaining unit, under section 7112(a)(1) of the Statute, after the transfer; and (b) constitute a majority of the employees in such unit;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;The gaining entity has substantially the same organizational mission as the losing entity, with the transferred employees performing substantially the same duties and functions under substantially similar working conditions in the gaining entity; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;It has not been demonstrated that an election is necessary to determine representation.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to accretion, and the acquisition of employees whose number does not place them in the majority of the newly-established or reformulated organization, under <span class="Italic">DLA, Defense Supply Center Columbus and AFGE, IFPTE</span>, 53 FLRA 1114, 1124-25, 1134 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e agree with the private sector rule that accretion is much more difficult to establish where the employees sought to be accreted are represented by a rival union. <span class="Italic">Lammert Industries v. NLRB</span>, 578 F.2d 1223, 1226 (7th Cir. 1978) (<span class="Italic">Lammert</span>); <span class="Italic">Seven-Up/Canada Dry Bottling Co</span>., 281 NLRB 943, 946 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Seven-Up</span>). This rule is intended to guard against the possibility of "an employer favoring one union over the other in violation of the employer's duty of neutrality." <span class="Italic">Lammert</span>, 578 F.2d at 1226. Further, it supports the principle that the accretion doctrine is generally narrowly applied, because it precludes employee self determination. <span class="Italic">Local 144, Hotel, Hospital, Nursing Home &#x0026; Allied Services Union, SEIU v. NLRB</span>, 9 F.3d 218, 223 (2d. Cir. 1993). This basic reluctance to short-circuit employee self-determination is enhanced where the employees have, in fact, already exercised their right of self-determination and chosen a representative different from the representative seeking to accrete them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that an election is necessary to determine the representational rights of the 212 AFGE specialists and the 198 IFPTE specialists. In this regard, both AFGE and IFPTE have represented employees in that unit that are virtually equal in number. There is no evidence that either group is sufficiently predominant to remove the question concerning representation. Thus, we conclude that it has been demonstrated that an election is necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to predominance of one represented group versus another in a reorganization, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Aviation Missile Command and AFGE Local 1858</span>, 56 FLRA 126, 131-32 (2000), explains:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We take as the guiding principle for determining whether one group is sufficiently predominant to render an election unnecessary whether there is a reasonable assurance of a meaningful contest.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Coast Guard Finance Center, Chesapeake, Virginia</span>, 34 FLRA 946, 949 (1990) (requirement for showing of interest helps to avoid unnecessary expenditure of time and funds where there is no reasonable assurance that a genuine representation question exists). We also note with approval the practice of the NLRB, which will not direct an election where it would be a useless exercise or prejudicial to the dominant group. <span class="Italic">See DLA, Columbus</span>, 53 FLRA at 1134, citing NLRB cases. If there is no reasonable assurance that the smaller group could succeed in an election, the holding of such a contest would be a waste of time and resources, since the predominant group already has voted for its representative. The statutory requirement of section 7111(a) that an exclusive representative be selected in a secret ballot election by a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit is thus fulfilled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the measure of "sufficiently predominant," both the General Counsel and the AFGE draw our attention to the fact that a 30 percent showing of interest is required by the Statute for a petitioner to gain an election where there is not an exclusive representative, or where there is an allegation that an exclusive representative no longer represents a majority. Section 7111(b)(1)(A) and (B).[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;We note, in addition, that experience in the private sector has led the NLRB to promulgate a rule that a 30 percent showing of interest is required to raise a QCR by a petitioning labor organization or a person seeking decertification. NLRB Rules and Regulations, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 101.18(a) (1999). The Board also has applied a 30 percent rule involving such voluntary recognition situations as, for example, where a voluntary recognition barred the processing of a subsequent petition unless the petitioner demonstrated that it had a 30 percent showing of interest at the time of recognition. <span class="Italic">Smith's Food and Drug Centers, Inc</span>., 320 NLRB 844 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NFFE's argument that its situation here is like that of an intervenor, which needs only a 10 percent showing of interest to gain participation in an election under the Statute, ignores an important distinction. Here, a 30 percent showing of interest would determine whether a QCR exists, requiring an election, in contrast to whether an intervenor with a 10 percent showing of interest may participate in an election where a QCR already exists.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that, absent special circumstances, not present here, a union that represents more than 70 percent of the employees in a newly combined unit formerly represented by two or more unions is sufficiently predominant to render an election unnecessary because such an election would be a useless exercise.[8] In such a situation, prong three of <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> is satisfied through the determination that an election would be unnecessary. We base our conclusion on a finding that unless the smaller group consists of at least 30 percent, absent special circumstances, there is no question concerning representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;"Special circumstances" would include cases where there is clear evidence that the percentage of employees represented by the unions in the separate, appropriate unit is not a dispositive indicator of their respective strength. For example, where the smaller union produces reliable evidence that it is supported by more than 30 percent of the employees in the proposed unit, the larger union's historical representation of more than 70 percent of the employees in the newly combined unit would not establish that it is sufficiently predominant to render an election unnecessary because such an election would be a useless exercise.</p>
<p class="noindent">With this summary, we turn to the nuances, and to the historically twisting path of FLRA decisions involving accretion and successorship and related unit clarification issues.</p>
