<p class="noindent">Under FLRA's regulations, a complaint must include a clear description of the acts claimed to constitute ULPs including, when known, the approximate dates and places of the acts and names of the respondent's agents or representatives who committed those acts. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3529 and Cyncynatus</span>, 31 FLRA 1208, 1211 (1988). Complaints will not be deemed unspecific if they are understood by both parties and the issues are fully litigated by the parties at the hearing. An ambiguity in the language of the complaint does not remove an issue from being properly before an ALJ if the issue is fully developed in the record before him. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 29 FLRA 891, 901 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, 416 CSG, Griffiss AFB, Rome and AFGE Local 2612</span>, 38 FLRA 1136, 1146 (1990) (allegation in complaint that violation was "continuing to date" was sufficient to place agency on notice that alleged unlawful acts extended beyond activity tied to particular date in complaint; events were fully litigated at hearing).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">INS, Border Patrol and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2366</span>, 51 FLRA 1561, 1564 (1996), <span class="Italic">review denied</span> <span class="Italic">sub nom</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 114 F.3d 1214, 1217 (D.C. Cir. 1997), added as to the adequacy of notice in a complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If a complaint does not set forth all of the elements of an alleged violation or is ambiguous, it is appropriate to examine other elements of the proceedings, including the charge, to determine whether adequate notice was provided. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grand Rapids Die Casting Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 831 F.2d 112, 118 (6th Cir. 1987) (although the complaint did not allege the theory of violation found by the judge, due process was accorded where, among other factors, the violation conformed to the amended charge); <span class="Italic">U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Customs Service (Washington, D.C.) and U.S. Customs Service</span> <span class="Italic">Northeast Region (Boston, Massachusetts</span>), 29 FLRA 891, 901 (1987) (mere ambiguity <span id="page_1569"></span>in the language of the complaint did not remove the issue from being properly before the Judge where the matter was fully developed in the record before him). <span class="Italic">See generally, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington</span>, <span class="Italic">D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 462, 467 (1995) (a violation can be found even if not alleged in the complaint if "all issues surrounding the violation have been litigated fully and fairly"). Here, the Authority looked to the charge as well as the matters litigated before the Judge and the positions of the parties in determining that this case had been characterized from its inception and throughout the hearing as involving mid-term bargaining. In these circumstances, it is clear that the Authority did not depart from precedent in relying in part on the charge to make this determination.</p>
<p class="noindent">A "mere ambiguity" in the wording of a complaint does not prevent consideration and disposition of an issue. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Border Patrol and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 41 FLRA 154, 173 (1991). The question is whether the respondent had notice of the issue being raised. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Border Patrol, El Paso and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 38 FLRA 1256, 1265 (1991).

<p class="noindent-1">The amended complaint alleged that the Union "failed and refused to recognize the [Agency's] designated representatives for the purpose of negotiating a successor collective[-]bargaining agreement" and by doing so, refused to negotiate in good faith, in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(b)(5) of the Statute. While the complaint does not specifically include "stalling," it clearly outlines the violation of good-faith bargaining by failing and refusing to recognize the Agency's representatives.[23] Our review of the record finds that the Union understood the issues in dispute to include whether or not it recognized the Agency's representatives for the purpose of negotiating a successor collective-bargaining agreement and that at issue were the sequence and substance of its communications with the Agency during the early months of 2016. This understanding was evidenced by the Union's full participation in the hearing during which it presented relevant testimony and other evidence. In particular, the Union had the opportunity to object to the Judge's questions regarding "stalling" motivations, though it did not do so,[24] and to explain, through witnesses, the reasons for its behavior.[25] We find the Union was afforded adequate notice and it was not denied "due process." Accordingly, we deny the Union's exception that it was denied due process.[26]</p>

<p class="noindent">FLRA examines the entire ULP complaint process to assess the complaint’s adequacy, as occurred in a case involving the agency's untimely response to an information request under 5 USC 7114, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-48.html">71 FLRA 281</a>, 282-83 (2019) (Chairman Kiko dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Judge erred in finding that both the Union's charge and the GC's Complaint provided it with an "adequate theory" of the GC's case.[11] While the Agency admits that "acknowledge" and "respond" have "similar definitions and could be used in the same manner to express similar acts," it contends that the GC did not assert that the timeliness of the Agency's response "was at issue" until the GC made its opening statement at the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;The Agency also took exception to the Judge's exclusion of evidence concerning additional information requests that were made around the same time as the information request at issue here. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 9. It contends that the excluded evidence was relevant to show that the Agency's reply to the information request was reasonable under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, &#x00A7; 2423.31(b) of the Authority's Regulations establishes that "the determination of the matters to be admitted into evidence is within the discretion of an Administrative Law Judge." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1345, Fort Carson, Colo</span>., 53 FLRA 1789, 1796 (1998). Furthermore, the Agency must demonstrate that the exclusion of the evidence would have affected the "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1797. In the instant case, the record reveals that the Agency presented ample evidence to demonstrate that the Agency worked in a "small office with a busy workload." The Judge excluded the evidence since it was "cumulative" and unduly repetitive. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.31(b) ("The Administrative Law Judge shall receive evidence and inquire fully into the relevant and material facts concerning the matters that are the subject of the hearing. The Administrative Law Judge may exclude any evidence that is immaterial, irrelevant, unduly repetitious, or customarily privileged. Rules of evidence shall not be strictly followed."). Therefore, we find no error in the Judge's decision to exclude the evidence.</p>

<p class="noindent">For the General Counsel to obtain a proper remedy, the complaint must specific the relation between the alleged statutory violation and the remedy requested. In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3283 and Spivey</span>, 61 FLRA 426, 426-28 (2005), the complaint alleged that the union violated its duty of fair representation by failing to advise a group of grievants of the criteria used by the union to determine who would receive a monetary award as part of a grievance settlement, but the complaint did not allege that the result of the union's action or inaction was a monetary loss by any of the grievants. Although the union admitted the fair representation allegation by failing to respond to the complaint, FLRA denied the monetary remedy that the General Counsel claimed in its exceptions to the decision of the ALJ. The complaint was insufficiently specific as to the remedial claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint alleges that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1) and (8) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) by failing to advise a group of grievants of the objective criteria used by the Respondent to determine which grievants would obtain a monetary award as part of the settlement of their grievances, and thereby violating the Respondent's duty of fair representation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nineteen unit employees filed grievances concerning their performance appraisals and appraisal scores.&#x2003;The grievances were consolidated by the Respondent for arbitration. The Respondent resolved the grievances by entering into a settlement agreement with the Defense Finance Accounting Service (the Agency) that resulted in monetary awards for 7 of the 19 grievants. Lenda Spivey, one of the grievants who did not receive an award, filed a charge concerning the Respondent's failure to provide any information concerning the details of the settlement and monetary awards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, the General Counsel issued a complaint, which alleged in relevant part that the "[t]he settlement agreement...resulted in a monetary award of $4,178[,] which Respondent determined only 7 of the 19 grievants were eligible to share." The complaint further alleged that "the Respondent violated its duty of fair representation under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) by acting in an irrational, arbitrary and unreasonable manner by not properly and fairly advising the 19 grievants...of the objective criteria the Respondent intended to and did use to determine which employees would obtain a monetary award as part of the Respondent's settlement with the Agency." On the basis of these allegations, the complaint alleged that the Respondent failed to comply with &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) and thereby committed an unfair labor practice in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1) and (8)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the General Counsel alleged in its motion for summary judgment that the Respondent's violation of its duty of fair representation "resulted in a monetary loss for the remaining 12 grievants." However, in the complaint, the Respondent's alleged violation of its duty of fair representation was limited to "'acting in an irrational, arbitrary and unreasonable manner <span class="Italic">by not properly and fairly advising the 19 grievants...</span>of the objective criteria the Respondent intended to and did use to determine which employees would obtain a monetary award as part of the Respondent's settlement with the Agency.'" As such, the alleged violation in the complaint that the Respondent admitted by virtue of its failure to file an answer was solely that the Respondent violated the Statute by failing to "advise" the grievants. The complaint does not allege, and hence the Respondent did not admit, that the alleged failure to advise employees resulted in a loss of pay, allowances, or differentials or that, in any other way, the Respondent violated its duty of fair representation by irrationally, arbitrarily and unreasonably failing to provide monetary awards for the 12 grievants. Thus, nothing in the complaint demonstrates that the 12 grievants are entitled to backpay as a result of the Respondent's failure to advise the grievants of the details of the settlement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Judge did not err in denying the make-whole relief. For the same reasons, we reject the General Counsel's claim that the determination regarding the specific make-whole relief for employees in this case should have been handled as a compliance matter. Similarly, we reject the General Counsel's claims that the Judge's decision not to grant the make-whole relief without conducting further fact-finding is inconsistent with Authority and NLRB case law. For example, the General Counsel's reliance on <span class="Italic">Loring AFB</span> is misplaced. Unlike this case, the consolidated complaint in <span class="Italic">Loring AFB</span> alleged that the union violated the Statute by entering into a settlement agreement that required the distribution of environmental differential pay in a manner that was affected by unlawful considerations of membership and status in the union and/or which treated one or more bargaining unit employees differently from other similarly situated unit employees. 43 FLRA at 1112. In the same vein, the complaints in the Board cases, <span class="Italic">Trade Force, Inc.</span> and <span class="Italic">Alpha American Construction, Inc.</span>, specifically alleged that the respondents violated the National Labor Relations Act by unlawfully refusing to hire and/or to consider for hire applicants because of their involvement in union activities. As noted above, the alleged violation that the Respondent admitted by virtue of its failure to file an answer could not have resulted in a loss of pay, allowances or differentials because the nature of the allegation was solely that the Respondent violated the Statute by failing to "advis[e]" the grievants. Thus, we find that the Judge did not err in concluding that the complaint does not support the General Counsel's request for backpay or further proceedings to determine the specific extent of make-whole relief. Accordingly, we deny the General Counsel's request for backpay or further proceedings.</p>
