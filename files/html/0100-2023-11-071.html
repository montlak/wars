<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-72"><span class="space">4.</span> Other Promotion Information</h4>
<p class="noindent">Moving beyond ranking criteria and crediting plans, unions request other information pertaining to grievances filed by unsuccessful promotion candidates. Whether the information can be obtained depends on a combination of factors considered in cases arising both under &#x00A7; 7114 and in the context of negotiability determinations.</p>
<p class="noindent">When grieving a discriminatory appraisal allegedly designed to injure promotion prospects, a union is entitled to the content of a promotion package needed to make a comparative assessment of promotion material to be used in proving the discrimination. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 21 FLRA 646, 648 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Army Hq., XVIII Airborne Corps and Ft. Bragg and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 34 FLRA 461, 462-63 (1990) (agency was required to provide to union a promotion file for nonbargaining unit job to assist union in determining whether to file grievance concerning failure of agency to properly rank unit applicant). As to a grievance protesting a merit promotion action, the agency did not have to give the union the entire promotion package, including ranking sheets. The grievance protested the failure to post a vacancy announcement and the failure to establish a promotion committee or best qualified list. The agency supplied enough information when it provided a copy of the vacancy announcement and the BQL for the union to determine that both a promotion committee and BQL were established. There was no indication how the additional information requested by the union was necessary. <span class="Italic">DHHS and AFGE Local 1760</span>, 19 FLRA 132, 134-35 (1985). But when it is necessary, specific merit promotion information may be obtained. In the context of promotion grievances, qualification worksheets used with crediting plans may be disclosable upon request of the union. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census and AFGE Local 2782</span>, 24 FLRA 630, 632-33 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Local 476</span>, 43 FLRA 748, 749 (1991) (remanded for additional factfinding in consolidated case of <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Allenwood Fed. Prison Camp and AFGE Council 33, Local 148</span>, 49 FLRA 597 (1994), <span class="Italic">supra</span>). The agency improperly failed to provide to the union "key words" used by management to search or screen applicants through a Resumix system for a nonunit team lead position when several unit members expressed concerns that they did not make the certificate of eligibles for the job. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Air Depot Jacksonville and AFGE Local 1943</span>, 63 FLRA 455 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent">Because of privacy concerns, <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 858 and USDA, FDIC, Kansas City</span>, 42 FLRA 1169, 1175, 1176-80 (1991) (Proposal 2), resolved as nonnegotiable a proposal requiring management to provide to the union unredacted forms showing rating and ranking panels' evaluations of applications for promotion and showing those determined to be best qualified and selected for the positions, along with relative rankings:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Privacy Act regulates the disclosure of any information contained in an agency "record" within a "system of records" that is retrieved by reference to an individual's name or some other personal identifier. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(a)(4), (5) (1982). The Privacy Act defines "record" as "any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency..." and "system of records" as "a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(a)(5)....&#8197;Forms FDIC-473 and AD-735 are records within a "system of records" under the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span>, 13 FLRA at 545-46.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With certain enumerated exceptions, the Privacy Act precludes an agency from disclosing to any person or agency any record which it maintains as a part of a system of records absent a request by, or the written consent of, the person to whom the record pertains. Section (b)(2) of the Privacy Act provides that the prohibition against disclosure is not applicable if disclosure of the information would be required under the FOIA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)(2). Exemption (b)(6) of the FOIA provides that information contained in personnel files, in addition to medical and other similar files, may be withheld if disclosure of the information would constitute a "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(6). Therefore, if the release of Forms FCIC-473 and AD-735 would not constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, disclosure of those forms to the Union would not be barred by the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question, therefore, is whether disclosure of unsanitized copies of Forms FCIC-473 and AD-735 would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy. In determining whether disclosure of the requested forms, including the names of individuals not selected for a position, would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, the employee's right to privacy must be balanced against the public interest in disclosure....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying the balancing test, we look to the public interest embodied in the Statute....&#8197;The "public interest" identified in the Statute is "the <span id="Page_333"></span>facilitation of the collective bargaining process....<span class="Italic">" Id.</span> at 531. We conclude that there is a strong public interest in the disclosure of the requested information. The Union argues that the information is necessary in order to ensure that the Agency adheres to the provisions of the parties' agreement, thereby "protecting the bargaining unit employees' right to fair consideration for positions advertised through the Merit Promotion Plan[.]"...&#8197;Because the Union requested the information for this purpose, we find that the disclosure of the names and relative standings of all employees contained in the Forms FCIC-473 and AD-735 would serve a strong public interest. The disclosure of information needed to ensure that the Agency complies with its responsibilities in administering the selection process is a matter of public concern....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even using only the public interest identified by the Supreme Court in<span class="Italic"> United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press</span>, 489 U.S. 749, 773 (1989) (<span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span>), and taking into account "the nature of the requested document and its relationship to the basic purpose of the FOIA 'to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny,'" <span class="Italic">Dunkelberger v. Department of Justice</span>, 906 F.2d 779, 781 (D.C. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span>, we find that there is a clear public interest in the disclosure of the information requested by the Union in this case. Disclosing copies of forms listing the names and relative ranking of all applicants for a promotion, the rating for each applicant, and whether or not an applicant was selected for the position, would open to public scrutiny the manner in which the Agency administers its selection process and whether the Agency's selection process is administered in a fair and evenhanded manner....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The information required by the proposal pertains to the decisions the Agency makes and the actions the Agency takes in selecting among candidates for a vacant position.&#x2003;Disclosure of that information would open to "public scrutiny" what the Agency is "up to" in its hiring and promotion practices. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span>, 489 U.S. at 772-73. Disclosure of the information would enable the public to assess, for example, whether the Agency is hiring and promoting candidates for a vacancy consistent with applicable law, regulation, and the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employees, however, have significant privacy interests in records concerning their relative standing in the Agency's selection process. In this regard, FPM chapter 335, subchapter 1-4, Requirement 5 and FPM Supplement 335-1, subchapter S5-2.c. provide that an agency, in administering its promotion system, must ensure the protection of an individual's privacy rights and an employee's rating or score must not be made known to anyone who does not have an official need to know an individual's score.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the balancing test to this case, we find that the personal privacy interests of employees whose records are disclosed outweigh the public interest in the blanket disclosure to the Union in its representational capacity of unsanitized documents generated in the promotion process. In <span class="Italic">Federal Employees Metal Trades Council and U.S. Department of the Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California</span>, 38 FLRA 1410 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Mare Island Naval Shipyard</span>), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Federal Employees Metal Trades Council v. FLRA</span>, No. 91-70168 (9th Cir. Mar. 5, 1991), the Authority found that "the public interest in blanket, unsanitized disclosure of all proposed and final disciplinary and adverse actions to the Union, without an expressed particularized need for the information" constituted an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and did not outweigh "the employees' strong privacy interests." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1425. The Authority found that the information requested in <span class="Italic">Mare Island Naval Shipyard</span> was prohibited from disclosure under the Privacy Act....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, Provision 2 requires the blanket release of unsanitized information concerning each applicant's individual rating, selection, nonselection, and relative ranking in the Agency's selection process for promotions. On balance, we find that the privacy interests of the affected employees outweigh the public interest in the disclosure of that information. Consequently, we conclude that the disclosure of Forms FCIC-473 and AD-735 constitutes an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under Exemption 6 of the FOIA and that such disclosure is prohibited under the Privacy Act....&#8197;Accordingly, we find that Provision 2 is inconsistent with law and, therefore, is nonnegotiable under section 7117(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We emphasize that, under our decision, the Union is not foreclosed from requesting specific information, including information that is unsanitized and that concerns employees who have not designated the Union as their representative, under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. In the event that such a request were disputed, the Authority would then balance the competing interests in determining whether disclosure of the information is consistent with law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mare Island Naval Shipyard</span>, 38 FLRA at 1425 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">A union properly requested information concerning claims of racial discrimination in promotions that involved applicants from within and external to the agency. The information was necessary to the evaluation of concerns that merit promotion procedures were violated or misapplied and to a determination of whether to use a statutory or negotiated procedure to raise EEO claims, <span class="Italic">HCFA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 56 FLRA 156, 160-62 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first issue to be resolved is whether the Union's request for information is connected to its representational responsibilities under the Statute. In its information request dated January 14, 1998, the Union stated that it needed information related to a specific vacancy announcement "in connection with a potential grievance." Later, by letter dated March 31, 1998, the Union clarified its need by explaining that it requested the documents because (1) bargaining unit employees alleged that irregularities in the selection process occurred, and (2) the Union was representing one such employee who had filed an informal complaint of discrimination, been issued a Counseling Report, and needed to make an informed election as to the appropriate appeal forum for filing formally. As shown below, we find that the Union's stated use for the documents relates to its representational responsibilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union stated that one of the reasons that it needed the information was to advise the employee with the EEO complaint whether he should proceed through the statutory appeal process or through the negotiated grievance procedure.&#x2003;Before it could advise that employee, the Union had to make a determination as to whether it would be willing to take the individual's case to arbitration at the end of the grievance process. Determining whether to file a grievance is a basic union responsibility under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">INS, Border Patrol</span>, 51 FLRA at 774-76 (union entitled to information to determine if employee complaints about management's assigning policy is "true and correct" and, therefore, grievable).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the MLA expressly contemplates that the Union would advise a bargaining unit employee who was considering filing an EEO claim against the Respondent. It is well settled that the scope of information entitlement under section 7114(b)(4) extends to the full range of representational activity, including contract administration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., FAA, </span>55 FLRA at 258-59; <span class="Italic">U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, Kansas</span> <span class="Italic">City, Missouri, </span>22 FLRA 667, 669 (1986). Therefore, the Union would be using the information to administer the contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Each of the six arguments proffered by the Respondent in support of its first exception lacks merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1. &#x2003;Section 7121(c)(4) Does not Preclude a Grievance Over a Non-initial Entry Appointment</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(c)(4) provides that the scope of a grievance procedure negotiated under the Statute may not extend to any grievance concerning an "examination, certification, or appointment." However, the Authority has held that the term "appointment" in section 7121(c)(4) relates to the initial entry of an applicant into the federal service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense, Dependent Schools, Kaiserslautern, Germany</span> <span class="Italic">and Overseas Education Association, </span>51 FLRA 210, 212 (1995); <span class="Italic">National Council of Field Labor Locals of</span> <span class="Italic">the American Federation of Government Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO and United States Department of Labor</span>, 4 FLRA 376, 381 (1980); <span class="Italic">see also Suzal v. Director,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Information Agency, </span>32 F.3d 574, 580 (D.C. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Brammer v. United States, </span>24 Cl. Ct. 487, 492 (1991). Although the Respondent claims that the action at issue is an "appointment" and thus not grievable, it has offered no reasons why this well-settled Authority and judicial precedent is wrong. Accordingly, we conclude that the Judge properly held that an employee's grievance regarding an external recruitment is not precluded by section 7121(c)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2. &#x2003;Employees Who Apply for New Bargaining Unit Positions Through an External Recruitment Remain "Employees" under the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent cites no authority for the proposition that a bargaining unit employee who applies for a new position does not apply as an "employee" under the Statute, but as an applicant. In any event, Authority case law makes clear that the process that an agency uses to fill vacant positions for which bargaining unit employees are eligible concerns the working conditions of those employees. <span class="Italic">See National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 33 and U.S. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army, Corps of Engineers, Galveston, Texas, </span>47 FLRA 765 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's related argument that complaints about the selection process do not qualify as a "grievance" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9) is also baseless. Although section 7103(a)(9) refers to "any matter relating to the employment of the employee," bargaining unit employees do not cease to be "employees" merely because they apply for a bargaining unit position that is open to non-employee applicants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent relies on <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, National Office, </span>21 FLRA 646, 649 n.3 (1986) for the proposition that an agency has no obligation to provide information for a grievance that is statutorily excluded. However, as shown above, the Respondent has failed to establish that a grievance regarding a recruitment open to bargaining unit and non-employee applicants is precluded either by the definition of "grievance" in section 7103(a)(9) or by section 7121(c)(4). Moreover, <span id="Page_334"></span>grievability questions are for an arbitrator to decide and the existence of such a question does not relieve an agency of its obligation to furnish information. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, National Aviation Support Facility, Atlantic City Airport, New Jersey</span>, 43 FLRA 191, 197 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3. &#x2003;The Application of a Crediting Plan Is not "Specifically Provided For" and, Therefore, Falls Within the Statutory Definition of "Conditions of Employment"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case a bargaining unit employee has claimed that the Respondent has misapplied its crediting plan, and the Respondent does not identify any law that specifically provides how crediting plans are to be applied. Further, even if the Respondent had identified a law, to the extent that that law gave the Respondent discretion with regard to the application of the crediting plan, the matter is not "specifically provided for" by statute and thus is a condition of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">International Association of Machinists and Aerospace</span> <span class="Italic">Workers, Franklin Lodge No. 2135 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing,</span> 50 FLRA 677, 685 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd mem. sub nom. Bureau</span> <span class="Italic">of Engraving &#x0026; Printing v. FLRA, </span>88 F.3d 1279 (D.C. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4. &#x2003;The Union Has the Right to Information Regarding External Recruitment Matters Even Though They Relate to Management Rights to Hire and Select</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if the Union's request relates to matters that are management rights, this case involves the Union's right to information--not the scope of the Respondent's duty to bargain. Although section 7114(b)(4) ties a union's information rights to "the scope of collective bargaining," the Authority has broadly interpreted this statutory phrase. <span class="Italic">See FAA, </span>55 FLRA at 258-59; <span class="Italic">Commander Naval Air Pacific, San Diego, California and</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Air Station, Whidbey Island, Oak Harbor, Washington, </span>41 FLRA 662, 668 (1991); <span class="Italic">see also American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local</span> <span class="Italic">1345 v. FLRA, </span>793 F.2d 1360 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (affirming Authority's interpretation of "scope of collective bargaining"). The Union asks for the information in order to fulfill its contractual role of advising a bargaining unit employee--a purpose "within the scope of collective bargaining." In this regard, the Respondent's reliance on <span class="Italic">General Services Administration, </span>29 FLRA 197 (1987) is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">General Services Administration, </span>the Authority held that a union was not entitled to information in order to draft negotiation proposals concerning the establishment of crediting plans because that matter is outside the duty to bargain. In contrast, here, the Union requested the information not to bargain about external recruitments but to assist an employee who has complained about how a bargaining unit position was filled.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5. &#x2003;The Respondent's Argument Regarding EEO Procedures Lacks Merit</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent incorrectly assumes that an employee with an EEO claim could proceed only through the statutory EEO procedures.&#x2003;Rather, the employee has an option with regard to remedial forum. Further, contrary to the Respondent's assertion, the Union is not asking for information to be used in the EEO forum but rather to advise the employee as to <span class="Italic">which </span>forum--EEO or negotiated grievance procedure--the employee should pursue. <span class="Italic">Library of Congress, </span>19 FLRA 267 (1985), relied upon by the Respondent, merely stands for the proposition that once the employee elects the statutory EEO forum over the negotiated grievance procedure, a union official acting as the employee's personal representative must use EEO procedures, not section 7114(b)(4), to gather information.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">6. &#x2003;The Respondent's Assertion that It Performs External Recruitments through Authority Delegated from OPM Is Irrelevant</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Union does not have a collective bargaining relationship with OPM, it does have a bargaining relationship with the Respondent. Two unit employees who are represented by the Union have alleged that they were harmed by the Respondent's actions. The fact that OPM delegated examining authority to the Respondent does not alter the fact that the Respondent exercised that authority by performing the selection process at issue in this case. <span class="Italic">Cf. Internal</span> <span class="Italic">Revenue Service (District Office Unit), Department Of</span> <span class="Italic">the Treasury, </span>29 FLRA 268, 270-71 (1987) (agency must bargain with union over proposal related to OPM's delegation of examining authority to the agency).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that the Judge properly concluded that the Union's request for information is related to its representational responsibilities and, therefore, is related to a subject "within the scope of bargaining" within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Judge Correctly Determined That the Union Articulated Its Need with Requisite Particularity</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent also argues that the Union's request is not specific enough. Under the Authority's "particularized need" test, the Union must "articulat[e], with specificity, why it needs the requested information, including the uses to which the union will put the information and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute<span class="Italic">." IRS, Kansas City</span>, 50 FLRA at 669.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union Vice President's clarified request to the Respondent, dated March 31, 1998, satisfies the particularity requirement. Referring to a specific vacancy announcement for a bargaining unit position, the request clearly informs the Respondent that the Union needs the information for two reasons: (1) to determine whether the Respondent wrongfully rated and ranked the applications of bargaining unit employees; and (2) to advise a bargaining unit employee regarding the proper forum to bring an EEO claim--an advisory role recognized in the MLA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent complains that the Union failed to articulate what "act or failure to act [the] Respondent is alleged to have committed" and to "identify any specific promotion policy/procedure or any law or regulation that was alleged to have been misapplied or violated." The Union, however, has explained in its request that bargaining unit employees believe that they were rated and ranked incorrectly. To require the Union to describe the exact nature of the alleged irregularities is asking too much of the Union. In essence, the Respondent is asking the Union to describe the potential contents of documents it has not seen<span class="Italic">. See AFGE, Local 2343 v. FLRA, </span>144 F.3d 85, 89 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (citing <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, 50 FLRA at 670 n.13).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Union has provided sufficient information to allow the Respondent "to make a reasoned judgment" concerning disclosure. We agree with the Judge that the Union has established a "particularized need" and has sufficiently articulated its need for the information requested in order to advise the employee with the EEO claim as to the appropriate filing forum.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before its change in approach to materials covered by the Privacy Act, FLRA ruled in <span class="Italic">BATF and NTEU</span>, 18 FLRA 611, 614-15 (1985), that the agency should have provided to the union the successful applicant's unredacted qualification form to permit comparison with the grievant's qualifications. Additionally, on request, the agency should have provided information as to other qualified applicants to permit evaluation of whether the selection was based on merit. That information included the unsuccessful applicants' prior employment records (employers, length of service, and places), the names of the educational and training institutions attended by the applicants and dates of attendance, and the weight assigned to each factor evaluated by the rating panel. There was no requirement to provide names of the unsuccessful applicants and names of the raters or selecting officials. The names were not needed to determine if the selection process was fair. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DLA, Defense Contract Admin. Servs. Region, Boston and NAGE</span>, 31 FLRA 800, 800-01 (1988) (agency should have released documents in promotion file and personal qualifications statement of individual selected for position).</p>
<p class="noindent">The union could require negotiations over proposals to have management supply names of employees of state organizations or other entities working with agency employees. The agency used those individuals to fill agency slots, with an impact on promotion opportunity. Unit employees trained the state employees. It was necessary to know the identity of the state employees to understand their evaluations. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3748 and USDA, ARS</span>, 23 FLRA 160, 163 (1986). Also negotiable was Proposal 9 in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1482 and DOD, DMA, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr., Louisville</span>, 45 FLRA 52, 88-89 (1992), requiring management to retain records concerning promotions for one year, including the announcement, the list of interested employees, paperwork provided by the employees, and a list of employees selected for positions. This information would then be available to the union. The union allowed the employer to redact information if its disclosure would violate the Privacy Act.
