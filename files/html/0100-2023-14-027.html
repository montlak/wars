<h5 class="h5" id="sec7-28"><span class="space">b.</span> Employee's Tax Problem--IRS, Other Agencies; Responsibility for Errors of Others</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Taxpayers and the IRS view with disfavor IRS employees who fail to file their returns or pay their taxes. Congress responded to those concerns with legislation providing for the mandatory penalty of removal for IRS employees who fail properly to abide by defined tax obligations. In <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 104 MSPR 345, 348-352 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-16, 2007 MSPB 4 (2007), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 244 Fed. Appx. 349 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), the Board noted that IRS may rely on the statutory process or it may rely on other authority to discipline an IRS employee, but if the latter route is followed, the Board is not blocked from considering the penalty under a <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> mitigation analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency contends that the AJ erred in not sustaining Charge 1 because she improperly required it to prove that the appellant violated Sections 1203(b)(8) and (b)(9) of the Restructuring and Reform Act (RRA) of 1998, 26 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7804, which proscribe willful misconduct. It asserts that the appellant was charged in the alternative with violating Section 1203 or other rules, which do not require a showing of intent. It thus argues that, even if the appellant's actions were not willful, they still violated the ethical rules and warranted removal. Citing <span class="Italic">LaChance v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 147 F.3d 1367 (Fed. Cir. 1998), it contends that it was permitted to allege alternative statements of fact to support a charge--one including an intent element and one not--and did not need to prove both alternatives to prevail. It asserts that, because the AJ determined that the appellant did not submit a complete return by April 15, 2003, she should have concluded that the appellant did not timely file her return, regardless of whether the appellant acted willfully or not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1203(a) of the RRA provides that the IRS Commissioner shall terminate the employment of any IRS employee "if there is a final administrative or judicial determination that such employee committed any act or omission described under subsection (b) in the performance of the employee's official duties." Section 1203(b)(8) proscribes "willful failure to file any return of tax required under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 on or before the date prescribed therefor (including any extensions), unless such failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect." Section 1203(b)(9) proscribes "willful understatement of Federal tax liability, unless such understatement is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that it was not required to prove that the appellant violated the RRA to prove Charge 1. Charge 1, as written, did not require the agency to prove willful misconduct. Rather, it simply charged the appellant with "[f]ailure to timely file a personal federal income tax return." Moreover, in the underlying specification, Operations Manager Janice Carter, the proposing official, stated that the appellant "willfully failed to file" her 2002 return by April 15, 2003, but that, even if she "did not willfully fail to timely file," she "still filed [her] return after the due date." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Carter further stated that she was charging the appellant "<span class="Italic">in the alternative</span>." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis in original). She explained that she was charging the appellant with violating either Sections 1203(b)(8) and (b)(9) of the RRA or "other laws, rules or regulations." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Concerning the latter, she identified Section 2635.809 of the Office of Government Ethics Standards of Ethical Conduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Section 2635.809 states, in part, that "[e]mployees shall satisfy in good faith their obligations as citizens, including all just financial obligations, especially those such as Federal, State, or local taxes that are imposed by law." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.809.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, Field Director Charles Washington, Jr., the deciding official, noted that the agency charged the appellant in the alternative with violating either "1203 provisions and/or provisions of other laws, rules or regulations." Washington determined that the appellant's removal was warranted "in accordance with Section 1203 of RRA '98, as well as the Office of Government Ethics Standards." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Indeed, the AJ recognized that the appellant had been charged in the alternative. ID at 2-3. Thus, as the agency asserts, it was not required to prove that the appellant acted willfully to sustain Charge 1. <span class="Italic">See LaChance</span>, 147 F.3d at 1372-73.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the agency that it proved Charge 1 by showing that the appellant did not submit a complete return by April 15, 2003. The AJ found "plausible" the appellant's testimony that she mailed the return on April 15, 2003." She further found, though, that there was no evidence that the appellant originally submitted a "complete return, i.e., one to which the Schedule EIC was properly attached," and that it was more likely true than untrue that the appellant did not provide the agency with the Schedule EIC until she resubmitted her return in May 2003. (emphasis in original). The AJ found that the omission of the Schedule EIC rendered the appellant's return untimely under the agency's policy. ID at 7. The record supports the AJ's finding. Therefore, we sustain Charge 1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency argues that the Board lacks authority to consider the reasonableness of the penalty because the appellant was covered by two settlement agreements, which required her to timely and properly file her tax returns and pursuant to which she waived her Board appeal rights. It thus contends that, once the AJ determined that the appellant had failed to properly file her 2002 return, thereby violating the settlement agreements, the AJ lacked authority to review the penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the agency that the settlement agreements preclude Board evaluation of the penalty in this case. The Board is required to review the agency's decision in an adverse action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency; the Board may not substitute what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis. <span class="Italic">E.g., Akers v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 270, &#x00B6; 7 (2005). Moreover, it is error for an agency to rely on matters affecting the penalty it imposes without including those matters in the proposal notice. <span class="Italic">E.g. Von Muller v. Department of Energy</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 91, &#x00B6; 20 (2006). Here, the notice of proposed removal did not even mention the settlement agreements. Therefore, the agency has failed to show that the AJ should not have independently considered the penalty because of the settlement agreements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues that the Board lacks authority to independently review the penalty because the AJ found that the appellant violated Section 1203(b)(9) of the RRA, which subjected her to mandatory removal under Section 1203(a). Citing <span class="Italic">James v. Tablerion</span>, 363 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the agency asserts that the Board lacks authority to review the penalty under those circumstances. In <span class="Italic">Tablerion</span>, our reviewing court found that the IRS Commissioner is required to impose the removal penalty for forms of behavior specified in Section 1203 and that the Commissioner's determination is final and not subject to judicial review. <span class="Italic">Tablerion</span>, 363 F.3d at 1359; <span class="Italic">see also Akers</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 270, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the record does not establish that the agency relied on the RRA's procedures in removing the appellant. The "Guide to Section 1203 of the IRS Restructuring &#x0026; Reform Act of 1998" states that "[I]f the deciding official concludes after the oral/written reply that a &#x00A7; 1203 violation did occur, removal is required and the case must be forwarded through AWSS Personnel Services to the Commissioner's &#x00A7; 1203 Review Board [CRB] for mitigation consideration." In accordance with that procedure, Carter stated in the proposal notice that the record would be forwarded to the CRB for consideration of any appropriate mitigation if the deciding official determined that the appellant had violated the RRA sections. But Washington did not forward his decision to the CRB for review. Moreover, he considered the Board's factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981), in determining whether removal was an appropriate penalty. Such consideration would have been unnecessary if removal was mandatory. Therefore, because the record does not indicate that the Commissioner or the CRB made any determination in this case, we find that the Board is not precluded from considering the reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Cf. Akers</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 270, <span id="Page_2315"></span>&#x00B6; 8 (finding that the Board's authority to review the penalty was limited where the CRB found that mitigation was inappropriate).[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] The AJ's previously noted determination that the appellant "willfully understated her tax liability," might be deemed to satisfy the RRA's requirement of an "administrative determination" sufficient to invoke the mandatory removal provisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 26 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7804(a). Given the evidence that the agency did not rely on the RRA's mandatory removal procedures in removing the appellant, we believe that it would be inappropriate for the Board to do so. In any event, we need not address that issue in this case because we find that the agency proved removal was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board sustains all of an agency's charges, the Board may mitigate the agency's original penalty to the maximum reasonable penalty when it finds the agency's original penalty too severe. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The Board will defer to an agency's penalty decision unless the penalty exceeds the range of allowable punishment specified by statute or regulation, or the penalty is "so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">Batten v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 222, &#x00B6; 9 (2006) (quoting <span class="Italic">Parker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 819 F.2d 1113, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1987)). That is because the agency has primary discretion in maintaining employee discipline and efficiency. The Board will not displace management's responsibility, but will instead ensure that managerial judgment has been properly exercised. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 9. Mitigation is appropriate only where the agency failed to weigh the relevant factors or the agency's judgment clearly exceeded the limits of reasonableness. The deciding official need not show that he considered all the mitigating factors. The Board will independently weigh the relevant factors only if the deciding official failed to demonstrate that he considered any specific, relevant mitigating factors before deciding upon a penalty. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the ID shows that the agency weighed the relevant factors in deciding to remove the appellant. <span class="Italic">[S]ee Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06. Specifically, the AJ cited Washington's statement that he considered the appellant's conduct to be very serious, considering her position; that he believed that her conduct was intentional; that her conduct created a question about her credibility that affected the agency's trust in her ability to perform her job; and that the penalty was consistent with the penalties imposed in other similar cases. He acknowledged that the appellant had more than 5 years of service and that he was not aware of any work performance problems. He noted, though, that she had received two prior disciplinary actions, including a last-chance settlement agreement; that she was clearly on notice of the agency's rules; that he did not believe that rehabilitation was likely given her prior progressive discipline; and that she had not made him aware of any mitigating circumstances. The AJ correctly found that the seriousness of the misconduct, the appellant's prior disciplinary record, the provisions of the settlement agreements, and the provisions of the RRA militated against mitigating the penalty. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 11-12; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Casteel v.

<p class="Body-Text">In an appeal predating the 1998 Restructuring and Reform Act, the Board examined nexus as to the charge against an IRS GS-7 Tax Technician accused of failing to timely pay balances due for two income tax returns. Discipline was justified, but removal was excessive. The Board mitigated to a 60-day suspension, <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 8 MSPR 317, 318-21 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant was removed from his position of Tax Technician, GS-7, with the Internal Revenue Service, based on charges that he failed to timely pay balances due on his 1977 and 1978 Federal Income tax liabilities of $83.00 and $263.45 respectively. Such failure constitutes a violation of the agency's Handbook of Employee Responsibilities and Conduct, IRM 0735.1, Section 223.6. He appealed to the Board's New York Regional Office, and a hearing was held. The presiding official found the agency action was supported by a preponderance of the evidence and was taken for such cause as would promote the efficiency of the service. The removal was accordingly sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, appellant stipulated as to the accuracy of the charges against him but argues that his removal was not for such cause as would promote the efficiency of the service. The agency responds that the petition for review does not meet the criteria for review under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have held that in actions taken under 5 USC Chapter 75 for conduct occurring while the employee is off-duty, a determination must be made as to whether a nexus exists which links the misconduct with the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Merritt v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 6 MSPB 493, 509, 6 MSPR 585, 605 (1981). This determination must be based on evidence of such a link or on a presumption which may arise, <span class="Italic">id</span>. "In considering whether such a presumption arises, 'the nature of the particular job as much as the conduct allegedly justifying the action has a bearing on whether the necessary relationship obtains.[1] '" Consideration of the nature of the job encompasses not only the composite duties but also the overriding purposes of the employer. <span class="Italic">See Wild v. HUD,</span> 7 MSPB 434, 7 MSPR 595 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Gallagher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 6 MSPB 482, 484, 6 MSPR 572, 576 (1981), quoting <span class="Italic">Doe v. Hampton,</span> 566 F.2d 265, 272 n.201 (D.C. Cir. 1977). These cases only recognize the obvious--to have a logical inference that alleged conduct impairs the efficiency of the service, both the conduct and the position must be considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Obviously the above mentioned considerations cannot be applied mechanistically. If the relationship between the conduct and the employee's job is readily apparent, a presumption of nexus is easily drawn. In <span class="Italic">Masino v. U.S.,</span> 589 F.2d 1048, 218 Ct. Cl. 531 (1978), a U.S. Customs Inspector was discharged for transporting and using marijuana. The Court said, "the transportation and use of the very contraband which a law enforcement officer is sworn to interdict, is clearly misconduct which 'speaks for itself.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1056, 218 Ct. Cl. 531. <span class="Italic">See also, Wild v. HUD, supra; Gibson v. Dept. of Justice,</span> 7 MSPB 405, 7 MSPR 561 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where the conduct is not so easily related to a particular job duty or agency goal, a presumption may still arise if the nature of the conduct has serious implications as to some aspect of the employee's character which may be deemed to substantially erode the employer's ability to depend on the employee. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Gamble v. Postal Service,</span> 6 MSPB 487, 6 MSPR 578 (1981), we found a presumption of nexus, which went unrebutted, even though appellant's conduct, welfare fraud, did not directly impair performance of his specific janitorial duties. The offense, defrauding the government of public funds, was one which would reasonably give the employer substantial cause to question whether the employee could be given the trust necessary to perform his job. <span class="Italic">See also Embrey v. Hampton,</span> 470 F.2d 146 (4th Cir. 1972). The Board noted, however, that "commission of a crime does not necessarily reflect on the honesty of an individual <span class="Italic">vis a vis</span> his employment. When an agency makes such a claim...it must necessarily prove the elements of an offense which raises [such] a presumption...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant failed to timely pay Federal income taxes for 1977 and 1978. As an employee of the department which collects such taxes, the Internal Revenue Service, a connection between the offense and his employment is immediately obvious. But, in <span class="Italic">Monterosso v. Dept. of the Treasury,</span> 6 MSPB 573, 577, 6 MSPR 684, 690 (1981), we found nexus lacking because the employee was a mail clerk who had incurred tax liability as a result of income realized only constructively, and the agency's own collection branch had determined the tax bill to be uncollectible considering the appellant's necessary expenses as compared to his annual salary of $10,877. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 577, 6 MSPR 690.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, however, the appellant is a Tax Technician whose duties include auditing tax returns, and he had been previously reprimanded in October 1977 for being similarly delinquent on his 1976 taxes. Therefore, considering appellant's conduct and position (including the agency's mission), we presume a link between such conduct and the efficiency of the service. Further, we agree with the fact findings of the presiding <span id="Page_2316"></span>official and conclude that appellant has not rebutted the presumption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our consideration of this case does not end here, however, since even though there is a proper disciplinary offense, removal may not be reasonable....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[E]ven when the Board does find an agency penalty to be excessive, the corrected penalty to be specified by the Board is not necessarily one which in the Board's view would be the "best" or "most reasonable" penalty, but rather the maximum penalty that the Board would find to be "within the parameters of reasonableness."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, in this case, that removal is unreasonable. Aggravating factors in this case are: the prior warning given appellant; the position he held; and the fact that he could have changed the amount of tax withheld from his salary. On the other hand, appellant filed his return timely,[4] there is no charge that he failed to compute his tax liability correctly, the amounts due were relatively small, and appellant did pay the amounts due in installments. Further, a suspension would be sufficient to impress the seriousness of his conduct on appellant and to deter such conduct by others. Therefore we find that the penalty of removal was unreasonably harsh under the circumstances, and conclude that a sixty-day suspension would be the maximum reasonable penalty in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Compare Giles v. U.S.</span>, 553 F.2d 647, 213 Ct. Cl. 602 (1977) where a revenue agent was removed for failure to file tax returns for three years, <span class="Italic">with Boyce et al. v. U.S.,</span> 543 F.2d 1290, 211 Ct. Cl. 57 (1976), where two lower-level employees were discharged for unintentionally filing tax returns late. The Court dismissed plaintiff's petition in <span class="Italic">Giles</span> but found the penalty to be unconscionably disproportionate to the offense in <span class="Italic">Boyce</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Davis</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Gibbs v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 21 MSPR 646, 648-51 (1984), involving removal, mitigated to a suspension, of an IRS criminal investigator who was not timely in his tax payments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant also argues that the presiding official erred in finding a nexus between the sustained charges and the efficiency of the service. In particular, appellant cited <span class="Italic">Boyce v. United States,</span> 543 F.2d 1290, 211 Ct. Cl. 57 (1976), where, under the facts in that case, it was found that removal was unconscionably disproportionate to the charge of failing to file tax returns in a timely manner. In that regard, however, the court in <span class="Italic">Boyce</span> noted that some penalty was warranted and that case does not support a finding that a nexus for such a charge is not present. Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> the Board outlined the bases for a finding of nexus where a Tax Technician failed to timely pay tax balances owed during two consecutive years. An almost identical situation exists here, where appellant's position was Criminal Investigator. The agency relies on voluntary compliance from all taxpayers and it is of paramount importance that its employees comply with the tax laws so as to maintain the image and the integrity of the agency. Appellant's position requires numerous contacts with the public, and appellant's job duties demand that he display familiarity with the tax laws. The agency has clearly shown a connection between the employment with the IRS and adherence to the tax laws. Accordingly, the presiding official's finding of nexus was proper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In considering the penalty in this case, it should be noted that penalties in comparable cases involving Internal Revenue Service employees have been reviewed by the Board previously. One distinguishing factor has been whether an employee's action was a deliberate effort to decrease his taxes and whether personal gain was involved. In that regard, removal was held to be appropriate for offenses such as overstating deductions or understanding income. <span class="Italic">Rotolo v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 636 F.2d 6 (1st Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Hoover v. United States,</span> 513 F.2d 603, 206 Ct. Cl. 640 (1975); <span class="Italic">Monaco v. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service,</span> 15 MSPR 727 (1983). Removal has also been found not to be too harsh for a revenue officer's failure to timely file tax returns for three different years, including one year when a state income tax return was never filed. <span class="Italic">Giles v. United States,</span> 553 F.2d 647, 213 Ct. Cl. 602 (1977). Nevertheless, in <span class="Italic">Boyce,</span> cited previously, removal was found to constitute an abuse of discretion for a failure to timely file federal tax returns by tax clerks who did not act intentionally and were not benefitted by their shortcomings. It should be noted in this case that there is no evidence that appellant tried to decrease his tax liability.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The 1981 <span class="Italic">Davis</span> decision mentioned <span class="Italic">Boyce v. United States</span>, 543 F.2d 1290, 1293, 1295 (Ct. Cl. 1976). The court interceded to avoid removal of low-level IRS employees who innocently failed to timely file returns that they thought would be prepared and filed by their spouses and that would result in refunds:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, on balance, it is extremely doubtful that plaintiffs knowingly, intentionally and wilfully failed to file tax returns in a timely manner. The charges against plaintiffs were for failure to file returns in a timely manner, <span class="Italic">not</span> for wilful failure to file and <span class="Italic">not</span> for a wilful attempt to evade taxes. As in the <span class="Italic">Power</span> case [<span class="Italic">Power v. United States</span>, 531 F.2d 505 (Ct. Cl. 1976)], defendant fails to show that the amount of taxes involved is anything but <span class="Italic">de minimis.</span> Indeed, it appears that all of Mrs. Dixon's returns involved refunds. Many, if not most, of Mrs. Boyce's returns also involved refunds. It is incredible to believe that one would intentionally delay filing a tax return in order to delay receipt of a tax refund.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, both plaintiffs argued and the IRS never rebutted the fact that they delegated their filing responsibility to their husbands. While such reliance obviously cannot be justified, this shortcoming goes to proof of guilt--not to the propriety of the penalty. While plaintiffs cannot evade responsibility for their failure to timely file by reliance on their husbands, such reliance does relate to the wilfulness of their action. In the present circumstances, such reliance demonstrates that plaintiffs' failures were not intentional, but arose from a misguided belief that their husbands would "take care of" the returns. Such conduct cannot be sanctioned, but in imposing a penalty for such conduct, the agency must take some notice of the realities of modern life, the complexities involved in filing tax returns, the fact that most returns by married individuals are joint returns, and that generally, one spouse will rely on the other to execute the forms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even the Internal Revenue Code demonstrates a leniency for "unsuspecting spouse." Section 6013(e) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that in certain circumstances, the spouse who did not know or have reason to know of an omission of income and did not derive substantial benefit therefrom, will be relieved of liability. Certainly the instant case provides a close analogy to this philosophy of leniency expressed in the Code.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the nature of plaintiffs' employment presents a clear inference that any shortcomings were not knowing, intentional or wilful. Mrs. Boyce was a seasonal GS-2 data transcriber, and Mrs. Dixon a GS-3 file clerk. One cannot say...that they knew it was improper to rely upon their husbands to file the tax returns. This is not the case of an audit agent or a managerial employee who intentionally claims deductions or expense to which he is not entitled. (<span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Hoover v. U.S.,</span> 513 F.2d 603, 206 Ct. Cl. 640 (1975)). This is the case of two low-level IRS employees who improperly, but without intent to hurt the Government, relied on their husbands to file their tax returns.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we come to what appears to be the real basis for the CSC's reversal of the BAR: deterrence and concern with the public image of the IRS. The IRS letter requesting the CSC reopening stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I believe these two appeal decisions will establish dangerous precedent for us in the important tax area. * * * Neither the employee who knowingly fails in his tax responsibilities nor the employee who is grossly negligent in attending to them belongs in an agency whose mission is the collection of taxes. * * * [Letter from IRS Comm'r. Donald C. Alexander to CSC Chairman Robert E. Hampton, Aug. 23, 1973 at 10.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the <span class="Italic">Power</span> case, defendant attempted to justify removal based on a goal of deterrence. We stated that "[d]eterrence can be an effective method of preventing fraud upon the Government." This is true. The matter is even more crucial when we are confronted with misconduct by IRS employees. Theirs is a highly visible agency which is "rightly concerned with the image of honesty and integrity." <span class="Italic">Birnholz, supra,</span> 199 Ct. Cl. at 537; <span class="Italic">Hoover, supra,</span> 513 F.2d at 606, 206 Ct. Cl. at 646. However, as we stated in <span class="Italic">Power,</span> a penalty can be so harsh as to "effectively ruin defendant's goal of deterrence."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Should a powerful government agency seek the severe penalty of dismissal for every <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> offense, not only might the goal of deterrence suffer, but potential employees might equally be deterred from seeking positions with the agency. Further, a reputation for gross unfairness generated by such dismissals could have a much more harmful <span id="Page_2317"></span>impact on the public image of the IRS than would carrying a person on the payroll who has failed to file income tax returns.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, imposing the same penalty on two low-level employees who unintentionally fail to file tax returns in a timely manner by relying on their spouses, as on an IRS tax technician who "culpably, for his own benefit" overstates tax deductions creates a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, an unconscionably disproportionate penalty aids neither the goal of deterrence nor the image of the IRS....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Monaco v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 15 MSPR 727, 730 (1983), a taxpayer service specialist was removed for failing to file proper income tax returns. She defended on the basis that the returns were prepared by her husband and that she was unaware of the income not reported by her spouse when he prepared the returns. The Board determined there was adequate nexus, noting that the public's confidence in and compliance with IRS taxing authority could be reduced if it became publicly known that the IRS knew of and tolerated tax evasion by employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's four year delinquency in understating her Federal Income Tax could reasonably be deemed, by the agency, to undermine its heavy reliance on voluntary compliance with the tax laws. As the court stated in <span class="Italic">Rotolo v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 630 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1980), "If it became publicly known that the IRS knew of and tolerated tax evaders as employees...the resulting cynicism or disbelief in IRS's law enforcement effectiveness might logically reduce to some degree public compliance with revenue laws." Further, the Board notes that in cases involving the penalty which should be imposed on an IRS employee who fails to pay a valid tax due, substantial consideration must be given to the employee's position and tax knowledge. <span class="Italic">See Giles v. United States,</span> 553 F.2d 647, 213 Ct. Cl. 602, 608 (1977); <span class="Italic">Boyce v. United States,</span> 543 F.2d 1290, 211 Ct. Cl. 57, 63 (1976); <span class="Italic">Hoover v. United States,</span> 513 F.2d 603, 206 Ct. Cl. 640 (1975). Appellant was not a clerical employee who would not be expected to know about tax law and obligations, but was a professional employee who advised taxpayers on obeying the law. Her work involved aiding taxpayers who came to the agency for assistance in filing tax returns and she had gone through extensive training programs in all facets of tax law. In addition, she had served in the GS-9 position for 5 years at the time of her removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the severity of the penalty of removal, <span class="Italic">Monaco</span> determined that the offense was not <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, involving about $2,000 of tax liability, and that the employee was not a clerical employee who could not be expected to know about tax law, but a professional employee who advised taxpayers on obeying the law. As to her culpability, without discussing the underlying facts, the Board accepted the AJ's determination that she was at least grossly negligent in failing to report the dividend and interest income. Gross negligence was sufficient to warrant removal under the circumstances. Board affirmance of an IRS clerk's dismissal for underreporting taxable income for several years was sustained in court: the nexus between the employee's conduct and the dismissal supported by the possibility of bad publicity for the agency and the possibility of noncompliance with tax laws if the public learned that the IRS employee underreported income and suffered no administrative penalty. <span class="Italic">Rotolo v. MSPB</span>, 636 F.2d 6 (1st Cir. 1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Micali v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 56 MSPR 127, 133 (1992), sustained adverse action after the Board considered the likely knowledge of the tax code by the appellant, a GS-13 Criminal Investigator responsible for planning and conducting tax evasion cases, and accepted the deciding official's testimony that the appellant's failure fully to report spousal income required removal because "the appellant's position required him to testify in court against alleged tax evaders, and the charged conduct...would be a basis for impeaching his testimony and compromising such tax cases."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nexus between an employee's position and his tax problems need not be particularly strong to sustain adverse actions, as was demonstrated in an appeal of a supervisory police officer of the Treasury Department, <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 56 MSPR 224, 236-37 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining that a 120-day suspension is the maximum reasonable penalty in this appeal, we have considered the appellant's contention in his cross petition for review that the agency failed to establish a nexus between his position as a Supervisory Police Officer and the charge of failure to file his Federal income taxes for tax years 1985 to 1988. He argues that the Board generally finds nexus in tax-related misconduct cases where the appellant has a tax-related position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no merit to this contention.... [T]he Board has found nexus in tax-related misconduct cases even where the appellants concerned did not occupy tax-related positions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, 32 MSPR at 363-66; <span class="Italic">Eilertson</span>, 23 MSPR at 153-59; <span class="Italic">Brandt</span>, 22 MSPR at 37-40. In this case, we find that the administrative judge fully addressed the issue of nexus in the initial decision and correctly concluded that a nexus exists between the appellant's misconduct and the efficiency of the service. As the administrative judge noted: (1) Although the appellant's responsibilities did not involve tax-related matters, he was employed by a division of the Department of Treasury, which is involved in tax collection; (2) because of his position as a law enforcement officer, he is held to a higher standard of conduct than other employees; and (3) the agency reasonably concluded that public confidence in the agency would be undermined if it did not discipline the appellant for his tax-related misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nevertheless, <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, 56 MSPR at 234-36, explained that nexus does not alone make the case; mitigating factors will be considered:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency contends that the administrative judge erred by mitigating the removal penalty. The administrative judge mitigated the penalty to a 90-day suspension based on the following reasons: (1) The agency failed to prove its specification that the appellant "repeatedly" failed to file his Federal income tax returns for the 4 years alleged, since it proved only 1 instance of such failure; (2) the deciding official stated in her deposition that she based her decision to remove the appellant primarily on his failure to file his tax returns; (3) although the deciding official asserted that she considered the relevant mitigating factors, she also stated in her deposition that she felt that only removal was appropriate for tax evasion; (4) the appellant had made substantial payments for the years in which he was in arrears on his taxes; (5) the appellant's attempts to repay his taxes, albeit belated, began many months prior to the initiation of the agency's adverse action and were not in response to any action or threat of action by the agency; (6) the appellant had 30 years of Federal service, including 10 years with the agency; (7) he had no prior disciplinary record; (8) his work record was exemplary; (9) the agency did not have a uniform policy for addressing tax infractions and, although the evidence did not disclose disparate treatment, four other employees who had taxes levied against them received only counselings; (10) the absence of "a well-publicized, consistent [agency] policy in treating tax levies" was indicated "by the appellant's confident, and perhaps too trusting appeal for assistance from his supervisor" when he thought that the tax levy deduction from his paycheck was a mistake and by his ready admission to his supervisor of his tax problems; (11) the record indicated that the appellant received the agency's Minimum Standards of Conduct in 1989, but does not indicate that he received it earlier, and, in light of its inconsistent approach to its employees' tax problems, the agency did not show that the appellant was clearly placed on notice of the charged misconduct; (12) the appellant's potential for rehabilitation was good because he assumed his responsibility for paying his back taxes before the matter was brought to the agency's attention; and (13) the most significant specification of the charge was not sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not identified any relevant factor that the administrative judge failed to consider. In view of our finding above that the second specification of the charge is sustained in part, however, we find it necessary to review the appropriateness of the penalty....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the agency relies on <span class="Italic">Brandt v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 36 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 856 F.2d 202 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table), and <span class="Italic">Eilertson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 23 MSPR 152, 159 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 770 F.2d 179 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table), to support its imposition of the removal penalty. These cases are distinguishable from the instant case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Brandt</span>, the appellant was a GM-14 Operations Research Analyst who was removed after revocation of his top security clearance based on a felony conviction for tax evasion, which involved his fraudulent understating of his 1978 taxable income by $10,119.72, thereby reducing his tax liability by $4,715.28.... In the instant case, the appellant was neither convicted nor charged with fraud. In <span class="Italic">Eilertson</span>, the employee was an Aerospace Engineer who was removed for submitting a false document in connection with his employment, i.e., an "exempt" W-4 withholding certificate, which he was not entitled to file, and for bringing discredit upon the Federal service.... The Board found there that removal was appropriate because the falsification charge was serious and, in itself, would warrant removal, and, in addition, it was coupled with the second charge, which involved the appellant's open defiance of the tax laws and the publicity he sought and received.... In the instant case, there is no charge of falsification or discredit brought upon the Federal service by open and public defiance of the tax laws and, as previously noted, a number of mitigating factors exist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, in view of the additional partly-sustained specification, the nature and seriousness of the misconduct, and the appellant's law enforcement position with the agency, we find that a 120-day suspension is the maximum reasonable penalty. <span class="Italic">See Mitchell v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 362, 363-66 (1987) (while the employee occupied a law enforcement position as a Postal Police Officer, his removal based on a conviction of tax evasion and on filing false information on a W-4 tax withholding statement was unreasonable in view of the existing relevant mitigating factors, and a 60-day suspension was the maximum reasonable penalty).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Conviction for tax evasion was not sufficient to support removal of a postal police officer. The agency did not prove that the appellant's conduct tended to embarrass or bring disrepute to the Postal Service. Removal was reduced to a 60-day suspension for other related violations of the agency's code of conduct. <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 362, 366 (1987). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-023.html#sec7-24">Failure to Pay Debt</a>" for the <span class="Italic">Monterosso</span> decision.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Eilertson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 23 MSPR 152, 159 (1984), sustained removal of an <span id="Page_2318"></span>aerospace engineer based on publicity caused by appellant's litigation over means he was said to have employed to reduce or avoid taxes. The appellant filed a false or misleading W-4 form, conduct the Board viewed as creating the impression that the appellant was defrauding the government. The appellant was acquitted of related criminal charges, but the Board felt that attendant publicity had a substantial adverse impact on the service and that removal was justified because of the discredit brought on the agency by a serious offense. The Board did not state in other than conclusory terms the impact of the publicity. <span class="Italic">Williams v. SSA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20091109130">586 F.3d 1365</a> (Fed. Cir. 2009), determined that sufficient nexus existed between the employment of an SSA employee and his involvement in filing a false tax return listing the social security numbers of children that were not those of the appellant. The charge was properly sustained based on the agency's concerns about identity theft and the potential access in the future of the appellant to social security numbers through his work. The appeal was remanded to the Board to consider a penalty disparity assertion involving the agency's actions as to an arguably similarly situated coworker.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Taylor v. DOJ</span>, 60 MSPR 686, 690-96 (1994), synthesized decisions(predating the 1998 Restructuring and Reform Act) concerning actions against employees with tax problems. Removal was excessive for a security programs specialist who was not involved in the taxation process as part of his job and who made some technical errors as to the filing of tax documents:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant and the agency seek support for their respective positions in precedential adverse action cases involving an employee's failure to comply with federal income tax laws. The Court of Claims and the Board have upheld removals for an employee's failure to comply with tax laws where the employees themselves, as part of their duties, were charged with ensuring taxpayers' compliance with the Internal Revenue Code.[5] The present appeal is distinguishable from these cases, insofar as neither the appellant, nor the division of the agency where he worked, were responsible for enforcing tax laws.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Giles v. United States,</span> 213 Ct. Cl. 602, 553 F.2d 647 (1977), the court upheld the removal of a GS-11 IRS revenue officer for his failure to file or to timely file state and federal income tax returns for three consecutive years. In <span class="Italic">Hoover v. United States,</span> 206 Ct. Cl. 640, 513 F.2d 603 (1975), the court upheld the removal of an IRS tax technician for overstating tax deductions for two years; there was substantial evidence that some of the improper deductions had been deliberately claimed. In <span class="Italic">Monaco v. Dept. of the Treasury,</span> 15 MSPR 727 (1983), the Board upheld the removal of a GS-9 IRS Taxpayer Service Specialist based on her having understated her income for four consecutive years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other cases involving an employee's failure to comply with tax laws, the Board has considered all of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and has ordered an agency to substitute a suspension for a removal, even where the employee's duties included enforcing tax laws.[6] These cases support the appellant's argument that the penalty of removal is too severe. As we explain below, the appellant paid his taxes on or about the date they were due, despite his failure to file tax returns for three consecutive years; the appellants in <span class="Italic">Mitchell, Gibbs,</span> and <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> by contrast, did not make timely payment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 32 MSPR 362 (1987), the Board ordered the agency to substitute a 60-day suspension for a dismissal, where a Postal Police Officer had been convicted of income tax evasion and reporting false information on a W-4 withholding statement. In <span class="Italic">Gibbs v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 21 MSPR 646 (1984), the Board mitigated the removal of a GS-11 IRS criminal investigator to a 60-day suspension, where the investigator had failed to pay his taxes in a timely manner. In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of the Treasury,</span> 8 MSPB 17, 8 MSPR 317 (1981), the Board mitigated the removal of a GS-7 tax technician for failure to timely pay income taxes to a 60-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The obligation to file federal income tax returns is imposed by statute. 26 USC &#x00A7; 6012 (1988). The appellant's failure to file returns is therefore serious. The deciding official, however, went beyond the offense itself to consider what he evidently thought to be an aggravating factor, namely, that the appellant's tax had been "underwithheld" for 1989 and 1990 and that "there were obligations due and owing" for those years. The administrative judge also remarked that, for 1989 and 1990, "there were taxes due that had not been paid."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official and the administrative judge misinterpreted the evidence. The appellant filed IRS form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, for tax year 1988 dated April 17, 1989. The form indicates that the appellant concurrently remitted $4000 which, along with income tax withheld by the appellant's employer in 1988, satisfied his self-estimated tax liability for 1988. The appellant's remittance with the automatic extension request was a payment of tax due for the year to which the extension request related....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant paid his 1989 and 1990 income tax in a similar fashion....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the deciding official either did not recognize, or gave very little consideration to, the fact that no personal gain redounded to the appellant as a result of his failure to file his tax returns. The appellant did not lie to the IRS, and he did not profit nor attempt to profit from his actions. Notwithstanding his failure to file tax returns, which admittedly was serious, the appellant's conduct bespeaks an effort to avoid underpaying his taxes. In fact, according to the appellant, the IRS has issued him a refund and has determined not to impose any penalty for the late filing of the returns.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dept. of the Treasury,</span> 56 MSPR 224 (1993), the Board unanimously held that the maximum reasonable penalty for a Supervisory Police Officer's failure to make timely payment of income taxes for four consecutive years and failure to file an income tax return for one of those years was a 120-day suspension (the agency had removed him). That decision was based on many considerations unique to that case, <span class="Italic">see</span> 56 MSPR at 234-36, but Crawford's misconduct was, in some respects, even more serious than that of the appellant herein. We acknowledge that the appellant herein did not file tax returns for three years, whereas Crawford failed to file a tax return only once. Unlike Crawford, though, the appellant attempted to avoid underpaying his taxes. Whereas Crawford accumulated underpayments, penalties, and interest exceeding $10,000, <span class="Italic">see</span> 56 MSPR at 227, 232, the appellant herein made an overpayment that, when it was applied to subsequent years, resulted in a substantial refund, and the IRS did not assess any penalties against him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, in support of the Board's conclusion in <span class="Italic">Crawford</span> that the penalty of removal was too severe, we noted that the offense at issue in that appeal did not involve fraud, misrepresentation, or open and public defiance of the tax laws. 56 MSPR at 236. Similarly, the appellant herein did not attempt to defraud the government, did not make misrepresentations in connection with his income taxes, and did not attempt to evade his obligation to pay income taxes. Again, he made substantial excess payments covering the years at issue on or about the time that the payments were due. While a failure to file income tax returns is serious, it is not as serious as it would be if it were coupled with a failure to make the required payments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Many of the remaining <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors weigh in favor of mitigation, or at least are not present as aggravating circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on his duties, the appellant was aware of the importance of filing tax returns. Nonetheless, the filing of, or failure to file, tax returns is off-duty conduct not directly related to the appellant's duties as a Security Programs Specialist. The appellant was not employed by the IRS, and he was not responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official found that the agency's confidence in the appellant's ability to perform his duties had been destroyed. According to the agency, though, on one occasion the appellant discovered, during the course of reviewing a background investigation of an agency employee, that the employee had an outstanding tax lien and had failed to pay his taxes; the appellant referred the matter to the personnel office for resolution, as he was supposed to do. The agency's loss of confidence in the appellant's objectivity and effectiveness in reviewing background investigations therefore seems unwarranted. It should be stressed that the agency does not allege that the appellant's personal failure to file income tax returns ever caused him not to perform, or to perform negligently, his duties as a Security Programs Specialist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's failure to file income tax returns, by contrast, was off-duty conduct not directly related to his current duties involving the review of background investigations. Again, we note that the appellant has not been charged with failing to perform his duties in the latter position. Also, neither offense involved lying or deception. The deciding official was not required to "discount" the conduct that led to the 1989 suspension because it was unrelated to the appellant's failure to file tax returns, <span class="Italic">cf. Slaughter v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 56 MSPR 349, 357 (1993), but neither should he have ignored the fact that the two offenses were committed in different settings and implicated different government interests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the appellant occupied a prominent position, that he had extensive contact with the public, or that his conduct has generated adverse publicity for the agency. Further, the IRS has not had to resort to litigation or other collection activity which might impact adversely upon the agency's reputation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official stated that the penalty of removal was consistent with the agency's table of penalties, but he did not identify which of the 28 offenses listed in the agency's table the appellant committed. "Failure to file tax returns" does not appear on the table, and we are unable to determine with certainty what the deciding official considered the appellant's offense to be. The deciding official also gave no explanation of how the penalty chosen relates to the table's general scheme of increasingly severe penalties for repeated infractions. We therefore have no basis for concluding that the penalty of removal is consistent with the agency's table of penalties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2319"></span>Under the circumstances, the penalty imposed was excessive. The appellant was a 19-year federal employee with a nearly unblemished record, effectively performing his duties as a Security Programs Specialist when he was removed for off-duty conduct which was not directly related to his position and which was not motivated by a desire for personal gain. We conclude that a 90-day suspension is the maximum penalty within the parameters of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">James v. Tablerion</span>, 363 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2004), applied provisions of the tax code requiring termination of any IRS employee who threatens to audit a taxpayer for personal gain or benefit.</p>
