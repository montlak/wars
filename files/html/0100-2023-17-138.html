<p class="noindent">According to <span class="Italic">NATS and Dept. of Transp.</span>, FAA, 61 FLRA 558, 559 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority has held that arbitrators have broad discretion in fashioning appropriate remedies, and an arbitrator is not required to provide a remedy for every violation of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Cleveland Reg'l Office, Cleveland, Ohio</span>, 59 FLRA 248, 252 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring and Member Pope dissenting on other grounds). However, where law requires a particular remedy, an arbitrator's failure to award that remedy is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3134</span>, 56 FLRA 983, 984 (2000) (failure to award interest on backpay found contrary to Back Pay Act).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Locals 222 and DHUD</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-147.html">72 FLRA 738</a>, 741 (2022), added:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Where an arbitrator finds that a party has committed an unfair labor practice, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's judgment and discretion in the determination of the remedy.[49] Therefore, unless a party establishes that a particular remedy is compelled by the Statute, the Authority upholds the arbitrator's remedy determination unless the determination is "a patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the [Statute]."[50] Here, the Union does not point to any law, rule, or regulation requiring the Arbitrator to award a notice-posting remedy. And the Union does not assert, or provide any basis for finding, that the Arbitrator's denial of a posting was a "patent attempt to achieve ends other than those which can fairly be said to effectuate the policies of the [Statute]."[52] Therefore, the Union does not demonstrate that the Arbitrator's failure to order a notice posting is contrary to law.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator did not err in requiring the Agency to post a notice.&#x2003;Even though the parties never addressed a notice posting as a potential remedy, Authority precedent gives arbitrators broad discretion to fashion remedies. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Okla.

<p class="noindent">A posting was appropriate when an arbitrator determined that the agency failed adequately to monitor its dues withholding obligations.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority when he resolved a statutory issue and ordered a posting remedy that was not submitted to arbitration.&#x2003;Specifically, the Agency claims that the Union's arguments, both at the hearing and in its post-hearing brief, focused only on the violation of the parties' agreement and did not address a statutory violation.

<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Wage &#x0026; Investment Div. and NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA 235, 243-44 (2011), an arbitrator properly set up a claims procedure to resolve entitlements of employees under the award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority under the parties' agreement by impermissibly altering it in violation of Article 43, Section 4.A.18. Specifically, the Agency contends that, under Article 43, Section 1.B.2, discipline and performance appraisal issues must be litigated in the expedited grievance procedure. Moreover, it asserts that, under Article 43, Section 1.B.3, overtime issues must be litigated in a "streamlined" grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. By considering claims regarding discipline, performance appraisals, and overtime, the Agency contends that the Arbitrator altered the agreement. However, the Agency cites nothing in the parties' agreement that prevents the consideration of these claims as part of a remedy awarded in the type of arbitration utilized by the parties. Additionally, the Agency has cited nothing in the award that suggests that the parties would be submitting disputed claims to the Arbitrator for resolution rather than resolving the disputes themselves. <span class="Italic">See </span>Award at 29 (generally stating that employees could submit claims for consideration and compensation). Indeed, even the Agency acknowledges that the Union will "submit claims to the Agency." Moreover, even if the Arbitrator were the one resolving disputed claims, there is no indication in his award that he would be resolving any underlying grievances. Rather, he would be doing nothing more than determining "whether individual employees have been adversely affected by the Agency's unilateral change in any actionable way." Thus, the Arbitrator would solely be determining whether certain harms were a result of the Agency's actions. Accordingly, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority under the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3267</span>, 64 FLRA 547, 550 (2010) (party failed to establish that arbitrator exceeded his authority under parties' agreement because it did not prove that arbitrator's actions were prohibited by agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relying on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, the Agency asserts that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by retaining "jurisdiction over deciding the claims submitted during the individual claims period." Exceptions at 26 (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 29 FLRA at 1578-80). In <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, the arbitrator ordered the agency to cease and desist from filing grievances over official time and mandated that all union grievances concerning official time and related <span id="page_1910"></span>issues would be heard by him for the duration of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, </span>29 FLRA at 1577-78. The Authority found this portion of the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 1578-80. The Arbitrator's actions in this matter are distinguishable from those of the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>. As stated above, nothing in the award suggests that the parties will be submitting disputed claims to the Arbitrator for resolution rather than resolving these claims themselves. Again, the Agency acknowledges that the Union will "submit claims to the Agency." Moreover, even if the Arbitrator were to resolve these claims, there is no indication in the award that he would be resolving any underlying grievances. Rather, he would be doing nothing more than determining "whether individual employees have been adversely affected by the Agency's unilateral change in any actionable way." Thus, the Arbitrator would be determining solely whether certain harms were a result of the Agency's actions. Finally, contrary to the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, the Arbitrator here did not retain indefinite jurisdiction or prohibit either party from selecting other arbitrators to resolve related grievances after his jurisdiction expired. <span class="Italic">AFGE </span>is thus inapposite. Accordingly, we deny the Agency's claim.</p>

<p class="noindent">The remedy ordered by the arbitrator must be reasonably related--it must have "a sufficient nexus"--to the management right affected by the remedy and the violation leading to the remedy.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found remedies deficient as contrary to section 7106(a) when they were based on collective bargaining agreement provisions that did not relate or pertain to the management right affected by the ordered relief<span class="Italic">.

Thus, when a remedy awarded by an arbitrator affects a management right, there must be a sufficient nexus between the management right affected by the remedy and the violation for which the remedy provides relief. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span>; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1122</span>, 34 FLRA 323, 327-28 (1990) (in raising a performance rating, an arbitrator must reconstruct what the rating would have been if management had properly appraised the grievant).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we agree with the Agency that the Arbitrator's remedy was based solely on his finding that the Agency failed to properly administer its performance appraisal system because it did not comply with the FPM requirements pertaining to the identification of job elements, the establishment of performance standards, and management's appraisal of employees under performance appraisal systems. In this regard, the Arbitrator cited no source other than the FPM for his determination that outside applicants should not have been selected over the grievant. We find no evidence of any reliance by the Arbitrator on Article 10, Section 1-A of the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The remedy awarded by the Arbitrator, based on his finding that the Agency failed to properly administer its performance appraisal system, affects management's exercise of its rights to hire and make selections for appointments. However, compliance with performance appraisal requirements does not pertain generally to hiring and making selections for appointments, and the Arbitrator has not explained any such connection in this case. As a result, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency failed to properly administer its performance appraisal system is insufficient to support the Arbitrator's order that the grievant be selected for the next appropriate full-time vacancy. Consequently, the Arbitrator's order is contrary to management's rights to hire and select under sections 7106(a)(2)(A) and (C) of the Statute, and we strike the order.</p>
<p class="noindent">A constraint on the creativity of arbitral remedies was expressed in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and AFGE Local 48</span>, 53 FLRA 1445, 1446-49 (1998) (Member Wasserman dissenting): the remedy may not exceed the parameters of the issue that is stipulated by the parties or stated by the arbitrator. The arbitrator may not fashion a remedy to meet a nonexistent issue. FLRA implied that arbitrators need to frame issues broadly if they seek to provide creative remedies:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency assigned the grievant, a WG-05 Fabric Worker, to work with two WG-09 Fabric Workers from November 1, 1991, through November 30, 1993. At the end of November 1993, the Agency reassigned the grievant to his previous position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance "claiming that the grievant ha[s] not been paid the proper pay grade from November 1, 1991, [through] November 30, 1993." The parties did not resolve the grievance and went to arbitration, stipulating the issue as:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Did the [g]rievant perform the Wage Grade 9 [d]uties of a Fabric Worker from November 1, 1991, through November 16, 1993? If so, what should the remedy be?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the award, the Arbitrator reframed the issue as:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Was the [g]rievant, a WG-05[&#8197;] Fabric Worker, doing WG-09[&#8197;] Fabric Worker work for WG-05 [w]orker pay? If so[,] what is the appropriate remedy?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator effectively held that the grievant had not performed the work of a WG-09 Fabric Worker for the 2-year period. The Arbitrator determined that the grievant had performed some WG-09 work during the 2-year period, but stated that "to say that the grievant should have been given a temporary [promotion to the WG-09 level] is probably too much a stretch of the facts."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator then went on to state that "[h]owever, it is also clear that the [g]rievant did perform, on a regular basis, WG-7 level work" during the 2-year period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had failed to pay the grievant at the WG-07 level, and that such a failure violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement. The Arbitrator ordered the Agency to give the grievant a temporary promotion to WG-07 Fabric Worker and backpay with interest for the 2-year period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator exceeds his or her authority when the arbitrator fails to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolves an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregards specific limitations on his or her authority, or awards relief to persons who are not encompassed within the grievance. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Base, Norfolk, Virginia and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 22</span>, 51 FLRA 305, 307-08 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An example of an arbitrator exceeding his authority is found in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2798</span>, 24 FLRA 447 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Administration</span>). The issue before the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Administration</span> was whether the agency's termination of the grievant complied with the parties' collective bargaining agreement and applicable laws and regulations. The arbitrator concluded that the agency's action did not violate the collective bargaining agreement or applicable laws and regulations, but nonetheless went on to order the agency to inform the grievant of agency vacancies and to allow him to apply for those vacancies. The Authority held that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by failing to confine his decision and any possible remedy to the issues submitted as he unambiguously framed them. <span class="Italic">See Veterans Administration</span>, 24 FLRA at 451.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying the principles set forth above and concluding that the arbitrator exceeded his authority, the Authority stated the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The arbitrator clearly specified the issue on the merits to be whether the grievant's termination was in violation of the collective bargaining agreement or applicable law and regulation and, if so, what remedy [was] appropriate. When the [a]rbitrator answered precisely that issue by concluding that the grievant's termination did not violate the agreement or any applicable law and regulation, the [a]rbitrator had decided the merits of the issue submitted to him. By further ruling that the grievant be informed of and be allowed to apply for agency vacancies and directing the remedial relief...<span class="Italic">the [a]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">rbitrator exceeded</span> <span class="Italic">his authority by deciding, and awarding a remedy</span> <span class="Italic">concerning[,]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic"> an issue not submitted to</span> <span class="Italic">arbitration</span>....&#8197;<span class="Italic">Arbitrators may legitimately</span> <span class="Italic">bring their judgment to bear in reaching a fair</span> <span class="Italic">resolution of a dispute as submitted to or</span> <span class="Italic">formulated by them, but they may not decide</span> <span class="Italic">matters which are not before them</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's rationale in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span> applies here. The Union and the Agency stipulated the issue: Did the grievant perform WG-09 Fabric Worker duties from November 1, 1991, through November 16, 1993, and, "[i]f so, what should the remedy be?" The Arbitrator reframed the issue as whether the [g]rievant was doing WG-09 Fabric Worker work for WG-05 Fabric Worker pay, and, "[i]f so[,] what is the appropriate remedy?" The Arbitrator answered the stipulated issue, stating that to find that "the grievant should have been given a temporary [WG-09] position <span id="page_1911"></span>is probably too much a stretch of the facts." When the Arbitrator answered that issue by concluding that the grievant was not entitled to a promotion to the WG-09 level, he, like the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Administration</span>, had decided the stipulated issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span>, 24 FLRA at 451.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although he found that the grievant was not entitled to a temporary promotion to the WG-09 level, the Arbitrator did not deny the grievance. Instead, he awarded the grievant a temporary promotion to a WG-07 Fabric Worker and backpay with interest for the 2-year period. By finding that the grievant had regularly performed WG-07 work and should be compensated at that level for that work, the Arbitrator, like the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span>, "exceeded his authority by deciding, and awarding a remedy concerning an issue not submitted to arbitration<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.[2] In so doing, the Arbitrator exceeded his authority.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;The fact that the Arbitrator found a violation of the agreement regarding the WG-07 matter and awarded a remedy, whereas the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Administration</span> did not find any agreement violation but nonetheless awarded a remedy, is not a pertinent distinction with respect to whether the arbitrators exceeded their authority. The relevant point is that in both cases, the arbitrators addressed and resolved an issue that the parties did not submit to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;We respectfully disagree with our dissenting colleague's description of the award as extending to "'issues that necessarily arise from the issues specifically included in [the] submission agreement' or the stipulated issue," quoting <span class="Italic">Air Force Space Station</span>, 24 FLRA at 519. As reflected in the award, the Arbitrator's resolution of the stipulated issue did not require him to consider the additional issue of whether the grievant performed WG-07 work. Rather, he addressed that additional issue only after resolving the stipulated issue. In this regard, we note that the deference accorded to the Arbitrator's interpretation of the submission agreement applies to his framing of the issue, in the absence of a stipulation by the parties. <span class="Italic">See Air Force Space Station</span>, 24 FLRA at 519 (the arbitrator framed the issue based on competing versions presented by the parties and he decided the issue that he framed). In the instant case, as relevant here, the issue that the parties stipulated is the same as the issue the Arbitrator framed, and neither one required him to address the issue that he went on to decide.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In our view, finding this award deficient is not inconsistent with the Authority's treatment of discipline awards--the analogy suggested by the dissent. Here, the Arbitrator found that the Agency did not commit the act complained of by the grievant. In discipline cases, after finding that the discipline of a grievant violates the just cause provision of a collective bargaining agreement, an arbitral remedy reducing the discipline--from, for example, a 1-day suspension to a written reprimand--is not deficient if it reconstructs what management would have done had management acted properly. <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C</span>. <span class="Italic">and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 201</span>, 53 FLRA 146, 154 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We do not believe that our decision "imposes a limitation on the Arbitrator's authority to an extent that does not further good labor-management relations." The limitation on the Arbitrator's authority was determined by the parties when they stipulated the issue. Had they intended the Arbitrator to consider additional or different issues, they could have so stipulated or left to the Arbitrator the determination of the issues to be resolved. In the absence of the parties having done so, effective labor-management relations are best furthered in our view by having the Arbitrator resolve only the clear issue that was stipulated to him.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, FDA and NTEU Chap. 210</span>, 54 FLRA 90, 95 (1998), partially set aside an award when the arbitrator defined a remedy in terms of an issue not presented to him:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...When the Arbitrator addressed the issue by concluding that the union was not entitled to off-site meetings on bank time, he, like the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span>, had decided the issue presented. <span class="Italic">See Veterans Administration</span>, 24 FLRA at 451.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although he found that the Union was not entitled to have its grievance sustained on the issue as he defined it, the Arbitrator awarded the union another remedy for a violation that he found with respect to the adequacy of union office space. While the Arbitrator's additional finding of a violation of Article 10 is tangentially related to the issue submitted to him insofar as it might explain the union's motivation for wanting to meet off-site, the question of the adequacy of office space was not presented for resolution by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator's sole charge was to determine whether "bank time" could be used for off-site meetings. The Arbitrator, like the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span>, "exceeded his authority by deciding, and awarding a remedy concerning an issue not submitted to arbitration<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. In so doing, the Arbitrator exceeded his authority.</p>
<p class="noindent">Relief must be reasonably related to a contract violation. A determination that the agency was contractually obligated to enter into a new contract for health services for employee access did not justify a remedy of reimbursement of medical costs employees incurred when they lost access to the local medical units, <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRBU</span>, 72 FLRA 226, 230 (2021) (Chairman DuBester dissenting in part; Member Abbott concurring):</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...[T]he Arbitrator found that the Agency's violation of Article 23, Section 4 required it to reimburse the grievants' medical expenses and to restore their access to the health units. Because the Arbitrator found that the parties' agreement requires the Agency to provide the Union with access to the health service units, the remedy requiring the Agency to enter into a new contract for health services reasonably and proportionally relates to the Agency's violation of Article 23, Section 4. However, to require the Agency to reimburse the grievants for medical expenses they obtained elsewhere goes far beyond the Agency's duty to provide access to the health service units. Article 23, Section 4 never required the Agency to pay for employees medical costs, but instead, only required the Agency to provide "reasonable opportunity to visit Agency-authorized health service units," and that "such visits will be permitted without charge to annual leave, compensatory leave, or leave without pay." Consequently, the Arbitrator's remedy requiring medical reimbursement does not reasonably and proportionally relate to the Agency's violation of the parties' agreement and it is vacated.[46]...</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n the absence of a stipulated issue, the Arbitrator in this case framed the issue as whether the Agency violated the parties' agreement by not promoting the grievant.

The Arbitrator concluded that the Agency did not violate the parties' agreement as alleged and that the Union had not established that the Agency discriminated against the grievant based on her race. These conclusions resolved the merits of the issue, which the Arbitrator unambiguously framed, in favor of the Agency, and therefore, a remedy was not warranted in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that while the Agency's obligations under its affirmative action plan may be related to the question of whether the Agency violated the parties' agreement by not promoting the grievant, the Agency's compliance with those obligations, as a general concern, was not an issue presented to the Arbitrator for resolution.

<p class="noindent-1">In assessing the Agency's contention, we reexamine Authority precedent on the bounds of an arbitrator's remedial authority. The Authority has held that arbitrators lack the power to award relief to individuals who were not encompassed within a grievance because doing so would be akin to deciding an issue that was not submitted to arbitration.[15] Thus, arbitrators must limit their remedies to the individuals involved in a dispute. However, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, U.S. Corps of Engineers, Northwestern Division</span> (<span class="Italic">Corps</span>), the Authority held that, even if parties include an explicit time limitation in the issues for arbitration, an arbitrator may direct an "agency to comply with [a] violated contract provision in conducting <span class="Italic">future actions</span>."[16] In other words, the Authority in Corps held that arbitrators need not limit their remedies to the time period specified in a dispute.</p>

But he also awarded additional relief that concerned only future performance assessments. Applying our newly revised standard, we find that, because the Arbitrator expressly limited the issues before him to performance assessments in 2015 and 2016, he exceeded his authority by awarding additional relief for future years.[23] Therefore, we grant this part of the Agency's exceeded&#8209;authority exception and set aside the portion of the remedies that concerned only future assessments.</p>

Corps</span>, 65 FLRA at 136 (Dissenting Opinion of Member Beck) (explaining that more generally formulated issues, without an express time limitation, could have supported prospective relief, but the parties limited the issues statement to May 2009, thereby constraining the arbitrator's remedial authority).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Arbitrator's direction to change the grievant's performance rating does not excessively interfere with management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that the evaluation of employee performance is an exercise of management's rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute,[33] and the Agency argues that the award violates those rights because it changes the grievant's performance ratings. For several reasons discussed further below, the Agency asserts that the award fails to satisfy the standards for evaluating management&#8209;rights claims under <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP</span> (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>).[35]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</span>, 71 FLRA 387, 390 (2019) (<span class="Italic">Comptroller</span>) (Member DuBester dissenting, in part) ("[T]he right to evaluate employee performance extends to the determination of the rating that management will assign to a given employee." (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 47 FLRA 705, 710 (1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[35]&#x2003;70 FLRA 398, 405-06 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At step one of <span class="Italic">DOJ's</span> three&#8209;part framework, the question is whether the Arbitrator found a violation of a contract provision.[36] The Agency argues that the Arbitrator did not find a contract violation. But the Arbitrator found that the Agency incorrectly faulted the grievant for a backlog without citing any applicable standard for backlogs or backlog reduction. And to support that finding, the Arbitrator relied on Section 5(D), which states, "[i]f there are numeric performance standards[,] they will be clearly identified in the employee's performance plan." Thus, the Arbitrator found a violation of Section 5(D), and the answer to the first question is yes.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[36]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Comptroller</span>, 71 FLRA at 390 (citing <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 70 FLRA at 405) (finding that <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> applied to management&#8209;rights challenge to an arbitrator's direction to raise a performance rating).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At step two, the question is whether the Arbitrator's remedy reasonably <span id="page_1913"></span>and proportionally relates to the contract violation.[40] The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the procedures set forth in Section 5(D) of the collective&#8209;bargaining agreement when it lowered the grievant's job&#8209;knowledge rating based on an alleged backlog standard that was not clearly identified. As relief, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to revise the flawed assessments so that the grievant received a level&#8209;five rating in the job&#8209;knowledge element for 2015 and 2016. This relief reasonably and proportionally relates to the contract violation,[43] so the answer to the second question is yes.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[40]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Comptroller</span>, 71 FLRA at 390 (citing <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 70 FLRA at 405). The Agency claims that the portion of the remedies that concerned only future assessments is not reasonably and proportionally related to a violation of Section 5(D). Exceptions Br. at 9. But because we have already set aside that portion of the remedies, this claim is moot.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[43]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Comptroller</span>, 71 FLRA at 390 (where arbitrator found that agency lowered grievant's performance rating based on factors that were not part of her performance standards, remedy that required "set[ting] aside the flawed rating and...chang[ing] the grievant's rating" to a higher level was reasonable and proportional).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third question is whether the Arbitrator's remedy excessively interferes with management's rights.[44] The Authority has previously held that an arbitral direction to raise a performance rating "<span class="Italic">without finding that the grievant's...performance actually supported</span>" a higher rating excessively interfered with the rights to direct employees and assign work.[45] By contrast, here, the Arbitrator made credibility determinations and factual findings to support his conclusion that the grievant's performance merited level&#8209;five ratings in the job&#8209;knowledge element, due to the procedures established in Section 5(D).[46]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[44]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 70 FLRA at 405).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[45]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 391.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[46]&#x2003;Award at 5 (crediting grievant's testimony regarding her performance, crediting Agency witness's testimony regarding number of bulleted criteria that had to be satisfied to earn a level&#8209;five rating, and evaluating grievant's performance relative to four bullets under job knowledge); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. (finding "no specific evidence" supported Agency's backlog allegation against grievant).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator excessively interfered with management's rights by "reweigh[ing]" evidence.[47] We reject that argument because, under the Authority's previous decision on this question, an arbitrator <span class="Italic">must</span> evaluate pertinent evidence before directing a changed performance rating.[48] In other words, the Arbitrator did not excessively interfere with management's rights by undertaking the very analysis that the Authority's precedent required of him. The Agency also argues that the Arbitrator "merely substituted his judgment for the [A]gency's." In fact, the Agency argued before the Arbitrator that he should apply a "preponderance of the evidence" standard to decide the dispute over the grievant's rating, and the Arbitrator adopted and applied that standard. In addition, the Agency had the opportunity to provide evidence to establish that the procedures in Section 5(D) of the collective&#8209;bargaining agreement were met, but the Arbitrator found that the Agency's case suffered from "an amazing paucity of information...to support" its assessments of the grievant. Further, we have rejected the Agency's nonfact challenge to the Arbitrator's evaluation of evidence that supported his direction to change the grievant's ratings. Thus, the answer to the third question is no.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[47]&#x2003;Exceptions Br. at 8; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 9&#8209;10. The Agency's management&#8209;rights exception also relies on its Personnel Policy Manual, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 9 n.10, and an argument that the Arbitrator lacked the power to "impose[&#8197;] a particular score or rating...without first finding that the appraising official would have given [the grievant] that score had [the appraising official] properly followed the contract," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 8 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing, Wash., D.C</span>., 53 FLRA 146, 154 (1997)). But the record does not show, and the Agency does not assert, that it presented either the manual or this argument below, so we do not consider them. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2425.4(c), 2429.5.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[48]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Comptroller</span>, 71 FLRA at 390-91 (setting aside remedy of changed performance rating where the arbitrator did not "find[&#8197;] that the grievant's...performance actually supported" that rating (emphasis omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Agency has not shown that the award violates management's rights to direct employees and assign work, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA set aside portions of a remedy directed by an arbitrator who was considering the denial of a step increase for a single individual but who directed the agency to post a notice concerning future situations involving application of the performance appraisal system and who also issued a broad requirement concerning future supervisory training, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Exec. Office for Immigration Review and AFGE Local 3525</span>, 65 FLRA 657, 663-64 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrators exceed their authority when they fail to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolve an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregard specific limitations on their authority, or award relief to persons who are not encompassed within the grievance. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Base, Norfolk, Va.</span>, 51 FLRA 305, 307-08 (1995). The Authority has held that if a grievance is limited to a particular grievant, then the remedy must be similarly limited.[11] <span class="Italic">See U.S. EPA</span>, 57 FLRA 648, 651-52 (2001) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Logistics Ctr., Tinker Air Force Base, Okla.</span>, 45 FLRA 1234, 1240-41 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Tinker AFB</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;However, where an agency's treatment of a grievant constitutes an unfair labor practice (ULP) in violation of the Statute, the Authority has upheld notice posting remedies. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev., L.A. Field Office, L.A., Cal.</span>, 64 FLRA 383, 386 (2010) (upholding notice posting where arbitrator found agency's discipline of union president was a ULP). Neither party has alleged that this case involves a ULP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue before the Arbitrator was limited to whether the Agency acted improperly "in giving <span class="Italic">the grievant </span>her annual performance appraisal[.]" That is, the grievance was limited to the Agency's actions toward the grievant. Thus, as explained below, we find that the award is deficient to the extent that two of the Arbitrator's remedies extend to additional employees. <span class="Italic">See Tinker AFB</span>, 45 FLRA at 1240-41.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the notice posting remedy, the Authority has held that where the parties submitted to an arbitrator the issue of whether the agency had violated the parties' agreement in its actions towards one employee, the arbitrator exceeded his authority by directing the agency to post a notice defining the rights of all bargaining unit employees. <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 57 FLRA at 651-52. Similarly, here, because the notice that the Arbitrator directed the Agency to post promises employees that the Agency will adhere to the PAP and that supervisor animus will not influence future performance appraisals for any employee, it defines rights for individuals who were not included in the grievance. Accordingly, we find that this remedy is deficient because it exceeds the Arbitrator's authority. <span class="Italic">See EPA</span>, 57 FLRA at 651-52.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also challenges the training remedy imposed by the Arbitrator.&#x2003;The Authority has upheld a remedy requiring training for the supervisor(s) whose actions impermissibly affected a grievant's conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Flight Test Ctr., Edwards Air Force Base, Cal.</span>, 48 FLRA 74, 87 (1993) (Member Talkin concurring) (arbitrator awarded sexual harassment training for the supervisor who sexually harassed grievant and the supervisor who failed to investigate the grievant's harassment complaints); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, U.S. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pa.</span>, 39 FLRA 1288, 1300-01, 1305 (1991) (arbitrator awarded "sensitivity training" for supervisor who violated parties' agreement by failing to give proper attention to grievant's medical concerns), <span class="Italic">petition for review dismissed sub nom. U.S. Dep't of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 981 F.2d 1339 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Here, however, the awarded remedy of training for the grievant's supervisor <span class="Italic">and </span>"all other supervisors who serve as rating or reviewing officials under the PAP" would affect the working conditions of employees beyond the grievant. Accordingly, we find that the remedy of training is deficient to the extent that it applies to individuals other than the grievant's supervisor<span class="Italic">.
