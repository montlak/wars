<p class="Body-Text">Of overpayment recovery appeals, <span class="Italic">Carter v. OPM</span>, 32 MSPR 553, 555-56 (1987) (Chairman Levinson dissenting as to whether the waiver ran to an estate, prohibited by 5 CFR 831.1406(a)(2)), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b), recovery of an annuity payment may not be made when the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. The purpose of this provision is to avoid the hardship that can result from the recovery of an overpayment from a blameless recipient. <span class="Italic">See Shannon v. Civil Service Commission,</span> 444 F. Supp. 354, 358 (N.D. Cal. 1977), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part and rev'd in part,</span> 621 F.2d 1030 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Recovery of an annuity overpayment may be waived when the annuitant is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1401. Recovery is against equity and good conscience when it would cause financial hardship to the person from whom it is sought. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403. Financial hardship may be deemed to exist where the annuitant from whom collection is sought needs substantially all of his or her current income and liquid assets to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1404; <span class="Italic">see Gomez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 612, 614 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bayly v. OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 524, 525 (1990), outlined the criteria for evaluating when recovery of an overpayment would be against equity and good conscience:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1401, OPM may waive recovery of an annuity overpayment when (a) the annuitant is without fault and (b) recovery would be against equity and good conscience. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403, recovery is against equity and good conscience under the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;[Recovery] would cause financial hardship to the person from whom it is sought;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The recipient of the overpayment can show (regardless of his or her financial circumstances) that due to the notice that such payment would be made or because of the incorrect payment either he/she has relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Recovery could be unconscionable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has issued <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> in which it has provided more detailed instructions regarding the circumstances under which recovery is considered to be against equity and good conscience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">MSPB reviews the facts and equities of situations to determine if overpayments to annuitants are to be waived when the appellant is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. <span class="Italic">Martinez v. OPM</span>, 26 MSPR 315 (1985) (widow's explanation was credited that she had no way of knowing of overpayments to her deceased husband's separate account, and considering the meager assets available to the widow). MSPB will review disputes concerning amounts of overpayments. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v. OPM</span>, 26 MSPR 502 (1985). In its resolution of those disputes, the Board will consider OPM's documentary evidence and contrary testimony or evidence from the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wisecup v. OPM</span>, 30 MSPR 191, 192 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An element for OPM to consider is the fault of the appellant contributing toward an overpayment. <span class="Italic">Cool v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 270, 271 n.3 (1986), noted the OPM regulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. 831.1402(a), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Considerations. Pertinent considerations in finding fault are--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The applicable regulations place the burden of establishing entitlement to a waiver of an overpayment on the appellant. 5 C.F.R. 831.1407 provides "The recipient of an overpayment must establish by <span class="Italic">substantial evidence</span> that he/she is eligible for waiver or an adjustment." (emphasis added). While there is no definition of "substantial evidence" under the OPM regulations, the Board's regulations define "substantial evidence" as being "relevant evidence which a reasonable mind, considering the record as a whole, might accept as adequate to support a conclusion that the matter asserted is true." 5 C.F.R. 1201.56(c)(1) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(p)] .</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grabis v. OPM</span>, 424 F.3d 1265 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (when an annuitant's disputed personnel action was settled with what amounted to a back pay award, the annuitant knew or should have known, for purposes of overpayment recovery, that he should have held for refund to OPM the annuity payments he received during the period covered by the backpay award; fault would not be excused by the agency's failure to deduct those funds from the back pay settlement amount); <span class="Italic">Brown v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 352, 357 (1990) ("Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1402(a)(2), however, a recipient may be found at fault if he failed to disclose facts he '<span class="Italic">should have known</span> to be material,' whether or not he knew for a fact that they were material."); <span class="Italic">Higginbotham v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Warrender v. OPM</span>, 691 Fed. Appx. 629, 631-33 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP), involving the frequent problem of annuitants who receive Social Security benefits after OPM informs them they should report the payments to OPM so they can be deducted from FERS annuity payments or, if necessary, set received payments aside to repay duplicate payments to OPM, provides the analysis often used in overpayment appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM may recover an overpayment from a recipient who is not eligible for waiver. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1401. A recipient is eligible for waiver if (a) he or she is "without fault" and (b) "recovery would be against equity and good conscience." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 845.301. One who receives an "overpayment is without fault if he or she performed no act of commission or omission that resulted in the overpayment. The fact that the [&#8197;] OPM or another agency may have been at fault in initiating an overpayment will not necessarily relieve the individual from liability." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 845.302. OPM is required to consider certain factors when determining fault:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Whether payment resulted from the individual's incorrect but not necessarily fraudulent statement, which he or she should have known to be incorrect;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Whether payment resulted from the individual's failure to disclose material facts in his or her possession, which he or she should have known to be material; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Whether he or she accepted a payment that he or she <span class="Italic">knew or should have known to be erroneous</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 845.302(a) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if Ms. Warrender "is ineligible for waiver," she may still be "entitled to an adjustment in the recovery schedule if [&#8197;] she shows that it would cause [&#8197;] her financial hardship to make payment at the rate scheduled." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 845.301. "Financial hardship may be deemed to exist in--but not limited to--those situations where the annuitant from whom collection is sought needs substantially all of his/her current income and liquid assets to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 831.1404.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's analysis complied with the legal framework outlined above. The Board first determined that Ms. Warrender was not eligible for a waiver because she knew or should have known of the overpayment, but it then adjusted the repayment schedule due to her financial hardship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we find the Board's decision to be supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with law. The Board explained that Ms. Warrender "knew or should have known the payment she received was erroneous" because she received two letters from OPM expressly stating that she must report the amount of SSA benefits she receives so that the amount could be deducted from her FERS annuity. <span class="Italic">Final Order</span>, 2016 WL 7439441, &#x00B6; 8. That finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that OPM sent Ms. Warrender two letters, dated January 10, 2006 and March 16, 2006, expressly informing her that OPM was "required to deduct all or part of [any] Social Security benefits from the FERS" and that she should thus "hold" or set aside any SSA retroactive payment "so that [she would] have sufficient funds to repay [her] duplicate payment" because she was "legally required to repay this money to OPM." Ms. Warrender does not deny that she received either letter. In fact, she responded to the March 16, 2006 letter, informing OPM that she had filed for a reconsideration of the SSA's initial denial of her benefits application. Thus, the Board properly found that she knew or should have known of the overpayment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Board found that Ms. Warrender knew or should have known that she received an overpayment, it then properly determined that the "set-aside rule" applied to her case. According to the set-aside rule, individuals who know or suspect that they are receiving overpayments must set aside the amount overpaid pending recoupment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Boyd v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 851 F.3d 1309, 1313-14 (Fed. Cir. 2017). When the set-aside rule applies, recovery by OPM of the overpayment is "not against equity and good conscience" and cannot be waived absent "exceptional circumstances," which do not include financial hardship. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1313 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the Board found that Ms. Warrender did not qualify for a waiver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That determination was legally sound and is supported by substantial record evidence. Ms. Warrender challenges the Board's determination based solely on her financial hardship. But, as we noted above, financial hardship cannot qualify an individual for a waiver if the set-aside rule applies--i.e., if she knew or should have known of the overpayment--as is the case here. Thus, the Board properly affirmed OPM's decision denying Ms. Warrender a waiver from recovery of the overpayment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An annuitant was at fault when, despite notice of her obligation to do so, she failed for a year to notify OPM of her remarriage prior to age 60, an event that disqualified her from continued receipt of a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Plewisnksi v. OPM</span>, 44 MSPR 20, 23 (1990). Overpayment was waived in <span class="Italic">Lehardy v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 1, 3-4 (1988), based on confusion concerning military retirement pay status:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Military retired pay includes retirement based upon a variety of factors, including various forms of disability. It is undisputed that the appellant here should have disclosed on his retirement application that he was receiving such pay based upon his disability (heart attack). As noted above, however, the appellant believed that the payments he received on account of his service-connected disability did not constitute military retired pay, and no one questioned his belief until OPM informed him of the overpayment. Further, OPM's subsequent request that he inform it if he began to receive such pay was not dated, and there is no evidence rebutting the appellant's assertion that he did not receive it. In any event, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that he did receive that request, we would not expect the appellant to have notified OPM that he was receiving military retired pay, since he did not believe that his disability-related payments constituted such pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that in other similar cases, employees who were receiving payments for service-connected disabilities were found not to be at fault in representing on civil service retirement applications that they were not receiving military retired pay. In <span class="Italic">Morris v. OPM,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 206, 208-09 (1988), we noted that the agency therein acknowledged that there was "far too much confusion over the difference between" military retired pay based on length of service and that based on disability to find a retirement applicant to be at fault for not recognizing that both constitute military retired pay. Further, in <span class="Italic">Olsen v. OPM,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. 513 (1988), OPM excused similar confusion, and found no fault, on the part of a retirement applicant, where a personnel clerk incorrectly led the applicant to believe that his pay for a disability incurred while serving in the National Guard did not constitute military retired pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weber v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 562, 563-64 (1986), involved an overpayment resulting from service credit for post-1956 military service once the individual became 62 years of age and was entitled to Social Security benefits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has set forth its standards for waiving collection of overpayments of annuities at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1401-1403 (1984). Section 831.1401 provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Recovery of an overpayment from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund may be waived pursuant to section 8346(b), of title 5, United States Code, when the annuitant (a) is without fault and (b) recovery would be against equity and good conscience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since OPM admits that appellant was without fault, the only issue is whether the recovery would be against equity and good conscience. OPM has defined that requirement in Section 831.1403:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Defined. Recovery is against equity and good conscience when--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;It would cause financial hardship to the person from whom it is sought;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;The recipient of the overpayment can show (regardless of his or her financial circumstances) that due to the notice that such payment would be made or because of the incorrect payment either he/she has relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;Recovery could be unconscionable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See also Wheelahan v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 28 MSPR 427 (1985); <span class="Italic">Knowles v. OPM,</span> 24 MSPR 500 (1984). The presiding official determined both that the overpayment was through no fault on appellant's part, and that recovery of the overpayment would be against equity and good conscience as a matter of law because it would result in appellant's not receiving any benefit based upon his military service for the two years in question. This was error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As pointed out by OPM in its petition for review, Congress specifically provided in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(j) that post-1956 military service was to be excluded from length of service in calculating civil service annuities once the individual annuitant became 62 years of age and was entitled, <span class="Italic">or would on proper application be entitled,</span> to social security benefits. This provision clearly contemplates that a person could have his civil service annuity reduced even though he would not receive social security benefits which he could, upon proper application, have received. We cannot conclude that OPM's enforcement of such a provision by reducing appellant's annuity and seeking to recoup prior overpayments, absent some other evidence establishing financial hardship or detrimental reliance, can be against equity and good conscience.</p>
