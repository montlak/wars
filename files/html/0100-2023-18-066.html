<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-67"><span class="space">9.</span> Cumulative Charges; Merger of Charges</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may take a single instance of misconduct and prepare charges containing several specifications, e.g., a day of AWOL may appear charged as AWOL, a failure to follow regulations, and a false statement to a superior. Some agency regulations require that the use of cumulative charges be avoided through the selection of the one category of misconduct that most nearly describes the appellant's conduct. If the agency violates the regulation, the error is not harmful if the principal charge warrants the adverse action imposed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sadowski v. DLA</span>, 40 MSPR 655, 658 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board merges charges if they are based on the same conduct and proof of one charge automatically constitutes proof of the other. <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. DOJ</span>, 98 MSPR 289, 292 &#x00B6; 5 (2005) (merging charges that an employee gave preferential treatment, and violated agency policy, by giving an inmate unrestricted access to a telephone). That is, if charges are based on the same incident and involve essentially the same conduct, they should be brought as one charge. <span id="Page_3208"></span><span class="Italic">Westmoreland v. VA</span>, 83 MSPR 625, 627 &#x00B6; 6 (1999) ("[T]he charges of failure to follow leave-requesting procedures and AWOL must be merged because they did not involve different misconduct or elements of proof, that is, the charge of AWOL was based solely on the appellant's failure to follow leave-requesting procedures.") (overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS,</span> 116 MSPR 453, 458-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-13, 2011 MSPB 62 (2011), and <span class="Italic">Pickett v.

Smithsonian Institution,</span> DC-0752-10-0824-I-1 (NP 1/19/2012) ("Where two charges are based on the same act of misconduct and proof of one charge automatically constitutes proof of the other, the charges should be merged. <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 18 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 626 F. Supp.2d 1140 (D.N.M. 2009). The fact that a charge has been merged into another does not mean that the duplicative charge is not sustained or that the appellant's misconduct somehow becomes less serious by virtue of the merger. <span class="Italic">Harrington v. VA</span>, AT-0752-21-0535-I-1 (NP 2/7/2023) (<span class="Italic">citing Shiflett, supra</span>; "There is also no indication in the record that the deciding official interpreted the appellant's misconduct as exceeding a single set of acts or sought to magnify the penalty based on the fact that the same acts were used to support two charges.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Merger is not appropriate where proof of a single act does not automatically result in proof of multiple charges. <span class="Italic">Id</span>."); <span class="Italic">Delgado v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 685, 688 (1988), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Best v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 124, 128 (1989) (charges of purchasing cocaine and violating the ELRM should have been considered as one charge); <span class="Italic">cf. McCardle v. EEOC</span>, SF-0752-16-0689-I-3 (NP 12/7/2022) ("The merger of charges is appropriate when they are based on the same misconduct and proof of one charge automatically constitutes proof of the other charge. <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. Department of Justice</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 289, &#x00B6; 5 (2005). The appellant's assertion in this regard is unpersuasive. The fact that the agency proved the improper conduct charge did not mean that it automatically proved the misuse of agency email system charge. The crux of the relevant portion of the improper conduct charge involved the disruption to the workplace that the content of the appellant's email (and other statements) caused and did not address the supervisory approval requirement. The root of the misuse of agency email system charge centered on the appellant not having the proper approval from management to send an agency-wide email. Because the allegations are distinct, the administrative judge was correct to assess these charges separately."); <span class="Italic">Christensen v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 681, 687 (1991) (charges of misuse of a government vehicle, involving a deviation from route, and transportation of an unauthorized person in the vehicle, were charges that did not merge; each charge involved different proof, even though they arose from the same transaction); <span class="Italic">Harrison v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bennett v. VA,</span> CH-0752-15-0367-I-1 (NP 3/10/2016), provided syntactical analysis of a compound charge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The charge consists of a compound label, "Disrespectful, intimidating language toward supervisor/Conduct unbecoming a Federal employee," and a lengthy narrative describing the incident leading to the charge. The agency asserts that the charge should have been analyzed as two separate charges because the clauses "Disrespectful, intimidating language toward supervisor," and "Conduct unbecoming a Federal employee," in the label are separated by a slash, a punctuation symbol often used in lieu of the word "or." Citing <span class="Italic">Texeira v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 267 F. App'x 950, 951-52 (Fed. Cir. 2008), and <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Navy</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 309, 318 (1993), the agency argues that a single act of misconduct like the one here may result in multiple charges as long as each separate charge requires the agency to meet different elements of proof.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, when an agency issues two charges based on a single act of misconduct, and one of those charges is "conduct unbecoming," the Board will merge the general charge of "conduct unbecoming" into the more specific charge describing the misconduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 18 (2006) (finding that when two charges are based on the same act of misconduct and proof of one charge automatically constitutes proof of the other, the charges should be merged), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 626 F. Supp.2d 1140 (D.N.M. 2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 490 F. App'x 932 (10th Cir. 2012). The cases upon which the agency relies, <span class="Italic">Texeira</span> and <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, are distinguishable on their facts. <span class="Italic">See Texeira</span>, 267 F. App'x at 951 (holding that the Board properly split a charge of "Unacceptable Conduct: Falsification in Recording Time/Failure to Follow Proper Timekeeping Procedures" into two separate charges because these labels were separate offenses with different elements of proof); <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 311, 318-19 (noting that the appellant was charged with sexual harassment, which is nonconsensual, and with engaging in disgraceful conduct, which was based on consensual sexual conduct). Moreover, based on the format of the proposal notice, we believe that the agency intended to issue a single charge. The notice labels the charge as "Charge 1"; there is no "Charge 2." Instead, there is a single label and narrative. Therefore, the agency's argument that there were two charges is unavailing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a single charge contains multiple clauses, each construed as a separate charge, the clauses or elements of the charge may merge in part if the separate specific misconduct was added by a particular element not already embraced in another element of the charge, e.g., an allegation of unsatisfactory work performance (a general element) may merge into more specific elements (e.g., failure to performance assigned duties in an effective manner). <span class="Italic">Spencer v. USPS</span>, 112 MSPR 132, 134 n.2, 2009 MSPB 155 (2009). Merger of charges is properly denied by the AJ when each charge has independent elements, <span class="Italic">Baldwin v. VA,</span> CH-0752-09-0843-I-1 (NP 11/12/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly found that merger of the charges was not required because proof of the Misuse of Government Time charge does not require the identical elements of proof as the Misuse of Government Property charge. Merely showing that the appellant used the government computer to view sexually explicit materials was enough to prove the Misuse of Government Property charge but was not sufficient to prove the Misuse of Government Time charge. To prove that charge, the agency had to show that the misuse occurred during working hours. Therefore, merger of the two charges was not required. <span class="Italic">See Alvarado v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 18 (2006) (merger is not appropriate where proof of a single act does not automatically result in proof of multiple charges), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 626 F.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will merge charges if they are based on the same conduct and proof of one charge automatically constitutes proof of the other charge. <span class="Italic">Mann v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 1, 7 (1998). However, merger is not appropriate where proof of a single act does not automatically result in proof of multiple charges. <span class="Italic">See Alvarado v.

While merely showing that the appellant intentionally misrepresented a government purchase was enough to prove the misrepresentation charge, such a showing would not be sufficient to prove the other charge. To prove that charge, the agency had to show that the appellant instructed an employee to falsely list an item description on a CBP Form 148. Because proof of the instruction charge does not require the same elements of proof as the misrepresentation charge, the administrative judge correctly found that merger of the two charges was not required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further contends that, if the charges had been merged, the deciding official could have recommended a less severe penalty than removal. The appellant asserts that deciding official Martin Vaughan testified that, if the administrative judge were to sustain only one of the two charges, then the recommended penalty could be something less than removal. Therefore, the appellant contends, the Board should mitigate the removal penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 8 (citing <span class="Italic">LaChance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (where the agency has indicated during proceedings that a lesser penalty would be imposed on fewer charges, the Board must act in conformity with the agency's preference)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find this argument unpersuasive. The fact that a charge has been merged into another does not mean that the duplicative charge is not sustained, or that the appellant's misconduct somehow becomes less serious by virtue of the merger. <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. Department of Justice</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 289, &#x00B6; 12 (2005). As discussed further below, both of the charges that the agency's deciding official sustained were proven and the penalty of removal is reasonable under the circumstances of this case. Thus, even assuming the administrative judge erred by denying the appellant's request to merge the two charges, the error did not prejudice the appellant's rights and provides no basis for reversal of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Panter v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the charges and of the record reveals that, in essence, Reason 2 was merely a continuation of Reason 1--the agency was merely charging the appellant with violating its rules and regulations by using government property for other than official purposes. In this case, the appellant was charged with two separate charges based on only one specification, and the penalty was assessed based on specific discipline for each separate charge. We find, under these circumstances, that Reason 2 should be merged with Reason 1 because it is, in essence, a continuation of Reason 1, and that the appropriate penalty should be assessed for the single merged, sustained charge. <span class="Italic">See Southers v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board summarized its approach toward the merger of charges in <span class="Italic">Mann v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he AJ should not have merged reasons (3) and (4), assuming that she intended to merge them. The Board has "merged" a separate charge such as conduct unbecoming a Federal employee, into a more specific charge, such as falsification or AWOL. Such merger has been held appropriate when the agency "did not accuse the appellant of any specific misconduct under the unacceptable conduct charge in addition to its...allegations" of misconduct underlying the more specific charge. <span class="Italic">See Gunn v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 63 MSPR 513, 516-17 (1994) (merging a charge of unacceptable conduct in violation of the agency's Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELRM) into a charge of falsification of a leave form); <span class="Italic">Wolak v. Department of the Army</span>, 53 MSPR 251, 261 (1992) (the AJ should have merged a conduct unbecoming charge into charges of misuse of government time and property and providing false statements and impeding an investigation). Charges have also been merged when one charge is really a "continuation" of the other. <span class="Italic">See Barcia v. Department of the Army</span>, 47 MSPR 423, 429-30 (1991) (merging a charge of use [of] government property for other than official purposes with a charge of violation of administrative rules and regulations, where the charges were supported by the same specification and the second charge was a continuation of the first charge, i.e., the agency was charging the appellant with violating its rules and regulations by using government property for other than official purposes); <span class="Italic">Best v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 41 MSPR 124, 128 (1989) (the AJ correctly considered as one charge--purchasing cocaine on the agency's premises in violation of Sections 661.53, 661.55, and 666.2 of the ELRM--separate charges of purchasing cocaine and violating those sections of the ELRM where they were based on the same act of misconduct).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has also merged charges when separate charges (that are not general charges such as conduct unbecoming) "are based on the same incident and involve essentially the same misconduct." <span class="Italic">Delgado v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 36 MSPR 685, 688 (1988) (merging separate charges of destruction of government property and unauthorized use of bolt cutters, and merging separate charges of leaving the job without permission and absence without leave, where each pair of charges was based on the same incident and involved essentially the same misconduct); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ruffin v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 499, 502-03 (1987) (merging separate charges of insubordination and being disrespectful by using inflammatory language to a supervisor, where they were "based on identical specifications and evidence"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 852 F.2d 1293 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table). The key reason for merger in these two cases, however, appears to be that when the charges are based on the same act of misconduct, proof of the act of misconduct automatically constitutes proof of both charges. Where proof of a single act of misconduct does not automatically result in proof of multiple charges, the Board has not merged the charges<span class="Italic">. Walker v. Department of the Navy,</span> 59 MSPR 309, 318 (1993) (where the agency brought separate charges of sexual harassment and disgraceful conduct based on the same act of misconduct, and the proven act did not constitute proof of sexual harassment, the Board found that it did constitute disgraceful conduct because a single set of actions can support more than one charge, as long as the charges entail different elements of proof); <span class="Italic">Brim v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 49 MSPR 494, 497-98 (1991) (where the agency brought three separate charges of Conduct unbecoming an employee; violation of the agency's policy on sexual harassment; and unreasonably interfering with employees' work performance and/or creating an intimidating, hostile, and/or offensive work environment, all based on the same proven act of misconduct, the Board found, where the latter two charges were not proven, that the charges "are not interdependent upon each other and each can stand alone as a separate charge").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, although reasons (3) and (4) are based on the same proven act of misconduct, namely, the appellant's personal use of a Federal Express airbill containing the agency's Federal Express account number, merger is not appropriate under <span class="Italic">Gunn</span> or <span class="Italic">Barcia</span> because reason (4) is not a conduct unbecoming-type charge, nor is it a "continuation" of reason (3). Moreover, <span class="Italic">Delgado</span> does not warrant merger of reasons (3) and (4) because proof of the underlying act of misconduct does not, as set forth below, automatically mean that both reason (3) and reason (4) have been proven.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schifano v. VA</span>, 70 MSPR 275, 279-81 (1996), considered merger of charges and distinctions among charges of independent types of misconduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, in a proposal notice, an agency first sets out the charge(s) levied against the employee, or the reason(s) for the action, each followed by one or more specifications or specific instances of behavior underlying that charge. However, there is no requirement that the notice be in any particular form. Thus, the agency here was free to first describe the specifications, and then set forth the applicable charge or charges which it had levied against the appellant, based on those specifications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In resolving the issue of how the charges in the proposal notice are to be construed, we find it instructive to examine the structure and language of the notice. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Diaz v. Department of the Army</span>, 56 MSPR 415, 418 (1993). We find, with respect to the quoted example (which, as noted, is illustrative of the remainder of the proposal notice), that the agency's intentional placement of certain paragraphs in bold reflects its intention that each such paragraph be considered as a separate charge, one of sexual harassment and one of conduct unbecoming a federal employee. This interpretation is supported by an examination of the remainder of the proposal notice. Where the agency has set forth the two charges as described in the sample, the specifications supporting the charges basically fall into two categories, those where the alleged misconduct has sexual overtones, and those where it describes the use of obscenities or other behavior generally considered inappropriate in the workplace. <span class="Italic">Fairley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 63 MSPR 545, 548 (1994). This too suggests that the agency intended to charge the appellant with two distinct types of misconduct, conduct which violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations on sexual harassment and which requires distinct elements of proof, and other misconduct which is dependent, for proof, upon a showing that the factual allegations occurred and that the misconduct was "unbecoming." The manner or form in which the agency described this conduct is not critical. What matters is that the agency charged the appellant with two distinct types of misconduct, neither of which is dependent upon the other. <span class="Italic">See Walker v. Department of the Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 309, 318 (1993); <span class="Italic">Brim v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 49 MSPR 494, 497 (1991). Thus, we affirm the administrative judge's ruling to the extent he found that the charge of sexual harassment and the charge of conduct unbecoming a federal employee are separate charges and do not merge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3210"></span>What remains to be determined is how the alleged regulatory violations cited by the agency should be construed, and whether, as the administrative judge found, they constitute yet another separate charge. On review, we find that they do not, and we vacate that portion of his ruling. In this regard, we find instructive the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Gunn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 63 MSPR 513 (1994). There, the agency charged the appellant with falsification of Postal Form 3971 (leave form) and unacceptable conduct based on the same actions. The Board found that the administrative judge had correctly merged the charge of unacceptable conduct into the falsification charge because the agency did not accuse the appellant of any specific misconduct under the unacceptable conduct charge in addition to its previous allegations that she falsified Postal Form 3971. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 516-17; <span class="Italic">see also Wolak v. Department of the Army</span>, 53 MSPR 251, 260-61 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as to the charge of sexual harassment, the agency has not alleged any events of sexual harassment for which it has not also alleged a violation of 5 CFR 2635.101(b)(13). Therefore, if the agency can prove that the appellant committed sexual harassment, it will have automatically proven that he violated section 2635.101(b)(13), and thus the alleged regulatory violation merges into the charge of sexual harassment. Similarly, as to the charge of conduct unbecoming a federal employee, the agency has not alleged any events constituting a violation of section 2635.101(a) for which it has not also alleged conduct unbecoming a federal employee. Therefore, if the agency proves that the appellant violated one of the 14 general principles contained in section 2635.101(b), it will have automatically proven that he engaged in conduct unbecoming a federal employee, and thus the conduct unbecoming charge merges into the alleged regulatory violation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If charges should merge because they are duplicative, the AJ errs by concluding the duplicated charge cannot to be sustained only because it was duplicative. <span class="Italic">Mann v. DHHS</span>, 78 MSPR 1, 6 (1998). The Board added in <span class="Italic">Mann</span> that "[A]lthough the Board has, as set forth below, held at times that so-called duplicative charges 'merge' into other charges, it has not intended to hold that a merged charge is, by its very merger, not sustained." <span class="Italic">Childs v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 348, 355-56 (1995), noted the agency's failure to merge charges does not invalidate a penalty properly supported by the distinct charge or charges:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not raised by the appellant on petition for review, we note that the charge of conduct unbecoming a Postal Police Officer was not based on any misconduct separate from the other two charges, and did not entail any different element(s) of proof. Therefore, this third charge should have been merged into the other two charges. <span class="Italic">See Wolak v. Department of the Army</span>, 53 MSPR 251, 260-61 (1992); <span class="Italic">cf. Jackson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 52 MSPR 1, 3 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this merger of the third charge does not warrant mitigation of the penalty because, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, in selecting the penalty of removal, the agency deciding official did not separately consider the third charge to enhance the penalty. Rather, he relied on the substance of the first two charges, showing that the appellant intentionally defrauded the agency, to determine that such misconduct irreparably harmed the agency's confidence in his honesty and integrity, which are essential qualities for a Postal Police Officer position....</p>
