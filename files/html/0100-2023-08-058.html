<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-59"><span class="space">a.</span> Time in Nonpermanent Appointment as a Component of Current Continuous Service</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Much law and much confusion in the law developed over whether time employed in nonpermanent (term or temporary) positions is counted toward current continuous service. Recall the distinctions in calculations at 5 USC 7511(a), each dependent on the type of appointment (competitive or excepted service):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;"employee" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;an individual in the competitive service--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;in an Executive agency; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;in the United States Postal Service or Postal Regulatory Commission; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less[.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 7511 employs "current continuous service" in different contexts. The phrase is ambiguous and its interpretation spawned diverse, confusing opinions on Board jurisdiction--decisions sometimes dependent on nuanced distinctions in the nature of appellant's appointments predating the appointed served at the time of the termination. In a somewhat unifying decision, <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/13-3056.Opinion.1-13-2014.1.PDF">741 F.3d 81</a> (Fed. Cir. 2014) (Judge Prost dissenting), an excepted service Justice Department lawyer was discharged after just short of two years of service in her permanent appointment, but with a little more than seven months of service in a nonpermanent DOJ position immediately predating the permanent appointment and with a couple years of additional, related assignments with DOJ while Ms. Mitchell worked as an attorney with a prior employer, the Social Security Administration. Central to resolution of the existence of Board jurisdiction over the appeal was whether the time served by Mitchell with DOJ prior to the onset of her permanent appointment could be characterized as "temporary." Although the initial appointment was nonpermanent, and arguably temporary by a dictionary definition, the court followed the definition of "temporary" in OPM regulations--an appointment limited to a year or less. Since Mitchell's initial DOJ appointment was for 18 months (although she served but seven months of that before being made a permanent employee), the initial appointment was not temporary under the statute implemented by the OPM regulation; the resulting continuous service exceeded two years under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), 741 F.3d at 82-88:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Mitchell began working as a government attorney in 1998, when she became a lawyer for the Social Security Administration. In 2006, the Department of Justice appointed her as a Special Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas--a one-year appointment <span id="Page_59"></span>during which she remained an employee of, and continued to be paid by, the Social Security Administration. The Department twice extended that appointment, and she served for just over two years in the Special Assistant position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective December 21, 2008, the Department hired Ms. Mitchell as an Assistant United States Attorney in the same office. It issued a Standard Form 50-B (Notification of Personnel Action) documenting the appointment. As authority for the appointment, the form invoked 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 542, which authorizes Assistant United States Attorney appointments generally. The form also stated that the appointment was not to exceed 18 months, was "temporary" because of the pending background investigation, and was "subject to" the successful completion of that investigation. The background check concluded in late July 2009. In early August 2009, the Department provided Ms. Mitchell another Standard Form 50-B, again citing 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 542 as legal authority for the personnel action. This time, the "Remarks" section stated that Ms. Mitchell was subject to a two-year trial period beginning August 2, 2009, during which she could be removed without cause or appeal rights. The Department fired Ms. Mitchell effective July 29, 2011, days before the two-year period was to end, without notice or an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Mitchell promptly filed an appeal at the MSPB. In February 2012, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that Ms. Mitchell was not an "employee" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a) and therefore did not have the right to appeal. Ms. Mitchell filed a petition for review to the full Board, which denied her relief. She now appeals to this court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that very nearly two years' worth of Ms. Mitchell's service as an Assistant United States Attorney--from August 2, 2009, to July 29, 2011--was "under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). We must decide whether she held a "temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less" during the pendency of her background check in the months before August 2009. If she did, then those seven-plus months do not count toward the required "2 years of current continuous service," leaving her just a few days shy of the two-year threshold. If she did not, then she worked for more than two years in the same or similar positions and she comes within the statutory definition of an "employee" who may appeal to the Board. Making that "legal determination" <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, <span class="Italic">Roy v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 672 F.3d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2012), we conclude that the second view is the better one.[1]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5 limits the Board's jurisdiction over federal workers' appeals based on both the nature of the personnel action being contested and the employment status of the individual complainant. This case is about the latter. An "employee" has the right to appeal certain adverse actions to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701(a), 7512, 7513(d). Section 7511 defines what "employee" means for such purposes. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7511(a). (That definition modifies, for adverse actions, the general definition of a federal civil-service "employee" set out in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105.) It is undisputed that, for Ms. Mitchell, as a person in the "excepted service" not eligible for a preference, qualification as an "employee" depends on whether, upon her July 2011 firing, she had "completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii); <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 197 F.3d 1144, 1149-50 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (discussing 1990 addition of provision). To calculate the length of Ms. Mitchell's "current continuous service," we must ask whether she was in a "temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less" during her first seven-plus months as an Assistant United States Attorney, starting in December 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our answer starts with the text, where our task is to "give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of [the] statute, avoiding, if it may be, any construction which implies that the legislature was ignorant of the meaning of the language it employed." <span class="Italic">Inhabitants of Montclair Twp. v. Ramsdell</span>, 107 U.S. 147, 152 (1883). That principle counsels against reading "temporary" to have no meaning beyond "limited in time" or "for a limited period." Such a reading would effectively erase the term from the provision: the result would be the same as if the statute referred simply to "other than a[n] appointment limited to 2 years or less." The word "temporary" should be given independent meaning, if possible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Several sources might provide such meaning, but the first and most natural place to look is in regulations of the agency charged with implementing the statute, OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7514. It makes sense for Congress to include the word "temporary" and allow its definition to depend, at least in part, on OPM determinations. In fact, the predominant and longstanding use of the word "temporary" in the context of federal appointments is to refer to appointments of one year or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An OPM excepted-service regulation states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]hen agencies elect to make temporary, intermittent, or seasonal appointments in Schedule A, B, C, or D, those terms have the following meaning: (1) Temporary appointments, unless otherwise specified in a particular Schedule A, B, C, or D exception, are made for a specified period not to exceed 1 year and are subject to the time limits in paragraph (b) of this section. Time-limited appointments made for more than 1 year are not considered to be temporary appointments, and are not subject to these time limits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.104(a). When OPM promulgated the regulation, it made clear that it was newly making uniform a one-year standard for "temporary" appointments that already appeared in OPM regulations. The first sentence of the "Summary" announced that OPM was "revising its regulations governing use of temporary appointments (<span class="Italic">i.e., appointments limited to 1 year or less</span>) to set a uniform service limit for such appointments in both the competitive and the excepted service at 1 year with no more than one 1-year extension (24 months total service)." 59 Fed. Reg. 46,895-01 (Sept. 13, 1994) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see Stern v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 699 F.2d 1312, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 1983) ("It was a <span class="Italic">temporary appointment</span> (<span class="Italic">i.e., one year or less</span>, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.401 (1982))....") (emphasis added). This understanding has persisted. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 63 Fed. Reg. 63,781, 63,783 (Nov. 17, 1998) ("Excepted appointments not-to-exceed 1 year are defined in 5 CFR 213.104(a)(1) as temporary and are subject to the maximum time limits [of] 5 CFR 213.104(b)(1).").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has long distinguished "temporary" appointments from others--given labels like "term" and "time-limited"--made for different but still limited periods. For example, when adding the last sentence of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.104(a), which refers to "[t]ime-limited appointments," the agency explained both that "[t]he existing regulations provide that if the appointments are for 1 year or less, by definition, they are temporary appointments" and, in addition, "that agencies continue to have the ability to make appointments with time limits of more than 1 year [and that t] hese time-limited appointments are not subject to the restrictions for temporary appointments." 62 Fed. Reg. 18,505 (Apr. 16, 1997). These distinctions existed long before the relevant provision of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a) was added to the statute in 1990. In 1968, for instance, OPM regulations provided that "[a]n agency may make a temporary limited appointment only for a definite period of 1 year or less," 33 Fed. Reg. 12,402, 12,423 (Sept. 4, 1968) (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.401), and that "[t]he Commission may authorize an agency to make a term appointment for a period of more than 1 year on request of the agency and after determination...that the employment need is for a limited period of 4 years or less," <span class="Italic">id.</span> (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.301). <span class="Italic">See also Stern</span>, 699 F.2d at 1313 (discussing 1982 regulation); 45 Fed. Reg. 8,541, 8,544 (Feb. 8, 1980) ("time limited" appointments in the Senior Executive Service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If we were to rely entirely on the longstanding regulatory meaning of "temporary," the conclusion would be that Ms. Mitchell never held a "temporary" appointment, because (as is undisputed) her appointment as an Assistant United States Attorney was never limited to a period of one year or less. Even the December 2008 Standard Form 50-B stated that her appointment, subject to a background investigation, was not to exceed 18 months, not one year. But we need not rely entirely on the regulatory treatment, because the conclusion is further supported by two additional considerations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, nothing indicates that the Department of Justice ever contemplated that the job it was giving Ms. Mitchell, even in December 2008, was a short-term job. Rather, it invoked the same legal authority, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 542, for Ms. Mitchell's appointment as an Assistant United States Attorney throughout her tenure in that position, from December 2008 onward. The reason for the time limit in the December 2008 Standard Form 50-B was not any "expectation" that the need for Ms. Mitchell's service in the job would come to an end. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 101-328, at 4 (1989) (focusing on "expectation of continuing employment"). It simply reflected the fact that, operating under its waiver of the "<span class="Italic">pre</span>appointment investigative requirement," the Department had only "a limited period" to complete the background investigation when appointing Ms. Mitchell. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.202(a)(1) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Dep't of Justice, <span class="Italic">Oversight of Background Investigations by the Security and Emergency Planning Staff</span>, Report No. 1-97-06, at App. II (July 1997). Those circumstances are quite different from her appointments as a <span class="Italic">Special</span> Assistant United States Attorney under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 543, one-year appointments that were made to fill short-term needs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, determining that Ms. Mitchell did not hold a "temporary" appointment after December 2008 serves the statute's purpose. The <span id="Page_60"></span>reason for the two-year trial period in &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) is to 'ensure that the agency can fully judge an employee's performance and yet vest these employees with important job protections."' <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span>, 197 F.3d at 1149. Here, the parties stipulated that Ms. Mitchell held the "same or similar" positions from December 2008 through her termination, indicating that nothing meaningful about her job duties changed once the background investigation was completed. There is thus no reason to think that the Department lacked the contemplated amount of time for judging Ms. Mitchell's performance within the two-year period starting on December 21, 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the statute and regulations, and the particulars of Ms. Mitchell's tenure as an Assistant United States Attorney, lead us to conclude that she spent no part of that tenure in a "temporary" appointment as that term is used in &#x00A7; 7511(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's arguments in support of its contrary conclusion are unpersuasive. The Board has relied on certain statements from our precedents. But it has given the statements unduly broad effect by taking them out of context.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In at least two instances, we have said that a complainant fell outside &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) because that person had not spent two continuous years in a "permanent" position. <span class="Italic">See Roy</span>, 672 F.3d at 1382; <span class="Italic">Forest v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 47 F.3d 409, 411-12 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Those decisions, however, cannot be taken to establish that time spent in a "permanent" position is the only time that qualifies under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). There are various types of federal appointments--some without end dates, like permanent, seasonal, or intermittent, and some with end dates, like temporary, term, or time-limited.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g.</span>, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.104(a). The statute excludes only those which are "temporary," which is not the only alternative to "permanent." None of our precedents had occasion to address these distinctions, as none actually involved a dispute about whether the appointment at issue was or was not "temporary," or considered the meaning of "temporary" in &#x00A7; 7511(a) alongside 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.104 and other OPM regulations. <span class="Italic">See Roy</span>, 672 F.3d at 1382; <span class="Italic">Carrow v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 626 F.3d 1348, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <span class="Italic">Forest</span>, 47 F.3d at 411-12. (<span class="Italic">Weidel v. Department of Justice</span>, 230 F.3d 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (table), involved a similar issue, but the decision is non-precedential, and the court recognized that the arguments were not fully developed.) Precedent thus does not establish a conclusion different from the one we reach here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board urges us to discount the significance of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.104 on the ground that OPM did not invoke &#x00A7; 7511(a) in promulgating it. That is not a sufficient reason to eschew reliance on the regulation in interpreting and applying "temporary" in the statute. The alternative interpretation on offer would run afoul of the general rule against nullifying words in the statute, and the regulation embodies an interpretation deeply embedded in federal personnel law and a policy promoting a uniform application of that interpretation. At least where other considerations support the same conclusion, it makes good sense to construe the statute in accordance with this regulation. <span class="Italic">Cf. Pauley v. BethEnergy Mines, Inc</span>., 501 U.S. 680, 706 (1991) (adopting interpretation that harmonizes statute with regulations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board highlights the fact that the December 2008 Standard Form 50-B (SF-50) used the term "temporary" to refer to Ms. Mitchell's appointment "pending adjudication of a full-field background check." But we have held that "the SF-50 is not a legally operative document controlling on its face an employee's status and rights." <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. U.S. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 729 F.2d 772, 776 (Fed. Cir. 1984). And we think that, as between the label "temporary" and the actual stated term of 18 months for the particular job of Assistant United States Attorney, the latter must control. We need not go any further, or offer an affirmative view of the correct label to apply to the pre-August 2009 portion of Ms. Mitchell's tenure as an Assistant United States Attorney. <span class="Italic">Cf. Weidel</span>, 230 F.3d 1380 (expressing "doubt as to the source of authority for [a 'temporary'] appointment" as an Assistant United States Attorney).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board observes that Ms. Mitchell served for only seven-plus months while her background check was pending, suggesting that even if "temporary" appointments are appointments for one year or less, that standard makes no difference here because seven-plus months is still less than a year. But the regulatory and statutory scheme requires that the nature of Ms. Mitchell's appointment be judged at the outset, without regard to service ultimately completed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM regulations, for example, define a temporary appointment based on the time limit imposed when the appointment is "made." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.104(a)(1). This makes good sense. Allowing a federal appointment to change character over time based on time served--if, say, a permanent appointment became seasonal or temporary when an employee lasts only a few months--would conflict with &#x00A7; 7511(a)'s express provision for so-called "tacking" of time in consecutive jobs. Section 7511(a) permits employees to combine time spent in "the same or similar" jobs, if one immediately follows the other, in order to get to the requisite two years of "current continuous service." But under the Board's suggestion, someone who spends twenty years in one permanent position and then ten months in a "similar," permanent position before being terminated, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Mathis v. United States Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 232 (Fed. Cir. 1988), would be a "temporary" employee based on the final ten months of service, and would be stripped of all appeal rights. That cannot be how the statute is supposed to work. <span class="Italic">Cf. Grigsby</span>, 729 F.2d at 775 n.9 (counseling against "reduc[ing] an employee's appointment to a form manipulable at any time by the agency"). The length of time that Ms. Mitchell actually served before the background investigation was completed, therefore, does not alter our analysis of whether she held a "temporary" appointment at the time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In so concluding, we do not depart from "the doctrine of harmless error." That doctrine does not apply to the only question we must answer, namely, the character of the Department's appointment action, which determines whether Ms. Mitchell was an "employee" and hence whether the Board erred in its jurisdictional ruling. There is no doubt that, if Ms. Mitchell was an "employee," the Board's jurisdictional ruling was a harmful error, as it deprived Ms. Mitchell of a hearing on her rights regarding her removal. But on the threshold assessment of the Department's appointment, "harmless error" has no role.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As all of the cases cited by the dissent confirm, the subject of the harmless-error doctrine, and of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2), is "error" in the specific sense of a violation of legal requirements. In that event, the court must inquire, under proper standards, into whether the bottom-line result would have been different had the requirements been met. But there has been no suggestion here, by anyone, that the Department's December 2008 appointment committed any violation of legal requirements. It simply made a choice about the terms of the appointment. Although the Department may now wish that it had made a different choice, our jurisdictional analysis must ask about the character of the appointment actually made--specifically, whether it was a "temporary" appointment. There being no legal violation, there is no basis for us to ask what result would have occurred in the absence of such a violation. "Harmless "error" analysis is thus a mismatch for the issue currently before us. Of course, to the extent that Ms. Mitchell's claim on the merits before the Board concerns an alleged Department failure to follow procedures required when an employee is removed, a harmless error analysis may be appropriate, but that is for the Board to consider on remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that Ms. Mitchell did not hold a "temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less" during her roughly two-and-a-half years as an Assistant United States Attorney. Accordingly, she was an "employee" under &#x00A7; 7511(a) and had the right to contest her removal at the Board. We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Controlling in <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> was the OPM definition of a temporary appointment--a definition that limits a temporary appointment to a year. 5 CFR 213.104 (2022), provides as to excepted service appointments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">213.104 <span class="Italic">Special provisions for temporary, time-limited, intermittent, or seasonal appointments in Schedule A, B, C, or D.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;When OPM specifies that appointments under a particular Schedule A, B, C, or D authority must be temporary, intermittent, or seasonal, or when agencies elect to make temporary, intermittent, or seasonal appointments in Schedule A, B, C, or D, those terms have the following meaning:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Temporary appointments</span>, unless otherwise specified in a particular Schedule A, B, C, or D exception, are made for a specified period not to exceed 1 year and are subject to the time limits in paragraph (b) of this section. Time-limited appointments made for more than 1 year are not considered to be temporary appointments, and are not subject to these time limits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Intermittent positions</span> are positions in which work recurs at sporadic or irregular intervals so that an employee's tour of duty cannot be scheduled in advance of the administrative workweek.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Seasonal positions</span> involve annually recurring periods of employment lasting less than 12 months each year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Temporary appointments, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, are subject to the following limits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Service limits</span>. Agencies may make temporary appointments for a period not to exceed 1 year, unless the applicable Schedule A, B, C, or D authority specifies a shorter period. <span id="Page_61"></span>Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, agencies may extend temporary appointments for no more than 1 additional year (24 months of total service). Appointment to a successor position (i.e., a position that replaces and absorbs the original position) is considered to be an extension of the original appointment. Appointment to a position involving the same basic duties, in the same major subdivision of the agency, and in the same local commuting area is also considered to be an extension of the original appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Restrictions on refilling positions under temporary appointments</span>. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, an agency may not fill any position (or its successor) by a temporary appointment in Schedule A, B, C, or D if that position had previously been filled by temporary appointment(s) in either the competitive or excepted service for an aggregate of 2 years, or 24 months, within the preceding 3-year period. This limitation does not apply to programs established to provide for systematic exchange between a Federal agency and non-Federal organizations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exceptions to the general limits</span>. The service limits and restrictions on refilling positions set out in this section do not apply when:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;Positions involve intermittent or seasonal work, and employment in the same or a successor position under one or more appointing authorities totals less than 6 months (1,040 hours), excluding overtime, in a service year. The service year is the calendar year that begins on the date of the employee's initial appointment in the agency. Should employment in a position filled under this exception total 6 months or more in any service year, the general limits set out in this section will apply to subsequent extension or reappointment unless OPM approves continued exception under this section. An individual may be employed for training for up to 120 days following initial appointment and up to 2 weeks a year thereafter without regard to the service year limitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Positions are filled under an authority established for the purpose of enabling the appointees to continue or enhance their education, or to meet academic or professional qualification requirements. These include the authorities set out in paragraphs (r) and (s) of &#x00A7; 213.3102 and paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of &#x00A7; 213.3402, and authorities granted to individual agencies for use in connection with internship, fellowship, residency, or student programs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;OPM approves extension of specific temporary appointments beyond 2 years (24 months total service) when necessitated by major reorganizations or base closings or other rare and unusual circumstances. Requests based on major reorganization, base closing, restructuring, or other unusual circumstances that apply agencywide must be made by an official at the headquarters level of the Department or agency. Requests involving extension of appointments to a specific position or project based on other unusual circumstances may be submitted by the employing office to the appropriate OPM service center.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Administrative Judge ("AJ") determined that because Forest was terminated from an excepted service position, his appeal rights were governed by the Civil Service Due Process Amendments of 1990 ("Amendments"), Pub. L. No. 101-376, 104 Stat. 461 (1990) (codified in relevant part at 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C)(i), 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) (Supp. V 1993)). In particular, the AJ focused on &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), which provides that an excepted service "employee" who can appeal an adverse action to the board is an individual "who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that, although Forest had completed over two years of government service when he was terminated, the first fifteen and one-half months were under temporary appointments. Thus, the dispositive issue was whether Forest could "tack on" his prior service under temporary excepted service appointments to his service under a permanent excepted service appointment for purposes of meeting the two-year requirement of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). Relying on the statute's plain language, the AJ concluded that tacking is prohibited under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) because the required two years of current continuous service must be served "under other than a temporary appointment." As further support, the AJ noted that when the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") issued its final rules implementing the Amendments, it stated that "the law does not permit 'tacking on' of past service in a temporary appointment to current service in a nontemporary appointment." <span class="Italic">See</span> 58 Fed. Reg. 13,191 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Forest challenges the AJ's determination that tacking periods of service under temporary appointments to service under a permanent position is prohibited by &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). Forest cites an excerpt from the Senate debates in which Senator Pryor stated that "[t]he 2 year waiting period [for] excepted service personnel will ensure that the agency can fully judge an employee's performance and yet vest these employees with important job protections." 136 Cong. Rec. &#x00A7; 11,135 (daily ed. July 30, 1990). According to Forest, because he held a permanent excepted service position at the time of the adverse action, and the agency had an opportunity to evaluate his performance for a two-year period while he served in a same or similar position, he meets the definition of an excepted service "employee" who may appeal an adverse action to the board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. The starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself, which governs absent a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.</span>, 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S. Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L. Ed.2d 766 (1980). By the plain terms of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), the two years of current continuous service must be served "under other than a temporary appointment," i.e., under a permanent appointment. While the purpose of the two-year period may be to allow agencies ample time to evaluate the performance of their excepted service employees, the language of the statute is clear and the legislative history does not suggest that Congress intended that the requisite two years of service may be satisfied under temporary appointments. We therefore hold that tacking periods of prior service under temporary appointments to service under a permanent appointment is prohibited by the plain language of this section. Our interpretation is consistent with OPM's final rules implementing the Amendments. <span class="Italic">See</span> 58 Fed. Reg. 13,191 (1993); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also Antolin v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 895 F.2d 1395, 1397 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("Under the plain language of the statute, even when an individual serves a series of temporary appointments of one year or less, that individual does not become an employee for the purpose of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)."). Thus, because Forest did not complete two years of continuous service under a permanent appointment, he was not an excepted service "employee" pursuant to &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) with a right to appeal to the board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Forest also argues that in enacting the Amendments, Congress manifested an intent to give all permanent government employees a right to appeal to the board, based on their expectation of continuing employment with the government. Forest quotes a passage from a House Report which states that "the key to the distinction between those to whom appeal rights are extended and those to whom such rights are not extended is the expectation of continuing employment with the Federal Government." H.R. Rep. No. 328, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1989), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> <span id="Page_62"></span>1990 USCCAN 695, 698. He neglects to quote the prior sentence, however, which states that "[t]he requirement that an employee serve one continuous year [two years as enacted] before becoming eligible for appeal rights will keep temporary employees from clogging up the Merit Systems Protection Board appeals system." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, viewed in context, the legislative history does not support Forest's contention that Congress intended to give all permanent government employees a right to appeal. Rather, it appears that Congress intended what the language of the statute states, that excepted service employees have a right to appeal only after completing a prescribed period of continuous service under a permanent excepted service position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Forest argues that the board had jurisdiction over his appeal under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i). The AJ did not address this potential basis for jurisdiction in his decision, nor did Forest raise it in his petition for review, which the board denied. However, Forest did raise the issue in his initial appeal to the board and, since it is one of statutory interpretation involving no factfinding, we will consider this argument. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">James v. FERC</span>, 747 F.2d 1581, 1582-83 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (issue raised in initial appeal but not raised in denied petition for review may be considered on appeal to the Federal Circuit), <span class="Italic">reh'g denied</span> 755 F.2d 154, 155 (1985) ("[W]e reaffirm that the petition for review does not limit the issues before this court."); <span class="Italic">Beard v. GSA</span>, 801 F.2d 1318, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (statutory issue not raised before the board may be raised on appeal when the issue does not require the development of a factual record, the application of agency expertise, or the exercise of administrative discretion); <span class="Italic">cf. Synan v. MSPB</span>, 765 F.2d 1099, 1101 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (arguments not made before the board cannot be raised on appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) provides an alternative definition of an excepted service "employee" who is entitled to appeal an adverse action to the board. Under this provision, an individual "who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service" has a right to appeal. 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C)(i). Forest contends that at the time of his termination, he was not serving a probationary or trial period because he had completed one year of service in his last position. He further asserts that because he was <span class="Italic">not</span> serving under an appointment pending conversion to the competitive service, he comes within this definition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again, we must disagree. Section 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) covers only excepted service employees serving "under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service," provided they are not serving a probationary or trial period under such an appointment. <span class="Italic">Accord Pennington v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 57 MSPR 8, 10 n.2 (1993). Forest has provided no evidence of a clearly expressed legislative intent supporting his contrary interpretation. Under Forest's interpretation, all excepted service employees would have a vested right to appeal once they completed a probationary or trial period. Such an interpretation would render subpart (C)(ii) superfluous and thus violate the rule of construction that a statute should not be interpreted in a way that renders one of its parts inoperative. <span class="Italic">See Horner v. MSPB</span>, 815 F.2d 668, 674 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Colautti v. Franklin</span>, 439 U.S. 379, 392, 99 S. Ct. 675, 684, 58 L. Ed.2d 596 (1979)). Thus, since Forest was not serving under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service when he was terminated, we conclude that he was not an excepted service "employee" pursuant to &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) with a right to appeal to the board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Also cited in <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> was the appeal of an attorney serving as an immigration judge, <span class="Italic">Roy v. MSPB</span>, 672 F.3d 1378, 1379-82 (Fed. Cir. 2012), the court determining that the "two years of current continuous service" had to be through what the court characterized as a permanent rather than a temporary appointment of less than two years tacked on to prior service that would aggregate two years. Roy served about eight months of an 18-month temporary appointment, immediately followed by about 17 months in a permanent appointment. Roy was terminated, although in less than two years after the onset of the permanent appointment, with about 25 months in the same position. The outcome in <span class="Italic">Roy</span> differed from <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> because the court did not address the effect of OPM regulations defining temporary appointments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant facts are undisputed. From January 2, 2000, until March 1, 2008, Ms. Roy worked in a permanent position as an attorney in the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS").[1] From March 2, 2008, until November 8, 2008, she served in an excepted temporary appointment as an Immigration Judge in the Department of Justice ("DOJ"). The temporary appointment was for a period not to exceed eighteen months and was meant to allow for the completion of Ms. Roy's background investigation. Upon the completion of the background investigation, on November 9, 2008, Ms. Roy started a permanent excepted appointment as an Immigration Judge in the DOJ. On April 23, 2010, the DOJ terminated Ms. Roy's appointment based on alleged misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Ms. Roy was originally employed with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which later became part of the DHS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Roy appealed the termination of her employment to the Board, invoking 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) as the source of the Board's jurisdiction. The administrative judge determined, however, that Ms. Roy was not an "employee" under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) and could not assert a right to appeal pursuant to it. The administrative judge thus dismissed Ms. Roy's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Ms. Roy petitioned the Board for review of the administrative judge's decision. The Board denied Ms. Roy's petition for review, rendering the administrative judge's initial decision the final decision of the Board. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only question presented on appeal is whether the Board correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain Ms. Roy's appeal. That is a legal determination, which we review <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See Forest v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 47 F.3d 409, 410 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The Board's appellate jurisdiction is defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701. Section 7701 provides,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An <span class="Italic">employee,</span> or applicant for employment, may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a) (emphasis added). The term "employee" is expressly defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511. Thus, our jurisdictional inquiry is limited to whether the Board correctly determined that Ms. Roy is not an "employee" under &#x00A7; 7511. We hold that it did.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7511 defines various classes of employees, but Ms. Roy only contends that she is an employee under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). Subsection (C)(ii) covers an individual in the excepted service who is not preference eligible and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). There is no dispute that at the time of removal, Ms. Roy served in an excepted service and was not preference eligible. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2102 (competitive service); 2103 (excepted service); &#x0026; 2108(3) (preference eligible). The only question is whether Ms. Roy can satisfy the "current continuous service" requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). We hold that she cannot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) unambiguously states that the individual must have "2 years of <span class="Italic">current continuous</span> service in the same or similar positions...<span class="Italic">other than a temporary appointment</span> limited to 2 years or less." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) (emphases added). Two phrases in the text of the statute are important to our analysis: "current continuous" and "other than a temporary appointment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The word "current" indicates that the removal date is the key date for determining whether the continuity requirement is satisfied. The word "continuous" indicates that there cannot be a break in service. Thus, the phrase "current continuous" indicates that in order to determine the continuity requirement, we must look at the individual's employment at the time of removal and determine whether there has been a break in service during the two years that immediately precede the removal date. Moreover, the phrase "other than a temporary appointment" indicates that temporary appointments (limited to two years or less) do not count toward the two-year current continuous service requirement. Because at the time of removal, Ms. Roy had served less than two years in a <span class="Italic">permanent</span> position, she is not an employee as &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) defines that term.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Roy, however, reads the statute differently. She contends that she may satisfy the current continuous service requirement by tacking two periods of service in the same or similar permanent positions even though they are separated by a period of temporary appointment, so long as her employment in general was uninterrupted. We disagree. Although Ms. Roy does not state it expressly, her reading of the statute would divide the two-year current continuous requirement into two components, one that can be satisfied by two years of continuous service in either permanent or temporary positions, and another that can be satisfied by a total of two years of service in the same or similar permanent positions. In other words, Ms. Roy suggests that there is a two-year continuity requirement and a two-year permanent service requirement, but that the two requirements may be satisfied independently. The problem is that the statute uses the term "2 years" only once, followed by the phrase "of current continuous service...other than a temporary appointment." This language leaves no room to doubt that the two-year continuity requirement must be satisfied by service in the same or similar permanent positions. That is, prior intervals of permanent service that are separated from service at the time of removal by a period of temporary service do not count toward the two-year requirement, even if there is no break in service when one considers both temporary and <span class="Italic">permanent</span> positions. Therefore, as we already explained, Ms. Roy cannot meet the two-year current continuous service requirement of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The three cases that Ms. Roy relies on do not advance her argument. In <span class="Italic">Forest v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 47 F.3d at 411, we held that the appellant was not an employee under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) because he had served less than two years in a permanent position. Forest did not address the issue presented here because the appellant in that case had <span id="Page_63"></span>not served two years in the same or similar permanent positions, even in the aggregate. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 410. Nor do we see any basis for Ms. Roy's reliance on <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 197 F.3d 1144, 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The issue in <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span> was whether the right to appeal under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) is an alternative to the right to appeal under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i), or whether an individual who does not meet the requirements of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) is necessarily precluded from appealing under subsection (C)(ii) as well. In holding that the two subsections are mere alternatives, we said nothing about how the requirement of subsection (C)(ii) should be satisfied; indeed, "it [was] undisputed that Ms. Van Wersch me[t] [those] requirements." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span> cannot guide the interpretation of the requirements of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). Finally, Ms. Roy's reliance on <span class="Italic">Carrow v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 564 F.3d 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2009) ("<span class="Italic">Carrow I</span>"), is also unpersuasive. <span class="Italic">Carrow I</span> addressed the involuntary waiver of appellate rights, not whether the requirements of &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) were actually met. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1366-67. Moreover, <span class="Italic">Carrow I</span> remanded the case to the Board for further proceedings, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1367, and in a subsequent appeal we determined that the Board indeed lacked jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Carrow v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 626 F.3d 1348, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2010) ("<span class="Italic">Carrow II</span>"). Therefore, to the extent that <span class="Italic">Carrow I</span> and <span class="Italic">Carrow II</span> have any application here, they do not support Ms. Roy's argument--they undermine it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we hold that in order to be an employee within 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), the individual must have served continuously for at least two years in the same or similar permanent positions. Specifically, we hold that the text of subsection (C)(ii) is clear and requires that the continuity requirement apply to permanent service, not employment in general. Because Ms. Roy had served for less than two years in a permanent position at the time of her removal, she is not an employee within &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). Thus, the Board correctly declined to exercise jurisdiction over Ms. Roy's appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Noted but distinguished as nonprecedential and not controlling in <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> was <span class="Italic">Weidel v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 98-3285), not mentioning <span class="Italic">Forest.</span> Not considering, as did <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, the effect of OPM regulations defining temporary appointments, <span class="Italic">Weidel</span> appeared to bar the accumulation of about six months served in a 14-month "not to exceed" appointment with about 22 months of service during a trial period in the excepted service position of Assistant United States Attorney (the periods of service are taken from the initial decision of the AJ in DA-0752-97-0543-I-1 (Oct. 24, 1997)), and the court's decision added that the Board lacked the authority to determine whether the agency should have used a temporary appointment, instead of a different type of appointment, initially to hire the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent Ms. Weidel argues that it was improper for the Department of Justice to give her a temporary appointment of any kind, that argument is not cognizable by the MSPB in a proceeding to determine its jurisdiction. This court made clear in <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 12 F.3d 1069 (Fed. Cir. 1993), that the Board may not inquire into the propriety of a temporary appointment in order to determine whether it has jurisdiction over the case. That is, the Board may not review the circumstances surrounding a temporary appointment and, if it concludes that the temporary appointment was improper, treat that appointment as permanent for purposes of establishing Board jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, the petitioners were hired as temporary employees, but they contended that after two years they were entitled by law to enjoy protected positions within the competitive service. The <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> petitioners' SF-50 forms stated that the positions they held were temporary, but the petitioners argued that they should be deemed competitive service employees by operation of law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court in <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> distinguished this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. Department of Commerce</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984) [729 F.2d 772], <span class="Italic">supra</span>, on the ground that in <span class="Italic">Grigsby</span> the standard appointment forms contained a clerical error and therefore inaccurately stated the employee's status. In <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, however, the petitioners did not present any evidence that the forms were incorrect; instead, they argued that they should not be regarded as temporary employees, because the government had misled them when it appointed them to their temporary positions. The <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> court held that MSPB jurisdiction could not be "derived from government misconduct in the initial employment decision," and that to permit the MSPB to review the propriety of the appointment process as part of its jurisdictional determination would "improperly broaden the scope of MSPB authority to include equitable review of agency appointment processes." <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, 12 F.3d at 1071.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Weidel's argument is not that the SF-52 and SF-50 forms evidencing her appointment to a temporary position contained ministerial or clerical errors, as in <span class="Italic">Grigsby</span>, but rather that her appointment to a temporary position was legally improper<span class="Italic">. Anderson</span>, however, stands for the proposition that MSPB jurisdiction may not be based upon government misconduct in the initial employment decision<span class="Italic">. See also</span> <span class="Italic">Soehngen v. Department of Justice</span>, 47 MSPR 169, 173 &#x0026; n.4 (1991) (Board does not have jurisdiction over appellant's termination at the expiration of a temporary position on the ground that (1) agency unlawfully extended the appellant's temporary appointment, and (2) his temporary appointment therefore should have been regarded as permanent). Accordingly, for purposes of MSPB jurisdiction, Ms. Weidel must be regarded as having been appointed to a temporary position, which she occupied until her position was converted into a permanent position less than two years before her removal. For that reason, she did not satisfy the definition of an "employee" under section 7511 (a)(1)(C), and her appeal to the MSPB was properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> decision reversed an analysis by the Board that minimized the significance of OPM regulations and maximized the Board's dependence on inferential readings of prior decisions from the court. Under the Board's analysis, <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. DOJ</span>, DA-0752-11-0601-I-1 (NP 12/10/2012) (rev'd, <span class="Italic">Mitchell v.

Cir. 2014) (Judge Prost dissenting), <span class="Italic">supra</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in relying on the Federal Circuit's decisions in <span class="Italic">Forest</span> and <span class="Italic">Roy</span> to conclude that she failed to qualify as an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). Specifically, she contends that the 18-month appointment was not a temporary appointment because, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.104(a)(1), a temporary appointment is one that is limited to 1 year or less. She contends that she therefore held a "term" appointment and that her service should be tacked. The appellant also filed several supplements to her petition for review, among other things, citing two decisions issued by the Federal Circuit after the submission of the appellant's petition for review. None of the material cited by the appellant demonstrates that the Federal Circuit has reversed or otherwise modified its decisions in <span class="Italic">Forest</span> and <span class="Italic">Roy</span>, and the appellant has not shown why those decisions are not controlling precedent in the instant case. Thus, despite the appellant's protestations to the contrary, we are bound by the Federal Circuit decisions, and we find no reason to disturb the initial decision.[4] <span class="Italic">See Hoover v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 545, 552 (1993); <span class="Italic">Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 33, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In her petition for review, the appellant separately argues that the administrative judge misapplied the tacking doctrine and the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">McCrary v. Department of the Army</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 266 (2006), but we find that the administrative judge correctly applied the Federal Circuit's precedent in <span class="Italic">Forest</span> and <span class="Italic">Roy</span>; <span class="Italic">see Roy</span>, 672 F.3d at 1381-82; <span class="Italic">Forest</span>, 47 F.3d at 411. In <span class="Italic">Roy</span>, the court specifically stated that "[b]ecause at the time of removal, Ms. Roy had served less than two years in a permanent position, she is not an employee as &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) defines that term," and that "in order to be an employee within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), the individual must have served continuously for at least two years in the same or similar <span class="Italic">permanent</span> positions." <span class="Italic">Roy</span>, 672 F.3d at 1381-82 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) refers to the completion of 2 years of service under other than a "temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less." Thus, contrary to the appellant's suggestion, the plain language of the statute itself contemplates "temporary" appointments that can last more than 1 year but less than 2 years. Further, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of Transportation</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 554, &#x00B6; 12 (2011), that "term" appointments under 5 C.F.R. part 316 apply exclusively to the competitive service. The appellant's claim, therefore, that her 18-month appointment was a "term" appointment and not a temporary appointment is incorrect because her AUSA position was in the excepted service. Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Weidel v. Department of Justice</span>, 230 F.3d 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table), an unpublished decision, the court held that the 2-year period of continuous service does not include time spent in a temporary appointment, such as a 14-month appointment to an AUSA position pending a background investigation, similar to the appellant's 18-month appointment in this case. The court in <span class="Italic">Weidel</span> rejected the appellant's argument that her appointment was a "provisional" appointment and not a temporary appointment. We find the court's reasoning in Weidel persuasive. <span class="Italic">See Worley v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 8 (2000) (the Board may follow unpublished Federal Circuit decisions that it finds persuasive).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Federal Register notices promulgating 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.104, <span class="Italic">see</span> 59 Fed. Reg. 4601 (Feb. 1, 1994) (proposed regulation); 59 Fed. Reg. 46,895 (Sept. 13, 1994) (final regulation), indicate that the purpose of the regulation was to revise the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) regulations governing the use of temporary appointments to set a uniform service limit for such appointments and thereby ensure that temporary appointments, under which employees receive no benefits, are used to meet truly short-term needs. There is no indication that OPM intended to define the word "temporary" in section 213.104 for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) and Board appeal rights. The authority cited by OPM for section 213.104 is 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3161, 3301, and 3302, which deal more generally with the President's authority to set rules for the civil service, not 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. In fact, OPM's regulations at 5 C.F.R. part 752 <span id="Page_64"></span>define several terms, but not the word "temporary." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The matter of combining past service to form current continuous service to qualify for statutory appeal rights is a relative of the practice of allowing past service in the same agency and same line of work, albeit with a permitted short break in service between appointments, to count toward the completion of required probation and qualify for Board appeal rights. [Refer to <span class="Italic">McCrary v. Dept. of Army</span>, <span class="blue">103 MSPR 266</span>, 2006 MSPB 261 (2006), and in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-071.html#sec1-72">Appointment Pending Conversion to Competitive Service</a>."]</p>
