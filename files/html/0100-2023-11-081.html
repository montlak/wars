<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-82"><span class="space">1.</span> Silence</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Because the burden of proof is on the agency to demonstrate misconduct, an employee's failure to deny a charge is not a substitute for the agency's burden of proof and does not constitute an admission. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gary v. VA</span>, 19 MSPR 247, 250 (1984). Although the appellant's silence will not be, by itself, sufficient to sustain an agency's action, it is proper for an AJ to draw an adverse inference if the appellant does not present contradictory testimony. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boal v. Dept. of Army</span>, 51 MSPR 134, 137 (1991); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">LaChance v. Erickson</span>, 118 S. Ct. 753, 756 (1998) ("It may well be that an agency, in ascertaining the truth or falsity of the charge, would take into consideration the failure of the employee to respond. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baxter v. Palmigiano</span>, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976) (discussing the 'prevailing rule that the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify')"); <span class="Italic">Brewer v. DOD</span>, 249 Fed. Appx. 174, 176 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP) ("When answering an agency's question, an employee may invoke his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. However, an agency may still take into consideration and make an adverse inference from the failure of the employee to respond. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">LaChance v. Erickson,</span> 522 U.S. 262, 267-68 (1998)."). Silence may be added to the sufficiency of the agency case when it follows the agency's establishment of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">Dorrance v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 735 F.2d 516 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Silence as to an ailment may support the inference that an employee was not ill at the time alleged. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Deane v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-965) (citing <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 735 F.2d 537, 541 (Fed. Cir. 1984)). [<span class="Italic">Refer</span> earlier to "<a href="0100-2023-11-014.html#sec4-15">Evidentiary Value of Charge</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An adverse inference may be drawn from the failure to testify at the Board hearing. There is no requirement that an AJ warn an appellant that an adverse inference will be drawn if the appellant does not testify. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 92, 109 (1983). [<span class="Italic">Refer to</span> circumstantial evidence of striking in Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-119.html#sec8-118">Proof of Participation</a>," taken from <span class="Italic">Schapansky v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 735 F.2d 477 (Fed. Cir. 1984).] Although silence is insufficient to support disciplinary action, it is permissible to draw an adverse inference from a party's silence in response to evidence that incriminates him, from his failure to testify and contest evidence presented by the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-785); <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 735 F.2d 497, 502 (Fed. Cir. 1984) ("We believe the Board was correct in drawing an adverse inference from Root's failure to testify and contest the evidence presented by the agency"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Greco v.

<p class="Body-Text">Because the use of an adverse inference is discretionary, there is no requirement that an AJ employ the adverse inference if the appellant failed to deny charges against him. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Christie v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 30 MSPR 447 (1986). <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. DOJ</span>, 30 MSPR 652, 656 (1986), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also contends that the presiding official should have drawn an adverse inference from appellant's failure to testify. However, there is no requirement that the presiding official do so since drawing of an adverse inference is solely within the discretion of the presiding official....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the agency cannot rely on the appellant's failure to testify to support its own case. The agency bears the burden of proving its charges by preponderant evidence, and any adverse inference drawn from appellant's failure to testify is not, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, sufficient to overcome a lack of evidence to support the agency's charges.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Fifth Amendment does not preclude an AJ from drawing adverse inferences when an appellant refuses to respond to the probative evidence against him; however, the burden of proof remains upon the agency to support its action by the requisite degree of evidence. Silence then becomes one factor used to evaluate the weight of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bell v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1504"></span>The Federal Circuit observed of the Fifth Amendment and adverse inferences, <span class="Italic">McGuire v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 1990 NP No. 90-3120):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McGuire argues his constitutional right against self-incrimination was violated because the Administrative Judge drew an adverse inference regarding his credibility based on his assertion of the fifth amendment during a prehearing deposition. The fifth amendment, however, "does not forbid adverse inferences against parties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered against them...." <span class="Italic">Baxter v. Palmigiano</span>, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Baxter</span>, the civil defendant elected to remain silent when faced with incriminating investigatory reports. It is undisputed that McGuire, in this civil proceeding, refused to testify about his drug use during his prehearing deposition, taken after he had <span class="Italic">seen</span> the probative evidence offered against him by the agency.... Prior to the deposition, he knew of the agency's evidence against him, which was detailed in his Notice of Proposed Removal. The Notice described statements by other Secret Service employees regarding their personal observation of illegal drug use by McGuire on at least two occasions. Thus, McGuire faced "incriminating investigatory reports" just as much as Baxter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the hearing McGuire denied knowledge of drug activity. The AJ noted that, "Appellant was ill-advised to invoke the Fifth Amendment on the basis of self-incrimination [at the deposition] when he had already responded to the questions by denying drug use. His total denial of any knowledge of drug activity leaves his testimony suspect." Thus, the AJ based her credibility assessment of McGuire on the discrepancy among: McGuire's denial of drug use and knowledge of drug activities at his initial interview on June 22 and at the hearing (when he had no immunity from criminal prosecution); his denial of drug use on October 24 at his second interview (when he had immunity from prosecution); and his assertion of the fifth amendment privilege at the prehearing deposition (when he did not have immunity). Such an adverse inference was proper under <span class="Italic">Baxter</span>, because McGuire's silence was in the face of "probative evidence" regarding his drug use, the evidence the agency used as a basis to remove him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, this is not a case in which his refusal to waive the fifth amendment privilege led automatically, without more, to the loss of his job because the AJ based her decision to uphold McGuire's removal not only on his credibility but also her assessment of the credibility of agency witnesses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Adams v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 72, 83 (1983), noted of an inference that can be drawn from an appellant's failure to testify:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the presiding official drew an adverse inference from appellants' failure to testify at the hearing. While appellants claim in their petition for review that he improperly drew an adverse inference from their failure to reply completely to the charges, the initial decision clarifies that this was not the presiding official's ruling or intent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Baxter v. Palmigiano,</span> 425 U.S. 308 (1976), the Supreme Court held that while silence, in and of itself, is insufficient to support disciplinary action, it is permissible to draw an adverse inference from a party's silence in the face of evidence that incriminates him. As noted above, the agency in this case provided probative evidence that appellants were participating in a strike and absent without authorization. Thus, the presiding official's decision to draw an adverse inference was not improper. Additionally, the Board has held that an appellant's exercise of his fifth amendment right not to testify does not preclude a presiding official from drawing an adverse inference from that refusal. <span class="Italic">Book v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 6 MSPB 322 (1981), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 675 F.2d 158 (8th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant cases, it is clear that the presiding official found that the agency had presented a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of strike participation, and that appellants' refusal to testify or otherwise offer rebuttal evidence was preceded by the introduction of probative evidence by the agency. Accordingly, the Board does not conclude that the presiding official erred in considering appellants' failure to attempt to rebut the charges. Whether his reasoning is construed as being a finding of an unrebutted <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under <span class="Italic">Schapansky,</span> or drawing of an adverse inference under <span class="Italic">Book</span>, appellants have not shown that the presiding official's conduct constituted reversible error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The inference that may be drawn from a failure to testify at a hearing may extend to the failure to respond to a proposed adverse action, <span class="Italic">Shackelford v. USPS,</span> DC-0752-10-0158-I-1 (NP 9/15/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant challenges the administrative judge's finding that his failure to reply to the notice of proposed removal before the agency made its decision "reflect[ed] poorly on the credibility of his hearing testimony about the incident, and suggest[ed] that he did not believe he had any credible, relevant evidence to offer in his defense." The appellant asserts that he wanted to present his side of the story to the deciding official, but that union officials advised him not to respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the context of an appellant's failure to testify in his defense in an appeal, the Board has noted that an appellant's silence, in and of itself, is insufficient to support disciplinary action, but that it is permissible for an administrative judge to draw an adverse inference from a party's silence in the face of evidence that incriminates him. <span class="Italic">Adams v. Department of Transportation</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 72, 83 (1983) (citing <span class="Italic">Baxter v. Palmigiano</span>, 425 U.S. 308 (1976) and <span class="Italic">Book v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 378 (1981), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 675 F.2d 158 (8th Cir. 1982)). Although the cited cases involve a slightly different context, an appellant's failure to testify in his Board appeal, as opposed to the instant matter in which the appellant failed to respond to the agency's proposal notice, we believe the circumstances are sufficiently analogous to support the administrative judge's conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held in <span class="Italic">Book</span> that an appellant's silence "shall be given no more probative value than the facts of the case warrant." <span class="Italic">Book</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. at 380. In this matter, the administrative judge cited the appellant's failure to respond to the agency's proposal notice as one factor that he considered in making his credibility determinations. The administrative judge found no basis on which to credit the appellant's version of the events in question over the testimony of the agency's witnesses. Moreover, the record provides no reason to find that the administrative judge gave the appellant's failure to respond to the agency's proposal any more probative value than was warranted by the circumstances. Thus, "[T]he initial decision reflects that the administrative judge considered the evidence as a whole, drew appropriate inferences, and made reasoned conclusions on issues of credibility." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Broughton v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 357, 359 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Fifth Amendment does not preclude an adverse inference, silence alone will not support an adverse decision, <span class="Italic">Book v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPR 378, 380-81, 6 MSPB 322 (1981) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Book v. USPS</span>, 675 F.2d 158 (8th Cir. 1982), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the hearing before the presiding official, the agency presented evidence, including signed statements by appellant, tending to show that appellant had committed the acts with which he was charged. Following the agency's presentation of evidence at the hearing, appellant called three witnesses. Appellant, however, declined to testify. The presiding official advised appellant that his failure to testify could affect the credibility of his arguments, but appellant still declined to testify. Appellant now contends that this action of the presiding official violated his civil rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court specifically dealt with an analogous contention in <span class="Italic">Baxter v. Palmigiano,</span> 425 U.S. 308, 96 S. Ct. 1551, 47 L. Ed.2d 810 (1976). In <span class="Italic">Baxter,</span> the Court rejected a fifth amendment challenge to a prison disciplinary proceeding during which a prisoner was informed that he need not testify at the proceeding, but if he chose not to testify, his silence could be considered. The Court held that an adverse inference could be drawn from the inmate's silence at the disciplinary hearing. However, the Court also stressed that the corrections officers were required to prove, by other evidence, that the disciplinary measures were warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that this principle is also applicable to proceedings before this Board. Therefore, we conclude that the fifth amendment does not preclude a presiding official from drawing adverse inferences when an appellant refuses to testify at a hearing in response to probative evidence offered against him or her. We stress, however, that the burden remains upon the agency to prove its charges by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 USC 7701(c)(1)(B). An appellant's silence will not be, in and of itself, sufficient to support an adverse decision. It shall be given no more probative value than the facts of the case warrant. <span class="Italic">See Lefkowitz v. Cunningham,</span> 431 U.S. 801, 809 n.5, 97 S. Ct. 2132, 2137 n.5, 53 L. Ed.2d 1 (1977).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the presiding official properly applied <span class="Italic">Baxter.</span> The presiding official asked if appellant would testify. Appellant declined and the presiding official then notified appellant that he was not under an obligation to testify but that his silence could affect the credibility of his arguments. At all times, the burden remained upon the agency to prove its charge by a preponderance of the evidence under 5 USC 7701(c)(1)(B) and it is clear that the presiding official did not sustain the agency action solely because appellant refused to testify.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Board is aware of the cases holding that the government may not compel an employee, by threat of removal, to waive his fifth amendment privilege and any immunity he might have. E.g. <span class="Italic">Lefkowitz v. Cunningham,</span> 431 U.S. 801, 97 S. Ct. 2132, 53 L. Ed.2d 1 (1977); <span class="Italic">Lefkowitz v. Turley</span>, 414 U.S. 70, 94 S. Ct. 316, 38 LED.2d 274 (1973); <span class="Italic">Gardner v. Broderick,</span> 392 U.S. 273, 88 S.C. 1913, 20 LED.2d 1082 (1968); <span class="Italic">Uniformed Sanitation Men v. Comm'n of Sanitation</span>, 392 U.S. 280, 88 S. Ct. 1917, 20 L. Ed.2d 1089 (1968). Like <span class="Italic">Baxter,</span> the case before the Board is distinguishable from the above-cited cases, because here, "silence in and of itself is insufficient to support an adverse decision..." 425 U.S. at 317-18, 96 S. Ct. at 1557-58. The appellant's silence did not lead automatically to his removal as an admission of guilt. Rather, it was one factor used to evaluate the weight of the evidence. This situation does not amount to compulsion prohibited by the fifth amendment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1505"></span>A circuit court affirmed <span class="Italic">Book's</span> treatment of the evidentiary issue. The court concluded that although silence of an appellant may be considered and produce an adverse inference, the disciplinary action, whatever it may be, may not be based exclusively on the employee's failure to testify. It must be demonstrated by independent evidence that the action is warranted; this is true even if criminal charges are pending at the time of the administrative hearing. <span class="Italic">Book v. USPS</span>, 675 F.2d 158, 160 n.4 (8th Cir. 1982) (sustaining removal). An adverse inference may be drawn as to the silence at an adverse action hearing of appellants who fail to testify and rebut affirmative agency evidence that they sold marijuana to another employee at their work station. But silence alone cannot support the adverse action; the offense must be demonstrated through independent evidence<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Phillips v.
